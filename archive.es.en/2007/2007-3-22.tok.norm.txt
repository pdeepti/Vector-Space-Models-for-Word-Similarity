but it will still benefit airlines and passengers by generating lower airfares and added competition on transatlantic travel routes , according to analysts . since deregulation of the airline industry in the late 1970s , the european union 's member states have maintained a complicated patchwork of bilateral deals with the united states on airline routes and fares . lufthansa , for instance , is the only european airline allowed to fly from germany to the us , preventing other eu carriers from competing on the frankfurt-new york route , while only four airlines are permitted to fly between london 's heathrow and us airports . but that 's likely to change when european transport ministers vote on a groundbreaking transatlantic pact in the course of a two-day meeting that starts thursday . lower fares through increased competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more transatlantic traffic is likely on premium and secondary routes under the new " open skies " agreement , washington will treat all 27 eu nations as one entity , meaning that any eu airline can fly from any point in the bloc to any destination in the united states , while american airlines will be able to fly to the eu location of their choice . " the impact of open skies is that the industry will become more competitive and the cost savings they achieve will be passed on to the consumer , putting a downward pressure on airfares , especially in business and first class , " said dorothy robyn , a washington dc economist who handled aviation policy in the clinton administration . the main beneficiaries of the deal will be european airlines that are currently subject to restricted bilateral deals with washington , such as aer lingus .
the irish airline is only allowed to fly to four us cities under current conditions , but - like all the eu 's airlines - could soon offer flights to many more american destinations . britain opposed to deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after the concorde , ba enjoyed a near monopoly on heathrow-us flights almost all eu members are expected to vote for the open skies pact .
the uk is the one exception .
experts said it 's defending its flagship carrier , british airways -lrb- ba -rrb- . ba is attempting to protect a near monopoly on lucrative flights from heathrow to the united states .
under an antiquated bilateral accord , ba shares the route with only three other airlines : virgin , american and united . since flights between the us and britain account for 40 percent of all transatlantic traffic - with the bulk of passengers traveling through heathrow - other airlines are vying to break up the quartet 's stranglehold on heathrow 's transatlantic landing slots . " the single biggest benefit is the ability of more airlines to fly into -lrb- london 's -rrb- heathrow airport , " robyn said . industry analysts , however , said the chances of britain exercising its veto power are slim . " the uk government is under huge pressure to accept the agreement , as imperfect as it may be , " said stephen furlong , an airline analyst at davy direct .
" it 's ba and virgin against the world . " but on tuesday , virgin , britain 's second largest airline , turned around its opposition to the open skies plans and announced that it was looking into offering direct flights from frankfurt , paris , zurich , milan and amsterdam to new york , something it would not have been able to do under the old bilateral accords . imperfect , but consumers still benefit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business and first class passengers are espeically likely to see fares drop british airways has also advanced the argument that the deal is unfair to the europeans , since eu airlines wo n't have the right to fly within the us domestic market , while american carriers would acquire a blanket right to carry passengers inside of the 27-member bloc . furlong added that even though the pact was lopsided in favor of the us and did not go far enough , lower airfares and a greater choice of destinations were likely to be in store for european consumers . continental airlines , which favors the open skies treaty , said it would apply for blanket authority to serve destinations in all eu countries . " our strategy is to offer direct , point-to-point flights from european destinations into our newark hub that are not served by the others , " said the airline 's european spokesman , nick britton . still , furlong warned airline passengers not to expect too much from the deal , though he said it was a positive step . " there wo n't be a quantum leap in air travel , but we 're looking at incremental growth for sure , " he said .
" we 'll see more competition in the premium markets -lrb- routes such as new york- frankfurt or los angeles-london -rrb- , which will drive down fares , but also more direct , non-stop flights for secondary markets where demand is strong .

germany 's federal states agreed thursday to ban smoking in restaurants and pubs , but allowed exceptions for small bars and premises with extra smoking rooms . schools , old people 's homes and public buildings are also covered by the proposed ban , which needs the approval of each of the 16 state parliaments before it can come into force . the agreement comes a month after chancellor angela merkel 's government approved a smoking ban in trains , taxis and all other public transport . the no-smoking issue has divided europe 's most populous nation .
an attempt by the government late in november to impose a federal ban collapsed on constitutional grounds . under germany 's federal system the 16 states and not the berlin government have power over facilities such as hospitals and schools as well as restaurants and bars . smoking to continue in closed rooms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers can still light up in bars with special rooms under thursday 's agreement , restaurants and large bars or pubs can permit smokers to use designated smoking rooms provided they are closed off by doors from the rest of the public space . the restrictions fall far short of those in england , italy , ireland and other european nations which have already implemented smoking bans in all restaurants and bars . germany is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 16.7 million smokers , or 27 per cent of the adult population , according to official statistics . each year there are about 110,000 smoking-related deaths , mainly caused by lung cancer , circulatory ailments and stomach ulcers , says a government report on addiction . bans in discos and nightclubs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking in discos and clubs will be banned from september the states ' health ministers agreed last month that a complete smoking ban would apply in discotheques and night clubs popular with young people . fines for smoking could range from 5 to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 7 to 1,300 -rrb- once the federal government bans smoking in transport and federal facilities . if the upper and lower houses of the german parliament adopt the government-proposed law , it would take effect on september 1 . most airlines which land in germany already ban smoking .
the german railways restrict smoking to special smoking cars , as the future law will require and smoking is already banned in most municipal buses . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite planned ban , german mps fight for right to light up the german government last month agreed to ban smoking in public transport and federal buildings .
but its own backyard seems to be an exception with some parliamentarians reluctant to stub out .
-lrb- 10.03.2007 -rrb- german cabinet approves smoking ban smokers in germany will be limited in exercising their addiction beginning in september .

germany 's federal states agreed thursday to ban smoking in restaurants and pubs , but allowed exceptions for small bars and premises with extra smoking rooms . schools , old people 's homes and public buildings are also covered by the proposed ban , which needs the approval of each of the 16 state parliaments before it can come into force . the agreement comes a month after chancellor angela merkel 's government approved a smoking ban in trains , taxis and all other public transport . the no-smoking issue has divided europe 's most populous nation .
an attempt by the government late in november to impose a federal ban collapsed on constitutional grounds . under germany 's federal system the 16 states and not the berlin government have power over facilities such as hospitals and schools as well as restaurants and bars . smoking to continue in closed rooms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers can still light up in bars with special rooms under thursday 's agreement , restaurants and large bars or pubs can permit smokers to use designated smoking rooms provided they are closed off by doors from the rest of the public space . the restrictions fall far short of those in england , italy , ireland and other european nations which have already implemented smoking bans in all restaurants and bars . germany is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 16.7 million smokers , or 27 per cent of the adult population , according to official statistics . each year there are about 110,000 smoking-related deaths , mainly caused by lung cancer , circulatory ailments and stomach ulcers , says a government report on addiction . bans in discos and nightclubs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking in discos and clubs will be banned from september the states ' health ministers agreed last month that a complete smoking ban would apply in discotheques and night clubs popular with young people . fines for smoking could range from 5 to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 7 to 1,300 -rrb- once the federal government bans smoking in transport and federal facilities . if the upper and lower houses of the german parliament adopt the government-proposed law , it would take effect on september 1 . most airlines which land in germany already ban smoking .

" the three caricatures were published in charles hebdo on february 8 , 2006 , in a special edition devoted to caricatures of the islamic religion .

" to have such an increase it means that there will probably be far cheaper , more attractive fares being offered to europeans and americans , " he told journalists . good for consumers the european commission , which negotiated the deal on the eu 's behalf , says consumers will see up to 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- in benefits , as increased competition brings down ticket prices and creates 80,000 new jobs in the aviation sector in the eu and united states combined . it is set to be signed in washington on april 30 but will now only come into effect next march , instead of october this year , as originally planned , to take into account british objections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal was thrashed out at a meeting in brussels on thursday britain had reservations about the deal because it would lift restrictions on the number of airlines which can operate profitable transatlantic flights from heathrow airport outside london . currently , only british airways , virgin atlantic of britain and us carriers united airlines and american airlines are allowed to fly from heathrow to the united states . second round barrot said the fact that all member states had backed the agreement would strengthen the eu 's hand for a second round of negotiations with the united states , that are supposed to remove remaining barriers . " this confidence and unity means that the european side enters the next phase of negotiations with the united states in a strong position , " barrot said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european and us carriers will be able to fly to more destinations under the deal the deal stipulates that any eu carrier would be able to fly from anywhere in the eu to any point in the united states and vice versa . it is expected to dramatically increase competition because eu carriers are currently allowed to fly to the united states only from their home country . however , while us carriers would be able to fly intra-eu routes , their european rivals would not be able to fly between two cities within the united states . the agreement would also lift restrictions on eu carriers buying big stakes in us airlines , although their voting rights in a us carrier would remain capped at 25 percent . the ministers also agreed to a clause that could see some of the benefits of the deal suspended if there were no progress on further liberalisation after the first two and a half years . an open-skies deal is supposed to replace the patchwork of existing bilateral air transport agreements between eu members and the united states , eight of which the european court of justice has ruled are illegal . the european commission has not enforced the court decision because it has a mandate to negotiate an eu-us deal . dw staff -lrb- ml -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-us open skies deal to benefit passengers the eu-us open skies treaty may not go far enough .
but it will still benefit airlines and passengers by generating lower airfares and added competition on transatlantic travel routes , according to analysts .
-lrb- 22.03.2007 -rrb- eu and us reopen negotiations on deregulating air traffic the united states and european union tuesday revived talks on an " open skies " deal to deregulate transatlantic air traffic , two months after washington threw a large spanner in the works .

but it will still benefit airlines and passengers by generating lower airfares and added competition on transatlantic travel routes , according to analysts . since deregulation of the airline industry in the late 1970s , the european union 's member states have maintained a complicated patchwork of bilateral deals with the united states on airline routes and fares . lufthansa , for instance , is the only european airline allowed to fly from germany to the us , preventing other eu carriers from competing on the frankfurt-new york route , while only four airlines are permitted to fly between london 's heathrow and us airports . but that 's likely to change when european transport ministers vote on a groundbreaking transatlantic pact in the course of a two-day meeting that starts thursday . lower fares through increased competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more transatlantic traffic is likely on premium and secondary routes under the new " open skies " agreement , washington will treat all 27 eu nations as one entity , meaning that any eu airline can fly from any point in the bloc to any destination in the united states , while american airlines will be able to fly to the eu location of their choice . " the impact of open skies is that the industry will become more competitive and the cost savings they achieve will be passed on to the consumer , putting a downward pressure on airfares , especially in business and first class , " said dorothy robyn , a washington dc economist who handled aviation policy in the clinton administration . the main beneficiaries of the deal will be european airlines that are currently subject to restricted bilateral deals with washington , such as aer lingus .
the irish airline is only allowed to fly to four us cities under current conditions , but - like all the eu 's airlines - could soon offer flights to many more american destinations . britain opposed to deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after the concorde , ba enjoyed a near monopoly on heathrow-us flights almost all eu members are expected to vote for the open skies pact .
the uk is the one exception .
experts said it 's defending its flagship carrier , british airways -lrb- ba -rrb- . ba is attempting to protect a near monopoly on lucrative flights from heathrow to the united states .
under an antiquated bilateral accord , ba shares the route with only three other airlines : virgin , american and united . since flights between the us and britain account for 40 percent of all transatlantic traffic - with the bulk of passengers traveling through heathrow - other airlines are vying to break up the quartet 's stranglehold on heathrow 's transatlantic landing slots . " the single biggest benefit is the ability of more airlines to fly into -lrb- london 's -rrb- heathrow airport , " robyn said . industry analysts , however , said the chances of britain exercising its veto power are slim . " the uk government is under huge pressure to accept the agreement , as imperfect as it may be , " said stephen furlong , an airline analyst at davy direct .
" it 's ba and virgin against the world . " but on tuesday , virgin , britain 's second largest airline , turned around its opposition to the open skies plans and announced that it was looking into offering direct flights from frankfurt , paris , zurich , milan and amsterdam to new york , something it would not have been able to do under the old bilateral accords . imperfect , but consumers still benefit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business and first class passengers are espeically likely to see fares drop british airways has also advanced the argument that the deal is unfair to the europeans , since eu airlines wo n't have the right to fly within the us domestic market , while american carriers would acquire a blanket right to carry passengers inside of the 27-member bloc . furlong added that even though the pact was lopsided in favor of the us and did not go far enough , lower airfares and a greater choice of destinations were likely to be in store for european consumers . continental airlines , which favors the open skies treaty , said it would apply for blanket authority to serve destinations in all eu countries . " our strategy is to offer direct , point-to-point flights from european destinations into our newark hub that are not served by the others , " said the airline 's european spokesman , nick britton . still , furlong warned airline passengers not to expect too much from the deal , though he said it was a positive step . " there wo n't be a quantum leap in air travel , but we 're looking at incremental growth for sure , " he said .
" we 'll see more competition in the premium markets -lrb- routes such as new york- frankfurt or los angeles-london -rrb- , which will drive down fares , but also more direct , non-stop flights for secondary markets where demand is strong .

but it will still benefit airlines and passengers by generating lower airfares and added competition on transatlantic travel routes , according to analysts . since deregulation of the airline industry in the late 1970s , the european union 's member states have maintained a complicated patchwork of bilateral deals with the united states on airline routes and fares . lufthansa , for instance , is the only european airline allowed to fly from germany to the us , preventing other eu carriers from competing on the frankfurt-new york route , while only four airlines are permitted to fly between london 's heathrow and us airports . but that 's likely to change when european transport ministers vote on a groundbreaking transatlantic pact in the course of a two-day meeting that starts thursday . lower fares through increased competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more transatlantic traffic is likely on premium and secondary routes under the new " open skies " agreement , washington will treat all 27 eu nations as one entity , meaning that any eu airline can fly from any point in the bloc to any destination in the united states , while american airlines will be able to fly to the eu location of their choice . " the impact of open skies is that the industry will become more competitive and the cost savings they achieve will be passed on to the consumer , putting a downward pressure on airfares , especially in business and first class , " said dorothy robyn , a washington dc economist who handled aviation policy in the clinton administration . the main beneficiaries of the deal will be european airlines that are currently subject to restricted bilateral deals with washington , such as aer lingus .
the irish airline is only allowed to fly to four us cities under current conditions , but - like all the eu 's airlines - could soon offer flights to many more american destinations . britain opposed to deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after the concorde , ba enjoyed a near monopoly on heathrow-us flights almost all eu members are expected to vote for the open skies pact .
the uk is the one exception .
experts said it 's defending its flagship carrier , british airways -lrb- ba -rrb- . ba is attempting to protect a near monopoly on lucrative flights from heathrow to the united states .
under an antiquated bilateral accord , ba shares the route with only three other airlines : virgin , american and united . since flights between the us and britain account for 40 percent of all transatlantic traffic - with the bulk of passengers traveling through heathrow - other airlines are vying to break up the quartet 's stranglehold on heathrow 's transatlantic landing slots . " the single biggest benefit is the ability of more airlines to fly into -lrb- london 's -rrb- heathrow airport , " robyn said . industry analysts , however , said the chances of britain exercising its veto power are slim . " the uk government is under huge pressure to accept the agreement , as imperfect as it may be , " said stephen furlong , an airline analyst at davy direct .
" it 's ba and virgin against the world . " but on tuesday , virgin , britain 's second largest airline , turned around its opposition to the open skies plans and announced that it was looking into offering direct flights from frankfurt , paris , zurich , milan and amsterdam to new york , something it would not have been able to do under the old bilateral accords . imperfect , but consumers still benefit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business and first class passengers are espeically likely to see fares drop british airways has also advanced the argument that the deal is unfair to the europeans , since eu airlines wo n't have the right to fly within the us domestic market , while american carriers would acquire a blanket right to carry passengers inside of the 27-member bloc . furlong added that even though the pact was lopsided in favor of the us and did not go far enough , lower airfares and a greater choice of destinations were likely to be in store for european consumers . continental airlines , which favors the open skies treaty , said it would apply for blanket authority to serve destinations in all eu countries . " our strategy is to offer direct , point-to-point flights from european destinations into our newark hub that are not served by the others , " said the airline 's european spokesman , nick britton . still , furlong warned airline passengers not to expect too much from the deal , though he said it was a positive step . " there wo n't be a quantum leap in air travel , but we 're looking at incremental growth for sure , " he said .

he also loves to initiate projects : like collecting money to help the muslim community in cologne build a mosque . whether it 's getting people at his parish to offer tables and chairs which they then donate to the muslim community for a project room in their mosque or applying for european union funds for language courses for girls , pastor franz meurer is a man of action . his church , st. theodor , is located in the höhenberg-vingst areas of cologne - two bordering , lower-income districts with high immigrant and muslim populations . meurer 's interaction with muslims has been a driving force behind his projects .
after speaking with church authorities and the church council , he began collecting money to give to the turkish islamic union of the institute for religion -lrb- ditib -rrb- to help them build their new mosque in the city most famous for its catholic cathedral . last week , meurer raised 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,660 -rrb- in a collection during services in his parish . " several years ago , when our new catholic church was inaugurated , we received a present from a neighboring protestant church , " said meurer .
" we thought the idea was so nice , we wanted to do something similar ourselves . " returning the favor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 3 million muslims live in germany that 's when the idea to donate something to the muslim community was born . " it 's a good idea to support those who think sensibly and want to live together in peace , " meurer said .
" i think it would be a dangerous thing if everyone just lived in their own worlds , separated from one another . " bekir alboga , ditib 's appointee for inter-faith dialogue , said she thinks meurer 's willingness to pass the plate for understanding across religions . " i think it 's great that he 's brave enough to show his true colors , " alboga said .
" it 's a wonderful thing when a catholic priest dares to do what he 's doing , even though right-wing extremism and xenophobia , and even islamophobia , are on the rise . but not everyone in meurer 's parish agreed with collecting money for the new mosque . " i do n't like the idea , " one parishioner said .
" people from all religions should be tolerant , and i do n't see muslims being that way . " another man said that since donations helped to get st. theodor built five years ago , he felt it was a good idea to help people of other faiths build their own places of worship . " everyone has the right to live their faith , " another woman said .
" we pray to our god and the muslims to theirs .
if we can build a church , then they should be able to build a mosque if they want . " controversial mosque bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 1,000 mosques in germany opened their doors for visitors last fall the cologne central mosque is to be built in the district of ehrenfeld - at the site of the current , smaller ditib mosque - and will be one of germany 's largest .
it is designed to hold more than 3,000 worshippers , and building is set to begin in the fall . however , construction of the mosque has been controversial .
the right-wing extremist " pro köln " group - a political party that also sits on the cologne city council - has been one of the biggest opponents of the mosque . it 's the opposition to a new mosque that alboga said makes meurer 's decision to back its construction a strong statement of support . " i think meurer 's gesture is worth a lot more than the money the community wants to give us , " she added . monika griebeler -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ex-muslims get threats after forming society in germany a group of former muslims in germany who formed a non-religious society have been sent threatening letters , pronouncing them " fit for death .

now , german chancellor angela merkel has said she hopes to present a road map for its revival in time for elections to the eu parliament in 2009 . the german government has prepared a so-called berlin declaration , which has been sent to the other 26 eu member states for approval and hopes to have signed at a giant birthday party for the bloc in the german capital sunday . the weekend celebrations will mark the 50th anniversary of the signing of the treaty of rome , which established the european economic community , the forerunner of the eu . support expected government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said wednesday that berlin was confident the draft berlin declaration would win the support of the entire union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steimeier calls for ' renewed foundations ' for europe german newspaper handelsblatt said it had obtained a copy of the text , in which germany states the goal of ending the constitutional crisis in two years ' time .
but the draft does not mention the word " constitution , " so as to not provoke supporters of a more watered-down treaty . the handelsblatt report noted that several states objected to including the date 2009 , deeming it too early . the newspaper added that the inclusion in the declaration of a " european social model " that can only be preserved by a united bloc was also a source of controversy . steinmeier : ' the eu needs a new foundation ' britain in particular has raised objections to the inclusion of such a phrase in a european constitution . voters in france and the netherlands rejected a draft constitution in referendums in 2005 , sending the project into a tailspin and plunging the union into a serious crisis . according to a report by reuters news service , a section of the two or three page berlin declaration reads : " fifty years after the signing of the treaties of rome , we are united in the common goal of renewing , in time for the 2009 european parliamentary elections , the common foundation on which the european union is built . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will need to convince some eu members to sign the document describing the significance of this passage , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reuters : " the union needs renewed foundations , and that needs to come in the form of the substance of a constitution . " skeptical czechs ? the full text of the declaration will be issued on sunday , where it is to be signed by german chancellor angela merkel , european commission chief jose manuel barroso and the head of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering . the mention of 2009 is not expected to please the czechs , who are one of the countries that want merkel to scrap her plans to try again with the constitution . the czech negotiator for the declaration , member of european parliament jan zahradil , said prague would not treat this language as a commitment to any kind of new charter or treaty . a few tough sells " we wo n't wreck the whole thing , but we will interpret it as we see fit , therefore not as a commitment to a new treaty or a version of it by 2009 , " zahradil told reuters . the czechs , poles , british , dutch and french are expected to be the most difficult countries for merkel to convince as she presses ahead with plans to lay out a specific " road map " for the eu charter , which aims to make the bloc 's institutions more efficient and streamline decision-making . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland agrees to eu declaration and to talks on constitution polish president kaczynski told german chancellor merkel on saturday his country would not block efforts to revive the european union 's constitution and would sign an eu declaration marking the bloc 's 50th birthday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.03.2007 report : merkel to aim for eu constitution in 2009 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is hoping for a way out of the constitutional dead end germany has included the goal of having a constitution for the european union by 2009 in a draft declaration to mark the 50th anniversary of the bloc . the eu constitution has been in limbo since its rejection by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
now , german chancellor angela merkel has said she hopes to present a road map for its revival in time for elections to the eu parliament in 2009 . the german government has prepared a so-called berlin declaration , which has been sent to the other 26 eu member states for approval and hopes to have signed at a giant birthday party for the bloc in the german capital sunday . the weekend celebrations will mark the 50th anniversary of the signing of the treaty of rome , which established the european economic community , the forerunner of the eu . support expected government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said wednesday that berlin was confident the draft berlin declaration would win the support of the entire union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steimeier calls for ' renewed foundations ' for europe german newspaper handelsblatt said it had obtained a copy of the text , in which germany states the goal of ending the constitutional crisis in two years ' time .

it 's another sign of a renaissance of the jewish community . the new museum , to be opened to the public on friday , is part of a new complex on munich 's central jakobsplatz , which also houses a new synagogue and community center .
its permanent collection will focus on different aspects of jewish life , spotlighting religious rites and festivals of the jewish year . objects include manuscripts from the renaissance , a jewish wedding ring from 1500 , and a 550-year-old prayer book for the jewish sukkoth holiday , or feast of tabernacles . bildunterschrift : the building , a cube-shaped structure designed by saarbrücken architects wandel hoefer lorck , is only the second in germany after berlin especially built to house a jewish museum .
there are some 900 square meters -lrb- 9,687 square feet -rrb- of exhibition space . " the building should appeal to jews and non-jews alike and be avenue for open discussion about jewish history , art and culture , " christian ude , munich 's mayor , said in a statement . the museum is located just blocks away from where nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels ordered the destruction of munich 's main synagogue on the night of broken glass , or kristallnacht , in november 1938 . three floors of judaica the building , whose 13.5-million-euro -lrb- $ 18 million -rrb- construction cost was paid by the city , has three floors .
the permanent exhibition on the lowest floor focuses on jewish life in munich and includes models of the city 's five previous synagogues .
the other two floors have space for temporary exhibitions .
at the beginning of 2008 , works by contemporary jewish artists will be shown . bildunterschrift : a woman looks at information panels at the new jewish museum in munich one collection of judaica to be shown is that of alfred pringsheim , a mathematician and father-in-law of the author thomas mann .
it includes renaissance-era ceramics and silver items which are on view together for the first time in munich in more than 70 years .
pringsheim had fled to switzerland during the nazi era , where he died in 1941 . according to the president of germany 's central council of jews , charlotte knoblauch , rthe museum completes munich 's new jewish center . " with it , visitors will have the opportunity to experience a living and diverse judaism in the rooms of our own community and learn about the long history of munich 's jews , " she said . while germany 's jewish community in 1933 numbered 565,000 , by 1950 , there were just 37,000 .
but since german reunification , thousands of jews have moved to germany , mostly from the soviet union , thanks to government policies encouraging immigration .

" to have such an increase it means that there will probably be far cheaper , more attractive fares being offered to europeans and americans , " he told journalists . good for consumers the european commission , which negotiated the deal on the eu 's behalf , says consumers will see up to 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- in benefits , as increased competition brings down ticket prices and creates 80,000 new jobs in the aviation sector in the eu and united states combined . it is set to be signed in washington on april 30 but will now only come into effect next march , instead of october this year , as originally planned , to take into account british objections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal was thrashed out at a meeting in brussels on thursday britain had reservations about the deal because it would lift restrictions on the number of airlines which can operate profitable transatlantic flights from heathrow airport outside london . currently , only british airways , virgin atlantic of britain and us carriers united airlines and american airlines are allowed to fly from heathrow to the united states . second round barrot said the fact that all member states had backed the agreement would strengthen the eu 's hand for a second round of negotiations with the united states , that are supposed to remove remaining barriers . " this confidence and unity means that the european side enters the next phase of negotiations with the united states in a strong position , " barrot said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european and us carriers will be able to fly to more destinations under the deal the deal stipulates that any eu carrier would be able to fly from anywhere in the eu to any point in the united states and vice versa . it is expected to dramatically increase competition because eu carriers are currently allowed to fly to the united states only from their home country . however , while us carriers would be able to fly intra-eu routes , their european rivals would not be able to fly between two cities within the united states . the agreement would also lift restrictions on eu carriers buying big stakes in us airlines , although their voting rights in a us carrier would remain capped at 25 percent . the ministers also agreed to a clause that could see some of the benefits of the deal suspended if there were no progress on further liberalisation after the first two and a half years . an open-skies deal is supposed to replace the patchwork of existing bilateral air transport agreements between eu members and the united states , eight of which the european court of justice has ruled are illegal . the european commission has not enforced the court decision because it has a mandate to negotiate an eu-us deal . dw staff -lrb- ml -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-us open skies deal to benefit passengers the eu-us open skies treaty may not go far enough .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 22.03.2007 eu-us open skies deal to benefit passengers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more competition could mean greater choice in destinations for passengers the eu-us open skies treaty may not go far enough .
but it will still benefit airlines and passengers by generating lower airfares and added competition on transatlantic travel routes , according to analysts . since deregulation of the airline industry in the late 1970s , the european union 's member states have maintained a complicated patchwork of bilateral deals with the united states on airline routes and fares . lufthansa , for instance , is the only european airline allowed to fly from germany to the us , preventing other eu carriers from competing on the frankfurt-new york route , while only four airlines are permitted to fly between london 's heathrow and us airports . but that 's likely to change when european transport ministers vote on a groundbreaking transatlantic pact in the course of a two-day meeting that starts thursday . lower fares through increased competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more transatlantic traffic is likely on premium and secondary routes under the new " open skies " agreement , washington will treat all 27 eu nations as one entity , meaning that any eu airline can fly from any point in the bloc to any destination in the united states , while american airlines will be able to fly to the eu location of their choice . " the impact of open skies is that the industry will become more competitive and the cost savings they achieve will be passed on to the consumer , putting a downward pressure on airfares , especially in business and first class , " said dorothy robyn , a washington dc economist who handled aviation policy in the clinton administration . the main beneficiaries of the deal will be european airlines that are currently subject to restricted bilateral deals with washington , such as aer lingus .
the irish airline is only allowed to fly to four us cities under current conditions , but - like all the eu 's airlines - could soon offer flights to many more american destinations . britain opposed to deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after the concorde , ba enjoyed a near monopoly on heathrow-us flights almost all eu members are expected to vote for the open skies pact .
the uk is the one exception .
experts said it 's defending its flagship carrier , british airways -lrb- ba -rrb- . ba is attempting to protect a near monopoly on lucrative flights from heathrow to the united states .
under an antiquated bilateral accord , ba shares the route with only three other airlines : virgin , american and united . since flights between the us and britain account for 40 percent of all transatlantic traffic - with the bulk of passengers traveling through heathrow - other airlines are vying to break up the quartet 's stranglehold on heathrow 's transatlantic landing slots . " the single biggest benefit is the ability of more airlines to fly into -lrb- london 's -rrb- heathrow airport , " robyn said . industry analysts , however , said the chances of britain exercising its veto power are slim . " the uk government is under huge pressure to accept the agreement , as imperfect as it may be , " said stephen furlong , an airline analyst at davy direct .
" it 's ba and virgin against the world . " but on tuesday , virgin , britain 's second largest airline , turned around its opposition to the open skies plans and announced that it was looking into offering direct flights from frankfurt , paris , zurich , milan and amsterdam to new york , something it would not have been able to do under the old bilateral accords . imperfect , but consumers still benefit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business and first class passengers are espeically likely to see fares drop british airways has also advanced the argument that the deal is unfair to the europeans , since eu airlines wo n't have the right to fly within the us domestic market , while american carriers would acquire a blanket right to carry passengers inside of the 27-member bloc . furlong added that even though the pact was lopsided in favor of the us and did not go far enough , lower airfares and a greater choice of destinations were likely to be in store for european consumers . continental airlines , which favors the open skies treaty , said it would apply for blanket authority to serve destinations in all eu countries . " our strategy is to offer direct , point-to-point flights from european destinations into our newark hub that are not served by the others , " said the airline 's european spokesman , nick britton . still , furlong warned airline passengers not to expect too much from the deal , though he said it was a positive step . " there wo n't be a quantum leap in air travel , but we 're looking at incremental growth for sure , " he said .
" we 'll see more competition in the premium markets -lrb- routes such as new york- frankfurt or los angeles-london -rrb- , which will drive down fares , but also more direct , non-stop flights for secondary markets where demand is strong .

it 's another sign of a renaissance of the jewish community . the new museum , to be opened to the public on friday , is part of a new complex on munich 's central jakobsplatz , which also houses a new synagogue and community center .
its permanent collection will focus on different aspects of jewish life , spotlighting religious rites and festivals of the jewish year . objects include manuscripts from the renaissance , a jewish wedding ring from 1500 , and a 550-year-old prayer book for the jewish sukkoth holiday , or feast of tabernacles . bildunterschrift : the building , a cube-shaped structure designed by saarbrücken architects wandel hoefer lorck , is only the second in germany after berlin especially built to house a jewish museum .
there are some 900 square meters -lrb- 9,687 square feet -rrb- of exhibition space . " the building should appeal to jews and non-jews alike and be avenue for open discussion about jewish history , art and culture , " christian ude , munich 's mayor , said in a statement . the museum is located just blocks away from where nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels ordered the destruction of munich 's main synagogue on the night of broken glass , or kristallnacht , in november 1938 . three floors of judaica the building , whose 13.5-million-euro -lrb- $ 18 million -rrb- construction cost was paid by the city , has three floors .
the permanent exhibition on the lowest floor focuses on jewish life in munich and includes models of the city 's five previous synagogues .
the other two floors have space for temporary exhibitions .

it includes renaissance-era ceramics and silver items which are on view together for the first time in munich in more than 70 years .
pringsheim had fled to switzerland during the nazi era , where he died in 1941 . according to the president of germany 's central council of jews , charlotte knoblauch , rthe museum completes munich 's new jewish center . " with it , visitors will have the opportunity to experience a living and diverse judaism in the rooms of our own community and learn about the long history of munich 's jews , " she said . while germany 's jewish community in 1933 numbered 565,000 , by 1950 , there were just 37,000 .
but since german reunification , thousands of jews have moved to germany , mostly from the soviet union , thanks to government policies encouraging immigration .

it 's another sign of a renaissance of the jewish community . the new museum , to be opened to the public on friday , is part of a new complex on munich 's central jakobsplatz , which also houses a new synagogue and community center .
its permanent collection will focus on different aspects of jewish life , spotlighting religious rites and festivals of the jewish year . objects include manuscripts from the renaissance , a jewish wedding ring from 1500 , and a 550-year-old prayer book for the jewish sukkoth holiday , or feast of tabernacles . bildunterschrift : the building , a cube-shaped structure designed by saarbrücken architects wandel hoefer lorck , is only the second in germany after berlin especially built to house a jewish museum .
there are some 900 square meters -lrb- 9,687 square feet -rrb- of exhibition space . " the building should appeal to jews and non-jews alike and be avenue for open discussion about jewish history , art and culture , " christian ude , munich 's mayor , said in a statement . the museum is located just blocks away from where nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels ordered the destruction of munich 's main synagogue on the night of broken glass , or kristallnacht , in november 1938 . three floors of judaica the building , whose 13.5-million-euro -lrb- $ 18 million -rrb- construction cost was paid by the city , has three floors .
the permanent exhibition on the lowest floor focuses on jewish life in munich and includes models of the city 's five previous synagogues .
the other two floors have space for temporary exhibitions .

it includes renaissance-era ceramics and silver items which are on view together for the first time in munich in more than 70 years .
pringsheim had fled to switzerland during the nazi era , where he died in 1941 . according to the president of germany 's central council of jews , charlotte knoblauch , rthe museum completes munich 's new jewish center . " with it , visitors will have the opportunity to experience a living and diverse judaism in the rooms of our own community and learn about the long history of munich 's jews , " she said . while germany 's jewish community in 1933 numbered 565,000 , by 1950 , there were just 37,000 .
but since german reunification , thousands of jews have moved to germany , mostly from the soviet union , thanks to government policies encouraging immigration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.03.2007 eu-us open skies deal to benefit passengers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more competition could mean greater choice in destinations for passengers the eu-us open skies treaty may not go far enough .
but it will still benefit airlines and passengers by generating lower airfares and added competition on transatlantic travel routes , according to analysts . since deregulation of the airline industry in the late 1970s , the european union 's member states have maintained a complicated patchwork of bilateral deals with the united states on airline routes and fares . lufthansa , for instance , is the only european airline allowed to fly from germany to the us , preventing other eu carriers from competing on the frankfurt-new york route , while only four airlines are permitted to fly between london 's heathrow and us airports . but that 's likely to change when european transport ministers vote on a groundbreaking transatlantic pact in the course of a two-day meeting that starts thursday . lower fares through increased competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more transatlantic traffic is likely on premium and secondary routes under the new " open skies " agreement , washington will treat all 27 eu nations as one entity , meaning that any eu airline can fly from any point in the bloc to any destination in the united states , while american airlines will be able to fly to the eu location of their choice . " the impact of open skies is that the industry will become more competitive and the cost savings they achieve will be passed on to the consumer , putting a downward pressure on airfares , especially in business and first class , " said dorothy robyn , a washington dc economist who handled aviation policy in the clinton administration . the main beneficiaries of the deal will be european airlines that are currently subject to restricted bilateral deals with washington , such as aer lingus .
the irish airline is only allowed to fly to four us cities under current conditions , but - like all the eu 's airlines - could soon offer flights to many more american destinations . britain opposed to deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after the concorde , ba enjoyed a near monopoly on heathrow-us flights almost all eu members are expected to vote for the open skies pact .
the uk is the one exception .
experts said it 's defending its flagship carrier , british airways -lrb- ba -rrb- . ba is attempting to protect a near monopoly on lucrative flights from heathrow to the united states .
under an antiquated bilateral accord , ba shares the route with only three other airlines : virgin , american and united . since flights between the us and britain account for 40 percent of all transatlantic traffic - with the bulk of passengers traveling through heathrow - other airlines are vying to break up the quartet 's stranglehold on heathrow 's transatlantic landing slots . " the single biggest benefit is the ability of more airlines to fly into -lrb- london 's -rrb- heathrow airport , " robyn said . industry analysts , however , said the chances of britain exercising its veto power are slim . " the uk government is under huge pressure to accept the agreement , as imperfect as it may be , " said stephen furlong , an airline analyst at davy direct .
" it 's ba and virgin against the world . " but on tuesday , virgin , britain 's second largest airline , turned around its opposition to the open skies plans and announced that it was looking into offering direct flights from frankfurt , paris , zurich , milan and amsterdam to new york , something it would not have been able to do under the old bilateral accords . imperfect , but consumers still benefit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business and first class passengers are espeically likely to see fares drop british airways has also advanced the argument that the deal is unfair to the europeans , since eu airlines wo n't have the right to fly within the us domestic market , while american carriers would acquire a blanket right to carry passengers inside of the 27-member bloc . furlong added that even though the pact was lopsided in favor of the us and did not go far enough , lower airfares and a greater choice of destinations were likely to be in store for european consumers . continental airlines , which favors the open skies treaty , said it would apply for blanket authority to serve destinations in all eu countries . " our strategy is to offer direct , point-to-point flights from european destinations into our newark hub that are not served by the others , " said the airline 's european spokesman , nick britton . still , furlong warned airline passengers not to expect too much from the deal , though he said it was a positive step . " there wo n't be a quantum leap in air travel , but we 're looking at incremental growth for sure , " he said .
" we 'll see more competition in the premium markets -lrb- routes such as new york- frankfurt or los angeles-london -rrb- , which will drive down fares , but also more direct , non-stop flights for secondary markets where demand is strong . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu and us reopen negotiations on deregulating air traffic the united states and european union tuesday revived talks on an " open skies " deal to deregulate transatlantic air traffic , two months after washington threw a large spanner in the works .

but it will still benefit airlines and passengers by generating lower airfares and added competition on transatlantic travel routes , according to analysts . since deregulation of the airline industry in the late 1970s , the european union 's member states have maintained a complicated patchwork of bilateral deals with the united states on airline routes and fares . lufthansa , for instance , is the only european airline allowed to fly from germany to the us , preventing other eu carriers from competing on the frankfurt-new york route , while only four airlines are permitted to fly between london 's heathrow and us airports . but that 's likely to change when european transport ministers vote on a groundbreaking transatlantic pact in the course of a two-day meeting that starts thursday . lower fares through increased competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more transatlantic traffic is likely on premium and secondary routes under the new " open skies " agreement , washington will treat all 27 eu nations as one entity , meaning that any eu airline can fly from any point in the bloc to any destination in the united states , while american airlines will be able to fly to the eu location of their choice . " the impact of open skies is that the industry will become more competitive and the cost savings they achieve will be passed on to the consumer , putting a downward pressure on airfares , especially in business and first class , " said dorothy robyn , a washington dc economist who handled aviation policy in the clinton administration . the main beneficiaries of the deal will be european airlines that are currently subject to restricted bilateral deals with washington , such as aer lingus .
the irish airline is only allowed to fly to four us cities under current conditions , but - like all the eu 's airlines - could soon offer flights to many more american destinations . britain opposed to deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after the concorde , ba enjoyed a near monopoly on heathrow-us flights almost all eu members are expected to vote for the open skies pact .
the uk is the one exception .
experts said it 's defending its flagship carrier , british airways -lrb- ba -rrb- . ba is attempting to protect a near monopoly on lucrative flights from heathrow to the united states .
under an antiquated bilateral accord , ba shares the route with only three other airlines : virgin , american and united . since flights between the us and britain account for 40 percent of all transatlantic traffic - with the bulk of passengers traveling through heathrow - other airlines are vying to break up the quartet 's stranglehold on heathrow 's transatlantic landing slots .

" to have such an increase it means that there will probably be far cheaper , more attractive fares being offered to europeans and americans , " he told journalists . good for consumers the european commission , which negotiated the deal on the eu 's behalf , says consumers will see up to 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- in benefits , as increased competition brings down ticket prices and creates 80,000 new jobs in the aviation sector in the eu and united states combined . it is set to be signed in washington on april 30 but will now only come into effect next march , instead of october this year , as originally planned , to take into account british objections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal was thrashed out at a meeting in brussels on thursday britain had reservations about the deal because it would lift restrictions on the number of airlines which can operate profitable transatlantic flights from heathrow airport outside london . currently , only british airways , virgin atlantic of britain and us carriers united airlines and american airlines are allowed to fly from heathrow to the united states . second round barrot said the fact that all member states had backed the agreement would strengthen the eu 's hand for a second round of negotiations with the united states , that are supposed to remove remaining barriers . " this confidence and unity means that the european side enters the next phase of negotiations with the united states in a strong position , " barrot said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european and us carriers will be able to fly to more destinations under the deal the deal stipulates that any eu carrier would be able to fly from anywhere in the eu to any point in the united states and vice versa . it is expected to dramatically increase competition because eu carriers are currently allowed to fly to the united states only from their home country . however , while us carriers would be able to fly intra-eu routes , their european rivals would not be able to fly between two cities within the united states . the agreement would also lift restrictions on eu carriers buying big stakes in us airlines , although their voting rights in a us carrier would remain capped at 25 percent . the ministers also agreed to a clause that could see some of the benefits of the deal suspended if there were no progress on further liberalisation after the first two and a half years . an open-skies deal is supposed to replace the patchwork of existing bilateral air transport agreements between eu members and the united states , eight of which the european court of justice has ruled are illegal . the european commission has not enforced the court decision because it has a mandate to negotiate an eu-us deal . dw staff -lrb- ml -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-us open skies deal to benefit passengers the eu-us open skies treaty may not go far enough .

" a separate drawing by french cartoonist cabu showed mohammed sobbing , holding his head in his hands and saying : " it is hard to be loved by fools . " the three caricatures were published in charles hebdo on february 8 , 2006 , in a special edition devoted to caricatures of the islamic religion .

he also loves to initiate projects : like collecting money to help the muslim community in cologne build a mosque . whether it 's getting people at his parish to offer tables and chairs which they then donate to the muslim community for a project room in their mosque or applying for european union funds for language courses for girls , pastor franz meurer is a man of action . his church , st. theodor , is located in the höhenberg-vingst areas of cologne - two bordering , lower-income districts with high immigrant and muslim populations . meurer 's interaction with muslims has been a driving force behind his projects .
after speaking with church authorities and the church council , he began collecting money to give to the turkish islamic union of the institute for religion -lrb- ditib -rrb- to help them build their new mosque in the city most famous for its catholic cathedral . last week , meurer raised 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,660 -rrb- in a collection during services in his parish . " several years ago , when our new catholic church was inaugurated , we received a present from a neighboring protestant church , " said meurer .
" we thought the idea was so nice , we wanted to do something similar ourselves . " returning the favor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 3 million muslims live in germany that 's when the idea to donate something to the muslim community was born . " it 's a good idea to support those who think sensibly and want to live together in peace , " meurer said .
" i think it would be a dangerous thing if everyone just lived in their own worlds , separated from one another . " bekir alboga , ditib 's appointee for inter-faith dialogue , said she thinks meurer 's willingness to pass the plate for understanding across religions . " i think it 's great that he 's brave enough to show his true colors , " alboga said .
" it 's a wonderful thing when a catholic priest dares to do what he 's doing , even though right-wing extremism and xenophobia , and even islamophobia , are on the rise . but not everyone in meurer 's parish agreed with collecting money for the new mosque . " i do n't like the idea , " one parishioner said .
" people from all religions should be tolerant , and i do n't see muslims being that way . " another man said that since donations helped to get st. theodor built five years ago , he felt it was a good idea to help people of other faiths build their own places of worship . " everyone has the right to live their faith , " another woman said .
" we pray to our god and the muslims to theirs .
if we can build a church , then they should be able to build a mosque if they want . " controversial mosque bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 1,000 mosques in germany opened their doors for visitors last fall the cologne central mosque is to be built in the district of ehrenfeld - at the site of the current , smaller ditib mosque - and will be one of germany 's largest .
it is designed to hold more than 3,000 worshippers , and building is set to begin in the fall . however , construction of the mosque has been controversial .
the right-wing extremist " pro köln " group - a political party that also sits on the cologne city council - has been one of the biggest opponents of the mosque . it 's the opposition to a new mosque that alboga said makes meurer 's decision to back its construction a strong statement of support .

germany 's federal states agreed thursday to ban smoking in restaurants and pubs , but allowed exceptions for small bars and premises with extra smoking rooms . schools , old people 's homes and public buildings are also covered by the proposed ban , which needs the approval of each of the 16 state parliaments before it can come into force . the agreement comes a month after chancellor angela merkel 's government approved a smoking ban in trains , taxis and all other public transport . the no-smoking issue has divided europe 's most populous nation .

now , german chancellor angela merkel has said she hopes to present a road map for its revival in time for elections to the eu parliament in 2009 . the german government has prepared a so-called berlin declaration , which has been sent to the other 26 eu member states for approval and hopes to have signed at a giant birthday party for the bloc in the german capital sunday . the weekend celebrations will mark the 50th anniversary of the signing of the treaty of rome , which established the european economic community , the forerunner of the eu . support expected government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said wednesday that berlin was confident the draft berlin declaration would win the support of the entire union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steimeier calls for ' renewed foundations ' for europe german newspaper handelsblatt said it had obtained a copy of the text , in which germany states the goal of ending the constitutional crisis in two years ' time .
but the draft does not mention the word " constitution , " so as to not provoke supporters of a more watered-down treaty . the handelsblatt report noted that several states objected to including the date 2009 , deeming it too early . the newspaper added that the inclusion in the declaration of a " european social model " that can only be preserved by a united bloc was also a source of controversy . steinmeier : ' the eu needs a new foundation ' britain in particular has raised objections to the inclusion of such a phrase in a european constitution . voters in france and the netherlands rejected a draft constitution in referendums in 2005 , sending the project into a tailspin and plunging the union into a serious crisis . according to a report by reuters news service , a section of the two or three page berlin declaration reads : " fifty years after the signing of the treaties of rome , we are united in the common goal of renewing , in time for the 2009 european parliamentary elections , the common foundation on which the european union is built . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will need to convince some eu members to sign the document describing the significance of this passage , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reuters : " the union needs renewed foundations , and that needs to come in the form of the substance of a constitution . " skeptical czechs ? the full text of the declaration will be issued on sunday , where it is to be signed by german chancellor angela merkel , european commission chief jose manuel barroso and the head of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering . the mention of 2009 is not expected to please the czechs , who are one of the countries that want merkel to scrap her plans to try again with the constitution . the czech negotiator for the declaration , member of european parliament jan zahradil , said prague would not treat this language as a commitment to any kind of new charter or treaty . a few tough sells " we wo n't wreck the whole thing , but we will interpret it as we see fit , therefore not as a commitment to a new treaty or a version of it by 2009 , " zahradil told reuters . the czechs , poles , british , dutch and french are expected to be the most difficult countries for merkel to convince as she presses ahead with plans to lay out a specific " road map " for the eu charter , which aims to make the bloc 's institutions more efficient and streamline decision-making . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland agrees to eu declaration and to talks on constitution polish president kaczynski told german chancellor merkel on saturday his country would not block efforts to revive the european union 's constitution and would sign an eu declaration marking the bloc 's 50th birthday .

it 's another sign of a renaissance of the jewish community . the new museum , to be opened to the public on friday , is part of a new complex on munich 's central jakobsplatz , which also houses a new synagogue and community center .
its permanent collection will focus on different aspects of jewish life , spotlighting religious rites and festivals of the jewish year . objects include manuscripts from the renaissance , a jewish wedding ring from 1500 , and a 550-year-old prayer book for the jewish sukkoth holiday , or feast of tabernacles . bildunterschrift : the building , a cube-shaped structure designed by saarbrücken architects wandel hoefer lorck , is only the second in germany after berlin especially built to house a jewish museum .
there are some 900 square meters -lrb- 9,687 square feet -rrb- of exhibition space . " the building should appeal to jews and non-jews alike and be avenue for open discussion about jewish history , art and culture , " christian ude , munich 's mayor , said in a statement . the museum is located just blocks away from where nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels ordered the destruction of munich 's main synagogue on the night of broken glass , or kristallnacht , in november 1938 . three floors of judaica the building , whose 13.5-million-euro -lrb- $ 18 million -rrb- construction cost was paid by the city , has three floors .
the permanent exhibition on the lowest floor focuses on jewish life in munich and includes models of the city 's five previous synagogues .
the other two floors have space for temporary exhibitions .
at the beginning of 2008 , works by contemporary jewish artists will be shown . bildunterschrift : a woman looks at information panels at the new jewish museum in munich one collection of judaica to be shown is that of alfred pringsheim , a mathematician and father-in-law of the author thomas mann .
it includes renaissance-era ceramics and silver items which are on view together for the first time in munich in more than 70 years .
pringsheim had fled to switzerland during the nazi era , where he died in 1941 . according to the president of germany 's central council of jews , charlotte knoblauch , rthe museum completes munich 's new jewish center . " with it , visitors will have the opportunity to experience a living and diverse judaism in the rooms of our own community and learn about the long history of munich 's jews , " she said . while germany 's jewish community in 1933 numbered 565,000 , by 1950 , there were just 37,000 .
but since german reunification , thousands of jews have moved to germany , mostly from the soviet union , thanks to government policies encouraging immigration .

" to have such an increase it means that there will probably be far cheaper , more attractive fares being offered to europeans and americans , " he told journalists . good for consumers the european commission , which negotiated the deal on the eu 's behalf , says consumers will see up to 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- in benefits , as increased competition brings down ticket prices and creates 80,000 new jobs in the aviation sector in the eu and united states combined . it is set to be signed in washington on april 30 but will now only come into effect next march , instead of october this year , as originally planned , to take into account british objections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal was thrashed out at a meeting in brussels on thursday britain had reservations about the deal because it would lift restrictions on the number of airlines which can operate profitable transatlantic flights from heathrow airport outside london . currently , only british airways , virgin atlantic of britain and us carriers united airlines and american airlines are allowed to fly from heathrow to the united states . second round barrot said the fact that all member states had backed the agreement would strengthen the eu 's hand for a second round of negotiations with the united states , that are supposed to remove remaining barriers .

" to have such an increase it means that there will probably be far cheaper , more attractive fares being offered to europeans and americans , " he told journalists . good for consumers the european commission , which negotiated the deal on the eu 's behalf , says consumers will see up to 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- in benefits , as increased competition brings down ticket prices and creates 80,000 new jobs in the aviation sector in the eu and united states combined . it is set to be signed in washington on april 30 but will now only come into effect next march , instead of october this year , as originally planned , to take into account british objections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal was thrashed out at a meeting in brussels on thursday britain had reservations about the deal because it would lift restrictions on the number of airlines which can operate profitable transatlantic flights from heathrow airport outside london . currently , only british airways , virgin atlantic of britain and us carriers united airlines and american airlines are allowed to fly from heathrow to the united states . second round barrot said the fact that all member states had backed the agreement would strengthen the eu 's hand for a second round of negotiations with the united states , that are supposed to remove remaining barriers . " this confidence and unity means that the european side enters the next phase of negotiations with the united states in a strong position , " barrot said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european and us carriers will be able to fly to more destinations under the deal the deal stipulates that any eu carrier would be able to fly from anywhere in the eu to any point in the united states and vice versa . it is expected to dramatically increase competition because eu carriers are currently allowed to fly to the united states only from their home country . however , while us carriers would be able to fly intra-eu routes , their european rivals would not be able to fly between two cities within the united states . the agreement would also lift restrictions on eu carriers buying big stakes in us airlines , although their voting rights in a us carrier would remain capped at 25 percent . the ministers also agreed to a clause that could see some of the benefits of the deal suspended if there were no progress on further liberalisation after the first two and a half years . an open-skies deal is supposed to replace the patchwork of existing bilateral air transport agreements between eu members and the united states , eight of which the european court of justice has ruled are illegal . the european commission has not enforced the court decision because it has a mandate to negotiate an eu-us deal . dw staff -lrb- ml -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-us open skies deal to benefit passengers the eu-us open skies treaty may not go far enough .

germany 's federal states agreed thursday to ban smoking in restaurants and pubs , but allowed exceptions for small bars and premises with extra smoking rooms . schools , old people 's homes and public buildings are also covered by the proposed ban , which needs the approval of each of the 16 state parliaments before it can come into force . the agreement comes a month after chancellor angela merkel 's government approved a smoking ban in trains , taxis and all other public transport . the no-smoking issue has divided europe 's most populous nation .
an attempt by the government late in november to impose a federal ban collapsed on constitutional grounds . under germany 's federal system the 16 states and not the berlin government have power over facilities such as hospitals and schools as well as restaurants and bars . smoking to continue in closed rooms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers can still light up in bars with special rooms under thursday 's agreement , restaurants and large bars or pubs can permit smokers to use designated smoking rooms provided they are closed off by doors from the rest of the public space . the restrictions fall far short of those in england , italy , ireland and other european nations which have already implemented smoking bans in all restaurants and bars . germany is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 16.7 million smokers , or 27 per cent of the adult population , according to official statistics . each year there are about 110,000 smoking-related deaths , mainly caused by lung cancer , circulatory ailments and stomach ulcers , says a government report on addiction . bans in discos and nightclubs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking in discos and clubs will be banned from september the states ' health ministers agreed last month that a complete smoking ban would apply in discotheques and night clubs popular with young people . fines for smoking could range from 5 to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 7 to 1,300 -rrb- once the federal government bans smoking in transport and federal facilities . if the upper and lower houses of the german parliament adopt the government-proposed law , it would take effect on september 1 . most airlines which land in germany already ban smoking .
the german railways restrict smoking to special smoking cars , as the future law will require and smoking is already banned in most municipal buses . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite planned ban , german mps fight for right to light up the german government last month agreed to ban smoking in public transport and federal buildings .
but its own backyard seems to be an exception with some parliamentarians reluctant to stub out .

the government has agreed to outlaw smoking in selected public areas , but stopped short of efforts to introduce a nationwide ban .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.03.2007 report : merkel to aim for eu constitution in 2009 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is hoping for a way out of the constitutional dead end germany has included the goal of having a constitution for the european union by 2009 in a draft declaration to mark the 50th anniversary of the bloc . the eu constitution has been in limbo since its rejection by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
now , german chancellor angela merkel has said she hopes to present a road map for its revival in time for elections to the eu parliament in 2009 . the german government has prepared a so-called berlin declaration , which has been sent to the other 26 eu member states for approval and hopes to have signed at a giant birthday party for the bloc in the german capital sunday . the weekend celebrations will mark the 50th anniversary of the signing of the treaty of rome , which established the european economic community , the forerunner of the eu . support expected government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said wednesday that berlin was confident the draft berlin declaration would win the support of the entire union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steimeier calls for ' renewed foundations ' for europe german newspaper handelsblatt said it had obtained a copy of the text , in which germany states the goal of ending the constitutional crisis in two years ' time .
but the draft does not mention the word " constitution , " so as to not provoke supporters of a more watered-down treaty . the handelsblatt report noted that several states objected to including the date 2009 , deeming it too early . the newspaper added that the inclusion in the declaration of a " european social model " that can only be preserved by a united bloc was also a source of controversy . steinmeier : ' the eu needs a new foundation ' britain in particular has raised objections to the inclusion of such a phrase in a european constitution . voters in france and the netherlands rejected a draft constitution in referendums in 2005 , sending the project into a tailspin and plunging the union into a serious crisis . according to a report by reuters news service , a section of the two or three page berlin declaration reads : " fifty years after the signing of the treaties of rome , we are united in the common goal of renewing , in time for the 2009 european parliamentary elections , the common foundation on which the european union is built . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will need to convince some eu members to sign the document describing the significance of this passage , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reuters : " the union needs renewed foundations , and that needs to come in the form of the substance of a constitution . " skeptical czechs ? the full text of the declaration will be issued on sunday , where it is to be signed by german chancellor angela merkel , european commission chief jose manuel barroso and the head of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering . the mention of 2009 is not expected to please the czechs , who are one of the countries that want merkel to scrap her plans to try again with the constitution . the czech negotiator for the declaration , member of european parliament jan zahradil , said prague would not treat this language as a commitment to any kind of new charter or treaty . a few tough sells " we wo n't wreck the whole thing , but we will interpret it as we see fit , therefore not as a commitment to a new treaty or a version of it by 2009 , " zahradil told reuters . the czechs , poles , british , dutch and french are expected to be the most difficult countries for merkel to convince as she presses ahead with plans to lay out a specific " road map " for the eu charter , which aims to make the bloc 's institutions more efficient and streamline decision-making . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland agrees to eu declaration and to talks on constitution polish president kaczynski told german chancellor merkel on saturday his country would not block efforts to revive the european union 's constitution and would sign an eu declaration marking the bloc 's 50th birthday .

germany 's federal states agreed thursday to ban smoking in restaurants and pubs , but allowed exceptions for small bars and premises with extra smoking rooms . schools , old people 's homes and public buildings are also covered by the proposed ban , which needs the approval of each of the 16 state parliaments before it can come into force . the agreement comes a month after chancellor angela merkel 's government approved a smoking ban in trains , taxis and all other public transport . the no-smoking issue has divided europe 's most populous nation .
an attempt by the government late in november to impose a federal ban collapsed on constitutional grounds . under germany 's federal system the 16 states and not the berlin government have power over facilities such as hospitals and schools as well as restaurants and bars . smoking to continue in closed rooms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers can still light up in bars with special rooms under thursday 's agreement , restaurants and large bars or pubs can permit smokers to use designated smoking rooms provided they are closed off by doors from the rest of the public space . the restrictions fall far short of those in england , italy , ireland and other european nations which have already implemented smoking bans in all restaurants and bars . germany is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 16.7 million smokers , or 27 per cent of the adult population , according to official statistics . each year there are about 110,000 smoking-related deaths , mainly caused by lung cancer , circulatory ailments and stomach ulcers , says a government report on addiction . bans in discos and nightclubs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking in discos and clubs will be banned from september the states ' health ministers agreed last month that a complete smoking ban would apply in discotheques and night clubs popular with young people . fines for smoking could range from 5 to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 7 to 1,300 -rrb- once the federal government bans smoking in transport and federal facilities . if the upper and lower houses of the german parliament adopt the government-proposed law , it would take effect on september 1 . most airlines which land in germany already ban smoking .
the german railways restrict smoking to special smoking cars , as the future law will require and smoking is already banned in most municipal buses . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite planned ban , german mps fight for right to light up the german government last month agreed to ban smoking in public transport and federal buildings .
but its own backyard seems to be an exception with some parliamentarians reluctant to stub out .
-lrb- 10.03.2007 -rrb- german cabinet approves smoking ban smokers in germany will be limited in exercising their addiction beginning in september .
the government has agreed to outlaw smoking in selected public areas , but stopped short of efforts to introduce a nationwide ban .

a green paper is expected to reveal if the government thinks pupils should be legally forced to stay in education .
gordon brown said every teenager would have " a right " to stay in training or school until they were 18 during his budget speech on wednesday .
the age at which children must attend school was raised to 16 in 1972 .
john brennan , chief executive of the association of colleges , said the sector he represented supported the ambition of the government .
meanwhile , richard lambert , cbi director-general , said : " the cbi supports moves to raise the age at which young people can leave education or training to address the lack of basic and employability skills amongst many young people entering the labour market . "
previously , the department for education and skills said its plans would see the school leaving age raised in england by 2013 .
school leaving age 1870 : first compulsory school for younger children 1880 : attendance officers enforce school for 5 to 10 year olds 1899 : leaving age raised to 12 1918 : full-time education compulsory up to 14 1944 : education act raises leaving age to 15 1964 : raising of school leaving age to 16 announced , but not in place until 1972 recent figures for england showed that 11 % of 16 to 18-year-olds are still outside education , training or work .
at present , 76 % of this age group are in education or receiving training - which will mean that the remainder will either have to begin workplace training or return to further education .
plans for funding and implementation are reported to have been drawn up in meetings between the education department , the treasury , business representatives and head teachers ' leaders .
among the examples of how this might be enforced is a scheme in canada , where under 18-year-olds can not get a driving licence without proof that they are in education or training .
young people are already offered financial incentives - the educational maintenance allowances -lrb- emas -rrb- - to help them stay in education beyond the age of 16 .
the education secretary alan johnson previously said it was " repellent that a youngster of 16 is not getting any training " .

developer david mclean has submitted plans to boost the number of boat moorings from 10 , to between 45-50 .
mr mclean , 64 , said the expansion would form part of a £ 1m facelift for the gwynedd marine boat yard , to meet modern-day sailing needs .
porthmadog harbour consultative committee said more talks were needed , but accepted the idea in principle .
mr mclean , president of the deeside-based david mclean -lrb- holdings -rrb- ltd , is also involved in the construction of a £ 10m luxury hotel on the white house hotel site in abersoch .
i am not too sure if the area under consideration is suitable at times of high tides dr john jones morris , madoc yacht club he said there was a " clear need " for more pontoons in porthmadog harbour .
he said : " i am convinced that i will be able to attract clients twice over for those that i have in mind at gwynedd marine . "
he said the area around porthmadog was " the best part of the world as far as tourism , and sailing in particular , are concerned . "
maritime officer barry davies told the harbour 's committee the size of the area and the pontoons should be considered in relation to the narrowness of the estuary .
madoc yacht club secretary , retired gp john jones morris , emphasised the need to ensure the council did not lose any income .
he added : " i am not too sure if the area under consideration is suitable at times of high tides , and i doubt if the boats would be safe there . "
in the past , plans to expand pwllheli , another gwynedd marina , have failed because of fears an influx of non-welsh speakers could damage the traditional language heartland .

clarendon mayor milton brown told a bbc wales documentary that countries involved in the trade had a " moral responsibility " to help those affected .
clarendon was once dominated by a welsh slave-owning family .
a descendant of the family - originally from flintshire - has now offered to make a contribution to the community .
the mayor argues that slavery has left a lasting legacy in the caribbean , whereas wales made long-term gains in the growth of industries like copper and iron , which were boosted by slavery .
mr brown said : " all those countries that were involved in slavery have a moral responsibility to have some form of restoration -lsb- compensation -rsb- .
" wales being one of those countries , i would expect them to take the necessary measures to have some form of restoration done . "
he added that he thought education would be the " best avenue for restitution " .
the pennant family owned large slave-run sugar plantations in the clarendon area of jamaica .
they used the money they made to buy the penrhyn estate in gwynedd and develop the north wales slate industry .
douglas pennant , a descendant of the family , said his admiration for his ancestor richard pennant , the father of the north wales slate industry , was tainted by his involvement in slavery .
moral debt he said : " what he did by today 's standards was appalling , but you have got to remember he was a man of his time .
" slavery was one of the greatest crimes that ever happened in history .
it was far worse than what happened in germany in the 1930s and 1940s . "
mr pennant said there was a moral duty to make reparations .
he said : " morally there is a debt , but practically on economic lines , you ca n't do it because so many generations have gone by . "
but mr pennant has suggested funding a project in clarendon though a charitable trust and has been put in touch with mayor brown by the programme makers .
as well as boosting the wealth of a number of welsh families , researchers believe the slave trade was important in the industrial development of wales .
chris evans , from the university of glamorgan , said : " there are very clear links between the swansea copper industry and slavery because it 's a good that was in demand on the african coast among african slave traders .
" in north wales , the development of the parys mountain mine is closely connected to the whole issue of atlantic shipping and the slave trade because so much of the copper that is being made there is destined for the sheathing of naval vessels .
" the iron industry has very clear roots in slave enterprise .

clarendon mayor milton brown told a bbc wales documentary that countries involved in the trade had a " moral responsibility " to help those affected .
clarendon was once dominated by a welsh slave-owning family .
a descendant of the family - originally from flintshire - has now offered to make a contribution to the community .
the mayor argues that slavery has left a lasting legacy in the caribbean , whereas wales made long-term gains in the growth of industries like copper and iron , which were boosted by slavery .
mr brown said : " all those countries that were involved in slavery have a moral responsibility to have some form of restoration -lsb- compensation -rsb- .
" wales being one of those countries , i would expect them to take the necessary measures to have some form of restoration done . "
the mayor would like to see money invested in education he added that he thought education would be the " best avenue for restitution " .
the pennant family owned large slave-run sugar plantations in the clarendon area of jamaica .
they used the money they made to buy the penrhyn estate in gwynedd and develop the north wales slate industry .
douglas pennant , a descendant of the family , said his admiration for his ancestor richard pennant , the father of the north wales slate industry , was tainted by his involvement in slavery .
moral debt he said : " what he did by today 's standards was appalling , but you have got to remember he was a man of his time .
" slavery was one of the greatest crimes that ever happened in history .
it was far worse than what happened in germany in the 1930s and 1940s . "
mr pennant said there was a moral duty to make reparations .
he said : " morally there is a debt , but practically on economic lines , you ca n't do it because so many generations have gone by . "
but mr pennant has suggested funding a project in clarendon though a charitable trust and has been put in touch with mayor brown by the programme makers .
as well as boosting the wealth of a number of welsh families , researchers believe the slave trade was important in the industrial development of wales .
chris evans , from the university of glamorgan , said : " there are very clear links between the swansea copper industry and slavery because it 's a good that was in demand on the african coast among african slave traders .
" in north wales , the development of the parys mountain mine is closely connected to the whole issue of atlantic shipping and the slave trade because so much of the copper that is being made there is destined for the sheathing of naval vessels .
" the iron industry has very clear roots in slave enterprise .
" if we think of merthyr tydfil , the great starting point of the modern iron industry in wales , the key figure is anthony bacon who made his money in atlantic commerce shipping slaves among other things . "

bbc news -pipe- school report -pipe- teens tell bbc chief what news they want bbc news / school report graphics version bbc sport home thursday , 22 march 2007 , 07:44 gmt teens tell bbc chief what news they want by pete clifton head of news interactive the great thing about taking part in the build-up to school report news day is i got to learn just as much as the children !
while i could hopefully pass on a few bits of useful information about journalism , the 12- and 13-year-olds i met at charles edward brooke school in lambeth could tell me what they really thought of the bbc news website - warts and all .
abi , ashley , leticha and peta-gay were part of the video group filming me as part of their report for the big school report day on 22 march .
" there are too many words on the -lsb- bbc -rsb- news website , and sometimes too many long words , " they told me .
" who is it all for ? "
and when mikayla , shanique and camilla took their turn at doing a jeremy paxman , the questions were just as to the point .
" why do all the pages of the -lsb- bbc -rsb- news site look the same when they are about different subjects ?
why ca n't it be easier to use like the newsround site ? "
big tick for celebrity news they had got me on the ropes now , so the best thing to do was bounce back and ask them about news .
and it was good to discover that despite their reservations about the bbc news site , they were really interested in what is happening around them .
gun crime , the environment -lrb- sometimes -rrb- and a big tick for celebrity news , and they had all watched some of that on bbc1 , news 24 , sky news and the ever-reliable newsround .
but probably not the bbc news site .
and mobiles were yet to catch on as a way for them to keep up with the news .
" mobiles are for talking to friends , " they generally agreed .
so what more could the bbc do for them ?
a place they could go on the site for news for teenagers was a popular suggestion , and a " teens news 24 " , with the additional requirement - " do you think you could have some slightly younger people doing it ? "
i suddenly felt very old .
reaching out by the end of my time with this fantastic bunch , they knew a bit more about me - how i got into journalism , a few trusty stories about exploding houses and car pile-ups from my local newspaper days , what makes a top reporter , how do you get into the profession - and i had a real insight into the news they are interested in and where they look for it .
while the bbc news site might be aimed at a slightly older age group - our biggest audience is in the 25-44 bracket - there is a real issue for the bbc about how it reaches out to teenagers who find themselves caught between newsround and the main bbc news site .
shorter news pieces , a more tailored news agenda , younger people presenting it , and making it all available in places where teenagers might be looking .
all big challenges , but ones we are determined to crack in bbc news as part of a wider bbc project to provide more content for teenagers .
and school report news day is also part of the picture of course .
it is excellent to see so many young people taking a real interest in news , learning more about how it is produced , and then putting it all into action .
i 'm really looking forward to seeing all the content that gets put together on 22 march - and if one or two of the people i met up with in lambeth decide they 'd like to be a journalist , that will be icing on the cake .

while the bbc news site might be aimed at a slightly older age group - our biggest audience is in the 25-44 bracket - there is a real issue for the bbc about how it reaches out to teenagers who find themselves caught between newsround and the main bbc news site .
shorter news pieces , a more tailored news agenda , younger people presenting it , and making it all available in places where teenagers might be looking .
all big challenges , but ones we are determined to crack in bbc news as part of a wider bbc project to provide more content for teenagers .

it is excellent to see so many young people taking a real interest in news , learning more about how it is produced , and then putting it all into action .

britain has exchanged with germany 1.5 % of its quota for north sea prawns for permission to land an extra 150 tonnes of high-value sole .
ministers said it was a rescue deal that would safeguard 160 small boats in norfolk , suffolk , essex and kent in danger of going out of business .
the boats caught mainly skate , ray , cod and sole which have had catches cut .
' urgent action ' european fisheries ministers set 25 % lower limits for fish from the north sea in 2007 because stock levels were declining .
many small english fishing boats , from lowestoft to folkestone , faced going out of business because they could not catch enough fish under the restrictions .
the government has struck a deal with germany to swap 375 tonnes of north sea prawns quota for 150 tonnes of north sea sole .
ben bradshaw , uk fisheries minister , said : " we had to take urgent action or scores of fishermen risked losing their livelihoods .
" the deal we struck means they can carry on fishing without a disproportionate impact on other fishermen . "

i 'm very excited , but we have known for ages . "
but he refused to say whether the star of the hit sci-fi show , david tennant , would return in the lead role .
the third series , which co-stars freema agyeman as new assistant martha jones , starts on bbc one on 31 march .
her character replaces former assistant rose tyler , who was written out at the end of the second series after billie piper decided to leave the show .
" billie did a tremendous job , " said agyeman .
" i know no-one likes change but the nature of the show is change and hopefully fans will be cool with that and give me a chance . "
davies spoke glowingly of his new star .
" i just think people will open their hearts and let her in - they 'll love it . "
kiss stars including jonathan ross , jo whiley and fame academy coaches david and carrie grant attended the premiere in central london .
they saw the first episode of the latest series , which sees doctor who share a kiss with his new assistant .
but tennant , who plays the time-travelling hero , would not talk to reporters about his role in future series .
" do you know how many times i have been asked that question ?
do you know how many times i have answered it ? " said the actor .
he was more willing to speak of his affection for cardiff , where the hit series is filmed .
" cardiff is a great city and has been very good to us , " he said .
" it 's lovely to film there because everyone is so enthusiastic .
" you try filming in london and everyone 's so mean about it and complains that there is a huge camera truck parking in their street .
" everyone in cardiff seems to welcome us with open arms .
god bless you all , frankly . "

famous for hits such as letter from america , they have returned to the singles charts with a reworking of i 'm gonna be -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- for comic relief .
the re-recording , with comedians peter kay and matt lucas , is currently at number three , while the original track from 1988 stands at number 37 .
charlie reid , who is older by 30 minutes , explains why the song was adopted for the charity fundraiser and how the proclaimers ' enduring success has far exceeded anything he expected .
it has been an exciting few days for you - not just with your chart success but because your beloved football team hibernian lifted the cis insurance cup .
the proclaimers ' favourite side hibs beat kilmarnock 5-1 on sunday it 's been a very , very big week for us , and very emotional , with the record coming out and then the football .
hibs have n't won anything for 16 years so to get a trophy when you 're a hibs supporter is amazing .
we 've a long history with the club .
it 's not a club you follow if you 're a glory-hunter , put it that way , because you 're consistently disappointed .
i took my kids along and craig took his - to see their faces light up as the trophy was lifted was great .
how did the comic relief video come about ?
matt lucas is a long-term proclaimers aficionado , so he was already a friend .
i think we bumped into peter when we did live8 at murrayfield and maybe that 's where he got the idea for doing the record .
with peter , because of phoenix nights and all the things he 's done before , he 's filmed it in his head before he 's filmed it physically .
it was so swift because he knew exactly what he wanted .
we just turned up , sang a bit and went home , but it was very amusing to see all the different faces .
i 'm gonna be -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- has featured regularly in films and tv shows .
why has it remained so popular ?
i 'm gonna be -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- was originally a number 11 hit in 1988 we 've been out on the road consistently for the last six or seven years , and i would say the growth on that record has been phenomenal .
even before this week , to me it was a much bigger song in the last few years than when it came out in 1988 .
it 's just one of those records that sticks around .
it 's really simple , with conventional instruments , and it works really well on the radio .
have you ever tired of playing it live ?
never once , because usually you 're playing the two , three , four songs that you 're known for , and mixing them up with new songs .
i 've never found it a problem .
did you ever lower your expectations of success in the years when you were n't in the charts ?
we came into this to do what we wanted and to do it on our own terms , hopefully with some success .
we 've already vastly exceeded any success we thought we 'd have .
basically we 're a band that plays live and puts records out .
we do n't expect to have huge hits , but we 've had a lot more than we thought we would .
do you ever see any of the other big scottish bands of the late 80s , such as deacon blue or hue and cry ?
funnily enough with hue and cry , our bass player is the younger brother of pat and greg kane , so there 's a connection there anyway .
but every once in a while , we do bump into the guys from texas or deacon blue .
what do you think of the musical about the proclaimers which is about to be performed by the dundee repertory theatre ?
the duo 's first hit album was in the charts for five months in 1987 it 's very much endorsed by us .
we 've not seen any of the rehearsals yet but i think there are 20 or 21 proclaimers songs in the show .
i think it 's a play with our music in , rather than a proclaimers musical as such , but it 's set in leith over the last 20 years and it involves a couple of families , i believe .
we 're really desperate to go and see it when it comes out .
i think ticket sales are going really well in scotland in the four cities where it 's playing , and i 'm looking forward to it .

famous for hits such as letter from america , they have returned to the singles charts with a reworking of i 'm gonna be -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- for comic relief .
the re-recording , with comedians peter kay and matt lucas , is currently at number three , while the original track from 1988 stands at number 37 .
charlie reid , who is older by 30 minutes , explains why the song was adopted for the charity fundraiser and how the proclaimers ' enduring success has far exceeded anything he expected .
it has been an exciting few days for you - not just with your chart success but because your beloved football team hibernian lifted the cis insurance cup .
the proclaimers ' favourite side hibs beat kilmarnock 5-1 on sunday it 's been a very , very big week for us , and very emotional , with the record coming out and then the football .
hibs have n't won anything for 16 years so to get a trophy when you 're a hibs supporter is amazing .
we 've a long history with the club .
it 's not a club you follow if you 're a glory-hunter , put it that way , because you 're consistently disappointed .
i took my kids along and craig took his - to see their faces light up as the trophy was lifted was great .
how did the comic relief video come about ?
matt lucas is a long-term proclaimers aficionado , so he was already a friend .
i think we bumped into peter when we did live8 at murrayfield and maybe that 's where he got the idea for doing the record .
with peter , because of phoenix nights and all the things he 's done before , he 's filmed it in his head before he 's filmed it physically .
it was so swift because he knew exactly what he wanted .
we just turned up , sang a bit and went home , but it was very amusing to see all the different faces .
i 'm gonna be -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- has featured regularly in films and tv shows .
why has it remained so popular ?
i 'm gonna be -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- was originally a number 11 hit in 1988 we 've been out on the road consistently for the last six or seven years , and i would say the growth on that record has been phenomenal .
even before this week , to me it was a much bigger song in the last few years than when it came out in 1988 .
it 's just one of those records that sticks around .
it 's really simple , with conventional instruments , and it works really well on the radio .
have you ever tired of playing it live ?
never once , because usually you 're playing the two , three , four songs that you 're known for , and mixing them up with new songs .
i 've never found it a problem .
did you ever lower your expectations of success in the years when you were n't in the charts ?
we came into this to do what we wanted and to do it on our own terms , hopefully with some success .
we 've already vastly exceeded any success we thought we 'd have .
basically we 're a band that plays live and puts records out .
we do n't expect to have huge hits , but we 've had a lot more than we thought we would .
do you ever see any of the other big scottish bands of the late 80s , such as deacon blue or hue and cry ?
funnily enough with hue and cry , our bass player is the younger brother of pat and greg kane , so there 's a connection there anyway .
but every once in a while , we do bump into the guys from texas or deacon blue .
what do you think of the musical about the proclaimers which is about to be performed by the dundee repertory theatre ?
the duo 's first hit album was in the charts for five months in 1987 it 's very much endorsed by us .
we 've not seen any of the rehearsals yet but i think there are 20 or 21 proclaimers songs in the show .
i think it 's a play with our music in , rather than a proclaimers musical as such , but it 's set in leith over the last 20 years and it involves a couple of families , i believe .
we 're really desperate to go and see it when it comes out .
i think ticket sales are going really well in scotland in the four cities where it 's playing , and i 'm looking forward to it .
the proclaimers ' greatest hits album is released on 2 april .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- how governments censor the web bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- thursday , 22 march 2007 , 08:59 gmt how governments censor the web by blocking the popular youtube website , turkey has joined the list of countries taking steps to control what their populations can see on the internet .
how far will governments go to censor web content , and how do they do it ?
youtube was blocked by a court order in turkey after clips were posted that , prosecutors said , insulted the memory of the nation 's founder , mustafa kemal ataturk .
turkish visitors to the site are now greeted with a message in english and turkish reading " access to www.youtube.com site has been suspended in accordance with decision no : 2007/384 dated 06.03.2007 of istanbul first criminal peace court " .
but controlling what people can and can not see on the internet has become a prime interest of many of the world 's more authoritarian regimes .
" five or six years ago , very few countries controlled the internet , " says julien pain of reporters without borders -lrb- rsf -rrb- .
" very few dictators understood that they had to control the web as they did traditional media .
unfortunately , now , web censorship is spreading around the world . "
flat denial over a decade after the internet really began to take off , most countries ' leaders recognise the desirability of being online , says daniel whitener of the world wide web consortium .
" they recognise it , if nothing else , as a critical avenue for commerce , " he explains .
the great firewall of china " what comes along with that commercial avenue though is access to quite a bit of information that can be quite threatening to authoritarian regimes . "
and the ways that different countries have attempted to combat this threat are numerous .
in north korea only selected government officials get access to the net and then on connections rented from china .
it does not even have its own national net domain , .nk.
in turkmenistan , access is denied to almost everyone .
and in many other countries , access is becoming more difficult as governments recognise the potential influence of the internet .
in burma , for example , computers in internet cafes automatically take a screen capture every five minutes to monitor what users are viewing .
in january this year iran enacted a new law requiring bloggers to register their sites with the authorities .
but it is china which has one of the most sophisticated and ambitious internet censorship programmes .
the country 's ruling communist party was quick to latch on to the internet 's potential - and was focusing on it at around the same time as microsoft founder bill gates .
great firewall of china china aims to make the internet available to everyone in the country - potentially doubling today 's global figure of one billion regular users - but because of recent history , it also intends to strictly govern what can and can not be seen .
" after tiananmen in 1989 , the government convened a whole range of crisis meetings - and in one of those meetings , put forward a plan for using the internet for control of china 's government administration , " says peter lovelock of the telecommunications research project at the university of hong kong .
" that meant never letting the country roll out of control like it had at tiananmen .
they started building these huge internet backbones then and there ... the chinese authorities said , ' we are going to put everybody on the internet - and on our terms ' . "
hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on building what is known as the great firewall of china - a network of state-licensed internet access providers , and around 30,000 internet police censors who filter sites between china and the rest of the world .
the bbc news website , for example , continues to be blocked in china .

how far will governments go to censor web content , and how do they do it ?
youtube was blocked by a court order in turkey after clips were posted that , prosecutors said , insulted the memory of the nation 's founder , mustafa kemal ataturk .
turkish visitors to the site are now greeted with a message in english and turkish reading " access to www.youtube.com site has been suspended in accordance with decision no : 2007/384 dated 06.03.2007 of istanbul first criminal peace court " .
but controlling what people can and can not see on the internet has become a prime interest of many of the world 's more authoritarian regimes .
" five or six years ago , very few countries controlled the internet , " says julien pain of reporters without borders -lrb- rsf -rrb- .
" very few dictators understood that they had to control the web as they did traditional media .
unfortunately , now , web censorship is spreading around the world . "
flat denial over a decade after the internet really began to take off , most countries ' leaders recognise the desirability of being online , says daniel whitener of the world wide web consortium .
" they recognise it , if nothing else , as a critical avenue for commerce , " he explains .
the great firewall of china " what comes along with that commercial avenue though is access to quite a bit of information that can be quite threatening to authoritarian regimes . "
and the ways that different countries have attempted to combat this threat are numerous .
in north korea only selected government officials get access to the net and then on connections rented from china .
it does not even have its own national net domain , .nk.
in turkmenistan , access is denied to almost everyone .
and in many other countries , access is becoming more difficult as governments recognise the potential influence of the internet .
in burma , for example , computers in internet cafes automatically take a screen capture every five minutes to monitor what users are viewing .
in january this year iran enacted a new law requiring bloggers to register their sites with the authorities .
but it is china which has one of the most sophisticated and ambitious internet censorship programmes .
the country 's ruling communist party was quick to latch on to the internet 's potential - and was focusing on it at around the same time as microsoft founder bill gates .
great firewall of china china aims to make the internet available to everyone in the country - potentially doubling today 's global figure of one billion regular users - but because of recent history , it also intends to strictly govern what can and can not be seen .
soliman 's sentence was condemned by human rights groups " after tiananmen in 1989 , the government convened a whole range of crisis meetings - and in one of those meetings , put forward a plan for using the internet for control of china 's government administration , " says peter lovelock of the telecommunications research project at the university of hong kong .
" that meant never letting the country roll out of control like it had at tiananmen .
they started building these huge internet backbones then and there ... the chinese authorities said , ' we are going to put everybody on the internet - and on our terms ' . "
hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on building what is known as the great firewall of china - a network of state-licensed internet access providers , and around 30,000 internet police censors who filter sites between china and the rest of the world .
the bbc news website , for example , continues to be blocked in china .
but western companies have been accused of collaborating with the chinese authorities in order to gain access to china 's rapidly-growing market - microsoft censors chinese blogs , while google has set up its own version of its site for the chinese market , on which it blocks politically-sensitive terms in agreement with conditions set by beijing .

how far will governments go to censor web content , and how do they do it ?
youtube was blocked by a court order in turkey after clips were posted that , prosecutors said , insulted the memory of the nation 's founder , mustafa kemal ataturk .
turkish visitors to the site are now greeted with a message in english and turkish reading " access to www.youtube.com site has been suspended in accordance with decision no : 2007/384 dated 06.03.2007 of istanbul first criminal peace court " .
but controlling what people can and can not see on the internet has become a prime interest of many of the world 's more authoritarian regimes .
" five or six years ago , very few countries controlled the internet , " says julien pain of reporters without borders -lrb- rsf -rrb- .
" very few dictators understood that they had to control the web as they did traditional media .
unfortunately , now , web censorship is spreading around the world . "
flat denial over a decade after the internet really began to take off , most countries ' leaders recognise the desirability of being online , says daniel whitener of the world wide web consortium .
" they recognise it , if nothing else , as a critical avenue for commerce , " he explains .
the great firewall of china " what comes along with that commercial avenue though is access to quite a bit of information that can be quite threatening to authoritarian regimes . "
and the ways that different countries have attempted to combat this threat are numerous .
in north korea only selected government officials get access to the net and then on connections rented from china .
it does not even have its own national net domain , .nk.
in turkmenistan , access is denied to almost everyone .
and in many other countries , access is becoming more difficult as governments recognise the potential influence of the internet .
in burma , for example , computers in internet cafes automatically take a screen capture every five minutes to monitor what users are viewing .
in january this year iran enacted a new law requiring bloggers to register their sites with the authorities .
but it is china which has one of the most sophisticated and ambitious internet censorship programmes .
the country 's ruling communist party was quick to latch on to the internet 's potential - and was focusing on it at around the same time as microsoft founder bill gates .
great firewall of china china aims to make the internet available to everyone in the country - potentially doubling today 's global figure of one billion regular users - but because of recent history , it also intends to strictly govern what can and can not be seen .
soliman 's sentence was condemned by human rights groups " after tiananmen in 1989 , the government convened a whole range of crisis meetings - and in one of those meetings , put forward a plan for using the internet for control of china 's government administration , " says peter lovelock of the telecommunications research project at the university of hong kong .
" that meant never letting the country roll out of control like it had at tiananmen .
they started building these huge internet backbones then and there ... the chinese authorities said , ' we are going to put everybody on the internet - and on our terms ' . "
hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on building what is known as the great firewall of china - a network of state-licensed internet access providers , and around 30,000 internet police censors who filter sites between china and the rest of the world .

" that meant never letting the country roll out of control like it had at tiananmen .
they started building these huge internet backbones then and there ... the chinese authorities said , ' we are going to put everybody on the internet - and on our terms ' . "
hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on building what is known as the great firewall of china - a network of state-licensed internet access providers , and around 30,000 internet police censors who filter sites between china and the rest of the world .
the bbc news website , for example , continues to be blocked in china .
but western companies have been accused of collaborating with the chinese authorities in order to gain access to china 's rapidly-growing market - microsoft censors chinese blogs , while google has set up its own version of its site for the chinese market , on which it blocks politically-sensitive terms in agreement with conditions set by beijing .
" the major corporations are going to self-censor - they are not going to do anything which will bring them to the attention of the government for the way in which they deploy their internet access , " mr lovelock adds .
blogging power despite the risks , however , there are nearly 20 million bloggers in china - up from just 2,000 at the end of 2002 .
although beijing views most bloggers as harmless , those who called for free elections have received long jail sentences ; china jails more dissident bloggers than any other country .
rsf last year released a report saying net users have also been jailed in egypt , iran , libya , the maldives , syria , tunisia and vietnam .
mr pain highlighted in particular the case of egyptian blogger abdel kareem nabil soliman , sentenced to four years in prison after being accused of insulting islam on his blog and criticising president hosni mubarak .
" he was an easy target , " said mr pain .
" but it shows that now , bloggers have a real power and influence over politics . "

how far will governments go to censor web content , and how do they do it ?
youtube was blocked by a court order in turkey after clips were posted that , prosecutors said , insulted the memory of the nation 's founder , mustafa kemal ataturk .
turkish visitors to the site are now greeted with a message in english and turkish reading " access to www.youtube.com site has been suspended in accordance with decision no : 2007/384 dated 06.03.2007 of istanbul first criminal peace court " .
but controlling what people can and can not see on the internet has become a prime interest of many of the world 's more authoritarian regimes .
" five or six years ago , very few countries controlled the internet , " says julien pain of reporters without borders -lrb- rsf -rrb- .
" very few dictators understood that they had to control the web as they did traditional media .
unfortunately , now , web censorship is spreading around the world . "
flat denial over a decade after the internet really began to take off , most countries ' leaders recognise the desirability of being online , says daniel whitener of the world wide web consortium .
" they recognise it , if nothing else , as a critical avenue for commerce , " he explains .
the great firewall of china " what comes along with that commercial avenue though is access to quite a bit of information that can be quite threatening to authoritarian regimes . "
and the ways that different countries have attempted to combat this threat are numerous .
in north korea only selected government officials get access to the net and then on connections rented from china .
it does not even have its own national net domain , .nk.
in turkmenistan , access is denied to almost everyone .
and in many other countries , access is becoming more difficult as governments recognise the potential influence of the internet .
in burma , for example , computers in internet cafes automatically take a screen capture every five minutes to monitor what users are viewing .
in january this year iran enacted a new law requiring bloggers to register their sites with the authorities .
but it is china which has one of the most sophisticated and ambitious internet censorship programmes .
the country 's ruling communist party was quick to latch on to the internet 's potential - and was focusing on it at around the same time as microsoft founder bill gates .
great firewall of china china aims to make the internet available to everyone in the country - potentially doubling today 's global figure of one billion regular users - but because of recent history , it also intends to strictly govern what can and can not be seen .

researchers found changes in rotas and working nights were at the heart of the problem in a poll of 1,400 medics .
uk doctors agreed more needed to be done , and warned badly designed rotas were a concern .
the occupational and environmental medicine journal study was done by researchers at massey and auckland universities in new zealand .
the study is published as many western countries look to reduce the hours their junior doctors work .
in the uk , they are no longer allowed to work over 58 hours and this must be reduced to 48 by 2009 under the european working time directive .
the doctors who were quizzed were working a variety of hours from 40 a week to over 70 . "
when designing rotas , the nhs must recognise the importance of doctors having enough time to rest beforehand and afterwards " dr masood ahmed , of the british medical association each participant was given a fatigue risk score by combining 10 aspects of work patterns and sleep in the preceding week .
some 30 % of respondents were classified as " excessively sleepy " - twice the rate of the general population .
one in four said that since becoming a doctor they had fallen asleep at the wheel of their car while driving home and two thirds said they had come close to falling asleep in the past year .
two thirds also said that they had made a mistake associated with fatigue at some point in their careers , while more than four out of 10 said that this had happened in the preceding six months .
but the study found night shifts and unscheduled changes to rosters were more consistently linked to sleepiness and errors than the total number of hours worked .
for example , while hours worked did reduce the risk of sleepiness it did not change the risk of feeling sleepy at the wheel or a fatigue-related clinical error .
whereas night work increased the risk of sleepiness at the wheel by a half and shift changes increased the risk of error by a third .
errors dr phillip gander , of massey university 's sleep research centre , said : " we conclude that long work hours are not the only aspect of work patterns that needs to be managed to reduce sleepiness and fatigue-related clinical errors among junior doctors .
" the findings support the view that a more comprehensive risk management approach is needed to reduce doctors ' sleepiness and improve patient safety . "
dr masood ahmed , deputy chairman of the british medical association 's junior doctors committee , said : " when designing rotas , the nhs must recognise the importance of doctors having enough time to rest beforehand and afterwards .
" they must also provide adequate rest rooms .
unfortunately , too many are more focussed on saving money than improving patient safety , and are withdrawing rest facilities . "
a department of health spokesman said the government was working hard to get a balance for junior doctors .
" working patterns must provide a sensible balance between supporting patient services , doctors working lives and their training . "

researchers found changes in rotas and working nights were at the heart of the problem in a poll of 1,400 medics .
uk doctors agreed more needed to be done , and warned badly designed rotas were a concern .
the occupational and environmental medicine journal study was done by researchers at massey and auckland universities in new zealand .
the study is published as many western countries look to reduce the hours their junior doctors work .
in the uk , they are no longer allowed to work over 58 hours and this must be reduced to 48 by 2009 under the european working time directive .
the doctors who were quizzed were working a variety of hours from 40 a week to over 70 .
when designing rotas , the nhs must recognise the importance of doctors having enough time to rest beforehand and afterwards dr masood ahmed , of the british medical association each participant was given a fatigue risk score by combining 10 aspects of work patterns and sleep in the preceding week .
some 30 % of respondents were classified as " excessively sleepy " - twice the rate of the general population .
one in four said that since becoming a doctor they had fallen asleep at the wheel of their car while driving home and two thirds said they had come close to falling asleep in the past year .
two thirds also said that they had made a mistake associated with fatigue at some point in their careers , while more than four out of 10 said that this had happened in the preceding six months .
but the study found night shifts and unscheduled changes to rosters were more consistently linked to sleepiness and errors than the total number of hours worked .
for example , while hours worked did reduce the risk of sleepiness it did not change the risk of feeling sleepy at the wheel or a fatigue-related clinical error .
whereas night work increased the risk of sleepiness at the wheel by a half and shift changes increased the risk of error by a third .
errors dr phillip gander , of massey university 's sleep research centre , said : " we conclude that long work hours are not the only aspect of work patterns that needs to be managed to reduce sleepiness and fatigue-related clinical errors among junior doctors .
" the findings support the view that a more comprehensive risk management approach is needed to reduce doctors ' sleepiness and improve patient safety . "
dr masood ahmed , deputy chairman of the british medical association 's junior doctors committee , said : " when designing rotas , the nhs must recognise the importance of doctors having enough time to rest beforehand and afterwards .
" they must also provide adequate rest rooms .
unfortunately , too many are more focussed on saving money than improving patient safety , and are withdrawing rest facilities . "

more than 200 protesters , and several hundred onlookers , descended on two lines near guixi in jiangxi province .
they were protesting at planned zoning changes in guixi which could impact on income and benefits , the reports said .
protests , particularly in rural china , have become increasingly common as the gap between rich and poor has widened .
many of the protests have been linked to land seizures and corruption among local officials .
some 20,000 people clashed with police in central hunan province last week after protesting at an attempt by a bus company to double the price of tickets .
reports that one person had died were denied by the authorities .
popular route in the latest incident , protesters arrived at the railway station in guixi shortly before noon on wednesday , the state news agency xinhua said .
they blocked two railway lines , including a heavily-used track that links shanghai in the east to kunming , the capital of south-western yunnan province .
the protest went on for at least four hours before it was broken up by police and officials who had been called to the scene , the reports said .
the protesters were voicing their anger at a plan to place parts of guixi under the control of a different district , which would have an impact on benefits .
" they worried that the re-division would affect their salaries and welfare , " the xinhua report said .
