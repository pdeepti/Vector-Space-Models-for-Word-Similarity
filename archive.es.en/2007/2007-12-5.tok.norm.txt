program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 05.12.2007 the rise of the high rise in german film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living the high life german film , it seems , loves pre-fabs .
a new release about a make-shift family in a high-rise has attracted much praise , yet there is some suggestion that its success has as much to do with the setting as the plot . wir sagen du !
schatz -lrb- family rules -rrb- is an original idea ; it tells the story of a man , who faced with the rather triste prospect of spending christmas alone , decides to steal some relatives and subsequently barricade them , and himself , into the 17th floor of a tower block for festivities en famille . " why set it in a tower block ? " one might ask .
clearly , making the kidnapped protagonists ' prospects for escape difficult is a good plot device , but there is more to it than that .
there has been a shift in perception of high-rise blocks in recent years , and they are now seriously en-vogue among german directors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-fab landscape in the city of dresden actress hendrikje fitz believes using a pre-fab as a backdrop is a quick way for filmmakers to establish the genre and social milieu of their movies .
" you know immediately you are watching a film about people in the former east , " fitz said , " because high-rise blocks are the symbol of the gdr . " but she adds that this generation of german pre-fab movies go some way to portraying the former east germany as a kind of operetta town , so cozy and so trashy that it was a good , if weird , place to be . " it is the moderate way of depicting the gdr , " she said .
" people who lived through it do n't always want to be told they lived in a dictatorship , they want to see different aspects of what they experienced . "
by the same token , audiences who grew up in the west are fascinated by the beehive community element of tower block life sold to them as a synonym for the former eastern germany . giving humanity the hard sell what films like wir sagen du !
schatz , halbe treppe -lrb- grill point -rrb- or du bist nicht allein , another high-rise picture released earlier this year , offer their viewers is good-old fashioned humanity wrapped up in a mix of gritty reality , romanticism and comedy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from bernd böhlich 's ' du bist nicht allein ' lothar holler , set designer on films such as sonnenallee and goodbye lenin , says humanity and a feeling of sticking together are the key ingredients of pre-fab movies .
" audiences enjoy watching people overcome their problems , fight for their families and stave off their loneliness " holler said , " and they like to see people who live outside society 's norms . " over the years , holler 's research has taken him to countless high-rise apartments where he has come face to face with a wildly eclectic mix of people , styles and takes on life . " one lady dreamed of living in a country cottage , so she had sloping walls built into her flat and decked the whole place out in laura ashley .
the man next-door covered his walls in beer cans , and another guy lived in a tent pitched in his living room . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film halbe treppe von dresen holler says these are the little worlds he tries to recreate on screen , not only because they mirror reality , but because they are what audiences want to see .
" where we conform , these on-screen personas do n't , " he said " and their ' anything is possible ' mentality makes them exotic and hence very appealing . " living together , sticking together oliver mielke recently co-wrote , produced and directed a movie set in a pre-fab landscape .
ossis eleven , which is due for release early next year , is a comedy about the benefits of sticking together . mielke , who grew up in western germany and had little experience of tower blocks until he began to research them for his film , says he chose a high-rise location because he wanted to help dispel the prejudice which surrounds them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the positive face of a pre-fab " the clichés of high-rise living are deeply engrained in our minds , " he said , " but in actual fact the atmosphere is n't negative at all . " what stood out for mielke was the extent to which people stick together to organize their lives and the astonishing mix of characters who live on top of one another in a clearly defined space . " where else are you going to find a victim of a gdr doping scandal living next to an ex-stasi informer who lives next to a know-it-all west german ? " he asked .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 05.12.2007 opinion : high pisa score masks inequality in german schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german schools have improved their international ranking , according to the most recent pisa study .
but dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen puts pisa to the test and takes a closer look at the state of education in germany . once upon a time , people thought of the town in italy and of vacation when they heard the word " pisa . "
they thought of cappuccinos , of a building that adamantly refuses to fall over , of bella italia . then the first pisa study 's results came out in 2001 and nothing in german education was bella .
germany , the land of poets and philosophers , had regressed .
its students rated average to poor - a disgrace for old europe that the us tested ahead of germany . but now everything seems to be fine again .
the new pisa study shows - at first glance - that german students have caught up .
education policy-makers are patting each other on the back ; such an accomplishment inevitably involves a lot of them . and it 's true : the first pisa study got things going and generated productive concern .
the german philology association calls the most recent pisa study " proof of the innovative power and reformability " of german schools . but is that really the case ?
let 's take a closer look : the newest pisa study can hardly be compared with its predecessors .
in the 2001 results , testing focused on reading comprehension , but in 2003 it was heavy on math and now the emphasis is on the natural sciences .
that does n't allow for identifying a pattern of development . even if you turning a blind eye to the facts that the only statistics worth believing are the one you 've doctored yourself and that educational studies can never deliver a decisive evaluation of school quality , things still do n't fit together . it remains a disaster that - in a wealthy country like germany - parents ' pocketbook still determines children 's educational path . former german chancellor willy brandt 's motto " education for all " from the 1970s was never fulfilled : the manager 's son goes to the college-prep high school while the blue collar worker 's child attends the vocational high school . it 's still often the case that children from so-called underprivileged families and children with migration backgrounds are n't fostered enough and their potential is not recognized .
this only deepens the social divide that already exists . education means participation in social development .
but when this participation is hindered , we not only have an education problem but a democracy problem as well . the supposed pisa success should n't belie the fact that the three-pillared school system is a manifestation of an antiquated social structure .
no other country begins the selection process so early .
in germany , a student 's educational path is decided in the fourth grade .
the trusted world of learning - in which good , differentiated learning takes place - is lost . nearly all german education researchers agree on the solution : learning together over a longer period of time in a positive environment without pressure to achieve .
in the netherlands , a country that also has high immigration , elementary school last for six years .
the country has autonomous schools , comparative school research , and regular achievement tests for students and teachers . the foundation of scholastic success is laid in the first few years .
nevertheless , funds are distributed inequitably .
most of the money goes to high schools and universities , while pre-schools and elementary schools are underfinanced . the early years are especially crucial for children from migrant or underprivileged families .
they fall through the cracks . germany should follow sweden 's example and make a new law that says students ' academic paths are n't determined before ninth grade .
and it should finally have the gall to say , like finland , that " no child should be embarrassed . " the true success in the countries that scored well in the pisa study comes from taking lasting responsibility for each individual student . " no child should be embarrassed " - that would be a real revolution in german classrooms . ramon garcia-ziemsen is dw-radio 's culture editor -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de pisa education studies come under examination germany crept up the rankings in the latest comparative international education study .

that does n't allow for identifying a pattern of development . even if you turning a blind eye to the facts that the only statistics worth believing are the one you 've doctored yourself and that educational studies can never deliver a decisive evaluation of school quality , things still do n't fit together . it remains a disaster that - in a wealthy country like germany - parents ' pocketbook still determines children 's educational path . former german chancellor willy brandt 's motto " education for all " from the 1970s was never fulfilled : the manager 's son goes to the college-prep high school while the blue collar worker 's child attends the vocational high school . it 's still often the case that children from so-called underprivileged families and children with migration backgrounds are n't fostered enough and their potential is not recognized .
this only deepens the social divide that already exists . education means participation in social development .
but when this participation is hindered , we not only have an education problem but a democracy problem as well . the supposed pisa success should n't belie the fact that the three-pillared school system is a manifestation of an antiquated social structure .
no other country begins the selection process so early .
in germany , a student 's educational path is decided in the fourth grade .
the trusted world of learning - in which good , differentiated learning takes place - is lost . nearly all german education researchers agree on the solution : learning together over a longer period of time in a positive environment without pressure to achieve .
in the netherlands , a country that also has high immigration , elementary school last for six years .
the country has autonomous schools , comparative school research , and regular achievement tests for students and teachers . the foundation of scholastic success is laid in the first few years .
nevertheless , funds are distributed inequitably .
most of the money goes to high schools and universities , while pre-schools and elementary schools are underfinanced . the early years are especially crucial for children from migrant or underprivileged families .

a new release about a make-shift family in a high-rise has attracted much praise , yet there is some suggestion that its success has as much to do with the setting as the plot . wir sagen du !
schatz -lrb- family rules -rrb- is an original idea ; it tells the story of a man , who faced with the rather triste prospect of spending christmas alone , decides to steal some relatives and subsequently barricade them , and himself , into the 17th floor of a tower block for festivities en famille . " why set it in a tower block ? " one might ask .
clearly , making the kidnapped protagonists ' prospects for escape difficult is a good plot device , but there is more to it than that .
there has been a shift in perception of high-rise blocks in recent years , and they are now seriously en-vogue among german directors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-fab landscape in the city of dresden actress hendrikje fitz believes using a pre-fab as a backdrop is a quick way for filmmakers to establish the genre and social milieu of their movies .
" you know immediately you are watching a film about people in the former east , " fitz said , " because high-rise blocks are the symbol of the gdr . " but she adds that this generation of german pre-fab movies go some way to portraying the former east germany as a kind of operetta town , so cozy and so trashy that it was a good , if weird , place to be . " it is the moderate way of depicting the gdr , " she said .
" people who lived through it do n't always want to be told they lived in a dictatorship , they want to see different aspects of what they experienced . "
by the same token , audiences who grew up in the west are fascinated by the beehive community element of tower block life sold to them as a synonym for the former eastern germany . giving humanity the hard sell what films like wir sagen du !

" audiences enjoy watching people overcome their problems , fight for their families and stave off their loneliness " holler said , " and they like to see people who live outside society 's norms . " over the years , holler 's research has taken him to countless high-rise apartments where he has come face to face with a wildly eclectic mix of people , styles and takes on life . " one lady dreamed of living in a country cottage , so she had sloping walls built into her flat and decked the whole place out in laura ashley .
the man next-door covered his walls in beer cans , and another guy lived in a tent pitched in his living room .

in any case , world war three has been avoided - at least for now . writing on wednesday , dec .
5 , from munich , the süddeutsche zeitung said the recent us report , which stated that iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 , was intended to avoid a mistake similar to the invasion of iraq in 2001 . " the domestic consequences of the reversal are incalculable , " continued the paper .
" the distrust will now intensify in favor of the democrats .

" in iran , all of the political camps will have to attentively follow the developments , " wrote the paper .
" parliamentary elections are next year and the policy of the west will help decide how the advocates of reform fair . " other newspapers focused on the effects the latest intelligence report will have on peace elsewhere in the middle east . while some , especially israel , concentrated on the news that iran indeed had a nuclear weapons program prior to 2003 , others saw the new information as " a success for diplomacy that sweeps all military options off the table , " wrote vienna 's der standard on wednesday . " but one pillar of -lsb- the us ' -rsb- middle east policy has just collapsed - one that played a role in the israeli-palestinian peace conference in annapolis in the form of a security guarantee for israel , " concluded the paper . similarly , london 's the guardian saw the intelligence paper as a potential danger for israel . " no matter who is president in washington , israel now confronts a united american military and intelligence front declaring that the iranian nuclear issue is not urgent and probably not dangerous and rejecting an american military response , " commented the paper wednesday . bush , however , " judging by his immediate reaction to the nie -lsb- report -rsb- , will continue to be sympathetic to israel 's concerns . " in contrast , others expressed the hope that the knowledge that iran does not possess nuclear weapons could encourage negotiation and diplomacy on all sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will tehran respond to the report with a willingness to talk ?
" when we assume that tehran does n't have any military nuclear program , then , first of all , the danger of a military attack is reduced and , secondly , it means that negotiation is possible , " wrote le figaro wednesday from paris .
" a detente would also help peace in lebanon and palestine .
but tehran has to respond to washington 's open door . " from rome on tuesday , la repubblica agreed that the us would have had to make good on its promises of " terrible consequences " if iran had attacked israel - even though the us " had stuck its neck out too far " - but conceded that it can now " allow itself the liberty of not doing anything -lrb- … -rrb- and dream the dreams of reconciliation with iran and negotiations with palestine .

" the domestic consequences of the reversal are incalculable , " continued the paper .
" the distrust will now intensify in favor of the democrats . " only democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton 's popularity will suffer from the report as she had been the most outspoken against iran in her party , opined the süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report could be bad for clinton 's election campaign the berliner zeitung , writing tuesday from the german capital , said the security report would impact elections in iran as well . " in iran , all of the political camps will have to attentively follow the developments , " wrote the paper .
" parliamentary elections are next year and the policy of the west will help decide how the advocates of reform fair . " other newspapers focused on the effects the latest intelligence report will have on peace elsewhere in the middle east . while some , especially israel , concentrated on the news that iran indeed had a nuclear weapons program prior to 2003 , others saw the new information as " a success for diplomacy that sweeps all military options off the table , " wrote vienna 's der standard on wednesday . " but one pillar of -lsb- the us ' -rsb- middle east policy has just collapsed - one that played a role in the israeli-palestinian peace conference in annapolis in the form of a security guarantee for israel , " concluded the paper . similarly , london 's the guardian saw the intelligence paper as a potential danger for israel . " no matter who is president in washington , israel now confronts a united american military and intelligence front declaring that the iranian nuclear issue is not urgent and probably not dangerous and rejecting an american military response , " commented the paper wednesday . bush , however , " judging by his immediate reaction to the nie -lsb- report -rsb- , will continue to be sympathetic to israel 's concerns . " in contrast , others expressed the hope that the knowledge that iran does not possess nuclear weapons could encourage negotiation and diplomacy on all sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will tehran respond to the report with a willingness to talk ?
" when we assume that tehran does n't have any military nuclear program , then , first of all , the danger of a military attack is reduced and , secondly , it means that negotiation is possible , " wrote le figaro wednesday from paris .
" a detente would also help peace in lebanon and palestine .
but tehran has to respond to washington 's open door . " from rome on tuesday , la repubblica agreed that the us would have had to make good on its promises of " terrible consequences " if iran had attacked israel - even though the us " had stuck its neck out too far " - but conceded that it can now " allow itself the liberty of not doing anything -lrb- … -rrb- and dream the dreams of reconciliation with iran and negotiations with palestine . " after all , " the third world war that george bush had threatened last month as an inevitable reaction to iran 's nuclear bomb plans wo n't happen - at least not at the moment .

the deal is part of the town 's overall move to make a cultural comeback . in an amazing coup , down-and-out chemnitz beat stronger rivals like leipzig , dresden and stuttgart to acquire the private collection of munich gallery owner alfred gunzenhauser . the 2,945 piece collection - itself a surprise as few people knew of its existence - includes 290 artworks by new objectivist painter otto dix , numerous works by expressionists such as ernst ludwig kirchner , and more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eye for art : gunzenhauser found a home for his collection from the various cities that showed interest , which included stuttgart and berlin as well as saxony neighbors leipzig and dresden , gunzenhauser selected chemnitz as a home for his collection , after the town offered to create a permanent home for the artworks . strength in numbers the gunzenhauser museum was dedicated on dec .
1 , 2004 . " chemnitz was the first city that could offer the collection its own house , " said thomas freidrich , the gunzenhauser museum 's curator . " it is only by showing the core of the collection all together that the works can be best appreciated , " he said .
" until now , many of the paintings were unknown .
now that they are being shown together , we are realizing what an absolute treasure we have on our hands . " officials hope the creation of a world-class modern art museum will help bring back some of the former glory to chemnitz , a city with a dwindling population and 10 percent unemployment . artistic tradition in chemnitz art in chemnitz has a " long and deeply rooted " tradition , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german artists are repesented in the collection , including johannes grützke " around the end of the 19th century , business - mostly textiles - in chemnitz was booming , " he said .
" industrialists invested a lot of money in art and architecture .
as a result , art and architecture flourished . " in the 1920s , the galerie der moderne showed works by expressionists and die brücke - the most modern artists of the time . but then came the double blows of the nazis ' destruction of " degenerate art , " followed by the bleak years under communist rule , when the city became known as karl- marx stadt .
it has yet to recover , financially or culturally . yet today , the third-largest city in the struggling state of saxony is working hard to re-establish its reputation as a cultural mecca .
the city 's recently adopted motto is " chemnitz - the modern city , " - referring in part to the city 's deep roots in the modernist movements of the 1920s .
it is an image ingrid mössinger , the director of the city 's art collections , has gone to almost superhuman lengths to support . mössinger 's many coups one of mössinger 's earliest art-world successes was snagging the international blockbuster picasso and his women for chemnitz 's art museum , the kunstsammlung chemnitz .
she also conceived and curated a current show of paintings by singer-songwriter bob dylan , which will eventually travel to new york and other destinations . a " series of fortunate events " between 2002 and 2003 led to the acquisition of gunzenhauser 's collection , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building 's expressionist architecture suits the collecton , many say " it was chemnitz 's good luck that just at the time when mr. gunzenhauser was looking for a home for his works , the right people with the right means came together and made that happen , " friedrich said . first of all , mössinger got wind that the collection was available .
then she got the needed support from chemnitz 's then-mayor .
finally , a local savings bank moved out of its downtown headquarters , leaving an empty building just waiting to be renovated into a museum . a perfect match the expressionist facade of the new museum matches well with the content , friedrich says .
and in chemnitz , the collection has a chance to come into its own - moreso than if it had gone to a city with a more developed museum scene . " if he had given his collection to a gallery in munich or berlin , the collection would have barely been noticed , considering how much art those cities already have , " friedrich said .
" mr. gunzenhauser certainly wanted his collection to get the most attention possible . " not only will the collection benefit from its connection to chemnitz , but , organizers hope , chemnitz will benefit from the collection . in general , investing in art as a means of boosting the economy has become a common tactic for european cities .
among the first to do so was bilbao - and to great effect .
the industrial town in northern spain underwent a renaissance after it opened its frank gehry-designed guggenheim museum .
the phenomenon soon got the name " the bilbao effect . " possible ' bilbao effect ' " its possible chemnitz could experience some ' bilbao effect ' from this museum , " the curator conceded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid mössinger was first to bring dylan paintings to the public " in terms of being an art city , chemnitz has been behind dresden and leipzig up to now .
but through the gunzenhauser collection , i imagine that the tables have turned , and now people will recognize chemnitz as a serious city of art and culture … .
we are expecting tourism to improve here as a result . " friedrich added that since the museum opened , he has been deluged by requests for information about how to get to the city , museum opening hours , catalogs , and people wanting to know how to give coupons for exhibit tickets as christmas presents . but whether the positive effect will be long-term or short-lived remains to be seen , he said . " of course , we 'll do our best to see that it lasts .
the collection certainly has enough potential to stay fresh for the long term . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in any case , world war three has been avoided - at least for now . writing on wednesday , dec .
5 , from munich , the süddeutsche zeitung said the recent us report , which stated that iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 , was intended to avoid a mistake similar to the invasion of iraq in 2001 . " the domestic consequences of the reversal are incalculable , " continued the paper .
" the distrust will now intensify in favor of the democrats . " only democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton 's popularity will suffer from the report as she had been the most outspoken against iran in her party , opined the süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report could be bad for clinton 's election campaign the berliner zeitung , writing tuesday from the german capital , said the security report would impact elections in iran as well . " in iran , all of the political camps will have to attentively follow the developments , " wrote the paper .
" parliamentary elections are next year and the policy of the west will help decide how the advocates of reform fair . " other newspapers focused on the effects the latest intelligence report will have on peace elsewhere in the middle east . while some , especially israel , concentrated on the news that iran indeed had a nuclear weapons program prior to 2003 , others saw the new information as " a success for diplomacy that sweeps all military options off the table , " wrote vienna 's der standard on wednesday . " but one pillar of -lsb- the us ' -rsb- middle east policy has just collapsed - one that played a role in the israeli-palestinian peace conference in annapolis in the form of a security guarantee for israel , " concluded the paper . similarly , london 's the guardian saw the intelligence paper as a potential danger for israel . " no matter who is president in washington , israel now confronts a united american military and intelligence front declaring that the iranian nuclear issue is not urgent and probably not dangerous and rejecting an american military response , " commented the paper wednesday . bush , however , " judging by his immediate reaction to the nie -lsb- report -rsb- , will continue to be sympathetic to israel 's concerns . " in contrast , others expressed the hope that the knowledge that iran does not possess nuclear weapons could encourage negotiation and diplomacy on all sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will tehran respond to the report with a willingness to talk ?
" when we assume that tehran does n't have any military nuclear program , then , first of all , the danger of a military attack is reduced and , secondly , it means that negotiation is possible , " wrote le figaro wednesday from paris .
" a detente would also help peace in lebanon and palestine .
but tehran has to respond to washington 's open door . " from rome on tuesday , la repubblica agreed that the us would have had to make good on its promises of " terrible consequences " if iran had attacked israel - even though the us " had stuck its neck out too far " - but conceded that it can now " allow itself the liberty of not doing anything -lrb- … -rrb- and dream the dreams of reconciliation with iran and negotiations with palestine .

but dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen puts pisa to the test and takes a closer look at the state of education in germany . once upon a time , people thought of the town in italy and of vacation when they heard the word " pisa . "
they thought of cappuccinos , of a building that adamantly refuses to fall over , of bella italia . then the first pisa study 's results came out in 2001 and nothing in german education was bella .
germany , the land of poets and philosophers , had regressed .
its students rated average to poor - a disgrace for old europe that the us tested ahead of germany . but now everything seems to be fine again .
the new pisa study shows - at first glance - that german students have caught up .
education policy-makers are patting each other on the back ; such an accomplishment inevitably involves a lot of them . and it 's true : the first pisa study got things going and generated productive concern .
the german philology association calls the most recent pisa study " proof of the innovative power and reformability " of german schools . but is that really the case ?
let 's take a closer look : the newest pisa study can hardly be compared with its predecessors .
in the 2001 results , testing focused on reading comprehension , but in 2003 it was heavy on math and now the emphasis is on the natural sciences .
that does n't allow for identifying a pattern of development . even if you turning a blind eye to the facts that the only statistics worth believing are the one you 've doctored yourself and that educational studies can never deliver a decisive evaluation of school quality , things still do n't fit together . it remains a disaster that - in a wealthy country like germany - parents ' pocketbook still determines children 's educational path . former german chancellor willy brandt 's motto " education for all " from the 1970s was never fulfilled : the manager 's son goes to the college-prep high school while the blue collar worker 's child attends the vocational high school . it 's still often the case that children from so-called underprivileged families and children with migration backgrounds are n't fostered enough and their potential is not recognized .
this only deepens the social divide that already exists . education means participation in social development .
but when this participation is hindered , we not only have an education problem but a democracy problem as well . the supposed pisa success should n't belie the fact that the three-pillared school system is a manifestation of an antiquated social structure .
no other country begins the selection process so early .
in germany , a student 's educational path is decided in the fourth grade .
the trusted world of learning - in which good , differentiated learning takes place - is lost . nearly all german education researchers agree on the solution : learning together over a longer period of time in a positive environment without pressure to achieve .
in the netherlands , a country that also has high immigration , elementary school last for six years .
the country has autonomous schools , comparative school research , and regular achievement tests for students and teachers . the foundation of scholastic success is laid in the first few years .
nevertheless , funds are distributed inequitably .
most of the money goes to high schools and universities , while pre-schools and elementary schools are underfinanced . the early years are especially crucial for children from migrant or underprivileged families .
they fall through the cracks . germany should follow sweden 's example and make a new law that says students ' academic paths are n't determined before ninth grade .
and it should finally have the gall to say , like finland , that " no child should be embarrassed .

but dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen puts pisa to the test and takes a closer look at the state of education in germany . once upon a time , people thought of the town in italy and of vacation when they heard the word " pisa . "
they thought of cappuccinos , of a building that adamantly refuses to fall over , of bella italia . then the first pisa study 's results came out in 2001 and nothing in german education was bella .
germany , the land of poets and philosophers , had regressed .
its students rated average to poor - a disgrace for old europe that the us tested ahead of germany . but now everything seems to be fine again .
the new pisa study shows - at first glance - that german students have caught up .
education policy-makers are patting each other on the back ; such an accomplishment inevitably involves a lot of them . and it 's true : the first pisa study got things going and generated productive concern .
the german philology association calls the most recent pisa study " proof of the innovative power and reformability " of german schools . but is that really the case ?
let 's take a closer look : the newest pisa study can hardly be compared with its predecessors .
in the 2001 results , testing focused on reading comprehension , but in 2003 it was heavy on math and now the emphasis is on the natural sciences .
that does n't allow for identifying a pattern of development . even if you turning a blind eye to the facts that the only statistics worth believing are the one you 've doctored yourself and that educational studies can never deliver a decisive evaluation of school quality , things still do n't fit together . it remains a disaster that - in a wealthy country like germany - parents ' pocketbook still determines children 's educational path . former german chancellor willy brandt 's motto " education for all " from the 1970s was never fulfilled : the manager 's son goes to the college-prep high school while the blue collar worker 's child attends the vocational high school . it 's still often the case that children from so-called underprivileged families and children with migration backgrounds are n't fostered enough and their potential is not recognized .
this only deepens the social divide that already exists . education means participation in social development .
but when this participation is hindered , we not only have an education problem but a democracy problem as well . the supposed pisa success should n't belie the fact that the three-pillared school system is a manifestation of an antiquated social structure .
no other country begins the selection process so early .
in germany , a student 's educational path is decided in the fourth grade .
the trusted world of learning - in which good , differentiated learning takes place - is lost . nearly all german education researchers agree on the solution : learning together over a longer period of time in a positive environment without pressure to achieve .
in the netherlands , a country that also has high immigration , elementary school last for six years .
the country has autonomous schools , comparative school research , and regular achievement tests for students and teachers . the foundation of scholastic success is laid in the first few years .
nevertheless , funds are distributed inequitably .

5 , convicted three men of backing the terrorist network al qaeda and sentenced them to jail terms between three and a half and seven years . after a trial that lasted over one and a half years , the düsseldorf court declared the men guilty of supporting al qaeda and attempting to raise funds for the organization through massive insurance fraud . the court sentenced the 32-year-old principle defendant , ibrahim mohamed k. , to seven years imprisonment for membership in a terrorist organization and attempted fraud in 28 cases .
yasser abu s. received a six-year sentence for the same crimes .

5 , on a comprehensive package to slash germany 's greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent before 2020 . the multi-billion-euro plan calls for more energy efficiency , a greater use of renewable energy and new insulation standards for buildings . the program is designed to limit additional financial burdens on consumers , who are ultimately supposed to benefit from a reduction in energy use . another goal of the plan is to rely on renewable energy sources or highly efficient heat and power plants to generate half of the country 's total power needs by 2020 .
the generation of heat from renewable sources is also to increase from 6 percent to 14 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more power is to come from renewable sources " i think this is the biggest and most ambitious set of laws and guidelines you 'll find anywhere in the world , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel told reporters after the cabinet meeting . start for climate protection the plan is also intended to send a signal to the un climate change conference currently taking place on the indonesian island of bali to discuss a replacement for the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 . the 14-point package is the first phase of an overall 29-point program that the government outlined in august .
the remaining 15 measures , including stricter controls on vehicle emissions , are up for approval in may 2008 and may also include a co2 tax on trucks . germany is the world 's sixth largest emitter of greenhouse gases and europe 's biggest polluter .
the country accounts for 3.19 percent of the world 's total output of carbon dioxide emissions , according to the dpa news agency . the government 's new plan aims to cut back co2 emissions by 220 million tons by 2020 . german reductions in co2 emissions have stagnated since the mid-1990s , according to reuters news service .
the 18-percent reduction achieved since 1990 is primarily due to the end of heavily polluting industry in the former east germany , which was largely cleaned up after german reunification . criticism continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has made the climate a priority the environmental organization greenpeace has said the german government is not doing enough and criticized the endorsement of over 20 new coal-burning power plants , reuters reported .
supporters say the new plants are cleaner than older coal-fired power stations and are needed to fill the power void as nuclear plants are phased out . the environmental group said that if all the planned power plants were actually built - six are currently under construction - the country would not be able to meet its target of cutting co2 by 40 percent . opposition green party leader reinhard bütikofer called the government 's proposals " tepid " and " bogus , " according to dpa . transport and construction minister wolfgang tiefensee has cautioned that implementing the new measures will not be easy , but he stressed that germany must take a leading role in climate protection in the european union . the total cost of the new measures is estimated to be around 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 45.5 billion -rrb- , while energy savings are supposed to amount to around 36 billion euros by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 , on a comprehensive package to slash germany 's greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent before 2020 . the multi-billion-euro plan calls for more energy efficiency , a greater use of renewable energy and new insulation standards for buildings . the program is designed to limit additional financial burdens on consumers , who are ultimately supposed to benefit from a reduction in energy use . another goal of the plan is to rely on renewable energy sources or highly efficient heat and power plants to generate half of the country 's total power needs by 2020 .
the generation of heat from renewable sources is also to increase from 6 percent to 14 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more power is to come from renewable sources " i think this is the biggest and most ambitious set of laws and guidelines you 'll find anywhere in the world , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel told reporters after the cabinet meeting . start for climate protection the plan is also intended to send a signal to the un climate change conference currently taking place on the indonesian island of bali to discuss a replacement for the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 . the 14-point package is the first phase of an overall 29-point program that the government outlined in august .
the remaining 15 measures , including stricter controls on vehicle emissions , are up for approval in may 2008 and may also include a co2 tax on trucks . germany is the world 's sixth largest emitter of greenhouse gases and europe 's biggest polluter .
the country accounts for 3.19 percent of the world 's total output of carbon dioxide emissions , according to the dpa news agency . the government 's new plan aims to cut back co2 emissions by 220 million tons by 2020 . german reductions in co2 emissions have stagnated since the mid-1990s , according to reuters news service .
the 18-percent reduction achieved since 1990 is primarily due to the end of heavily polluting industry in the former east germany , which was largely cleaned up after german reunification . criticism continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has made the climate a priority the environmental organization greenpeace has said the german government is not doing enough and criticized the endorsement of over 20 new coal-burning power plants , reuters reported .
supporters say the new plants are cleaner than older coal-fired power stations and are needed to fill the power void as nuclear plants are phased out . the environmental group said that if all the planned power plants were actually built - six are currently under construction - the country would not be able to meet its target of cutting co2 by 40 percent . opposition green party leader reinhard bütikofer called the government 's proposals " tepid " and " bogus , " according to dpa . transport and construction minister wolfgang tiefensee has cautioned that implementing the new measures will not be easy , but he stressed that germany must take a leading role in climate protection in the european union . the total cost of the new measures is estimated to be around 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 45.5 billion -rrb- , while energy savings are supposed to amount to around 36 billion euros by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 05.12.2007 the rise of the high rise in german film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living the high life german film , it seems , loves pre-fabs .
a new release about a make-shift family in a high-rise has attracted much praise , yet there is some suggestion that its success has as much to do with the setting as the plot . wir sagen du !
schatz -lrb- family rules -rrb- is an original idea ; it tells the story of a man , who faced with the rather triste prospect of spending christmas alone , decides to steal some relatives and subsequently barricade them , and himself , into the 17th floor of a tower block for festivities en famille . " why set it in a tower block ? " one might ask .
clearly , making the kidnapped protagonists ' prospects for escape difficult is a good plot device , but there is more to it than that .
there has been a shift in perception of high-rise blocks in recent years , and they are now seriously en-vogue among german directors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-fab landscape in the city of dresden actress hendrikje fitz believes using a pre-fab as a backdrop is a quick way for filmmakers to establish the genre and social milieu of their movies .
" you know immediately you are watching a film about people in the former east , " fitz said , " because high-rise blocks are the symbol of the gdr . " but she adds that this generation of german pre-fab movies go some way to portraying the former east germany as a kind of operetta town , so cozy and so trashy that it was a good , if weird , place to be . " it is the moderate way of depicting the gdr , " she said .
" people who lived through it do n't always want to be told they lived in a dictatorship , they want to see different aspects of what they experienced . "
by the same token , audiences who grew up in the west are fascinated by the beehive community element of tower block life sold to them as a synonym for the former eastern germany . giving humanity the hard sell what films like wir sagen du !
schatz , halbe treppe -lrb- grill point -rrb- or du bist nicht allein , another high-rise picture released earlier this year , offer their viewers is good-old fashioned humanity wrapped up in a mix of gritty reality , romanticism and comedy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from bernd böhlich 's ' du bist nicht allein ' lothar holler , set designer on films such as sonnenallee and goodbye lenin , says humanity and a feeling of sticking together are the key ingredients of pre-fab movies .
" audiences enjoy watching people overcome their problems , fight for their families and stave off their loneliness " holler said , " and they like to see people who live outside society 's norms . " over the years , holler 's research has taken him to countless high-rise apartments where he has come face to face with a wildly eclectic mix of people , styles and takes on life . " one lady dreamed of living in a country cottage , so she had sloping walls built into her flat and decked the whole place out in laura ashley .
the man next-door covered his walls in beer cans , and another guy lived in a tent pitched in his living room .

a new release about a make-shift family in a high-rise has attracted much praise , yet there is some suggestion that its success has as much to do with the setting as the plot . wir sagen du !
schatz -lrb- family rules -rrb- is an original idea ; it tells the story of a man , who faced with the rather triste prospect of spending christmas alone , decides to steal some relatives and subsequently barricade them , and himself , into the 17th floor of a tower block for festivities en famille . " why set it in a tower block ? " one might ask .
clearly , making the kidnapped protagonists ' prospects for escape difficult is a good plot device , but there is more to it than that .
there has been a shift in perception of high-rise blocks in recent years , and they are now seriously en-vogue among german directors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-fab landscape in the city of dresden actress hendrikje fitz believes using a pre-fab as a backdrop is a quick way for filmmakers to establish the genre and social milieu of their movies .
" you know immediately you are watching a film about people in the former east , " fitz said , " because high-rise blocks are the symbol of the gdr . " but she adds that this generation of german pre-fab movies go some way to portraying the former east germany as a kind of operetta town , so cozy and so trashy that it was a good , if weird , place to be . " it is the moderate way of depicting the gdr , " she said .
" people who lived through it do n't always want to be told they lived in a dictatorship , they want to see different aspects of what they experienced . "
by the same token , audiences who grew up in the west are fascinated by the beehive community element of tower block life sold to them as a synonym for the former eastern germany . giving humanity the hard sell what films like wir sagen du !
schatz , halbe treppe -lrb- grill point -rrb- or du bist nicht allein , another high-rise picture released earlier this year , offer their viewers is good-old fashioned humanity wrapped up in a mix of gritty reality , romanticism and comedy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from bernd böhlich 's ' du bist nicht allein ' lothar holler , set designer on films such as sonnenallee and goodbye lenin , says humanity and a feeling of sticking together are the key ingredients of pre-fab movies .
" audiences enjoy watching people overcome their problems , fight for their families and stave off their loneliness " holler said , " and they like to see people who live outside society 's norms . " over the years , holler 's research has taken him to countless high-rise apartments where he has come face to face with a wildly eclectic mix of people , styles and takes on life . " one lady dreamed of living in a country cottage , so she had sloping walls built into her flat and decked the whole place out in laura ashley .
the man next-door covered his walls in beer cans , and another guy lived in a tent pitched in his living room . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film halbe treppe von dresen holler says these are the little worlds he tries to recreate on screen , not only because they mirror reality , but because they are what audiences want to see .
" where we conform , these on-screen personas do n't , " he said " and their ' anything is possible ' mentality makes them exotic and hence very appealing . " living together , sticking together oliver mielke recently co-wrote , produced and directed a movie set in a pre-fab landscape .

the deal is part of the town 's overall move to make a cultural comeback . in an amazing coup , down-and-out chemnitz beat stronger rivals like leipzig , dresden and stuttgart to acquire the private collection of munich gallery owner alfred gunzenhauser . the 2,945 piece collection - itself a surprise as few people knew of its existence - includes 290 artworks by new objectivist painter otto dix , numerous works by expressionists such as ernst ludwig kirchner , and more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eye for art : gunzenhauser found a home for his collection from the various cities that showed interest , which included stuttgart and berlin as well as saxony neighbors leipzig and dresden , gunzenhauser selected chemnitz as a home for his collection , after the town offered to create a permanent home for the artworks . strength in numbers the gunzenhauser museum was dedicated on dec .
1 , 2004 . " chemnitz was the first city that could offer the collection its own house , " said thomas freidrich , the gunzenhauser museum 's curator . " it is only by showing the core of the collection all together that the works can be best appreciated , " he said .
" until now , many of the paintings were unknown .
now that they are being shown together , we are realizing what an absolute treasure we have on our hands . " officials hope the creation of a world-class modern art museum will help bring back some of the former glory to chemnitz , a city with a dwindling population and 10 percent unemployment . artistic tradition in chemnitz art in chemnitz has a " long and deeply rooted " tradition , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german artists are repesented in the collection , including johannes grützke " around the end of the 19th century , business - mostly textiles - in chemnitz was booming , " he said .
" industrialists invested a lot of money in art and architecture .
as a result , art and architecture flourished . " in the 1920s , the galerie der moderne showed works by expressionists and die brücke - the most modern artists of the time . but then came the double blows of the nazis ' destruction of " degenerate art , " followed by the bleak years under communist rule , when the city became known as karl- marx stadt .
it has yet to recover , financially or culturally . yet today , the third-largest city in the struggling state of saxony is working hard to re-establish its reputation as a cultural mecca .
the city 's recently adopted motto is " chemnitz - the modern city , " - referring in part to the city 's deep roots in the modernist movements of the 1920s .
it is an image ingrid mössinger , the director of the city 's art collections , has gone to almost superhuman lengths to support . mössinger 's many coups one of mössinger 's earliest art-world successes was snagging the international blockbuster picasso and his women for chemnitz 's art museum , the kunstsammlung chemnitz .
she also conceived and curated a current show of paintings by singer-songwriter bob dylan , which will eventually travel to new york and other destinations . a " series of fortunate events " between 2002 and 2003 led to the acquisition of gunzenhauser 's collection , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building 's expressionist architecture suits the collecton , many say " it was chemnitz 's good luck that just at the time when mr. gunzenhauser was looking for a home for his works , the right people with the right means came together and made that happen , " friedrich said . first of all , mössinger got wind that the collection was available .
then she got the needed support from chemnitz 's then-mayor .
finally , a local savings bank moved out of its downtown headquarters , leaving an empty building just waiting to be renovated into a museum . a perfect match the expressionist facade of the new museum matches well with the content , friedrich says .
and in chemnitz , the collection has a chance to come into its own - moreso than if it had gone to a city with a more developed museum scene . " if he had given his collection to a gallery in munich or berlin , the collection would have barely been noticed , considering how much art those cities already have , " friedrich said .
" mr. gunzenhauser certainly wanted his collection to get the most attention possible . " not only will the collection benefit from its connection to chemnitz , but , organizers hope , chemnitz will benefit from the collection . in general , investing in art as a means of boosting the economy has become a common tactic for european cities .
among the first to do so was bilbao - and to great effect .
the industrial town in northern spain underwent a renaissance after it opened its frank gehry-designed guggenheim museum .
the phenomenon soon got the name " the bilbao effect . " possible ' bilbao effect ' " its possible chemnitz could experience some ' bilbao effect ' from this museum , " the curator conceded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid mössinger was first to bring dylan paintings to the public " in terms of being an art city , chemnitz has been behind dresden and leipzig up to now .
but through the gunzenhauser collection , i imagine that the tables have turned , and now people will recognize chemnitz as a serious city of art and culture … .
we are expecting tourism to improve here as a result . " friedrich added that since the museum opened , he has been deluged by requests for information about how to get to the city , museum opening hours , catalogs , and people wanting to know how to give coupons for exhibit tickets as christmas presents . but whether the positive effect will be long-term or short-lived remains to be seen , he said . " of course , we 'll do our best to see that it lasts .
the collection certainly has enough potential to stay fresh for the long term . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there remains a cause for concern , " the spokesman said , two days after a us intelligence assessment concluded that tehran appeared to have suspended its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
at the same time , wilhelm said an offer of cooperation with iran remained in force if the government there agreed to halt enrichment , which some nations in the west fear is geared towards making a bomb .
" the findings -lrb- of the report -rrb- confirm what the german government has always said - that diplomatic negotiations are promising , " wilhelm told a press conference .
" but you also know the reality that two un security council resolutions have not been followed and that iran has not yet stopped its uranium enrichment program . "
diplomatic pressure must therefore be maintained on iran , along with a readiness to cooperate with the islamic republic if it agrees to halt enrichment , wilhelm added .
report leads to calls for a halt to sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national security adviser hadley announced the report the us report released monday contradicted white house warnings that iran was closing in fast on the ability to produce its own nuclear weapon .
un security council members russia and china have suggested the report lessens the need for further un sanctions against iran .
but wilhelm said : " the security council is preparing a further resolution .
it is germany 's strong belief that we should continue to work towards a diplomatic solution together with china , russia , the european union and the united states . "
us president george w. bush has said the report did not change his view that " iran was dangerous , iran is dangerous and iran will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon . "
pressure works , claims steinmeier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said that pressure had gotten results on tuesday , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the us intelligence finding proves a united stance in the international community is needed .
he said the unity of the european union , the united states , russia and china had " evidently not failed to make an impression on the political leadership in iran . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 05.12.2007 the rise of the high rise in german film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living the high life german film , it seems , loves pre-fabs .
a new release about a make-shift family in a high-rise has attracted much praise , yet there is some suggestion that its success has as much to do with the setting as the plot . wir sagen du !
schatz -lrb- family rules -rrb- is an original idea ; it tells the story of a man , who faced with the rather triste prospect of spending christmas alone , decides to steal some relatives and subsequently barricade them , and himself , into the 17th floor of a tower block for festivities en famille . " why set it in a tower block ? " one might ask .
clearly , making the kidnapped protagonists ' prospects for escape difficult is a good plot device , but there is more to it than that .
there has been a shift in perception of high-rise blocks in recent years , and they are now seriously en-vogue among german directors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-fab landscape in the city of dresden actress hendrikje fitz believes using a pre-fab as a backdrop is a quick way for filmmakers to establish the genre and social milieu of their movies .
" you know immediately you are watching a film about people in the former east , " fitz said , " because high-rise blocks are the symbol of the gdr . " but she adds that this generation of german pre-fab movies go some way to portraying the former east germany as a kind of operetta town , so cozy and so trashy that it was a good , if weird , place to be . " it is the moderate way of depicting the gdr , " she said .
" people who lived through it do n't always want to be told they lived in a dictatorship , they want to see different aspects of what they experienced . "
by the same token , audiences who grew up in the west are fascinated by the beehive community element of tower block life sold to them as a synonym for the former eastern germany . giving humanity the hard sell what films like wir sagen du !
schatz , halbe treppe -lrb- grill point -rrb- or du bist nicht allein , another high-rise picture released earlier this year , offer their viewers is good-old fashioned humanity wrapped up in a mix of gritty reality , romanticism and comedy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from bernd böhlich 's ' du bist nicht allein ' lothar holler , set designer on films such as sonnenallee and goodbye lenin , says humanity and a feeling of sticking together are the key ingredients of pre-fab movies .
" audiences enjoy watching people overcome their problems , fight for their families and stave off their loneliness " holler said , " and they like to see people who live outside society 's norms . " over the years , holler 's research has taken him to countless high-rise apartments where he has come face to face with a wildly eclectic mix of people , styles and takes on life . " one lady dreamed of living in a country cottage , so she had sloping walls built into her flat and decked the whole place out in laura ashley .
the man next-door covered his walls in beer cans , and another guy lived in a tent pitched in his living room .

a new release about a make-shift family in a high-rise has attracted much praise , yet there is some suggestion that its success has as much to do with the setting as the plot . wir sagen du !
schatz -lrb- family rules -rrb- is an original idea ; it tells the story of a man , who faced with the rather triste prospect of spending christmas alone , decides to steal some relatives and subsequently barricade them , and himself , into the 17th floor of a tower block for festivities en famille . " why set it in a tower block ? " one might ask .
clearly , making the kidnapped protagonists ' prospects for escape difficult is a good plot device , but there is more to it than that .
there has been a shift in perception of high-rise blocks in recent years , and they are now seriously en-vogue among german directors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-fab landscape in the city of dresden actress hendrikje fitz believes using a pre-fab as a backdrop is a quick way for filmmakers to establish the genre and social milieu of their movies .
" you know immediately you are watching a film about people in the former east , " fitz said , " because high-rise blocks are the symbol of the gdr . " but she adds that this generation of german pre-fab movies go some way to portraying the former east germany as a kind of operetta town , so cozy and so trashy that it was a good , if weird , place to be . " it is the moderate way of depicting the gdr , " she said .
" people who lived through it do n't always want to be told they lived in a dictatorship , they want to see different aspects of what they experienced . "
by the same token , audiences who grew up in the west are fascinated by the beehive community element of tower block life sold to them as a synonym for the former eastern germany . giving humanity the hard sell what films like wir sagen du !
schatz , halbe treppe -lrb- grill point -rrb- or du bist nicht allein , another high-rise picture released earlier this year , offer their viewers is good-old fashioned humanity wrapped up in a mix of gritty reality , romanticism and comedy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from bernd böhlich 's ' du bist nicht allein ' lothar holler , set designer on films such as sonnenallee and goodbye lenin , says humanity and a feeling of sticking together are the key ingredients of pre-fab movies .
" audiences enjoy watching people overcome their problems , fight for their families and stave off their loneliness " holler said , " and they like to see people who live outside society 's norms . " over the years , holler 's research has taken him to countless high-rise apartments where he has come face to face with a wildly eclectic mix of people , styles and takes on life . " one lady dreamed of living in a country cottage , so she had sloping walls built into her flat and decked the whole place out in laura ashley .
the man next-door covered his walls in beer cans , and another guy lived in a tent pitched in his living room . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film halbe treppe von dresen holler says these are the little worlds he tries to recreate on screen , not only because they mirror reality , but because they are what audiences want to see .
" where we conform , these on-screen personas do n't , " he said " and their ' anything is possible ' mentality makes them exotic and hence very appealing . " living together , sticking together oliver mielke recently co-wrote , produced and directed a movie set in a pre-fab landscape .

now full-grown , the vipb -lrb- very important polar bear -rrb- celebrated his first birthday - complete with cake - on wednesday , dec .
5 . it 's amazing how time flies .
it seems like just yesterday that he was melting hearts with his fluffy white fur , cuddling with his keeper and posing for photos with other hot celebs like leonardo di caprio . now our little knut is all grown up . the berlin zoo celebrated its star attraction wednesday with free entry for kids - a small sacrifice , considering that the former powder puff drew in as much as 10 million euros -lrb- $ 14.7 million -rrb- by more than doubling ticket sales over the past year .
that does n't count revenue generated by knut paraphernalia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the candles are missing on knut 's birthday cake over 2.5 million people from all over the world paid the polar bear cub a personal visit , while millions more oohed and ahhed at his pictures in the media . knut wo n't share his birthday cake the birthday boy himself reportedly celebrated his big day with a cake of ice cream , fruit and vegetables , topped off with croissants and grapes and served up by keeper thomas dörflein . knut 's life began as an 810-gram -lrb- 29-ounce -rrb- orphan when his mother abandoned him after birth .
dörflein managed to keep the rising star alive with a bottle - and the little guy became such a good eater that he had to go on a diet when his weight reached 60 kilograms -lrb- 132 pounds -rrb- in july . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in july , knut was told he had to drop a few pounds also in july , it was deemed too dangerous for dörflein to romp and wrestle with his protégé .
after all , the born carnivore has claws that would have to rip open seals and sea-lions if he lived in the wild .
now little knut is up to a whopping 110 kilograms . future uncertain for knut knut 's first year was n't all roses and seal blubber .
prior to the weight-loss program in the summer , the superstar received a death threat in april which prompted heightened police security .
in the same month he suffered from a toothache that forced him to call off public engagements .
later , in september , he hurt his right hind paw . " knut threw a tantrum when he saw me , " said veterinarian andreas ochs , who treated the injury . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut can no longer play with his keeper conservationists and animal rights purists also stirred up controversy by saying that knut should have been allowed to die naturally rather than be raised as a " half-human . " it is uncertain whether knut will be able to stay in the berlin zoo - a possibility which bear keeper heiner klös called unlikely , speaking wednesday on germany 's rbb-inforadio .
berlin already had two polar bear families and a third would be too expensive , he said . his future residence wo n't officially be decided until may , however . knut may have to pass baton of fame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut has even made it onto postage stamps in azerbaijan the berlin zoo announced at the end of november that knut may have three new siblings on the way .
his father lars reportedly impregnated all three of the female polar bears at the zoo , including knut 's mother tosca . with heavy competition coming in the cuteness department , knut 's fame may be short-lived .
but at least he 'll be in good company . reminisce over knut 's younger , fluffier days with the picture gallery below . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

few are the pint-sized performers who reach adulthood unscarred .
more common are the youthful tales of substance abuse , eating disorders and therapy , like those now faced by knut .

but dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen puts pisa to the test and takes a closer look at the state of education in germany . once upon a time , people thought of the town in italy and of vacation when they heard the word " pisa . "
they thought of cappuccinos , of a building that adamantly refuses to fall over , of bella italia . then the first pisa study 's results came out in 2001 and nothing in german education was bella .
germany , the land of poets and philosophers , had regressed .
its students rated average to poor - a disgrace for old europe that the us tested ahead of germany . but now everything seems to be fine again .
the new pisa study shows - at first glance - that german students have caught up .
education policy-makers are patting each other on the back ; such an accomplishment inevitably involves a lot of them . and it 's true : the first pisa study got things going and generated productive concern .
the german philology association calls the most recent pisa study " proof of the innovative power and reformability " of german schools . but is that really the case ?
let 's take a closer look : the newest pisa study can hardly be compared with its predecessors .
in the 2001 results , testing focused on reading comprehension , but in 2003 it was heavy on math and now the emphasis is on the natural sciences .
that does n't allow for identifying a pattern of development . even if you turning a blind eye to the facts that the only statistics worth believing are the one you 've doctored yourself and that educational studies can never deliver a decisive evaluation of school quality , things still do n't fit together . it remains a disaster that - in a wealthy country like germany - parents ' pocketbook still determines children 's educational path . former german chancellor willy brandt 's motto " education for all " from the 1970s was never fulfilled : the manager 's son goes to the college-prep high school while the blue collar worker 's child attends the vocational high school . it 's still often the case that children from so-called underprivileged families and children with migration backgrounds are n't fostered enough and their potential is not recognized .
this only deepens the social divide that already exists . education means participation in social development .
but when this participation is hindered , we not only have an education problem but a democracy problem as well . the supposed pisa success should n't belie the fact that the three-pillared school system is a manifestation of an antiquated social structure .
no other country begins the selection process so early .
in germany , a student 's educational path is decided in the fourth grade .
the trusted world of learning - in which good , differentiated learning takes place - is lost . nearly all german education researchers agree on the solution : learning together over a longer period of time in a positive environment without pressure to achieve .
in the netherlands , a country that also has high immigration , elementary school last for six years .
the country has autonomous schools , comparative school research , and regular achievement tests for students and teachers . the foundation of scholastic success is laid in the first few years .
nevertheless , funds are distributed inequitably .
most of the money goes to high schools and universities , while pre-schools and elementary schools are underfinanced . the early years are especially crucial for children from migrant or underprivileged families .
they fall through the cracks . germany should follow sweden 's example and make a new law that says students ' academic paths are n't determined before ninth grade .
and it should finally have the gall to say , like finland , that " no child should be embarrassed . " the true success in the countries that scored well in the pisa study comes from taking lasting responsibility for each individual student .

but dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen puts pisa to the test and takes a closer look at the state of education in germany . once upon a time , people thought of the town in italy and of vacation when they heard the word " pisa . "
they thought of cappuccinos , of a building that adamantly refuses to fall over , of bella italia . then the first pisa study 's results came out in 2001 and nothing in german education was bella .
germany , the land of poets and philosophers , had regressed .
its students rated average to poor - a disgrace for old europe that the us tested ahead of germany . but now everything seems to be fine again .
the new pisa study shows - at first glance - that german students have caught up .
education policy-makers are patting each other on the back ; such an accomplishment inevitably involves a lot of them . and it 's true : the first pisa study got things going and generated productive concern .
the german philology association calls the most recent pisa study " proof of the innovative power and reformability " of german schools . but is that really the case ?
let 's take a closer look : the newest pisa study can hardly be compared with its predecessors .
in the 2001 results , testing focused on reading comprehension , but in 2003 it was heavy on math and now the emphasis is on the natural sciences .
that does n't allow for identifying a pattern of development . even if you turning a blind eye to the facts that the only statistics worth believing are the one you 've doctored yourself and that educational studies can never deliver a decisive evaluation of school quality , things still do n't fit together . it remains a disaster that - in a wealthy country like germany - parents ' pocketbook still determines children 's educational path . former german chancellor willy brandt 's motto " education for all " from the 1970s was never fulfilled : the manager 's son goes to the college-prep high school while the blue collar worker 's child attends the vocational high school . it 's still often the case that children from so-called underprivileged families and children with migration backgrounds are n't fostered enough and their potential is not recognized .
this only deepens the social divide that already exists . education means participation in social development .
but when this participation is hindered , we not only have an education problem but a democracy problem as well . the supposed pisa success should n't belie the fact that the three-pillared school system is a manifestation of an antiquated social structure .
no other country begins the selection process so early .
in germany , a student 's educational path is decided in the fourth grade .
the trusted world of learning - in which good , differentiated learning takes place - is lost . nearly all german education researchers agree on the solution : learning together over a longer period of time in a positive environment without pressure to achieve .
in the netherlands , a country that also has high immigration , elementary school last for six years .
the country has autonomous schools , comparative school research , and regular achievement tests for students and teachers . the foundation of scholastic success is laid in the first few years .
nevertheless , funds are distributed inequitably .
most of the money goes to high schools and universities , while pre-schools and elementary schools are underfinanced . the early years are especially crucial for children from migrant or underprivileged families .
they fall through the cracks . germany should follow sweden 's example and make a new law that says students ' academic paths are n't determined before ninth grade .
and it should finally have the gall to say , like finland , that " no child should be embarrassed . " the true success in the countries that scored well in the pisa study comes from taking lasting responsibility for each individual student . " no child should be embarrassed " - that would be a real revolution in german classrooms . ramon garcia-ziemsen is dw-radio 's culture editor -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 , on a comprehensive package to slash germany 's greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent before 2020 . the multi-billion-euro plan calls for more energy efficiency , a greater use of renewable energy and new insulation standards for buildings . the program is designed to limit additional financial burdens on consumers , who are ultimately supposed to benefit from a reduction in energy use . another goal of the plan is to rely on renewable energy sources or highly efficient heat and power plants to generate half of the country 's total power needs by 2020 .
the generation of heat from renewable sources is also to increase from 6 percent to 14 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more power is to come from renewable sources " i think this is the biggest and most ambitious set of laws and guidelines you 'll find anywhere in the world , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel told reporters after the cabinet meeting . start for climate protection the plan is also intended to send a signal to the un climate change conference currently taking place on the indonesian island of bali to discuss a replacement for the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 . the 14-point package is the first phase of an overall 29-point program that the government outlined in august .
the remaining 15 measures , including stricter controls on vehicle emissions , are up for approval in may 2008 and may also include a co2 tax on trucks . germany is the world 's sixth largest emitter of greenhouse gases and europe 's biggest polluter .
the country accounts for 3.19 percent of the world 's total output of carbon dioxide emissions , according to the dpa news agency . the government 's new plan aims to cut back co2 emissions by 220 million tons by 2020 . german reductions in co2 emissions have stagnated since the mid-1990s , according to reuters news service .
the 18-percent reduction achieved since 1990 is primarily due to the end of heavily polluting industry in the former east germany , which was largely cleaned up after german reunification . criticism continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has made the climate a priority the environmental organization greenpeace has said the german government is not doing enough and criticized the endorsement of over 20 new coal-burning power plants , reuters reported .
supporters say the new plants are cleaner than older coal-fired power stations and are needed to fill the power void as nuclear plants are phased out . the environmental group said that if all the planned power plants were actually built - six are currently under construction - the country would not be able to meet its target of cutting co2 by 40 percent . opposition green party leader reinhard bütikofer called the government 's proposals " tepid " and " bogus , " according to dpa . transport and construction minister wolfgang tiefensee has cautioned that implementing the new measures will not be easy , but he stressed that germany must take a leading role in climate protection in the european union . the total cost of the new measures is estimated to be around 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 45.5 billion -rrb- , while energy savings are supposed to amount to around 36 billion euros by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 05.12.2007 the rise of the high rise in german film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living the high life german film , it seems , loves pre-fabs .
a new release about a make-shift family in a high-rise has attracted much praise , yet there is some suggestion that its success has as much to do with the setting as the plot . wir sagen du !
schatz -lrb- family rules -rrb- is an original idea ; it tells the story of a man , who faced with the rather triste prospect of spending christmas alone , decides to steal some relatives and subsequently barricade them , and himself , into the 17th floor of a tower block for festivities en famille . " why set it in a tower block ? " one might ask .
clearly , making the kidnapped protagonists ' prospects for escape difficult is a good plot device , but there is more to it than that .
there has been a shift in perception of high-rise blocks in recent years , and they are now seriously en-vogue among german directors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-fab landscape in the city of dresden actress hendrikje fitz believes using a pre-fab as a backdrop is a quick way for filmmakers to establish the genre and social milieu of their movies .
" you know immediately you are watching a film about people in the former east , " fitz said , " because high-rise blocks are the symbol of the gdr . " but she adds that this generation of german pre-fab movies go some way to portraying the former east germany as a kind of operetta town , so cozy and so trashy that it was a good , if weird , place to be . " it is the moderate way of depicting the gdr , " she said .
" people who lived through it do n't always want to be told they lived in a dictatorship , they want to see different aspects of what they experienced . "
by the same token , audiences who grew up in the west are fascinated by the beehive community element of tower block life sold to them as a synonym for the former eastern germany . giving humanity the hard sell what films like wir sagen du !
schatz , halbe treppe -lrb- grill point -rrb- or du bist nicht allein , another high-rise picture released earlier this year , offer their viewers is good-old fashioned humanity wrapped up in a mix of gritty reality , romanticism and comedy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from bernd böhlich 's ' du bist nicht allein ' lothar holler , set designer on films such as sonnenallee and goodbye lenin , says humanity and a feeling of sticking together are the key ingredients of pre-fab movies .
" audiences enjoy watching people overcome their problems , fight for their families and stave off their loneliness " holler said , " and they like to see people who live outside society 's norms . " over the years , holler 's research has taken him to countless high-rise apartments where he has come face to face with a wildly eclectic mix of people , styles and takes on life . " one lady dreamed of living in a country cottage , so she had sloping walls built into her flat and decked the whole place out in laura ashley .
the man next-door covered his walls in beer cans , and another guy lived in a tent pitched in his living room . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film halbe treppe von dresen holler says these are the little worlds he tries to recreate on screen , not only because they mirror reality , but because they are what audiences want to see .
" where we conform , these on-screen personas do n't , " he said " and their ' anything is possible ' mentality makes them exotic and hence very appealing . " living together , sticking together oliver mielke recently co-wrote , produced and directed a movie set in a pre-fab landscape .
ossis eleven , which is due for release early next year , is a comedy about the benefits of sticking together . mielke , who grew up in western germany and had little experience of tower blocks until he began to research them for his film , says he chose a high-rise location because he wanted to help dispel the prejudice which surrounds them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the positive face of a pre-fab " the clichés of high-rise living are deeply engrained in our minds , " he said , " but in actual fact the atmosphere is n't negative at all . " what stood out for mielke was the extent to which people stick together to organize their lives and the astonishing mix of characters who live on top of one another in a clearly defined space . " where else are you going to find a victim of a gdr doping scandal living next to an ex-stasi informer who lives next to a know-it-all west german ? " he asked .

the deal is part of the town 's overall move to make a cultural comeback . in an amazing coup , down-and-out chemnitz beat stronger rivals like leipzig , dresden and stuttgart to acquire the private collection of munich gallery owner alfred gunzenhauser . the 2,945 piece collection - itself a surprise as few people knew of its existence - includes 290 artworks by new objectivist painter otto dix , numerous works by expressionists such as ernst ludwig kirchner , and more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eye for art : gunzenhauser found a home for his collection from the various cities that showed interest , which included stuttgart and berlin as well as saxony neighbors leipzig and dresden , gunzenhauser selected chemnitz as a home for his collection , after the town offered to create a permanent home for the artworks . strength in numbers the gunzenhauser museum was dedicated on dec .
1 , 2004 . " chemnitz was the first city that could offer the collection its own house , " said thomas freidrich , the gunzenhauser museum 's curator . " it is only by showing the core of the collection all together that the works can be best appreciated , " he said .
" until now , many of the paintings were unknown .
now that they are being shown together , we are realizing what an absolute treasure we have on our hands . " officials hope the creation of a world-class modern art museum will help bring back some of the former glory to chemnitz , a city with a dwindling population and 10 percent unemployment . artistic tradition in chemnitz art in chemnitz has a " long and deeply rooted " tradition , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german artists are repesented in the collection , including johannes grützke " around the end of the 19th century , business - mostly textiles - in chemnitz was booming , " he said .
" industrialists invested a lot of money in art and architecture .
as a result , art and architecture flourished . " in the 1920s , the galerie der moderne showed works by expressionists and die brücke - the most modern artists of the time . but then came the double blows of the nazis ' destruction of " degenerate art , " followed by the bleak years under communist rule , when the city became known as karl- marx stadt .
it has yet to recover , financially or culturally . yet today , the third-largest city in the struggling state of saxony is working hard to re-establish its reputation as a cultural mecca .
the city 's recently adopted motto is " chemnitz - the modern city , " - referring in part to the city 's deep roots in the modernist movements of the 1920s .
it is an image ingrid mössinger , the director of the city 's art collections , has gone to almost superhuman lengths to support . mössinger 's many coups one of mössinger 's earliest art-world successes was snagging the international blockbuster picasso and his women for chemnitz 's art museum , the kunstsammlung chemnitz .
she also conceived and curated a current show of paintings by singer-songwriter bob dylan , which will eventually travel to new york and other destinations . a " series of fortunate events " between 2002 and 2003 led to the acquisition of gunzenhauser 's collection , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building 's expressionist architecture suits the collecton , many say " it was chemnitz 's good luck that just at the time when mr. gunzenhauser was looking for a home for his works , the right people with the right means came together and made that happen , " friedrich said . first of all , mössinger got wind that the collection was available .
then she got the needed support from chemnitz 's then-mayor .
finally , a local savings bank moved out of its downtown headquarters , leaving an empty building just waiting to be renovated into a museum . a perfect match the expressionist facade of the new museum matches well with the content , friedrich says .
and in chemnitz , the collection has a chance to come into its own - moreso than if it had gone to a city with a more developed museum scene . " if he had given his collection to a gallery in munich or berlin , the collection would have barely been noticed , considering how much art those cities already have , " friedrich said .
" mr. gunzenhauser certainly wanted his collection to get the most attention possible . " not only will the collection benefit from its connection to chemnitz , but , organizers hope , chemnitz will benefit from the collection . in general , investing in art as a means of boosting the economy has become a common tactic for european cities .
among the first to do so was bilbao - and to great effect .
the industrial town in northern spain underwent a renaissance after it opened its frank gehry-designed guggenheim museum .
the phenomenon soon got the name " the bilbao effect . " possible ' bilbao effect ' " its possible chemnitz could experience some ' bilbao effect ' from this museum , " the curator conceded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid mössinger was first to bring dylan paintings to the public " in terms of being an art city , chemnitz has been behind dresden and leipzig up to now .
but through the gunzenhauser collection , i imagine that the tables have turned , and now people will recognize chemnitz as a serious city of art and culture … .
we are expecting tourism to improve here as a result . " friedrich added that since the museum opened , he has been deluged by requests for information about how to get to the city , museum opening hours , catalogs , and people wanting to know how to give coupons for exhibit tickets as christmas presents . but whether the positive effect will be long-term or short-lived remains to be seen , he said . " of course , we 'll do our best to see that it lasts .
the collection certainly has enough potential to stay fresh for the long term . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal is part of the town 's overall move to make a cultural comeback . in an amazing coup , down-and-out chemnitz beat stronger rivals like leipzig , dresden and stuttgart to acquire the private collection of munich gallery owner alfred gunzenhauser . the 2,945 piece collection - itself a surprise as few people knew of its existence - includes 290 artworks by new objectivist painter otto dix , numerous works by expressionists such as ernst ludwig kirchner , and more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eye for art : gunzenhauser found a home for his collection from the various cities that showed interest , which included stuttgart and berlin as well as saxony neighbors leipzig and dresden , gunzenhauser selected chemnitz as a home for his collection , after the town offered to create a permanent home for the artworks . strength in numbers the gunzenhauser museum was dedicated on dec .
1 , 2004 . " chemnitz was the first city that could offer the collection its own house , " said thomas freidrich , the gunzenhauser museum 's curator . " it is only by showing the core of the collection all together that the works can be best appreciated , " he said .
" until now , many of the paintings were unknown .
now that they are being shown together , we are realizing what an absolute treasure we have on our hands . " officials hope the creation of a world-class modern art museum will help bring back some of the former glory to chemnitz , a city with a dwindling population and 10 percent unemployment . artistic tradition in chemnitz art in chemnitz has a " long and deeply rooted " tradition , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german artists are repesented in the collection , including johannes grützke " around the end of the 19th century , business - mostly textiles - in chemnitz was booming , " he said .
" industrialists invested a lot of money in art and architecture .
as a result , art and architecture flourished . " in the 1920s , the galerie der moderne showed works by expressionists and die brücke - the most modern artists of the time . but then came the double blows of the nazis ' destruction of " degenerate art , " followed by the bleak years under communist rule , when the city became known as karl- marx stadt .
it has yet to recover , financially or culturally . yet today , the third-largest city in the struggling state of saxony is working hard to re-establish its reputation as a cultural mecca .
the city 's recently adopted motto is " chemnitz - the modern city , " - referring in part to the city 's deep roots in the modernist movements of the 1920s .
it is an image ingrid mössinger , the director of the city 's art collections , has gone to almost superhuman lengths to support . mössinger 's many coups one of mössinger 's earliest art-world successes was snagging the international blockbuster picasso and his women for chemnitz 's art museum , the kunstsammlung chemnitz .
she also conceived and curated a current show of paintings by singer-songwriter bob dylan , which will eventually travel to new york and other destinations . a " series of fortunate events " between 2002 and 2003 led to the acquisition of gunzenhauser 's collection , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building 's expressionist architecture suits the collecton , many say " it was chemnitz 's good luck that just at the time when mr. gunzenhauser was looking for a home for his works , the right people with the right means came together and made that happen , " friedrich said . first of all , mössinger got wind that the collection was available .
then she got the needed support from chemnitz 's then-mayor .
finally , a local savings bank moved out of its downtown headquarters , leaving an empty building just waiting to be renovated into a museum . a perfect match the expressionist facade of the new museum matches well with the content , friedrich says .
and in chemnitz , the collection has a chance to come into its own - moreso than if it had gone to a city with a more developed museum scene . " if he had given his collection to a gallery in munich or berlin , the collection would have barely been noticed , considering how much art those cities already have , " friedrich said .
" mr. gunzenhauser certainly wanted his collection to get the most attention possible . " not only will the collection benefit from its connection to chemnitz , but , organizers hope , chemnitz will benefit from the collection . in general , investing in art as a means of boosting the economy has become a common tactic for european cities .
among the first to do so was bilbao - and to great effect .
the industrial town in northern spain underwent a renaissance after it opened its frank gehry-designed guggenheim museum .
the phenomenon soon got the name " the bilbao effect . " possible ' bilbao effect ' " its possible chemnitz could experience some ' bilbao effect ' from this museum , " the curator conceded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid mössinger was first to bring dylan paintings to the public " in terms of being an art city , chemnitz has been behind dresden and leipzig up to now .
but through the gunzenhauser collection , i imagine that the tables have turned , and now people will recognize chemnitz as a serious city of art and culture … .
we are expecting tourism to improve here as a result . " friedrich added that since the museum opened , he has been deluged by requests for information about how to get to the city , museum opening hours , catalogs , and people wanting to know how to give coupons for exhibit tickets as christmas presents . but whether the positive effect will be long-term or short-lived remains to be seen , he said . " of course , we 'll do our best to see that it lasts .
the collection certainly has enough potential to stay fresh for the long term . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there remains a cause for concern , " the spokesman said , two days after a us intelligence assessment concluded that tehran appeared to have suspended its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
at the same time , wilhelm said an offer of cooperation with iran remained in force if the government there agreed to halt enrichment , which some nations in the west fear is geared towards making a bomb .
" the findings -lrb- of the report -rrb- confirm what the german government has always said - that diplomatic negotiations are promising , " wilhelm told a press conference .
" but you also know the reality that two un security council resolutions have not been followed and that iran has not yet stopped its uranium enrichment program . "
diplomatic pressure must therefore be maintained on iran , along with a readiness to cooperate with the islamic republic if it agrees to halt enrichment , wilhelm added .
report leads to calls for a halt to sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national security adviser hadley announced the report the us report released monday contradicted white house warnings that iran was closing in fast on the ability to produce its own nuclear weapon .
un security council members russia and china have suggested the report lessens the need for further un sanctions against iran .
but wilhelm said : " the security council is preparing a further resolution .
it is germany 's strong belief that we should continue to work towards a diplomatic solution together with china , russia , the european union and the united states . "
us president george w. bush has said the report did not change his view that " iran was dangerous , iran is dangerous and iran will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon . "
pressure works , claims steinmeier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said that pressure had gotten results on tuesday , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the us intelligence finding proves a united stance in the international community is needed .
he said the unity of the european union , the united states , russia and china had " evidently not failed to make an impression on the political leadership in iran . "
" i appeal to the iranian leadership to continue cooperation with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and to respond to the unanswered questions about their nuclear program promptly and comprehensively , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 05.12.2007 opinion : high pisa score masks inequality in german schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german schools have improved their international ranking , according to the most recent pisa study .
but dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen puts pisa to the test and takes a closer look at the state of education in germany . once upon a time , people thought of the town in italy and of vacation when they heard the word " pisa . "
they thought of cappuccinos , of a building that adamantly refuses to fall over , of bella italia . then the first pisa study 's results came out in 2001 and nothing in german education was bella .
germany , the land of poets and philosophers , had regressed .
its students rated average to poor - a disgrace for old europe that the us tested ahead of germany . but now everything seems to be fine again .
the new pisa study shows - at first glance - that german students have caught up .
education policy-makers are patting each other on the back ; such an accomplishment inevitably involves a lot of them . and it 's true : the first pisa study got things going and generated productive concern .
the german philology association calls the most recent pisa study " proof of the innovative power and reformability " of german schools . but is that really the case ?
let 's take a closer look : the newest pisa study can hardly be compared with its predecessors .
in the 2001 results , testing focused on reading comprehension , but in 2003 it was heavy on math and now the emphasis is on the natural sciences .
that does n't allow for identifying a pattern of development . even if you turning a blind eye to the facts that the only statistics worth believing are the one you 've doctored yourself and that educational studies can never deliver a decisive evaluation of school quality , things still do n't fit together . it remains a disaster that - in a wealthy country like germany - parents ' pocketbook still determines children 's educational path . former german chancellor willy brandt 's motto " education for all " from the 1970s was never fulfilled : the manager 's son goes to the college-prep high school while the blue collar worker 's child attends the vocational high school . it 's still often the case that children from so-called underprivileged families and children with migration backgrounds are n't fostered enough and their potential is not recognized .
this only deepens the social divide that already exists . education means participation in social development .
but when this participation is hindered , we not only have an education problem but a democracy problem as well . the supposed pisa success should n't belie the fact that the three-pillared school system is a manifestation of an antiquated social structure .
no other country begins the selection process so early .
in germany , a student 's educational path is decided in the fourth grade .
the trusted world of learning - in which good , differentiated learning takes place - is lost . nearly all german education researchers agree on the solution : learning together over a longer period of time in a positive environment without pressure to achieve .
in the netherlands , a country that also has high immigration , elementary school last for six years .
the country has autonomous schools , comparative school research , and regular achievement tests for students and teachers . the foundation of scholastic success is laid in the first few years .
nevertheless , funds are distributed inequitably .
most of the money goes to high schools and universities , while pre-schools and elementary schools are underfinanced . the early years are especially crucial for children from migrant or underprivileged families .
they fall through the cracks . germany should follow sweden 's example and make a new law that says students ' academic paths are n't determined before ninth grade .
and it should finally have the gall to say , like finland , that " no child should be embarrassed . " the true success in the countries that scored well in the pisa study comes from taking lasting responsibility for each individual student . " no child should be embarrassed " - that would be a real revolution in german classrooms . ramon garcia-ziemsen is dw-radio 's culture editor -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal is part of the town 's overall move to make a cultural comeback . in an amazing coup , down-and-out chemnitz beat stronger rivals like leipzig , dresden and stuttgart to acquire the private collection of munich gallery owner alfred gunzenhauser . the 2,945 piece collection - itself a surprise as few people knew of its existence - includes 290 artworks by new objectivist painter otto dix , numerous works by expressionists such as ernst ludwig kirchner , and more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eye for art : gunzenhauser found a home for his collection from the various cities that showed interest , which included stuttgart and berlin as well as saxony neighbors leipzig and dresden , gunzenhauser selected chemnitz as a home for his collection , after the town offered to create a permanent home for the artworks . strength in numbers the gunzenhauser museum was dedicated on dec .
1 , 2004 . " chemnitz was the first city that could offer the collection its own house , " said thomas freidrich , the gunzenhauser museum 's curator . " it is only by showing the core of the collection all together that the works can be best appreciated , " he said .
" until now , many of the paintings were unknown .
now that they are being shown together , we are realizing what an absolute treasure we have on our hands . " officials hope the creation of a world-class modern art museum will help bring back some of the former glory to chemnitz , a city with a dwindling population and 10 percent unemployment . artistic tradition in chemnitz art in chemnitz has a " long and deeply rooted " tradition , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german artists are repesented in the collection , including johannes grützke " around the end of the 19th century , business - mostly textiles - in chemnitz was booming , " he said .
" industrialists invested a lot of money in art and architecture .
as a result , art and architecture flourished . " in the 1920s , the galerie der moderne showed works by expressionists and die brücke - the most modern artists of the time . but then came the double blows of the nazis ' destruction of " degenerate art , " followed by the bleak years under communist rule , when the city became known as karl- marx stadt .
it has yet to recover , financially or culturally . yet today , the third-largest city in the struggling state of saxony is working hard to re-establish its reputation as a cultural mecca .
the city 's recently adopted motto is " chemnitz - the modern city , " - referring in part to the city 's deep roots in the modernist movements of the 1920s .
it is an image ingrid mössinger , the director of the city 's art collections , has gone to almost superhuman lengths to support . mössinger 's many coups one of mössinger 's earliest art-world successes was snagging the international blockbuster picasso and his women for chemnitz 's art museum , the kunstsammlung chemnitz .
she also conceived and curated a current show of paintings by singer-songwriter bob dylan , which will eventually travel to new york and other destinations . a " series of fortunate events " between 2002 and 2003 led to the acquisition of gunzenhauser 's collection , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building 's expressionist architecture suits the collecton , many say " it was chemnitz 's good luck that just at the time when mr. gunzenhauser was looking for a home for his works , the right people with the right means came together and made that happen , " friedrich said . first of all , mössinger got wind that the collection was available .
then she got the needed support from chemnitz 's then-mayor .
finally , a local savings bank moved out of its downtown headquarters , leaving an empty building just waiting to be renovated into a museum . a perfect match the expressionist facade of the new museum matches well with the content , friedrich says .
and in chemnitz , the collection has a chance to come into its own - moreso than if it had gone to a city with a more developed museum scene . " if he had given his collection to a gallery in munich or berlin , the collection would have barely been noticed , considering how much art those cities already have , " friedrich said .
" mr. gunzenhauser certainly wanted his collection to get the most attention possible . " not only will the collection benefit from its connection to chemnitz , but , organizers hope , chemnitz will benefit from the collection . in general , investing in art as a means of boosting the economy has become a common tactic for european cities .
among the first to do so was bilbao - and to great effect .
the industrial town in northern spain underwent a renaissance after it opened its frank gehry-designed guggenheim museum .
the phenomenon soon got the name " the bilbao effect . " possible ' bilbao effect ' " its possible chemnitz could experience some ' bilbao effect ' from this museum , " the curator conceded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid mössinger was first to bring dylan paintings to the public " in terms of being an art city , chemnitz has been behind dresden and leipzig up to now .
but through the gunzenhauser collection , i imagine that the tables have turned , and now people will recognize chemnitz as a serious city of art and culture … .
we are expecting tourism to improve here as a result . " friedrich added that since the museum opened , he has been deluged by requests for information about how to get to the city , museum opening hours , catalogs , and people wanting to know how to give coupons for exhibit tickets as christmas presents . but whether the positive effect will be long-term or short-lived remains to be seen , he said . " of course , we 'll do our best to see that it lasts .
the collection certainly has enough potential to stay fresh for the long term . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" officials hope the creation of a world-class modern art museum will help bring back some of the former glory to chemnitz , a city with a dwindling population and 10 percent unemployment . artistic tradition in chemnitz art in chemnitz has a " long and deeply rooted " tradition , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german artists are repesented in the collection , including johannes grützke " around the end of the 19th century , business - mostly textiles - in chemnitz was booming , " he said .
" industrialists invested a lot of money in art and architecture .
as a result , art and architecture flourished . " in the 1920s , the galerie der moderne showed works by expressionists and die brücke - the most modern artists of the time . but then came the double blows of the nazis ' destruction of " degenerate art , " followed by the bleak years under communist rule , when the city became known as karl- marx stadt .
it has yet to recover , financially or culturally . yet today , the third-largest city in the struggling state of saxony is working hard to re-establish its reputation as a cultural mecca .
the city 's recently adopted motto is " chemnitz - the modern city , " - referring in part to the city 's deep roots in the modernist movements of the 1920s .
it is an image ingrid mössinger , the director of the city 's art collections , has gone to almost superhuman lengths to support . mössinger 's many coups one of mössinger 's earliest art-world successes was snagging the international blockbuster picasso and his women for chemnitz 's art museum , the kunstsammlung chemnitz .
she also conceived and curated a current show of paintings by singer-songwriter bob dylan , which will eventually travel to new york and other destinations . a " series of fortunate events " between 2002 and 2003 led to the acquisition of gunzenhauser 's collection , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building 's expressionist architecture suits the collecton , many say " it was chemnitz 's good luck that just at the time when mr. gunzenhauser was looking for a home for his works , the right people with the right means came together and made that happen , " friedrich said . first of all , mössinger got wind that the collection was available .
then she got the needed support from chemnitz 's then-mayor .
finally , a local savings bank moved out of its downtown headquarters , leaving an empty building just waiting to be renovated into a museum . a perfect match the expressionist facade of the new museum matches well with the content , friedrich says .
and in chemnitz , the collection has a chance to come into its own - moreso than if it had gone to a city with a more developed museum scene . " if he had given his collection to a gallery in munich or berlin , the collection would have barely been noticed , considering how much art those cities already have , " friedrich said .
" mr. gunzenhauser certainly wanted his collection to get the most attention possible . " not only will the collection benefit from its connection to chemnitz , but , organizers hope , chemnitz will benefit from the collection . in general , investing in art as a means of boosting the economy has become a common tactic for european cities .
among the first to do so was bilbao - and to great effect .
the industrial town in northern spain underwent a renaissance after it opened its frank gehry-designed guggenheim museum .
the phenomenon soon got the name " the bilbao effect .

5 , on a comprehensive package to slash germany 's greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent before 2020 . the multi-billion-euro plan calls for more energy efficiency , a greater use of renewable energy and new insulation standards for buildings . the program is designed to limit additional financial burdens on consumers , who are ultimately supposed to benefit from a reduction in energy use . another goal of the plan is to rely on renewable energy sources or highly efficient heat and power plants to generate half of the country 's total power needs by 2020 .
the generation of heat from renewable sources is also to increase from 6 percent to 14 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more power is to come from renewable sources " i think this is the biggest and most ambitious set of laws and guidelines you 'll find anywhere in the world , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel told reporters after the cabinet meeting . start for climate protection the plan is also intended to send a signal to the un climate change conference currently taking place on the indonesian island of bali to discuss a replacement for the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 . the 14-point package is the first phase of an overall 29-point program that the government outlined in august .
the remaining 15 measures , including stricter controls on vehicle emissions , are up for approval in may 2008 and may also include a co2 tax on trucks . germany is the world 's sixth largest emitter of greenhouse gases and europe 's biggest polluter .
the country accounts for 3.19 percent of the world 's total output of carbon dioxide emissions , according to the dpa news agency . the government 's new plan aims to cut back co2 emissions by 220 million tons by 2020 . german reductions in co2 emissions have stagnated since the mid-1990s , according to reuters news service .
the 18-percent reduction achieved since 1990 is primarily due to the end of heavily polluting industry in the former east germany , which was largely cleaned up after german reunification . criticism continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has made the climate a priority the environmental organization greenpeace has said the german government is not doing enough and criticized the endorsement of over 20 new coal-burning power plants , reuters reported .
supporters say the new plants are cleaner than older coal-fired power stations and are needed to fill the power void as nuclear plants are phased out . the environmental group said that if all the planned power plants were actually built - six are currently under construction - the country would not be able to meet its target of cutting co2 by 40 percent . opposition green party leader reinhard bütikofer called the government 's proposals " tepid " and " bogus , " according to dpa . transport and construction minister wolfgang tiefensee has cautioned that implementing the new measures will not be easy , but he stressed that germany must take a leading role in climate protection in the european union . the total cost of the new measures is estimated to be around 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 45.5 billion -rrb- , while energy savings are supposed to amount to around 36 billion euros by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there remains a cause for concern , " the spokesman said , two days after a us intelligence assessment concluded that tehran appeared to have suspended its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
at the same time , wilhelm said an offer of cooperation with iran remained in force if the government there agreed to halt enrichment , which some nations in the west fear is geared towards making a bomb .

" but you also know the reality that two un security council resolutions have not been followed and that iran has not yet stopped its uranium enrichment program . "

dörflein managed to keep the rising star alive with a bottle - and the little guy became such a good eater that he had to go on a diet when his weight reached 60 kilograms -lrb- 132 pounds -rrb- in july . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in july , knut was told he had to drop a few pounds also in july , it was deemed too dangerous for dörflein to romp and wrestle with his protégé .
after all , the born carnivore has claws that would have to rip open seals and sea-lions if he lived in the wild .
now little knut is up to a whopping 110 kilograms . future uncertain for knut knut 's first year was n't all roses and seal blubber .
prior to the weight-loss program in the summer , the superstar received a death threat in april which prompted heightened police security .
in the same month he suffered from a toothache that forced him to call off public engagements .
later , in september , he hurt his right hind paw . " knut threw a tantrum when he saw me , " said veterinarian andreas ochs , who treated the injury . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut can no longer play with his keeper conservationists and animal rights purists also stirred up controversy by saying that knut should have been allowed to die naturally rather than be raised as a " half-human . " it is uncertain whether knut will be able to stay in the berlin zoo - a possibility which bear keeper heiner klös called unlikely , speaking wednesday on germany 's rbb-inforadio .
berlin already had two polar bear families and a third would be too expensive , he said . his future residence wo n't officially be decided until may , however . knut may have to pass baton of fame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut has even made it onto postage stamps in azerbaijan the berlin zoo announced at the end of november that knut may have three new siblings on the way .
his father lars reportedly impregnated all three of the female polar bears at the zoo , including knut 's mother tosca . with heavy competition coming in the cuteness department , knut 's fame may be short-lived .
but at least he 'll be in good company . reminisce over knut 's younger , fluffier days with the picture gallery below . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 05.12.2007 opinion : high pisa score masks inequality in german schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german schools have improved their international ranking , according to the most recent pisa study .
but dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen puts pisa to the test and takes a closer look at the state of education in germany . once upon a time , people thought of the town in italy and of vacation when they heard the word " pisa . "
they thought of cappuccinos , of a building that adamantly refuses to fall over , of bella italia . then the first pisa study 's results came out in 2001 and nothing in german education was bella .
germany , the land of poets and philosophers , had regressed .
its students rated average to poor - a disgrace for old europe that the us tested ahead of germany . but now everything seems to be fine again .
the new pisa study shows - at first glance - that german students have caught up .
education policy-makers are patting each other on the back ; such an accomplishment inevitably involves a lot of them . and it 's true : the first pisa study got things going and generated productive concern .
the german philology association calls the most recent pisa study " proof of the innovative power and reformability " of german schools . but is that really the case ?
let 's take a closer look : the newest pisa study can hardly be compared with its predecessors .
in the 2001 results , testing focused on reading comprehension , but in 2003 it was heavy on math and now the emphasis is on the natural sciences .
that does n't allow for identifying a pattern of development . even if you turning a blind eye to the facts that the only statistics worth believing are the one you 've doctored yourself and that educational studies can never deliver a decisive evaluation of school quality , things still do n't fit together . it remains a disaster that - in a wealthy country like germany - parents ' pocketbook still determines children 's educational path . former german chancellor willy brandt 's motto " education for all " from the 1970s was never fulfilled : the manager 's son goes to the college-prep high school while the blue collar worker 's child attends the vocational high school . it 's still often the case that children from so-called underprivileged families and children with migration backgrounds are n't fostered enough and their potential is not recognized .
this only deepens the social divide that already exists . education means participation in social development .
but when this participation is hindered , we not only have an education problem but a democracy problem as well . the supposed pisa success should n't belie the fact that the three-pillared school system is a manifestation of an antiquated social structure .

but dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen puts pisa to the test and takes a closer look at the state of education in germany . once upon a time , people thought of the town in italy and of vacation when they heard the word " pisa . "
they thought of cappuccinos , of a building that adamantly refuses to fall over , of bella italia . then the first pisa study 's results came out in 2001 and nothing in german education was bella .
germany , the land of poets and philosophers , had regressed .
its students rated average to poor - a disgrace for old europe that the us tested ahead of germany . but now everything seems to be fine again .
the new pisa study shows - at first glance - that german students have caught up .
education policy-makers are patting each other on the back ; such an accomplishment inevitably involves a lot of them . and it 's true : the first pisa study got things going and generated productive concern .
the german philology association calls the most recent pisa study " proof of the innovative power and reformability " of german schools . but is that really the case ?
let 's take a closer look : the newest pisa study can hardly be compared with its predecessors .
in the 2001 results , testing focused on reading comprehension , but in 2003 it was heavy on math and now the emphasis is on the natural sciences .
that does n't allow for identifying a pattern of development . even if you turning a blind eye to the facts that the only statistics worth believing are the one you 've doctored yourself and that educational studies can never deliver a decisive evaluation of school quality , things still do n't fit together . it remains a disaster that - in a wealthy country like germany - parents ' pocketbook still determines children 's educational path . former german chancellor willy brandt 's motto " education for all " from the 1970s was never fulfilled : the manager 's son goes to the college-prep high school while the blue collar worker 's child attends the vocational high school . it 's still often the case that children from so-called underprivileged families and children with migration backgrounds are n't fostered enough and their potential is not recognized .
this only deepens the social divide that already exists . education means participation in social development .
but when this participation is hindered , we not only have an education problem but a democracy problem as well . the supposed pisa success should n't belie the fact that the three-pillared school system is a manifestation of an antiquated social structure .

in any case , world war three has been avoided - at least for now . writing on wednesday , dec .
5 , from munich , the süddeutsche zeitung said the recent us report , which stated that iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 , was intended to avoid a mistake similar to the invasion of iraq in 2001 . " the domestic consequences of the reversal are incalculable , " continued the paper .
" the distrust will now intensify in favor of the democrats . " only democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton 's popularity will suffer from the report as she had been the most outspoken against iran in her party , opined the süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report could be bad for clinton 's election campaign the berliner zeitung , writing tuesday from the german capital , said the security report would impact elections in iran as well . " in iran , all of the political camps will have to attentively follow the developments , " wrote the paper .
" parliamentary elections are next year and the policy of the west will help decide how the advocates of reform fair . " other newspapers focused on the effects the latest intelligence report will have on peace elsewhere in the middle east . while some , especially israel , concentrated on the news that iran indeed had a nuclear weapons program prior to 2003 , others saw the new information as " a success for diplomacy that sweeps all military options off the table , " wrote vienna 's der standard on wednesday . " but one pillar of -lsb- the us ' -rsb- middle east policy has just collapsed - one that played a role in the israeli-palestinian peace conference in annapolis in the form of a security guarantee for israel , " concluded the paper . similarly , london 's the guardian saw the intelligence paper as a potential danger for israel . " no matter who is president in washington , israel now confronts a united american military and intelligence front declaring that the iranian nuclear issue is not urgent and probably not dangerous and rejecting an american military response , " commented the paper wednesday . bush , however , " judging by his immediate reaction to the nie -lsb- report -rsb- , will continue to be sympathetic to israel 's concerns . " in contrast , others expressed the hope that the knowledge that iran does not possess nuclear weapons could encourage negotiation and diplomacy on all sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will tehran respond to the report with a willingness to talk ?
" when we assume that tehran does n't have any military nuclear program , then , first of all , the danger of a military attack is reduced and , secondly , it means that negotiation is possible , " wrote le figaro wednesday from paris .
" a detente would also help peace in lebanon and palestine .
but tehran has to respond to washington 's open door . " from rome on tuesday , la repubblica agreed that the us would have had to make good on its promises of " terrible consequences " if iran had attacked israel - even though the us " had stuck its neck out too far " - but conceded that it can now " allow itself the liberty of not doing anything -lrb- … -rrb- and dream the dreams of reconciliation with iran and negotiations with palestine .

5 , on a comprehensive package to slash germany 's greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent before 2020 . the multi-billion-euro plan calls for more energy efficiency , a greater use of renewable energy and new insulation standards for buildings . the program is designed to limit additional financial burdens on consumers , who are ultimately supposed to benefit from a reduction in energy use . another goal of the plan is to rely on renewable energy sources or highly efficient heat and power plants to generate half of the country 's total power needs by 2020 .
the generation of heat from renewable sources is also to increase from 6 percent to 14 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more power is to come from renewable sources " i think this is the biggest and most ambitious set of laws and guidelines you 'll find anywhere in the world , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel told reporters after the cabinet meeting . start for climate protection the plan is also intended to send a signal to the un climate change conference currently taking place on the indonesian island of bali to discuss a replacement for the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 . the 14-point package is the first phase of an overall 29-point program that the government outlined in august .
the remaining 15 measures , including stricter controls on vehicle emissions , are up for approval in may 2008 and may also include a co2 tax on trucks . germany is the world 's sixth largest emitter of greenhouse gases and europe 's biggest polluter .
the country accounts for 3.19 percent of the world 's total output of carbon dioxide emissions , according to the dpa news agency . the government 's new plan aims to cut back co2 emissions by 220 million tons by 2020 . german reductions in co2 emissions have stagnated since the mid-1990s , according to reuters news service .
the 18-percent reduction achieved since 1990 is primarily due to the end of heavily polluting industry in the former east germany , which was largely cleaned up after german reunification . criticism continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has made the climate a priority the environmental organization greenpeace has said the german government is not doing enough and criticized the endorsement of over 20 new coal-burning power plants , reuters reported .
supporters say the new plants are cleaner than older coal-fired power stations and are needed to fill the power void as nuclear plants are phased out . the environmental group said that if all the planned power plants were actually built - six are currently under construction - the country would not be able to meet its target of cutting co2 by 40 percent . opposition green party leader reinhard bütikofer called the government 's proposals " tepid " and " bogus , " according to dpa . transport and construction minister wolfgang tiefensee has cautioned that implementing the new measures will not be easy , but he stressed that germany must take a leading role in climate protection in the european union . the total cost of the new measures is estimated to be around 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 45.5 billion -rrb- , while energy savings are supposed to amount to around 36 billion euros by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen puts pisa to the test and takes a closer look at the state of education in germany . once upon a time , people thought of the town in italy and of vacation when they heard the word " pisa . "
they thought of cappuccinos , of a building that adamantly refuses to fall over , of bella italia . then the first pisa study 's results came out in 2001 and nothing in german education was bella .
germany , the land of poets and philosophers , had regressed .
its students rated average to poor - a disgrace for old europe that the us tested ahead of germany . but now everything seems to be fine again .
the new pisa study shows - at first glance - that german students have caught up .
education policy-makers are patting each other on the back ; such an accomplishment inevitably involves a lot of them . and it 's true : the first pisa study got things going and generated productive concern .
the german philology association calls the most recent pisa study " proof of the innovative power and reformability " of german schools . but is that really the case ?
let 's take a closer look : the newest pisa study can hardly be compared with its predecessors .
in the 2001 results , testing focused on reading comprehension , but in 2003 it was heavy on math and now the emphasis is on the natural sciences .
that does n't allow for identifying a pattern of development . even if you turning a blind eye to the facts that the only statistics worth believing are the one you 've doctored yourself and that educational studies can never deliver a decisive evaluation of school quality , things still do n't fit together . it remains a disaster that - in a wealthy country like germany - parents ' pocketbook still determines children 's educational path . former german chancellor willy brandt 's motto " education for all " from the 1970s was never fulfilled : the manager 's son goes to the college-prep high school while the blue collar worker 's child attends the vocational high school . it 's still often the case that children from so-called underprivileged families and children with migration backgrounds are n't fostered enough and their potential is not recognized .
this only deepens the social divide that already exists . education means participation in social development .
but when this participation is hindered , we not only have an education problem but a democracy problem as well . the supposed pisa success should n't belie the fact that the three-pillared school system is a manifestation of an antiquated social structure .
no other country begins the selection process so early .
in germany , a student 's educational path is decided in the fourth grade .
the trusted world of learning - in which good , differentiated learning takes place - is lost . nearly all german education researchers agree on the solution : learning together over a longer period of time in a positive environment without pressure to achieve .
in the netherlands , a country that also has high immigration , elementary school last for six years .
the country has autonomous schools , comparative school research , and regular achievement tests for students and teachers . the foundation of scholastic success is laid in the first few years .
nevertheless , funds are distributed inequitably .
most of the money goes to high schools and universities , while pre-schools and elementary schools are underfinanced . the early years are especially crucial for children from migrant or underprivileged families .
they fall through the cracks . germany should follow sweden 's example and make a new law that says students ' academic paths are n't determined before ninth grade .
and it should finally have the gall to say , like finland , that " no child should be embarrassed . " the true success in the countries that scored well in the pisa study comes from taking lasting responsibility for each individual student . " no child should be embarrassed " - that would be a real revolution in german classrooms . ramon garcia-ziemsen is dw-radio 's culture editor -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal is part of the town 's overall move to make a cultural comeback . in an amazing coup , down-and-out chemnitz beat stronger rivals like leipzig , dresden and stuttgart to acquire the private collection of munich gallery owner alfred gunzenhauser . the 2,945 piece collection - itself a surprise as few people knew of its existence - includes 290 artworks by new objectivist painter otto dix , numerous works by expressionists such as ernst ludwig kirchner , and more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eye for art : gunzenhauser found a home for his collection from the various cities that showed interest , which included stuttgart and berlin as well as saxony neighbors leipzig and dresden , gunzenhauser selected chemnitz as a home for his collection , after the town offered to create a permanent home for the artworks . strength in numbers the gunzenhauser museum was dedicated on dec .
1 , 2004 . " chemnitz was the first city that could offer the collection its own house , " said thomas freidrich , the gunzenhauser museum 's curator . " it is only by showing the core of the collection all together that the works can be best appreciated , " he said .
" until now , many of the paintings were unknown .
now that they are being shown together , we are realizing what an absolute treasure we have on our hands . " officials hope the creation of a world-class modern art museum will help bring back some of the former glory to chemnitz , a city with a dwindling population and 10 percent unemployment . artistic tradition in chemnitz art in chemnitz has a " long and deeply rooted " tradition , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german artists are repesented in the collection , including johannes grützke " around the end of the 19th century , business - mostly textiles - in chemnitz was booming , " he said .
" industrialists invested a lot of money in art and architecture .
as a result , art and architecture flourished . " in the 1920s , the galerie der moderne showed works by expressionists and die brücke - the most modern artists of the time . but then came the double blows of the nazis ' destruction of " degenerate art , " followed by the bleak years under communist rule , when the city became known as karl- marx stadt .
it has yet to recover , financially or culturally . yet today , the third-largest city in the struggling state of saxony is working hard to re-establish its reputation as a cultural mecca .
the city 's recently adopted motto is " chemnitz - the modern city , " - referring in part to the city 's deep roots in the modernist movements of the 1920s .
it is an image ingrid mössinger , the director of the city 's art collections , has gone to almost superhuman lengths to support . mössinger 's many coups one of mössinger 's earliest art-world successes was snagging the international blockbuster picasso and his women for chemnitz 's art museum , the kunstsammlung chemnitz .
she also conceived and curated a current show of paintings by singer-songwriter bob dylan , which will eventually travel to new york and other destinations . a " series of fortunate events " between 2002 and 2003 led to the acquisition of gunzenhauser 's collection , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building 's expressionist architecture suits the collecton , many say " it was chemnitz 's good luck that just at the time when mr. gunzenhauser was looking for a home for his works , the right people with the right means came together and made that happen , " friedrich said . first of all , mössinger got wind that the collection was available .
then she got the needed support from chemnitz 's then-mayor .
finally , a local savings bank moved out of its downtown headquarters , leaving an empty building just waiting to be renovated into a museum . a perfect match the expressionist facade of the new museum matches well with the content , friedrich says .
and in chemnitz , the collection has a chance to come into its own - moreso than if it had gone to a city with a more developed museum scene . " if he had given his collection to a gallery in munich or berlin , the collection would have barely been noticed , considering how much art those cities already have , " friedrich said .
" mr. gunzenhauser certainly wanted his collection to get the most attention possible . " not only will the collection benefit from its connection to chemnitz , but , organizers hope , chemnitz will benefit from the collection . in general , investing in art as a means of boosting the economy has become a common tactic for european cities .
among the first to do so was bilbao - and to great effect .
the industrial town in northern spain underwent a renaissance after it opened its frank gehry-designed guggenheim museum .
the phenomenon soon got the name " the bilbao effect . " possible ' bilbao effect ' " its possible chemnitz could experience some ' bilbao effect ' from this museum , " the curator conceded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid mössinger was first to bring dylan paintings to the public " in terms of being an art city , chemnitz has been behind dresden and leipzig up to now .
but through the gunzenhauser collection , i imagine that the tables have turned , and now people will recognize chemnitz as a serious city of art and culture … .
we are expecting tourism to improve here as a result . " friedrich added that since the museum opened , he has been deluged by requests for information about how to get to the city , museum opening hours , catalogs , and people wanting to know how to give coupons for exhibit tickets as christmas presents . but whether the positive effect will be long-term or short-lived remains to be seen , he said . " of course , we 'll do our best to see that it lasts .
the collection certainly has enough potential to stay fresh for the long term . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 , on a comprehensive package to slash germany 's greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent before 2020 . the multi-billion-euro plan calls for more energy efficiency , a greater use of renewable energy and new insulation standards for buildings . the program is designed to limit additional financial burdens on consumers , who are ultimately supposed to benefit from a reduction in energy use . another goal of the plan is to rely on renewable energy sources or highly efficient heat and power plants to generate half of the country 's total power needs by 2020 .
the generation of heat from renewable sources is also to increase from 6 percent to 14 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more power is to come from renewable sources " i think this is the biggest and most ambitious set of laws and guidelines you 'll find anywhere in the world , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel told reporters after the cabinet meeting . start for climate protection the plan is also intended to send a signal to the un climate change conference currently taking place on the indonesian island of bali to discuss a replacement for the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 . the 14-point package is the first phase of an overall 29-point program that the government outlined in august .
the remaining 15 measures , including stricter controls on vehicle emissions , are up for approval in may 2008 and may also include a co2 tax on trucks . germany is the world 's sixth largest emitter of greenhouse gases and europe 's biggest polluter .
the country accounts for 3.19 percent of the world 's total output of carbon dioxide emissions , according to the dpa news agency . the government 's new plan aims to cut back co2 emissions by 220 million tons by 2020 . german reductions in co2 emissions have stagnated since the mid-1990s , according to reuters news service .
the 18-percent reduction achieved since 1990 is primarily due to the end of heavily polluting industry in the former east germany , which was largely cleaned up after german reunification . criticism continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has made the climate a priority the environmental organization greenpeace has said the german government is not doing enough and criticized the endorsement of over 20 new coal-burning power plants , reuters reported .
supporters say the new plants are cleaner than older coal-fired power stations and are needed to fill the power void as nuclear plants are phased out . the environmental group said that if all the planned power plants were actually built - six are currently under construction - the country would not be able to meet its target of cutting co2 by 40 percent . opposition green party leader reinhard bütikofer called the government 's proposals " tepid " and " bogus , " according to dpa . transport and construction minister wolfgang tiefensee has cautioned that implementing the new measures will not be easy , but he stressed that germany must take a leading role in climate protection in the european union . the total cost of the new measures is estimated to be around 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 45.5 billion -rrb- , while energy savings are supposed to amount to around 36 billion euros by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 05.12.2007 otto dix in chemnitz : major art for a minor town großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the museum 's opening , a visitor eyed an otto dix painting from 1921 the eastern german city of chemnitz made a big-league art acquisition when it lured a major collection of otto dix paintings to a new home there .
the deal is part of the town 's overall move to make a cultural comeback . in an amazing coup , down-and-out chemnitz beat stronger rivals like leipzig , dresden and stuttgart to acquire the private collection of munich gallery owner alfred gunzenhauser . the 2,945 piece collection - itself a surprise as few people knew of its existence - includes 290 artworks by new objectivist painter otto dix , numerous works by expressionists such as ernst ludwig kirchner , and more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eye for art : gunzenhauser found a home for his collection from the various cities that showed interest , which included stuttgart and berlin as well as saxony neighbors leipzig and dresden , gunzenhauser selected chemnitz as a home for his collection , after the town offered to create a permanent home for the artworks . strength in numbers the gunzenhauser museum was dedicated on dec .
1 , 2004 . " chemnitz was the first city that could offer the collection its own house , " said thomas freidrich , the gunzenhauser museum 's curator . " it is only by showing the core of the collection all together that the works can be best appreciated , " he said .
" until now , many of the paintings were unknown .
now that they are being shown together , we are realizing what an absolute treasure we have on our hands . " officials hope the creation of a world-class modern art museum will help bring back some of the former glory to chemnitz , a city with a dwindling population and 10 percent unemployment . artistic tradition in chemnitz art in chemnitz has a " long and deeply rooted " tradition , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german artists are repesented in the collection , including johannes grützke " around the end of the 19th century , business - mostly textiles - in chemnitz was booming , " he said .
" industrialists invested a lot of money in art and architecture .
as a result , art and architecture flourished . " in the 1920s , the galerie der moderne showed works by expressionists and die brücke - the most modern artists of the time . but then came the double blows of the nazis ' destruction of " degenerate art , " followed by the bleak years under communist rule , when the city became known as karl- marx stadt .
it has yet to recover , financially or culturally . yet today , the third-largest city in the struggling state of saxony is working hard to re-establish its reputation as a cultural mecca .
the city 's recently adopted motto is " chemnitz - the modern city , " - referring in part to the city 's deep roots in the modernist movements of the 1920s .
it is an image ingrid mössinger , the director of the city 's art collections , has gone to almost superhuman lengths to support . mössinger 's many coups one of mössinger 's earliest art-world successes was snagging the international blockbuster picasso and his women for chemnitz 's art museum , the kunstsammlung chemnitz .
she also conceived and curated a current show of paintings by singer-songwriter bob dylan , which will eventually travel to new york and other destinations . a " series of fortunate events " between 2002 and 2003 led to the acquisition of gunzenhauser 's collection , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building 's expressionist architecture suits the collecton , many say " it was chemnitz 's good luck that just at the time when mr. gunzenhauser was looking for a home for his works , the right people with the right means came together and made that happen , " friedrich said . first of all , mössinger got wind that the collection was available .
then she got the needed support from chemnitz 's then-mayor .
finally , a local savings bank moved out of its downtown headquarters , leaving an empty building just waiting to be renovated into a museum . a perfect match the expressionist facade of the new museum matches well with the content , friedrich says .
and in chemnitz , the collection has a chance to come into its own - moreso than if it had gone to a city with a more developed museum scene . " if he had given his collection to a gallery in munich or berlin , the collection would have barely been noticed , considering how much art those cities already have , " friedrich said .
" mr. gunzenhauser certainly wanted his collection to get the most attention possible . " not only will the collection benefit from its connection to chemnitz , but , organizers hope , chemnitz will benefit from the collection . in general , investing in art as a means of boosting the economy has become a common tactic for european cities .
among the first to do so was bilbao - and to great effect .
the industrial town in northern spain underwent a renaissance after it opened its frank gehry-designed guggenheim museum .
the phenomenon soon got the name " the bilbao effect . " possible ' bilbao effect ' " its possible chemnitz could experience some ' bilbao effect ' from this museum , " the curator conceded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid mössinger was first to bring dylan paintings to the public " in terms of being an art city , chemnitz has been behind dresden and leipzig up to now .
but through the gunzenhauser collection , i imagine that the tables have turned , and now people will recognize chemnitz as a serious city of art and culture … .

the deal is part of the town 's overall move to make a cultural comeback . in an amazing coup , down-and-out chemnitz beat stronger rivals like leipzig , dresden and stuttgart to acquire the private collection of munich gallery owner alfred gunzenhauser . the 2,945 piece collection - itself a surprise as few people knew of its existence - includes 290 artworks by new objectivist painter otto dix , numerous works by expressionists such as ernst ludwig kirchner , and more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eye for art : gunzenhauser found a home for his collection from the various cities that showed interest , which included stuttgart and berlin as well as saxony neighbors leipzig and dresden , gunzenhauser selected chemnitz as a home for his collection , after the town offered to create a permanent home for the artworks . strength in numbers the gunzenhauser museum was dedicated on dec .
1 , 2004 . " chemnitz was the first city that could offer the collection its own house , " said thomas freidrich , the gunzenhauser museum 's curator . " it is only by showing the core of the collection all together that the works can be best appreciated , " he said .
" until now , many of the paintings were unknown .
now that they are being shown together , we are realizing what an absolute treasure we have on our hands . " officials hope the creation of a world-class modern art museum will help bring back some of the former glory to chemnitz , a city with a dwindling population and 10 percent unemployment . artistic tradition in chemnitz art in chemnitz has a " long and deeply rooted " tradition , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german artists are repesented in the collection , including johannes grützke " around the end of the 19th century , business - mostly textiles - in chemnitz was booming , " he said .
" industrialists invested a lot of money in art and architecture .
as a result , art and architecture flourished . " in the 1920s , the galerie der moderne showed works by expressionists and die brücke - the most modern artists of the time . but then came the double blows of the nazis ' destruction of " degenerate art , " followed by the bleak years under communist rule , when the city became known as karl- marx stadt .
it has yet to recover , financially or culturally . yet today , the third-largest city in the struggling state of saxony is working hard to re-establish its reputation as a cultural mecca .
the city 's recently adopted motto is " chemnitz - the modern city , " - referring in part to the city 's deep roots in the modernist movements of the 1920s .
it is an image ingrid mössinger , the director of the city 's art collections , has gone to almost superhuman lengths to support . mössinger 's many coups one of mössinger 's earliest art-world successes was snagging the international blockbuster picasso and his women for chemnitz 's art museum , the kunstsammlung chemnitz .
she also conceived and curated a current show of paintings by singer-songwriter bob dylan , which will eventually travel to new york and other destinations . a " series of fortunate events " between 2002 and 2003 led to the acquisition of gunzenhauser 's collection , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building 's expressionist architecture suits the collecton , many say " it was chemnitz 's good luck that just at the time when mr. gunzenhauser was looking for a home for his works , the right people with the right means came together and made that happen , " friedrich said . first of all , mössinger got wind that the collection was available .
then she got the needed support from chemnitz 's then-mayor .
finally , a local savings bank moved out of its downtown headquarters , leaving an empty building just waiting to be renovated into a museum . a perfect match the expressionist facade of the new museum matches well with the content , friedrich says .
and in chemnitz , the collection has a chance to come into its own - moreso than if it had gone to a city with a more developed museum scene . " if he had given his collection to a gallery in munich or berlin , the collection would have barely been noticed , considering how much art those cities already have , " friedrich said .
" mr. gunzenhauser certainly wanted his collection to get the most attention possible . " not only will the collection benefit from its connection to chemnitz , but , organizers hope , chemnitz will benefit from the collection . in general , investing in art as a means of boosting the economy has become a common tactic for european cities .
among the first to do so was bilbao - and to great effect .
the industrial town in northern spain underwent a renaissance after it opened its frank gehry-designed guggenheim museum .
the phenomenon soon got the name " the bilbao effect . " possible ' bilbao effect ' " its possible chemnitz could experience some ' bilbao effect ' from this museum , " the curator conceded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid mössinger was first to bring dylan paintings to the public " in terms of being an art city , chemnitz has been behind dresden and leipzig up to now .
but through the gunzenhauser collection , i imagine that the tables have turned , and now people will recognize chemnitz as a serious city of art and culture … .

the deal is part of the town 's overall move to make a cultural comeback . in an amazing coup , down-and-out chemnitz beat stronger rivals like leipzig , dresden and stuttgart to acquire the private collection of munich gallery owner alfred gunzenhauser . the 2,945 piece collection - itself a surprise as few people knew of its existence - includes 290 artworks by new objectivist painter otto dix , numerous works by expressionists such as ernst ludwig kirchner , and more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eye for art : gunzenhauser found a home for his collection from the various cities that showed interest , which included stuttgart and berlin as well as saxony neighbors leipzig and dresden , gunzenhauser selected chemnitz as a home for his collection , after the town offered to create a permanent home for the artworks . strength in numbers the gunzenhauser museum was dedicated on dec .
1 , 2004 . " chemnitz was the first city that could offer the collection its own house , " said thomas freidrich , the gunzenhauser museum 's curator . " it is only by showing the core of the collection all together that the works can be best appreciated , " he said .
" until now , many of the paintings were unknown .
now that they are being shown together , we are realizing what an absolute treasure we have on our hands . " officials hope the creation of a world-class modern art museum will help bring back some of the former glory to chemnitz , a city with a dwindling population and 10 percent unemployment . artistic tradition in chemnitz art in chemnitz has a " long and deeply rooted " tradition , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german artists are repesented in the collection , including johannes grützke " around the end of the 19th century , business - mostly textiles - in chemnitz was booming , " he said .
" industrialists invested a lot of money in art and architecture .
as a result , art and architecture flourished . " in the 1920s , the galerie der moderne showed works by expressionists and die brücke - the most modern artists of the time . but then came the double blows of the nazis ' destruction of " degenerate art , " followed by the bleak years under communist rule , when the city became known as karl- marx stadt .
it has yet to recover , financially or culturally . yet today , the third-largest city in the struggling state of saxony is working hard to re-establish its reputation as a cultural mecca .
the city 's recently adopted motto is " chemnitz - the modern city , " - referring in part to the city 's deep roots in the modernist movements of the 1920s .
it is an image ingrid mössinger , the director of the city 's art collections , has gone to almost superhuman lengths to support . mössinger 's many coups one of mössinger 's earliest art-world successes was snagging the international blockbuster picasso and his women for chemnitz 's art museum , the kunstsammlung chemnitz .
she also conceived and curated a current show of paintings by singer-songwriter bob dylan , which will eventually travel to new york and other destinations . a " series of fortunate events " between 2002 and 2003 led to the acquisition of gunzenhauser 's collection , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building 's expressionist architecture suits the collecton , many say " it was chemnitz 's good luck that just at the time when mr. gunzenhauser was looking for a home for his works , the right people with the right means came together and made that happen , " friedrich said . first of all , mössinger got wind that the collection was available .
then she got the needed support from chemnitz 's then-mayor .
finally , a local savings bank moved out of its downtown headquarters , leaving an empty building just waiting to be renovated into a museum . a perfect match the expressionist facade of the new museum matches well with the content , friedrich says .
and in chemnitz , the collection has a chance to come into its own - moreso than if it had gone to a city with a more developed museum scene . " if he had given his collection to a gallery in munich or berlin , the collection would have barely been noticed , considering how much art those cities already have , " friedrich said .
" mr. gunzenhauser certainly wanted his collection to get the most attention possible . " not only will the collection benefit from its connection to chemnitz , but , organizers hope , chemnitz will benefit from the collection . in general , investing in art as a means of boosting the economy has become a common tactic for european cities .
among the first to do so was bilbao - and to great effect .
the industrial town in northern spain underwent a renaissance after it opened its frank gehry-designed guggenheim museum .
the phenomenon soon got the name " the bilbao effect . " possible ' bilbao effect ' " its possible chemnitz could experience some ' bilbao effect ' from this museum , " the curator conceded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid mössinger was first to bring dylan paintings to the public " in terms of being an art city , chemnitz has been behind dresden and leipzig up to now .
but through the gunzenhauser collection , i imagine that the tables have turned , and now people will recognize chemnitz as a serious city of art and culture … .
we are expecting tourism to improve here as a result . " friedrich added that since the museum opened , he has been deluged by requests for information about how to get to the city , museum opening hours , catalogs , and people wanting to know how to give coupons for exhibit tickets as christmas presents . but whether the positive effect will be long-term or short-lived remains to be seen , he said . " of course , we 'll do our best to see that it lasts .
the collection certainly has enough potential to stay fresh for the long term . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 05.12.2007 european press review : iran report could impact elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us may now be less inclined to come to israel 's aid , opined several european papers some european papers saw the us iran report as a danger to israel , while others took it as hope for diplomacy .
in any case , world war three has been avoided - at least for now . writing on wednesday , dec .
5 , from munich , the süddeutsche zeitung said the recent us report , which stated that iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 , was intended to avoid a mistake similar to the invasion of iraq in 2001 . " the domestic consequences of the reversal are incalculable , " continued the paper .
" the distrust will now intensify in favor of the democrats . " only democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton 's popularity will suffer from the report as she had been the most outspoken against iran in her party , opined the süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report could be bad for clinton 's election campaign the berliner zeitung , writing tuesday from the german capital , said the security report would impact elections in iran as well . " in iran , all of the political camps will have to attentively follow the developments , " wrote the paper .
" parliamentary elections are next year and the policy of the west will help decide how the advocates of reform fair . " other newspapers focused on the effects the latest intelligence report will have on peace elsewhere in the middle east . while some , especially israel , concentrated on the news that iran indeed had a nuclear weapons program prior to 2003 , others saw the new information as " a success for diplomacy that sweeps all military options off the table , " wrote vienna 's der standard on wednesday . " but one pillar of -lsb- the us ' -rsb- middle east policy has just collapsed - one that played a role in the israeli-palestinian peace conference in annapolis in the form of a security guarantee for israel , " concluded the paper . similarly , london 's the guardian saw the intelligence paper as a potential danger for israel . " no matter who is president in washington , israel now confronts a united american military and intelligence front declaring that the iranian nuclear issue is not urgent and probably not dangerous and rejecting an american military response , " commented the paper wednesday . bush , however , " judging by his immediate reaction to the nie -lsb- report -rsb- , will continue to be sympathetic to israel 's concerns . " in contrast , others expressed the hope that the knowledge that iran does not possess nuclear weapons could encourage negotiation and diplomacy on all sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will tehran respond to the report with a willingness to talk ?
" when we assume that tehran does n't have any military nuclear program , then , first of all , the danger of a military attack is reduced and , secondly , it means that negotiation is possible , " wrote le figaro wednesday from paris .
" a detente would also help peace in lebanon and palestine .
but tehran has to respond to washington 's open door .

but dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen puts pisa to the test and takes a closer look at the state of education in germany . once upon a time , people thought of the town in italy and of vacation when they heard the word " pisa . "
they thought of cappuccinos , of a building that adamantly refuses to fall over , of bella italia . then the first pisa study 's results came out in 2001 and nothing in german education was bella .
germany , the land of poets and philosophers , had regressed .
its students rated average to poor - a disgrace for old europe that the us tested ahead of germany . but now everything seems to be fine again .
the new pisa study shows - at first glance - that german students have caught up .
education policy-makers are patting each other on the back ; such an accomplishment inevitably involves a lot of them . and it 's true : the first pisa study got things going and generated productive concern .
the german philology association calls the most recent pisa study " proof of the innovative power and reformability " of german schools . but is that really the case ?
let 's take a closer look : the newest pisa study can hardly be compared with its predecessors .
in the 2001 results , testing focused on reading comprehension , but in 2003 it was heavy on math and now the emphasis is on the natural sciences .
that does n't allow for identifying a pattern of development . even if you turning a blind eye to the facts that the only statistics worth believing are the one you 've doctored yourself and that educational studies can never deliver a decisive evaluation of school quality , things still do n't fit together . it remains a disaster that - in a wealthy country like germany - parents ' pocketbook still determines children 's educational path . former german chancellor willy brandt 's motto " education for all " from the 1970s was never fulfilled : the manager 's son goes to the college-prep high school while the blue collar worker 's child attends the vocational high school . it 's still often the case that children from so-called underprivileged families and children with migration backgrounds are n't fostered enough and their potential is not recognized .
this only deepens the social divide that already exists . education means participation in social development .
but when this participation is hindered , we not only have an education problem but a democracy problem as well . the supposed pisa success should n't belie the fact that the three-pillared school system is a manifestation of an antiquated social structure .
no other country begins the selection process so early .
in germany , a student 's educational path is decided in the fourth grade .
the trusted world of learning - in which good , differentiated learning takes place - is lost . nearly all german education researchers agree on the solution : learning together over a longer period of time in a positive environment without pressure to achieve .
in the netherlands , a country that also has high immigration , elementary school last for six years .
the country has autonomous schools , comparative school research , and regular achievement tests for students and teachers . the foundation of scholastic success is laid in the first few years .
nevertheless , funds are distributed inequitably .
most of the money goes to high schools and universities , while pre-schools and elementary schools are underfinanced . the early years are especially crucial for children from migrant or underprivileged families .
they fall through the cracks . germany should follow sweden 's example and make a new law that says students ' academic paths are n't determined before ninth grade .
and it should finally have the gall to say , like finland , that " no child should be embarrassed . " the true success in the countries that scored well in the pisa study comes from taking lasting responsibility for each individual student .

that does n't allow for identifying a pattern of development . even if you turning a blind eye to the facts that the only statistics worth believing are the one you 've doctored yourself and that educational studies can never deliver a decisive evaluation of school quality , things still do n't fit together . it remains a disaster that - in a wealthy country like germany - parents ' pocketbook still determines children 's educational path . former german chancellor willy brandt 's motto " education for all " from the 1970s was never fulfilled : the manager 's son goes to the college-prep high school while the blue collar worker 's child attends the vocational high school . it 's still often the case that children from so-called underprivileged families and children with migration backgrounds are n't fostered enough and their potential is not recognized .
this only deepens the social divide that already exists . education means participation in social development .
but when this participation is hindered , we not only have an education problem but a democracy problem as well . the supposed pisa success should n't belie the fact that the three-pillared school system is a manifestation of an antiquated social structure .
no other country begins the selection process so early .
in germany , a student 's educational path is decided in the fourth grade .
the trusted world of learning - in which good , differentiated learning takes place - is lost . nearly all german education researchers agree on the solution : learning together over a longer period of time in a positive environment without pressure to achieve .
in the netherlands , a country that also has high immigration , elementary school last for six years .
the country has autonomous schools , comparative school research , and regular achievement tests for students and teachers . the foundation of scholastic success is laid in the first few years .
nevertheless , funds are distributed inequitably .
most of the money goes to high schools and universities , while pre-schools and elementary schools are underfinanced . the early years are especially crucial for children from migrant or underprivileged families .
they fall through the cracks . germany should follow sweden 's example and make a new law that says students ' academic paths are n't determined before ninth grade .
and it should finally have the gall to say , like finland , that " no child should be embarrassed . " the true success in the countries that scored well in the pisa study comes from taking lasting responsibility for each individual student . " no child should be embarrassed " - that would be a real revolution in german classrooms . ramon garcia-ziemsen is dw-radio 's culture editor -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de pisa education studies come under examination germany crept up the rankings in the latest comparative international education study .
but the results are once again fanning the flames of controversy in the ongoing debate over school reform .
-lrb- 04.12.2007 -rrb- ' secret ' school discovered in bremen after 30 years of education of all the things which could be hard to spot , a school would not be anywhere close to the top of the list .

the deal is part of the town 's overall move to make a cultural comeback . in an amazing coup , down-and-out chemnitz beat stronger rivals like leipzig , dresden and stuttgart to acquire the private collection of munich gallery owner alfred gunzenhauser . the 2,945 piece collection - itself a surprise as few people knew of its existence - includes 290 artworks by new objectivist painter otto dix , numerous works by expressionists such as ernst ludwig kirchner , and more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eye for art : gunzenhauser found a home for his collection from the various cities that showed interest , which included stuttgart and berlin as well as saxony neighbors leipzig and dresden , gunzenhauser selected chemnitz as a home for his collection , after the town offered to create a permanent home for the artworks . strength in numbers the gunzenhauser museum was dedicated on dec .

" officials hope the creation of a world-class modern art museum will help bring back some of the former glory to chemnitz , a city with a dwindling population and 10 percent unemployment . artistic tradition in chemnitz art in chemnitz has a " long and deeply rooted " tradition , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german artists are repesented in the collection , including johannes grützke " around the end of the 19th century , business - mostly textiles - in chemnitz was booming , " he said .
" industrialists invested a lot of money in art and architecture .

" in the 1920s , the galerie der moderne showed works by expressionists and die brücke - the most modern artists of the time . but then came the double blows of the nazis ' destruction of " degenerate art , " followed by the bleak years under communist rule , when the city became known as karl- marx stadt .
it has yet to recover , financially or culturally . yet today , the third-largest city in the struggling state of saxony is working hard to re-establish its reputation as a cultural mecca .

it is an image ingrid mössinger , the director of the city 's art collections , has gone to almost superhuman lengths to support . mössinger 's many coups one of mössinger 's earliest art-world successes was snagging the international blockbuster picasso and his women for chemnitz 's art museum , the kunstsammlung chemnitz .
she also conceived and curated a current show of paintings by singer-songwriter bob dylan , which will eventually travel to new york and other destinations . a " series of fortunate events " between 2002 and 2003 led to the acquisition of gunzenhauser 's collection , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building 's expressionist architecture suits the collecton , many say " it was chemnitz 's good luck that just at the time when mr. gunzenhauser was looking for a home for his works , the right people with the right means came together and made that happen , " friedrich said . first of all , mössinger got wind that the collection was available .

finally , a local savings bank moved out of its downtown headquarters , leaving an empty building just waiting to be renovated into a museum . a perfect match the expressionist facade of the new museum matches well with the content , friedrich says .

but dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen puts pisa to the test and takes a closer look at the state of education in germany . once upon a time , people thought of the town in italy and of vacation when they heard the word " pisa . "
they thought of cappuccinos , of a building that adamantly refuses to fall over , of bella italia . then the first pisa study 's results came out in 2001 and nothing in german education was bella .
germany , the land of poets and philosophers , had regressed .
its students rated average to poor - a disgrace for old europe that the us tested ahead of germany . but now everything seems to be fine again .
the new pisa study shows - at first glance - that german students have caught up .
education policy-makers are patting each other on the back ; such an accomplishment inevitably involves a lot of them . and it 's true : the first pisa study got things going and generated productive concern .
the german philology association calls the most recent pisa study " proof of the innovative power and reformability " of german schools . but is that really the case ?
let 's take a closer look : the newest pisa study can hardly be compared with its predecessors .
in the 2001 results , testing focused on reading comprehension , but in 2003 it was heavy on math and now the emphasis is on the natural sciences .
that does n't allow for identifying a pattern of development . even if you turning a blind eye to the facts that the only statistics worth believing are the one you 've doctored yourself and that educational studies can never deliver a decisive evaluation of school quality , things still do n't fit together . it remains a disaster that - in a wealthy country like germany - parents ' pocketbook still determines children 's educational path . former german chancellor willy brandt 's motto " education for all " from the 1970s was never fulfilled : the manager 's son goes to the college-prep high school while the blue collar worker 's child attends the vocational high school . it 's still often the case that children from so-called underprivileged families and children with migration backgrounds are n't fostered enough and their potential is not recognized .
this only deepens the social divide that already exists . education means participation in social development .
but when this participation is hindered , we not only have an education problem but a democracy problem as well . the supposed pisa success should n't belie the fact that the three-pillared school system is a manifestation of an antiquated social structure .
no other country begins the selection process so early .
in germany , a student 's educational path is decided in the fourth grade .
the trusted world of learning - in which good , differentiated learning takes place - is lost . nearly all german education researchers agree on the solution : learning together over a longer period of time in a positive environment without pressure to achieve .
in the netherlands , a country that also has high immigration , elementary school last for six years .
the country has autonomous schools , comparative school research , and regular achievement tests for students and teachers . the foundation of scholastic success is laid in the first few years .
nevertheless , funds are distributed inequitably .
most of the money goes to high schools and universities , while pre-schools and elementary schools are underfinanced . the early years are especially crucial for children from migrant or underprivileged families .
they fall through the cracks . germany should follow sweden 's example and make a new law that says students ' academic paths are n't determined before ninth grade .
and it should finally have the gall to say , like finland , that " no child should be embarrassed .

in any case , world war three has been avoided - at least for now . writing on wednesday , dec .
5 , from munich , the süddeutsche zeitung said the recent us report , which stated that iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 , was intended to avoid a mistake similar to the invasion of iraq in 2001 . " the domestic consequences of the reversal are incalculable , " continued the paper .
" the distrust will now intensify in favor of the democrats . " only democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton 's popularity will suffer from the report as she had been the most outspoken against iran in her party , opined the süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report could be bad for clinton 's election campaign the berliner zeitung , writing tuesday from the german capital , said the security report would impact elections in iran as well . " in iran , all of the political camps will have to attentively follow the developments , " wrote the paper .
" parliamentary elections are next year and the policy of the west will help decide how the advocates of reform fair . " other newspapers focused on the effects the latest intelligence report will have on peace elsewhere in the middle east . while some , especially israel , concentrated on the news that iran indeed had a nuclear weapons program prior to 2003 , others saw the new information as " a success for diplomacy that sweeps all military options off the table , " wrote vienna 's der standard on wednesday . " but one pillar of -lsb- the us ' -rsb- middle east policy has just collapsed - one that played a role in the israeli-palestinian peace conference in annapolis in the form of a security guarantee for israel , " concluded the paper . similarly , london 's the guardian saw the intelligence paper as a potential danger for israel . " no matter who is president in washington , israel now confronts a united american military and intelligence front declaring that the iranian nuclear issue is not urgent and probably not dangerous and rejecting an american military response , " commented the paper wednesday . bush , however , " judging by his immediate reaction to the nie -lsb- report -rsb- , will continue to be sympathetic to israel 's concerns . " in contrast , others expressed the hope that the knowledge that iran does not possess nuclear weapons could encourage negotiation and diplomacy on all sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will tehran respond to the report with a willingness to talk ?
" when we assume that tehran does n't have any military nuclear program , then , first of all , the danger of a military attack is reduced and , secondly , it means that negotiation is possible , " wrote le figaro wednesday from paris .
" a detente would also help peace in lebanon and palestine .
but tehran has to respond to washington 's open door . " from rome on tuesday , la repubblica agreed that the us would have had to make good on its promises of " terrible consequences " if iran had attacked israel - even though the us " had stuck its neck out too far " - but conceded that it can now " allow itself the liberty of not doing anything -lrb- … -rrb- and dream the dreams of reconciliation with iran and negotiations with palestine .

5 , on a comprehensive package to slash germany 's greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent before 2020 . the multi-billion-euro plan calls for more energy efficiency , a greater use of renewable energy and new insulation standards for buildings . the program is designed to limit additional financial burdens on consumers , who are ultimately supposed to benefit from a reduction in energy use . another goal of the plan is to rely on renewable energy sources or highly efficient heat and power plants to generate half of the country 's total power needs by 2020 .
the generation of heat from renewable sources is also to increase from 6 percent to 14 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more power is to come from renewable sources " i think this is the biggest and most ambitious set of laws and guidelines you 'll find anywhere in the world , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel told reporters after the cabinet meeting . start for climate protection the plan is also intended to send a signal to the un climate change conference currently taking place on the indonesian island of bali to discuss a replacement for the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 . the 14-point package is the first phase of an overall 29-point program that the government outlined in august .
the remaining 15 measures , including stricter controls on vehicle emissions , are up for approval in may 2008 and may also include a co2 tax on trucks . germany is the world 's sixth largest emitter of greenhouse gases and europe 's biggest polluter .
the country accounts for 3.19 percent of the world 's total output of carbon dioxide emissions , according to the dpa news agency . the government 's new plan aims to cut back co2 emissions by 220 million tons by 2020 . german reductions in co2 emissions have stagnated since the mid-1990s , according to reuters news service .
the 18-percent reduction achieved since 1990 is primarily due to the end of heavily polluting industry in the former east germany , which was largely cleaned up after german reunification . criticism continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has made the climate a priority the environmental organization greenpeace has said the german government is not doing enough and criticized the endorsement of over 20 new coal-burning power plants , reuters reported .
supporters say the new plants are cleaner than older coal-fired power stations and are needed to fill the power void as nuclear plants are phased out . the environmental group said that if all the planned power plants were actually built - six are currently under construction - the country would not be able to meet its target of cutting co2 by 40 percent . opposition green party leader reinhard bütikofer called the government 's proposals " tepid " and " bogus , " according to dpa . transport and construction minister wolfgang tiefensee has cautioned that implementing the new measures will not be easy , but he stressed that germany must take a leading role in climate protection in the european union . the total cost of the new measures is estimated to be around 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 45.5 billion -rrb- , while energy savings are supposed to amount to around 36 billion euros by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 , on a comprehensive package to slash germany 's greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent before 2020 . the multi-billion-euro plan calls for more energy efficiency , a greater use of renewable energy and new insulation standards for buildings . the program is designed to limit additional financial burdens on consumers , who are ultimately supposed to benefit from a reduction in energy use . another goal of the plan is to rely on renewable energy sources or highly efficient heat and power plants to generate half of the country 's total power needs by 2020 .
the generation of heat from renewable sources is also to increase from 6 percent to 14 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more power is to come from renewable sources " i think this is the biggest and most ambitious set of laws and guidelines you 'll find anywhere in the world , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel told reporters after the cabinet meeting . start for climate protection the plan is also intended to send a signal to the un climate change conference currently taking place on the indonesian island of bali to discuss a replacement for the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 . the 14-point package is the first phase of an overall 29-point program that the government outlined in august .
the remaining 15 measures , including stricter controls on vehicle emissions , are up for approval in may 2008 and may also include a co2 tax on trucks . germany is the world 's sixth largest emitter of greenhouse gases and europe 's biggest polluter .
the country accounts for 3.19 percent of the world 's total output of carbon dioxide emissions , according to the dpa news agency . the government 's new plan aims to cut back co2 emissions by 220 million tons by 2020 . german reductions in co2 emissions have stagnated since the mid-1990s , according to reuters news service .
the 18-percent reduction achieved since 1990 is primarily due to the end of heavily polluting industry in the former east germany , which was largely cleaned up after german reunification . criticism continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has made the climate a priority the environmental organization greenpeace has said the german government is not doing enough and criticized the endorsement of over 20 new coal-burning power plants , reuters reported .
supporters say the new plants are cleaner than older coal-fired power stations and are needed to fill the power void as nuclear plants are phased out . the environmental group said that if all the planned power plants were actually built - six are currently under construction - the country would not be able to meet its target of cutting co2 by 40 percent . opposition green party leader reinhard bütikofer called the government 's proposals " tepid " and " bogus , " according to dpa . transport and construction minister wolfgang tiefensee has cautioned that implementing the new measures will not be easy , but he stressed that germany must take a leading role in climate protection in the european union . the total cost of the new measures is estimated to be around 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 45.5 billion -rrb- , while energy savings are supposed to amount to around 36 billion euros by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new release about a make-shift family in a high-rise has attracted much praise , yet there is some suggestion that its success has as much to do with the setting as the plot . wir sagen du !
schatz -lrb- family rules -rrb- is an original idea ; it tells the story of a man , who faced with the rather triste prospect of spending christmas alone , decides to steal some relatives and subsequently barricade them , and himself , into the 17th floor of a tower block for festivities en famille . " why set it in a tower block ? " one might ask .
clearly , making the kidnapped protagonists ' prospects for escape difficult is a good plot device , but there is more to it than that .
there has been a shift in perception of high-rise blocks in recent years , and they are now seriously en-vogue among german directors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-fab landscape in the city of dresden actress hendrikje fitz believes using a pre-fab as a backdrop is a quick way for filmmakers to establish the genre and social milieu of their movies .

" but she adds that this generation of german pre-fab movies go some way to portraying the former east germany as a kind of operetta town , so cozy and so trashy that it was a good , if weird , place to be . " it is the moderate way of depicting the gdr , " she said .
" people who lived through it do n't always want to be told they lived in a dictatorship , they want to see different aspects of what they experienced . "
by the same token , audiences who grew up in the west are fascinated by the beehive community element of tower block life sold to them as a synonym for the former eastern germany . giving humanity the hard sell what films like wir sagen du !

" audiences enjoy watching people overcome their problems , fight for their families and stave off their loneliness " holler said , " and they like to see people who live outside society 's norms . " over the years , holler 's research has taken him to countless high-rise apartments where he has come face to face with a wildly eclectic mix of people , styles and takes on life . " one lady dreamed of living in a country cottage , so she had sloping walls built into her flat and decked the whole place out in laura ashley .

a new release about a make-shift family in a high-rise has attracted much praise , yet there is some suggestion that its success has as much to do with the setting as the plot . wir sagen du !
schatz -lrb- family rules -rrb- is an original idea ; it tells the story of a man , who faced with the rather triste prospect of spending christmas alone , decides to steal some relatives and subsequently barricade them , and himself , into the 17th floor of a tower block for festivities en famille . " why set it in a tower block ? " one might ask .
clearly , making the kidnapped protagonists ' prospects for escape difficult is a good plot device , but there is more to it than that .
there has been a shift in perception of high-rise blocks in recent years , and they are now seriously en-vogue among german directors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-fab landscape in the city of dresden actress hendrikje fitz believes using a pre-fab as a backdrop is a quick way for filmmakers to establish the genre and social milieu of their movies .
" you know immediately you are watching a film about people in the former east , " fitz said , " because high-rise blocks are the symbol of the gdr . " but she adds that this generation of german pre-fab movies go some way to portraying the former east germany as a kind of operetta town , so cozy and so trashy that it was a good , if weird , place to be . " it is the moderate way of depicting the gdr , " she said .
" people who lived through it do n't always want to be told they lived in a dictatorship , they want to see different aspects of what they experienced . "
by the same token , audiences who grew up in the west are fascinated by the beehive community element of tower block life sold to them as a synonym for the former eastern germany . giving humanity the hard sell what films like wir sagen du !
schatz , halbe treppe -lrb- grill point -rrb- or du bist nicht allein , another high-rise picture released earlier this year , offer their viewers is good-old fashioned humanity wrapped up in a mix of gritty reality , romanticism and comedy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from bernd böhlich 's ' du bist nicht allein ' lothar holler , set designer on films such as sonnenallee and goodbye lenin , says humanity and a feeling of sticking together are the key ingredients of pre-fab movies .
" audiences enjoy watching people overcome their problems , fight for their families and stave off their loneliness " holler said , " and they like to see people who live outside society 's norms . " over the years , holler 's research has taken him to countless high-rise apartments where he has come face to face with a wildly eclectic mix of people , styles and takes on life . " one lady dreamed of living in a country cottage , so she had sloping walls built into her flat and decked the whole place out in laura ashley .
the man next-door covered his walls in beer cans , and another guy lived in a tent pitched in his living room . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film halbe treppe von dresen holler says these are the little worlds he tries to recreate on screen , not only because they mirror reality , but because they are what audiences want to see .
" where we conform , these on-screen personas do n't , " he said " and their ' anything is possible ' mentality makes them exotic and hence very appealing . " living together , sticking together oliver mielke recently co-wrote , produced and directed a movie set in a pre-fab landscape .
ossis eleven , which is due for release early next year , is a comedy about the benefits of sticking together . mielke , who grew up in western germany and had little experience of tower blocks until he began to research them for his film , says he chose a high-rise location because he wanted to help dispel the prejudice which surrounds them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the positive face of a pre-fab " the clichés of high-rise living are deeply engrained in our minds , " he said , " but in actual fact the atmosphere is n't negative at all . " what stood out for mielke was the extent to which people stick together to organize their lives and the astonishing mix of characters who live on top of one another in a clearly defined space . " where else are you going to find a victim of a gdr doping scandal living next to an ex-stasi informer who lives next to a know-it-all west german ? " he asked .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 05.12.2007 the rise of the high rise in german film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living the high life german film , it seems , loves pre-fabs .
a new release about a make-shift family in a high-rise has attracted much praise , yet there is some suggestion that its success has as much to do with the setting as the plot . wir sagen du !
schatz -lrb- family rules -rrb- is an original idea ; it tells the story of a man , who faced with the rather triste prospect of spending christmas alone , decides to steal some relatives and subsequently barricade them , and himself , into the 17th floor of a tower block for festivities en famille . " why set it in a tower block ? " one might ask .
clearly , making the kidnapped protagonists ' prospects for escape difficult is a good plot device , but there is more to it than that .
there has been a shift in perception of high-rise blocks in recent years , and they are now seriously en-vogue among german directors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-fab landscape in the city of dresden actress hendrikje fitz believes using a pre-fab as a backdrop is a quick way for filmmakers to establish the genre and social milieu of their movies .
" you know immediately you are watching a film about people in the former east , " fitz said , " because high-rise blocks are the symbol of the gdr . " but she adds that this generation of german pre-fab movies go some way to portraying the former east germany as a kind of operetta town , so cozy and so trashy that it was a good , if weird , place to be . " it is the moderate way of depicting the gdr , " she said .
" people who lived through it do n't always want to be told they lived in a dictatorship , they want to see different aspects of what they experienced . "
by the same token , audiences who grew up in the west are fascinated by the beehive community element of tower block life sold to them as a synonym for the former eastern germany . giving humanity the hard sell what films like wir sagen du !
schatz , halbe treppe -lrb- grill point -rrb- or du bist nicht allein , another high-rise picture released earlier this year , offer their viewers is good-old fashioned humanity wrapped up in a mix of gritty reality , romanticism and comedy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from bernd böhlich 's ' du bist nicht allein ' lothar holler , set designer on films such as sonnenallee and goodbye lenin , says humanity and a feeling of sticking together are the key ingredients of pre-fab movies .
" audiences enjoy watching people overcome their problems , fight for their families and stave off their loneliness " holler said , " and they like to see people who live outside society 's norms . " over the years , holler 's research has taken him to countless high-rise apartments where he has come face to face with a wildly eclectic mix of people , styles and takes on life . " one lady dreamed of living in a country cottage , so she had sloping walls built into her flat and decked the whole place out in laura ashley .
the man next-door covered his walls in beer cans , and another guy lived in a tent pitched in his living room . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film halbe treppe von dresen holler says these are the little worlds he tries to recreate on screen , not only because they mirror reality , but because they are what audiences want to see .
" where we conform , these on-screen personas do n't , " he said " and their ' anything is possible ' mentality makes them exotic and hence very appealing . " living together , sticking together oliver mielke recently co-wrote , produced and directed a movie set in a pre-fab landscape .
ossis eleven , which is due for release early next year , is a comedy about the benefits of sticking together . mielke , who grew up in western germany and had little experience of tower blocks until he began to research them for his film , says he chose a high-rise location because he wanted to help dispel the prejudice which surrounds them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the positive face of a pre-fab " the clichés of high-rise living are deeply engrained in our minds , " he said , " but in actual fact the atmosphere is n't negative at all . " what stood out for mielke was the extent to which people stick together to organize their lives and the astonishing mix of characters who live on top of one another in a clearly defined space . " where else are you going to find a victim of a gdr doping scandal living next to an ex-stasi informer who lives next to a know-it-all west german ? " he asked .

a new release about a make-shift family in a high-rise has attracted much praise , yet there is some suggestion that its success has as much to do with the setting as the plot . wir sagen du !
schatz -lrb- family rules -rrb- is an original idea ; it tells the story of a man , who faced with the rather triste prospect of spending christmas alone , decides to steal some relatives and subsequently barricade them , and himself , into the 17th floor of a tower block for festivities en famille . " why set it in a tower block ? " one might ask .
clearly , making the kidnapped protagonists ' prospects for escape difficult is a good plot device , but there is more to it than that .
there has been a shift in perception of high-rise blocks in recent years , and they are now seriously en-vogue among german directors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-fab landscape in the city of dresden actress hendrikje fitz believes using a pre-fab as a backdrop is a quick way for filmmakers to establish the genre and social milieu of their movies .
" you know immediately you are watching a film about people in the former east , " fitz said , " because high-rise blocks are the symbol of the gdr . " but she adds that this generation of german pre-fab movies go some way to portraying the former east germany as a kind of operetta town , so cozy and so trashy that it was a good , if weird , place to be . " it is the moderate way of depicting the gdr , " she said .
" people who lived through it do n't always want to be told they lived in a dictatorship , they want to see different aspects of what they experienced . "
by the same token , audiences who grew up in the west are fascinated by the beehive community element of tower block life sold to them as a synonym for the former eastern germany . giving humanity the hard sell what films like wir sagen du !
schatz , halbe treppe -lrb- grill point -rrb- or du bist nicht allein , another high-rise picture released earlier this year , offer their viewers is good-old fashioned humanity wrapped up in a mix of gritty reality , romanticism and comedy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from bernd böhlich 's ' du bist nicht allein ' lothar holler , set designer on films such as sonnenallee and goodbye lenin , says humanity and a feeling of sticking together are the key ingredients of pre-fab movies .
" audiences enjoy watching people overcome their problems , fight for their families and stave off their loneliness " holler said , " and they like to see people who live outside society 's norms . " over the years , holler 's research has taken him to countless high-rise apartments where he has come face to face with a wildly eclectic mix of people , styles and takes on life . " one lady dreamed of living in a country cottage , so she had sloping walls built into her flat and decked the whole place out in laura ashley .
the man next-door covered his walls in beer cans , and another guy lived in a tent pitched in his living room . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film halbe treppe von dresen holler says these are the little worlds he tries to recreate on screen , not only because they mirror reality , but because they are what audiences want to see .
" where we conform , these on-screen personas do n't , " he said " and their ' anything is possible ' mentality makes them exotic and hence very appealing . " living together , sticking together oliver mielke recently co-wrote , produced and directed a movie set in a pre-fab landscape .
ossis eleven , which is due for release early next year , is a comedy about the benefits of sticking together . mielke , who grew up in western germany and had little experience of tower blocks until he began to research them for his film , says he chose a high-rise location because he wanted to help dispel the prejudice which surrounds them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the positive face of a pre-fab " the clichés of high-rise living are deeply engrained in our minds , " he said , " but in actual fact the atmosphere is n't negative at all . " what stood out for mielke was the extent to which people stick together to organize their lives and the astonishing mix of characters who live on top of one another in a clearly defined space . " where else are you going to find a victim of a gdr doping scandal living next to an ex-stasi informer who lives next to a know-it-all west german ? " he asked .

the deal is part of the town 's overall move to make a cultural comeback . in an amazing coup , down-and-out chemnitz beat stronger rivals like leipzig , dresden and stuttgart to acquire the private collection of munich gallery owner alfred gunzenhauser . the 2,945 piece collection - itself a surprise as few people knew of its existence - includes 290 artworks by new objectivist painter otto dix , numerous works by expressionists such as ernst ludwig kirchner , and more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eye for art : gunzenhauser found a home for his collection from the various cities that showed interest , which included stuttgart and berlin as well as saxony neighbors leipzig and dresden , gunzenhauser selected chemnitz as a home for his collection , after the town offered to create a permanent home for the artworks . strength in numbers the gunzenhauser museum was dedicated on dec .

" until now , many of the paintings were unknown .
now that they are being shown together , we are realizing what an absolute treasure we have on our hands . " officials hope the creation of a world-class modern art museum will help bring back some of the former glory to chemnitz , a city with a dwindling population and 10 percent unemployment . artistic tradition in chemnitz art in chemnitz has a " long and deeply rooted " tradition , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german artists are repesented in the collection , including johannes grützke " around the end of the 19th century , business - mostly textiles - in chemnitz was booming , " he said .
" industrialists invested a lot of money in art and architecture .

it has yet to recover , financially or culturally . yet today , the third-largest city in the struggling state of saxony is working hard to re-establish its reputation as a cultural mecca .

it is an image ingrid mössinger , the director of the city 's art collections , has gone to almost superhuman lengths to support . mössinger 's many coups one of mössinger 's earliest art-world successes was snagging the international blockbuster picasso and his women for chemnitz 's art museum , the kunstsammlung chemnitz .
she also conceived and curated a current show of paintings by singer-songwriter bob dylan , which will eventually travel to new york and other destinations . a " series of fortunate events " between 2002 and 2003 led to the acquisition of gunzenhauser 's collection , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building 's expressionist architecture suits the collecton , many say " it was chemnitz 's good luck that just at the time when mr. gunzenhauser was looking for a home for his works , the right people with the right means came together and made that happen , " friedrich said . first of all , mössinger got wind that the collection was available .
then she got the needed support from chemnitz 's then-mayor .
finally , a local savings bank moved out of its downtown headquarters , leaving an empty building just waiting to be renovated into a museum . a perfect match the expressionist facade of the new museum matches well with the content , friedrich says .
and in chemnitz , the collection has a chance to come into its own - moreso than if it had gone to a city with a more developed museum scene . " if he had given his collection to a gallery in munich or berlin , the collection would have barely been noticed , considering how much art those cities already have , " friedrich said .
" mr. gunzenhauser certainly wanted his collection to get the most attention possible .

" there remains a cause for concern , " the spokesman said , two days after a us intelligence assessment concluded that tehran appeared to have suspended its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
at the same time , wilhelm said an offer of cooperation with iran remained in force if the government there agreed to halt enrichment , which some nations in the west fear is geared towards making a bomb .
" the findings -lrb- of the report -rrb- confirm what the german government has always said - that diplomatic negotiations are promising , " wilhelm told a press conference .
" but you also know the reality that two un security council resolutions have not been followed and that iran has not yet stopped its uranium enrichment program . "
diplomatic pressure must therefore be maintained on iran , along with a readiness to cooperate with the islamic republic if it agrees to halt enrichment , wilhelm added .
report leads to calls for a halt to sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national security adviser hadley announced the report the us report released monday contradicted white house warnings that iran was closing in fast on the ability to produce its own nuclear weapon .
un security council members russia and china have suggested the report lessens the need for further un sanctions against iran .
but wilhelm said : " the security council is preparing a further resolution .
it is germany 's strong belief that we should continue to work towards a diplomatic solution together with china , russia , the european union and the united states . "
us president george w. bush has said the report did not change his view that " iran was dangerous , iran is dangerous and iran will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon . "
pressure works , claims steinmeier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said that pressure had gotten results on tuesday , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the us intelligence finding proves a united stance in the international community is needed .
he said the unity of the european union , the united states , russia and china had " evidently not failed to make an impression on the political leadership in iran . "
" i appeal to the iranian leadership to continue cooperation with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and to respond to the unanswered questions about their nuclear program promptly and comprehensively , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there remains a cause for concern , " the spokesman said , two days after a us intelligence assessment concluded that tehran appeared to have suspended its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
at the same time , wilhelm said an offer of cooperation with iran remained in force if the government there agreed to halt enrichment , which some nations in the west fear is geared towards making a bomb .
" the findings -lrb- of the report -rrb- confirm what the german government has always said - that diplomatic negotiations are promising , " wilhelm told a press conference .
" but you also know the reality that two un security council resolutions have not been followed and that iran has not yet stopped its uranium enrichment program . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 05.12.2007 the rise of the high rise in german film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living the high life german film , it seems , loves pre-fabs .
a new release about a make-shift family in a high-rise has attracted much praise , yet there is some suggestion that its success has as much to do with the setting as the plot . wir sagen du !
schatz -lrb- family rules -rrb- is an original idea ; it tells the story of a man , who faced with the rather triste prospect of spending christmas alone , decides to steal some relatives and subsequently barricade them , and himself , into the 17th floor of a tower block for festivities en famille . " why set it in a tower block ? " one might ask .
clearly , making the kidnapped protagonists ' prospects for escape difficult is a good plot device , but there is more to it than that .
there has been a shift in perception of high-rise blocks in recent years , and they are now seriously en-vogue among german directors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-fab landscape in the city of dresden actress hendrikje fitz believes using a pre-fab as a backdrop is a quick way for filmmakers to establish the genre and social milieu of their movies .
" you know immediately you are watching a film about people in the former east , " fitz said , " because high-rise blocks are the symbol of the gdr . " but she adds that this generation of german pre-fab movies go some way to portraying the former east germany as a kind of operetta town , so cozy and so trashy that it was a good , if weird , place to be . " it is the moderate way of depicting the gdr , " she said .
" people who lived through it do n't always want to be told they lived in a dictatorship , they want to see different aspects of what they experienced . "
by the same token , audiences who grew up in the west are fascinated by the beehive community element of tower block life sold to them as a synonym for the former eastern germany . giving humanity the hard sell what films like wir sagen du !
schatz , halbe treppe -lrb- grill point -rrb- or du bist nicht allein , another high-rise picture released earlier this year , offer their viewers is good-old fashioned humanity wrapped up in a mix of gritty reality , romanticism and comedy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from bernd böhlich 's ' du bist nicht allein ' lothar holler , set designer on films such as sonnenallee and goodbye lenin , says humanity and a feeling of sticking together are the key ingredients of pre-fab movies .
" audiences enjoy watching people overcome their problems , fight for their families and stave off their loneliness " holler said , " and they like to see people who live outside society 's norms . " over the years , holler 's research has taken him to countless high-rise apartments where he has come face to face with a wildly eclectic mix of people , styles and takes on life . " one lady dreamed of living in a country cottage , so she had sloping walls built into her flat and decked the whole place out in laura ashley .
the man next-door covered his walls in beer cans , and another guy lived in a tent pitched in his living room . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film halbe treppe von dresen holler says these are the little worlds he tries to recreate on screen , not only because they mirror reality , but because they are what audiences want to see .
" where we conform , these on-screen personas do n't , " he said " and their ' anything is possible ' mentality makes them exotic and hence very appealing . " living together , sticking together oliver mielke recently co-wrote , produced and directed a movie set in a pre-fab landscape .
ossis eleven , which is due for release early next year , is a comedy about the benefits of sticking together . mielke , who grew up in western germany and had little experience of tower blocks until he began to research them for his film , says he chose a high-rise location because he wanted to help dispel the prejudice which surrounds them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the positive face of a pre-fab " the clichés of high-rise living are deeply engrained in our minds , " he said , " but in actual fact the atmosphere is n't negative at all . " what stood out for mielke was the extent to which people stick together to organize their lives and the astonishing mix of characters who live on top of one another in a clearly defined space . " where else are you going to find a victim of a gdr doping scandal living next to an ex-stasi informer who lives next to a know-it-all west german ? " he asked .

it seems like just yesterday that he was melting hearts with his fluffy white fur , cuddling with his keeper and posing for photos with other hot celebs like leonardo di caprio . now our little knut is all grown up . the berlin zoo celebrated its star attraction wednesday with free entry for kids - a small sacrifice , considering that the former powder puff drew in as much as 10 million euros -lrb- $ 14.7 million -rrb- by more than doubling ticket sales over the past year .
that does n't count revenue generated by knut paraphernalia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only the candles are missing on knut 's birthday cake over 2.5 million people from all over the world paid the polar bear cub a personal visit , while millions more oohed and ahhed at his pictures in the media . knut wo n't share his birthday cake the birthday boy himself reportedly celebrated his big day with a cake of ice cream , fruit and vegetables , topped off with croissants and grapes and served up by keeper thomas dörflein . knut 's life began as an 810-gram -lrb- 29-ounce -rrb- orphan when his mother abandoned him after birth .
dörflein managed to keep the rising star alive with a bottle - and the little guy became such a good eater that he had to go on a diet when his weight reached 60 kilograms -lrb- 132 pounds -rrb- in july . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in july , knut was told he had to drop a few pounds also in july , it was deemed too dangerous for dörflein to romp and wrestle with his protégé .
after all , the born carnivore has claws that would have to rip open seals and sea-lions if he lived in the wild .
now little knut is up to a whopping 110 kilograms . future uncertain for knut knut 's first year was n't all roses and seal blubber .
prior to the weight-loss program in the summer , the superstar received a death threat in april which prompted heightened police security .
in the same month he suffered from a toothache that forced him to call off public engagements .
later , in september , he hurt his right hind paw . " knut threw a tantrum when he saw me , " said veterinarian andreas ochs , who treated the injury . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut can no longer play with his keeper conservationists and animal rights purists also stirred up controversy by saying that knut should have been allowed to die naturally rather than be raised as a " half-human . " it is uncertain whether knut will be able to stay in the berlin zoo - a possibility which bear keeper heiner klös called unlikely , speaking wednesday on germany 's rbb-inforadio .
berlin already had two polar bear families and a third would be too expensive , he said . his future residence wo n't officially be decided until may , however . knut may have to pass baton of fame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut has even made it onto postage stamps in azerbaijan the berlin zoo announced at the end of november that knut may have three new siblings on the way .
his father lars reportedly impregnated all three of the female polar bears at the zoo , including knut 's mother tosca . with heavy competition coming in the cuteness department , knut 's fame may be short-lived .
but at least he 'll be in good company . reminisce over knut 's younger , fluffier days with the picture gallery below . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen puts pisa to the test and takes a closer look at the state of education in germany . once upon a time , people thought of the town in italy and of vacation when they heard the word " pisa . "
they thought of cappuccinos , of a building that adamantly refuses to fall over , of bella italia . then the first pisa study 's results came out in 2001 and nothing in german education was bella .
germany , the land of poets and philosophers , had regressed .
its students rated average to poor - a disgrace for old europe that the us tested ahead of germany . but now everything seems to be fine again .
the new pisa study shows - at first glance - that german students have caught up .
education policy-makers are patting each other on the back ; such an accomplishment inevitably involves a lot of them . and it 's true : the first pisa study got things going and generated productive concern .
the german philology association calls the most recent pisa study " proof of the innovative power and reformability " of german schools . but is that really the case ?
let 's take a closer look : the newest pisa study can hardly be compared with its predecessors .
in the 2001 results , testing focused on reading comprehension , but in 2003 it was heavy on math and now the emphasis is on the natural sciences .
that does n't allow for identifying a pattern of development . even if you turning a blind eye to the facts that the only statistics worth believing are the one you 've doctored yourself and that educational studies can never deliver a decisive evaluation of school quality , things still do n't fit together . it remains a disaster that - in a wealthy country like germany - parents ' pocketbook still determines children 's educational path . former german chancellor willy brandt 's motto " education for all " from the 1970s was never fulfilled : the manager 's son goes to the college-prep high school while the blue collar worker 's child attends the vocational high school . it 's still often the case that children from so-called underprivileged families and children with migration backgrounds are n't fostered enough and their potential is not recognized .
this only deepens the social divide that already exists . education means participation in social development .
but when this participation is hindered , we not only have an education problem but a democracy problem as well . the supposed pisa success should n't belie the fact that the three-pillared school system is a manifestation of an antiquated social structure .
no other country begins the selection process so early .
in germany , a student 's educational path is decided in the fourth grade .
the trusted world of learning - in which good , differentiated learning takes place - is lost . nearly all german education researchers agree on the solution : learning together over a longer period of time in a positive environment without pressure to achieve .
in the netherlands , a country that also has high immigration , elementary school last for six years .
the country has autonomous schools , comparative school research , and regular achievement tests for students and teachers . the foundation of scholastic success is laid in the first few years .
nevertheless , funds are distributed inequitably .
most of the money goes to high schools and universities , while pre-schools and elementary schools are underfinanced . the early years are especially crucial for children from migrant or underprivileged families .
they fall through the cracks . germany should follow sweden 's example and make a new law that says students ' academic paths are n't determined before ninth grade .
and it should finally have the gall to say , like finland , that " no child should be embarrassed . " the true success in the countries that scored well in the pisa study comes from taking lasting responsibility for each individual student .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 05.12.2007 the rise of the high rise in german film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living the high life german film , it seems , loves pre-fabs .
a new release about a make-shift family in a high-rise has attracted much praise , yet there is some suggestion that its success has as much to do with the setting as the plot . wir sagen du !
schatz -lrb- family rules -rrb- is an original idea ; it tells the story of a man , who faced with the rather triste prospect of spending christmas alone , decides to steal some relatives and subsequently barricade them , and himself , into the 17th floor of a tower block for festivities en famille . " why set it in a tower block ? " one might ask .
clearly , making the kidnapped protagonists ' prospects for escape difficult is a good plot device , but there is more to it than that .
there has been a shift in perception of high-rise blocks in recent years , and they are now seriously en-vogue among german directors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-fab landscape in the city of dresden actress hendrikje fitz believes using a pre-fab as a backdrop is a quick way for filmmakers to establish the genre and social milieu of their movies .
" you know immediately you are watching a film about people in the former east , " fitz said , " because high-rise blocks are the symbol of the gdr . " but she adds that this generation of german pre-fab movies go some way to portraying the former east germany as a kind of operetta town , so cozy and so trashy that it was a good , if weird , place to be . " it is the moderate way of depicting the gdr , " she said .
" people who lived through it do n't always want to be told they lived in a dictatorship , they want to see different aspects of what they experienced . "
by the same token , audiences who grew up in the west are fascinated by the beehive community element of tower block life sold to them as a synonym for the former eastern germany . giving humanity the hard sell what films like wir sagen du !
schatz , halbe treppe -lrb- grill point -rrb- or du bist nicht allein , another high-rise picture released earlier this year , offer their viewers is good-old fashioned humanity wrapped up in a mix of gritty reality , romanticism and comedy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from bernd böhlich 's ' du bist nicht allein ' lothar holler , set designer on films such as sonnenallee and goodbye lenin , says humanity and a feeling of sticking together are the key ingredients of pre-fab movies .
" audiences enjoy watching people overcome their problems , fight for their families and stave off their loneliness " holler said , " and they like to see people who live outside society 's norms . " over the years , holler 's research has taken him to countless high-rise apartments where he has come face to face with a wildly eclectic mix of people , styles and takes on life . " one lady dreamed of living in a country cottage , so she had sloping walls built into her flat and decked the whole place out in laura ashley .
the man next-door covered his walls in beer cans , and another guy lived in a tent pitched in his living room . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film halbe treppe von dresen holler says these are the little worlds he tries to recreate on screen , not only because they mirror reality , but because they are what audiences want to see .
" where we conform , these on-screen personas do n't , " he said " and their ' anything is possible ' mentality makes them exotic and hence very appealing . " living together , sticking together oliver mielke recently co-wrote , produced and directed a movie set in a pre-fab landscape .
ossis eleven , which is due for release early next year , is a comedy about the benefits of sticking together . mielke , who grew up in western germany and had little experience of tower blocks until he began to research them for his film , says he chose a high-rise location because he wanted to help dispel the prejudice which surrounds them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the positive face of a pre-fab " the clichés of high-rise living are deeply engrained in our minds , " he said , " but in actual fact the atmosphere is n't negative at all . " what stood out for mielke was the extent to which people stick together to organize their lives and the astonishing mix of characters who live on top of one another in a clearly defined space . " where else are you going to find a victim of a gdr doping scandal living next to an ex-stasi informer who lives next to a know-it-all west german ? " he asked .

in any case , world war three has been avoided - at least for now . writing on wednesday , dec .
5 , from munich , the süddeutsche zeitung said the recent us report , which stated that iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 , was intended to avoid a mistake similar to the invasion of iraq in 2001 . " the domestic consequences of the reversal are incalculable , " continued the paper .
" the distrust will now intensify in favor of the democrats . " only democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton 's popularity will suffer from the report as she had been the most outspoken against iran in her party , opined the süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report could be bad for clinton 's election campaign the berliner zeitung , writing tuesday from the german capital , said the security report would impact elections in iran as well . " in iran , all of the political camps will have to attentively follow the developments , " wrote the paper .
" parliamentary elections are next year and the policy of the west will help decide how the advocates of reform fair . " other newspapers focused on the effects the latest intelligence report will have on peace elsewhere in the middle east . while some , especially israel , concentrated on the news that iran indeed had a nuclear weapons program prior to 2003 , others saw the new information as " a success for diplomacy that sweeps all military options off the table , " wrote vienna 's der standard on wednesday . " but one pillar of -lsb- the us ' -rsb- middle east policy has just collapsed - one that played a role in the israeli-palestinian peace conference in annapolis in the form of a security guarantee for israel , " concluded the paper . similarly , london 's the guardian saw the intelligence paper as a potential danger for israel . " no matter who is president in washington , israel now confronts a united american military and intelligence front declaring that the iranian nuclear issue is not urgent and probably not dangerous and rejecting an american military response , " commented the paper wednesday . bush , however , " judging by his immediate reaction to the nie -lsb- report -rsb- , will continue to be sympathetic to israel 's concerns . " in contrast , others expressed the hope that the knowledge that iran does not possess nuclear weapons could encourage negotiation and diplomacy on all sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will tehran respond to the report with a willingness to talk ?
" when we assume that tehran does n't have any military nuclear program , then , first of all , the danger of a military attack is reduced and , secondly , it means that negotiation is possible , " wrote le figaro wednesday from paris .
" a detente would also help peace in lebanon and palestine .
but tehran has to respond to washington 's open door . " from rome on tuesday , la repubblica agreed that the us would have had to make good on its promises of " terrible consequences " if iran had attacked israel - even though the us " had stuck its neck out too far " - but conceded that it can now " allow itself the liberty of not doing anything -lrb- … -rrb- and dream the dreams of reconciliation with iran and negotiations with palestine . " after all , " the third world war that george bush had threatened last month as an inevitable reaction to iran 's nuclear bomb plans wo n't happen - at least not at the moment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 05.12.2007 otto dix in chemnitz : major art for a minor town großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the museum 's opening , a visitor eyed an otto dix painting from 1921 the eastern german city of chemnitz made a big-league art acquisition when it lured a major collection of otto dix paintings to a new home there .
the deal is part of the town 's overall move to make a cultural comeback . in an amazing coup , down-and-out chemnitz beat stronger rivals like leipzig , dresden and stuttgart to acquire the private collection of munich gallery owner alfred gunzenhauser . the 2,945 piece collection - itself a surprise as few people knew of its existence - includes 290 artworks by new objectivist painter otto dix , numerous works by expressionists such as ernst ludwig kirchner , and more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eye for art : gunzenhauser found a home for his collection from the various cities that showed interest , which included stuttgart and berlin as well as saxony neighbors leipzig and dresden , gunzenhauser selected chemnitz as a home for his collection , after the town offered to create a permanent home for the artworks . strength in numbers the gunzenhauser museum was dedicated on dec .
1 , 2004 . " chemnitz was the first city that could offer the collection its own house , " said thomas freidrich , the gunzenhauser museum 's curator . " it is only by showing the core of the collection all together that the works can be best appreciated , " he said .
" until now , many of the paintings were unknown .
now that they are being shown together , we are realizing what an absolute treasure we have on our hands . " officials hope the creation of a world-class modern art museum will help bring back some of the former glory to chemnitz , a city with a dwindling population and 10 percent unemployment . artistic tradition in chemnitz art in chemnitz has a " long and deeply rooted " tradition , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german artists are repesented in the collection , including johannes grützke " around the end of the 19th century , business - mostly textiles - in chemnitz was booming , " he said .
" industrialists invested a lot of money in art and architecture .
as a result , art and architecture flourished . " in the 1920s , the galerie der moderne showed works by expressionists and die brücke - the most modern artists of the time . but then came the double blows of the nazis ' destruction of " degenerate art , " followed by the bleak years under communist rule , when the city became known as karl- marx stadt .
it has yet to recover , financially or culturally . yet today , the third-largest city in the struggling state of saxony is working hard to re-establish its reputation as a cultural mecca .
the city 's recently adopted motto is " chemnitz - the modern city , " - referring in part to the city 's deep roots in the modernist movements of the 1920s .
it is an image ingrid mössinger , the director of the city 's art collections , has gone to almost superhuman lengths to support . mössinger 's many coups one of mössinger 's earliest art-world successes was snagging the international blockbuster picasso and his women for chemnitz 's art museum , the kunstsammlung chemnitz .
she also conceived and curated a current show of paintings by singer-songwriter bob dylan , which will eventually travel to new york and other destinations . a " series of fortunate events " between 2002 and 2003 led to the acquisition of gunzenhauser 's collection , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building 's expressionist architecture suits the collecton , many say " it was chemnitz 's good luck that just at the time when mr. gunzenhauser was looking for a home for his works , the right people with the right means came together and made that happen , " friedrich said . first of all , mössinger got wind that the collection was available .
then she got the needed support from chemnitz 's then-mayor .
finally , a local savings bank moved out of its downtown headquarters , leaving an empty building just waiting to be renovated into a museum . a perfect match the expressionist facade of the new museum matches well with the content , friedrich says .
and in chemnitz , the collection has a chance to come into its own - moreso than if it had gone to a city with a more developed museum scene . " if he had given his collection to a gallery in munich or berlin , the collection would have barely been noticed , considering how much art those cities already have , " friedrich said .
" mr. gunzenhauser certainly wanted his collection to get the most attention possible . " not only will the collection benefit from its connection to chemnitz , but , organizers hope , chemnitz will benefit from the collection . in general , investing in art as a means of boosting the economy has become a common tactic for european cities .
among the first to do so was bilbao - and to great effect .
the industrial town in northern spain underwent a renaissance after it opened its frank gehry-designed guggenheim museum .
the phenomenon soon got the name " the bilbao effect . " possible ' bilbao effect ' " its possible chemnitz could experience some ' bilbao effect ' from this museum , " the curator conceded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid mössinger was first to bring dylan paintings to the public " in terms of being an art city , chemnitz has been behind dresden and leipzig up to now .
but through the gunzenhauser collection , i imagine that the tables have turned , and now people will recognize chemnitz as a serious city of art and culture … .
we are expecting tourism to improve here as a result . " friedrich added that since the museum opened , he has been deluged by requests for information about how to get to the city , museum opening hours , catalogs , and people wanting to know how to give coupons for exhibit tickets as christmas presents . but whether the positive effect will be long-term or short-lived remains to be seen , he said . " of course , we 'll do our best to see that it lasts .
the collection certainly has enough potential to stay fresh for the long term . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal is part of the town 's overall move to make a cultural comeback . in an amazing coup , down-and-out chemnitz beat stronger rivals like leipzig , dresden and stuttgart to acquire the private collection of munich gallery owner alfred gunzenhauser . the 2,945 piece collection - itself a surprise as few people knew of its existence - includes 290 artworks by new objectivist painter otto dix , numerous works by expressionists such as ernst ludwig kirchner , and more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eye for art : gunzenhauser found a home for his collection from the various cities that showed interest , which included stuttgart and berlin as well as saxony neighbors leipzig and dresden , gunzenhauser selected chemnitz as a home for his collection , after the town offered to create a permanent home for the artworks . strength in numbers the gunzenhauser museum was dedicated on dec .
1 , 2004 . " chemnitz was the first city that could offer the collection its own house , " said thomas freidrich , the gunzenhauser museum 's curator . " it is only by showing the core of the collection all together that the works can be best appreciated , " he said .
" until now , many of the paintings were unknown .
now that they are being shown together , we are realizing what an absolute treasure we have on our hands . " officials hope the creation of a world-class modern art museum will help bring back some of the former glory to chemnitz , a city with a dwindling population and 10 percent unemployment . artistic tradition in chemnitz art in chemnitz has a " long and deeply rooted " tradition , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german artists are repesented in the collection , including johannes grützke " around the end of the 19th century , business - mostly textiles - in chemnitz was booming , " he said .
" industrialists invested a lot of money in art and architecture .
as a result , art and architecture flourished . " in the 1920s , the galerie der moderne showed works by expressionists and die brücke - the most modern artists of the time . but then came the double blows of the nazis ' destruction of " degenerate art , " followed by the bleak years under communist rule , when the city became known as karl- marx stadt .
it has yet to recover , financially or culturally . yet today , the third-largest city in the struggling state of saxony is working hard to re-establish its reputation as a cultural mecca .
the city 's recently adopted motto is " chemnitz - the modern city , " - referring in part to the city 's deep roots in the modernist movements of the 1920s .
it is an image ingrid mössinger , the director of the city 's art collections , has gone to almost superhuman lengths to support . mössinger 's many coups one of mössinger 's earliest art-world successes was snagging the international blockbuster picasso and his women for chemnitz 's art museum , the kunstsammlung chemnitz .
she also conceived and curated a current show of paintings by singer-songwriter bob dylan , which will eventually travel to new york and other destinations . a " series of fortunate events " between 2002 and 2003 led to the acquisition of gunzenhauser 's collection , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building 's expressionist architecture suits the collecton , many say " it was chemnitz 's good luck that just at the time when mr. gunzenhauser was looking for a home for his works , the right people with the right means came together and made that happen , " friedrich said . first of all , mössinger got wind that the collection was available .
then she got the needed support from chemnitz 's then-mayor .
finally , a local savings bank moved out of its downtown headquarters , leaving an empty building just waiting to be renovated into a museum . a perfect match the expressionist facade of the new museum matches well with the content , friedrich says .
and in chemnitz , the collection has a chance to come into its own - moreso than if it had gone to a city with a more developed museum scene . " if he had given his collection to a gallery in munich or berlin , the collection would have barely been noticed , considering how much art those cities already have , " friedrich said .
" mr. gunzenhauser certainly wanted his collection to get the most attention possible . " not only will the collection benefit from its connection to chemnitz , but , organizers hope , chemnitz will benefit from the collection . in general , investing in art as a means of boosting the economy has become a common tactic for european cities .
among the first to do so was bilbao - and to great effect .
the industrial town in northern spain underwent a renaissance after it opened its frank gehry-designed guggenheim museum .
the phenomenon soon got the name " the bilbao effect . " possible ' bilbao effect ' " its possible chemnitz could experience some ' bilbao effect ' from this museum , " the curator conceded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid mössinger was first to bring dylan paintings to the public " in terms of being an art city , chemnitz has been behind dresden and leipzig up to now .
but through the gunzenhauser collection , i imagine that the tables have turned , and now people will recognize chemnitz as a serious city of art and culture … .
we are expecting tourism to improve here as a result . " friedrich added that since the museum opened , he has been deluged by requests for information about how to get to the city , museum opening hours , catalogs , and people wanting to know how to give coupons for exhibit tickets as christmas presents . but whether the positive effect will be long-term or short-lived remains to be seen , he said . " of course , we 'll do our best to see that it lasts .
the collection certainly has enough potential to stay fresh for the long term . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal is part of the town 's overall move to make a cultural comeback . in an amazing coup , down-and-out chemnitz beat stronger rivals like leipzig , dresden and stuttgart to acquire the private collection of munich gallery owner alfred gunzenhauser . the 2,945 piece collection - itself a surprise as few people knew of its existence - includes 290 artworks by new objectivist painter otto dix , numerous works by expressionists such as ernst ludwig kirchner , and more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eye for art : gunzenhauser found a home for his collection from the various cities that showed interest , which included stuttgart and berlin as well as saxony neighbors leipzig and dresden , gunzenhauser selected chemnitz as a home for his collection , after the town offered to create a permanent home for the artworks . strength in numbers the gunzenhauser museum was dedicated on dec .
1 , 2004 . " chemnitz was the first city that could offer the collection its own house , " said thomas freidrich , the gunzenhauser museum 's curator . " it is only by showing the core of the collection all together that the works can be best appreciated , " he said .
" until now , many of the paintings were unknown .
now that they are being shown together , we are realizing what an absolute treasure we have on our hands . " officials hope the creation of a world-class modern art museum will help bring back some of the former glory to chemnitz , a city with a dwindling population and 10 percent unemployment . artistic tradition in chemnitz art in chemnitz has a " long and deeply rooted " tradition , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german artists are repesented in the collection , including johannes grützke " around the end of the 19th century , business - mostly textiles - in chemnitz was booming , " he said .
" industrialists invested a lot of money in art and architecture .
as a result , art and architecture flourished . " in the 1920s , the galerie der moderne showed works by expressionists and die brücke - the most modern artists of the time . but then came the double blows of the nazis ' destruction of " degenerate art , " followed by the bleak years under communist rule , when the city became known as karl- marx stadt .

in any case , world war three has been avoided - at least for now . writing on wednesday , dec .
5 , from munich , the süddeutsche zeitung said the recent us report , which stated that iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 , was intended to avoid a mistake similar to the invasion of iraq in 2001 . " the domestic consequences of the reversal are incalculable , " continued the paper .
" the distrust will now intensify in favor of the democrats . " only democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton 's popularity will suffer from the report as she had been the most outspoken against iran in her party , opined the süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report could be bad for clinton 's election campaign the berliner zeitung , writing tuesday from the german capital , said the security report would impact elections in iran as well . " in iran , all of the political camps will have to attentively follow the developments , " wrote the paper .
" parliamentary elections are next year and the policy of the west will help decide how the advocates of reform fair . " other newspapers focused on the effects the latest intelligence report will have on peace elsewhere in the middle east . while some , especially israel , concentrated on the news that iran indeed had a nuclear weapons program prior to 2003 , others saw the new information as " a success for diplomacy that sweeps all military options off the table , " wrote vienna 's der standard on wednesday . " but one pillar of -lsb- the us ' -rsb- middle east policy has just collapsed - one that played a role in the israeli-palestinian peace conference in annapolis in the form of a security guarantee for israel , " concluded the paper . similarly , london 's the guardian saw the intelligence paper as a potential danger for israel . " no matter who is president in washington , israel now confronts a united american military and intelligence front declaring that the iranian nuclear issue is not urgent and probably not dangerous and rejecting an american military response , " commented the paper wednesday . bush , however , " judging by his immediate reaction to the nie -lsb- report -rsb- , will continue to be sympathetic to israel 's concerns . " in contrast , others expressed the hope that the knowledge that iran does not possess nuclear weapons could encourage negotiation and diplomacy on all sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will tehran respond to the report with a willingness to talk ?
" when we assume that tehran does n't have any military nuclear program , then , first of all , the danger of a military attack is reduced and , secondly , it means that negotiation is possible , " wrote le figaro wednesday from paris .
" a detente would also help peace in lebanon and palestine .
but tehran has to respond to washington 's open door . " from rome on tuesday , la repubblica agreed that the us would have had to make good on its promises of " terrible consequences " if iran had attacked israel - even though the us " had stuck its neck out too far " - but conceded that it can now " allow itself the liberty of not doing anything -lrb- … -rrb- and dream the dreams of reconciliation with iran and negotiations with palestine .

the deal is part of the town 's overall move to make a cultural comeback . in an amazing coup , down-and-out chemnitz beat stronger rivals like leipzig , dresden and stuttgart to acquire the private collection of munich gallery owner alfred gunzenhauser . the 2,945 piece collection - itself a surprise as few people knew of its existence - includes 290 artworks by new objectivist painter otto dix , numerous works by expressionists such as ernst ludwig kirchner , and more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eye for art : gunzenhauser found a home for his collection from the various cities that showed interest , which included stuttgart and berlin as well as saxony neighbors leipzig and dresden , gunzenhauser selected chemnitz as a home for his collection , after the town offered to create a permanent home for the artworks . strength in numbers the gunzenhauser museum was dedicated on dec .
1 , 2004 . " chemnitz was the first city that could offer the collection its own house , " said thomas freidrich , the gunzenhauser museum 's curator . " it is only by showing the core of the collection all together that the works can be best appreciated , " he said .
" until now , many of the paintings were unknown .
now that they are being shown together , we are realizing what an absolute treasure we have on our hands . " officials hope the creation of a world-class modern art museum will help bring back some of the former glory to chemnitz , a city with a dwindling population and 10 percent unemployment . artistic tradition in chemnitz art in chemnitz has a " long and deeply rooted " tradition , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german artists are repesented in the collection , including johannes grützke " around the end of the 19th century , business - mostly textiles - in chemnitz was booming , " he said .
" industrialists invested a lot of money in art and architecture .
as a result , art and architecture flourished . " in the 1920s , the galerie der moderne showed works by expressionists and die brücke - the most modern artists of the time . but then came the double blows of the nazis ' destruction of " degenerate art , " followed by the bleak years under communist rule , when the city became known as karl- marx stadt .
it has yet to recover , financially or culturally . yet today , the third-largest city in the struggling state of saxony is working hard to re-establish its reputation as a cultural mecca .
the city 's recently adopted motto is " chemnitz - the modern city , " - referring in part to the city 's deep roots in the modernist movements of the 1920s .
it is an image ingrid mössinger , the director of the city 's art collections , has gone to almost superhuman lengths to support . mössinger 's many coups one of mössinger 's earliest art-world successes was snagging the international blockbuster picasso and his women for chemnitz 's art museum , the kunstsammlung chemnitz .
she also conceived and curated a current show of paintings by singer-songwriter bob dylan , which will eventually travel to new york and other destinations . a " series of fortunate events " between 2002 and 2003 led to the acquisition of gunzenhauser 's collection , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building 's expressionist architecture suits the collecton , many say " it was chemnitz 's good luck that just at the time when mr. gunzenhauser was looking for a home for his works , the right people with the right means came together and made that happen , " friedrich said . first of all , mössinger got wind that the collection was available .
then she got the needed support from chemnitz 's then-mayor .
finally , a local savings bank moved out of its downtown headquarters , leaving an empty building just waiting to be renovated into a museum . a perfect match the expressionist facade of the new museum matches well with the content , friedrich says .
and in chemnitz , the collection has a chance to come into its own - moreso than if it had gone to a city with a more developed museum scene . " if he had given his collection to a gallery in munich or berlin , the collection would have barely been noticed , considering how much art those cities already have , " friedrich said .
" mr. gunzenhauser certainly wanted his collection to get the most attention possible . " not only will the collection benefit from its connection to chemnitz , but , organizers hope , chemnitz will benefit from the collection . in general , investing in art as a means of boosting the economy has become a common tactic for european cities .
among the first to do so was bilbao - and to great effect .
the industrial town in northern spain underwent a renaissance after it opened its frank gehry-designed guggenheim museum .
the phenomenon soon got the name " the bilbao effect . " possible ' bilbao effect ' " its possible chemnitz could experience some ' bilbao effect ' from this museum , " the curator conceded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid mössinger was first to bring dylan paintings to the public " in terms of being an art city , chemnitz has been behind dresden and leipzig up to now .
but through the gunzenhauser collection , i imagine that the tables have turned , and now people will recognize chemnitz as a serious city of art and culture … .
we are expecting tourism to improve here as a result . " friedrich added that since the museum opened , he has been deluged by requests for information about how to get to the city , museum opening hours , catalogs , and people wanting to know how to give coupons for exhibit tickets as christmas presents . but whether the positive effect will be long-term or short-lived remains to be seen , he said . " of course , we 'll do our best to see that it lasts .
the collection certainly has enough potential to stay fresh for the long term . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , 2004 . " chemnitz was the first city that could offer the collection its own house , " said thomas freidrich , the gunzenhauser museum 's curator . " it is only by showing the core of the collection all together that the works can be best appreciated , " he said .
" until now , many of the paintings were unknown .
now that they are being shown together , we are realizing what an absolute treasure we have on our hands . " officials hope the creation of a world-class modern art museum will help bring back some of the former glory to chemnitz , a city with a dwindling population and 10 percent unemployment . artistic tradition in chemnitz art in chemnitz has a " long and deeply rooted " tradition , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german artists are repesented in the collection , including johannes grützke " around the end of the 19th century , business - mostly textiles - in chemnitz was booming , " he said .
" industrialists invested a lot of money in art and architecture .
as a result , art and architecture flourished . " in the 1920s , the galerie der moderne showed works by expressionists and die brücke - the most modern artists of the time . but then came the double blows of the nazis ' destruction of " degenerate art , " followed by the bleak years under communist rule , when the city became known as karl- marx stadt .
it has yet to recover , financially or culturally . yet today , the third-largest city in the struggling state of saxony is working hard to re-establish its reputation as a cultural mecca .
the city 's recently adopted motto is " chemnitz - the modern city , " - referring in part to the city 's deep roots in the modernist movements of the 1920s .
it is an image ingrid mössinger , the director of the city 's art collections , has gone to almost superhuman lengths to support . mössinger 's many coups one of mössinger 's earliest art-world successes was snagging the international blockbuster picasso and his women for chemnitz 's art museum , the kunstsammlung chemnitz .
she also conceived and curated a current show of paintings by singer-songwriter bob dylan , which will eventually travel to new york and other destinations . a " series of fortunate events " between 2002 and 2003 led to the acquisition of gunzenhauser 's collection , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building 's expressionist architecture suits the collecton , many say " it was chemnitz 's good luck that just at the time when mr. gunzenhauser was looking for a home for his works , the right people with the right means came together and made that happen , " friedrich said . first of all , mössinger got wind that the collection was available .
then she got the needed support from chemnitz 's then-mayor .
finally , a local savings bank moved out of its downtown headquarters , leaving an empty building just waiting to be renovated into a museum . a perfect match the expressionist facade of the new museum matches well with the content , friedrich says .
and in chemnitz , the collection has a chance to come into its own - moreso than if it had gone to a city with a more developed museum scene . " if he had given his collection to a gallery in munich or berlin , the collection would have barely been noticed , considering how much art those cities already have , " friedrich said .
" mr. gunzenhauser certainly wanted his collection to get the most attention possible . " not only will the collection benefit from its connection to chemnitz , but , organizers hope , chemnitz will benefit from the collection . in general , investing in art as a means of boosting the economy has become a common tactic for european cities .
among the first to do so was bilbao - and to great effect .
the industrial town in northern spain underwent a renaissance after it opened its frank gehry-designed guggenheim museum .
the phenomenon soon got the name " the bilbao effect . " possible ' bilbao effect ' " its possible chemnitz could experience some ' bilbao effect ' from this museum , " the curator conceded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid mössinger was first to bring dylan paintings to the public " in terms of being an art city , chemnitz has been behind dresden and leipzig up to now .
but through the gunzenhauser collection , i imagine that the tables have turned , and now people will recognize chemnitz as a serious city of art and culture … .
we are expecting tourism to improve here as a result . " friedrich added that since the museum opened , he has been deluged by requests for information about how to get to the city , museum opening hours , catalogs , and people wanting to know how to give coupons for exhibit tickets as christmas presents . but whether the positive effect will be long-term or short-lived remains to be seen , he said . " of course , we 'll do our best to see that it lasts .
the collection certainly has enough potential to stay fresh for the long term . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there remains a cause for concern , " the spokesman said , two days after a us intelligence assessment concluded that tehran appeared to have suspended its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
at the same time , wilhelm said an offer of cooperation with iran remained in force if the government there agreed to halt enrichment , which some nations in the west fear is geared towards making a bomb .
" the findings -lrb- of the report -rrb- confirm what the german government has always said - that diplomatic negotiations are promising , " wilhelm told a press conference .
" but you also know the reality that two un security council resolutions have not been followed and that iran has not yet stopped its uranium enrichment program . "
diplomatic pressure must therefore be maintained on iran , along with a readiness to cooperate with the islamic republic if it agrees to halt enrichment , wilhelm added .

the deal is part of the town 's overall move to make a cultural comeback . in an amazing coup , down-and-out chemnitz beat stronger rivals like leipzig , dresden and stuttgart to acquire the private collection of munich gallery owner alfred gunzenhauser . the 2,945 piece collection - itself a surprise as few people knew of its existence - includes 290 artworks by new objectivist painter otto dix , numerous works by expressionists such as ernst ludwig kirchner , and more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eye for art : gunzenhauser found a home for his collection from the various cities that showed interest , which included stuttgart and berlin as well as saxony neighbors leipzig and dresden , gunzenhauser selected chemnitz as a home for his collection , after the town offered to create a permanent home for the artworks . strength in numbers the gunzenhauser museum was dedicated on dec .
1 , 2004 . " chemnitz was the first city that could offer the collection its own house , " said thomas freidrich , the gunzenhauser museum 's curator . " it is only by showing the core of the collection all together that the works can be best appreciated , " he said .
" until now , many of the paintings were unknown .
now that they are being shown together , we are realizing what an absolute treasure we have on our hands . " officials hope the creation of a world-class modern art museum will help bring back some of the former glory to chemnitz , a city with a dwindling population and 10 percent unemployment . artistic tradition in chemnitz art in chemnitz has a " long and deeply rooted " tradition , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german artists are repesented in the collection , including johannes grützke " around the end of the 19th century , business - mostly textiles - in chemnitz was booming , " he said .
" industrialists invested a lot of money in art and architecture .
as a result , art and architecture flourished . " in the 1920s , the galerie der moderne showed works by expressionists and die brücke - the most modern artists of the time . but then came the double blows of the nazis ' destruction of " degenerate art , " followed by the bleak years under communist rule , when the city became known as karl- marx stadt .
it has yet to recover , financially or culturally . yet today , the third-largest city in the struggling state of saxony is working hard to re-establish its reputation as a cultural mecca .
the city 's recently adopted motto is " chemnitz - the modern city , " - referring in part to the city 's deep roots in the modernist movements of the 1920s .
it is an image ingrid mössinger , the director of the city 's art collections , has gone to almost superhuman lengths to support . mössinger 's many coups one of mössinger 's earliest art-world successes was snagging the international blockbuster picasso and his women for chemnitz 's art museum , the kunstsammlung chemnitz .
she also conceived and curated a current show of paintings by singer-songwriter bob dylan , which will eventually travel to new york and other destinations . a " series of fortunate events " between 2002 and 2003 led to the acquisition of gunzenhauser 's collection , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building 's expressionist architecture suits the collecton , many say " it was chemnitz 's good luck that just at the time when mr. gunzenhauser was looking for a home for his works , the right people with the right means came together and made that happen , " friedrich said . first of all , mössinger got wind that the collection was available .
then she got the needed support from chemnitz 's then-mayor .
finally , a local savings bank moved out of its downtown headquarters , leaving an empty building just waiting to be renovated into a museum . a perfect match the expressionist facade of the new museum matches well with the content , friedrich says .
and in chemnitz , the collection has a chance to come into its own - moreso than if it had gone to a city with a more developed museum scene . " if he had given his collection to a gallery in munich or berlin , the collection would have barely been noticed , considering how much art those cities already have , " friedrich said .
" mr. gunzenhauser certainly wanted his collection to get the most attention possible . " not only will the collection benefit from its connection to chemnitz , but , organizers hope , chemnitz will benefit from the collection . in general , investing in art as a means of boosting the economy has become a common tactic for european cities .
among the first to do so was bilbao - and to great effect .
the industrial town in northern spain underwent a renaissance after it opened its frank gehry-designed guggenheim museum .
the phenomenon soon got the name " the bilbao effect . " possible ' bilbao effect ' " its possible chemnitz could experience some ' bilbao effect ' from this museum , " the curator conceded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid mössinger was first to bring dylan paintings to the public " in terms of being an art city , chemnitz has been behind dresden and leipzig up to now .
but through the gunzenhauser collection , i imagine that the tables have turned , and now people will recognize chemnitz as a serious city of art and culture … .
we are expecting tourism to improve here as a result . " friedrich added that since the museum opened , he has been deluged by requests for information about how to get to the city , museum opening hours , catalogs , and people wanting to know how to give coupons for exhibit tickets as christmas presents . but whether the positive effect will be long-term or short-lived remains to be seen , he said . " of course , we 'll do our best to see that it lasts .
the collection certainly has enough potential to stay fresh for the long term . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal is part of the town 's overall move to make a cultural comeback . in an amazing coup , down-and-out chemnitz beat stronger rivals like leipzig , dresden and stuttgart to acquire the private collection of munich gallery owner alfred gunzenhauser . the 2,945 piece collection - itself a surprise as few people knew of its existence - includes 290 artworks by new objectivist painter otto dix , numerous works by expressionists such as ernst ludwig kirchner , and more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eye for art : gunzenhauser found a home for his collection from the various cities that showed interest , which included stuttgart and berlin as well as saxony neighbors leipzig and dresden , gunzenhauser selected chemnitz as a home for his collection , after the town offered to create a permanent home for the artworks . strength in numbers the gunzenhauser museum was dedicated on dec .
1 , 2004 . " chemnitz was the first city that could offer the collection its own house , " said thomas freidrich , the gunzenhauser museum 's curator . " it is only by showing the core of the collection all together that the works can be best appreciated , " he said .
" until now , many of the paintings were unknown .
now that they are being shown together , we are realizing what an absolute treasure we have on our hands . " officials hope the creation of a world-class modern art museum will help bring back some of the former glory to chemnitz , a city with a dwindling population and 10 percent unemployment . artistic tradition in chemnitz art in chemnitz has a " long and deeply rooted " tradition , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german artists are repesented in the collection , including johannes grützke " around the end of the 19th century , business - mostly textiles - in chemnitz was booming , " he said .
" industrialists invested a lot of money in art and architecture .
as a result , art and architecture flourished . " in the 1920s , the galerie der moderne showed works by expressionists and die brücke - the most modern artists of the time . but then came the double blows of the nazis ' destruction of " degenerate art , " followed by the bleak years under communist rule , when the city became known as karl- marx stadt .
it has yet to recover , financially or culturally . yet today , the third-largest city in the struggling state of saxony is working hard to re-establish its reputation as a cultural mecca .
the city 's recently adopted motto is " chemnitz - the modern city , " - referring in part to the city 's deep roots in the modernist movements of the 1920s .
it is an image ingrid mössinger , the director of the city 's art collections , has gone to almost superhuman lengths to support . mössinger 's many coups one of mössinger 's earliest art-world successes was snagging the international blockbuster picasso and his women for chemnitz 's art museum , the kunstsammlung chemnitz .
she also conceived and curated a current show of paintings by singer-songwriter bob dylan , which will eventually travel to new york and other destinations . a " series of fortunate events " between 2002 and 2003 led to the acquisition of gunzenhauser 's collection , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building 's expressionist architecture suits the collecton , many say " it was chemnitz 's good luck that just at the time when mr. gunzenhauser was looking for a home for his works , the right people with the right means came together and made that happen , " friedrich said . first of all , mössinger got wind that the collection was available .
then she got the needed support from chemnitz 's then-mayor .
finally , a local savings bank moved out of its downtown headquarters , leaving an empty building just waiting to be renovated into a museum . a perfect match the expressionist facade of the new museum matches well with the content , friedrich says .
and in chemnitz , the collection has a chance to come into its own - moreso than if it had gone to a city with a more developed museum scene . " if he had given his collection to a gallery in munich or berlin , the collection would have barely been noticed , considering how much art those cities already have , " friedrich said .
" mr. gunzenhauser certainly wanted his collection to get the most attention possible . " not only will the collection benefit from its connection to chemnitz , but , organizers hope , chemnitz will benefit from the collection . in general , investing in art as a means of boosting the economy has become a common tactic for european cities .
among the first to do so was bilbao - and to great effect .
the industrial town in northern spain underwent a renaissance after it opened its frank gehry-designed guggenheim museum .
the phenomenon soon got the name " the bilbao effect . " possible ' bilbao effect ' " its possible chemnitz could experience some ' bilbao effect ' from this museum , " the curator conceded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid mössinger was first to bring dylan paintings to the public " in terms of being an art city , chemnitz has been behind dresden and leipzig up to now .
but through the gunzenhauser collection , i imagine that the tables have turned , and now people will recognize chemnitz as a serious city of art and culture … .
we are expecting tourism to improve here as a result . " friedrich added that since the museum opened , he has been deluged by requests for information about how to get to the city , museum opening hours , catalogs , and people wanting to know how to give coupons for exhibit tickets as christmas presents . but whether the positive effect will be long-term or short-lived remains to be seen , he said . " of course , we 'll do our best to see that it lasts .
the collection certainly has enough potential to stay fresh for the long term . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal is part of the town 's overall move to make a cultural comeback . in an amazing coup , down-and-out chemnitz beat stronger rivals like leipzig , dresden and stuttgart to acquire the private collection of munich gallery owner alfred gunzenhauser . the 2,945 piece collection - itself a surprise as few people knew of its existence - includes 290 artworks by new objectivist painter otto dix , numerous works by expressionists such as ernst ludwig kirchner , and more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eye for art : gunzenhauser found a home for his collection from the various cities that showed interest , which included stuttgart and berlin as well as saxony neighbors leipzig and dresden , gunzenhauser selected chemnitz as a home for his collection , after the town offered to create a permanent home for the artworks . strength in numbers the gunzenhauser museum was dedicated on dec .
1 , 2004 . " chemnitz was the first city that could offer the collection its own house , " said thomas freidrich , the gunzenhauser museum 's curator . " it is only by showing the core of the collection all together that the works can be best appreciated , " he said .
" until now , many of the paintings were unknown .
now that they are being shown together , we are realizing what an absolute treasure we have on our hands . " officials hope the creation of a world-class modern art museum will help bring back some of the former glory to chemnitz , a city with a dwindling population and 10 percent unemployment . artistic tradition in chemnitz art in chemnitz has a " long and deeply rooted " tradition , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german artists are repesented in the collection , including johannes grützke " around the end of the 19th century , business - mostly textiles - in chemnitz was booming , " he said .
" industrialists invested a lot of money in art and architecture .
as a result , art and architecture flourished . " in the 1920s , the galerie der moderne showed works by expressionists and die brücke - the most modern artists of the time . but then came the double blows of the nazis ' destruction of " degenerate art , " followed by the bleak years under communist rule , when the city became known as karl- marx stadt .
it has yet to recover , financially or culturally . yet today , the third-largest city in the struggling state of saxony is working hard to re-establish its reputation as a cultural mecca .
the city 's recently adopted motto is " chemnitz - the modern city , " - referring in part to the city 's deep roots in the modernist movements of the 1920s .
it is an image ingrid mössinger , the director of the city 's art collections , has gone to almost superhuman lengths to support . mössinger 's many coups one of mössinger 's earliest art-world successes was snagging the international blockbuster picasso and his women for chemnitz 's art museum , the kunstsammlung chemnitz .
she also conceived and curated a current show of paintings by singer-songwriter bob dylan , which will eventually travel to new york and other destinations . a " series of fortunate events " between 2002 and 2003 led to the acquisition of gunzenhauser 's collection , friedrich explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building 's expressionist architecture suits the collecton , many say " it was chemnitz 's good luck that just at the time when mr. gunzenhauser was looking for a home for his works , the right people with the right means came together and made that happen , " friedrich said . first of all , mössinger got wind that the collection was available .
then she got the needed support from chemnitz 's then-mayor .
finally , a local savings bank moved out of its downtown headquarters , leaving an empty building just waiting to be renovated into a museum . a perfect match the expressionist facade of the new museum matches well with the content , friedrich says .
and in chemnitz , the collection has a chance to come into its own - moreso than if it had gone to a city with a more developed museum scene . " if he had given his collection to a gallery in munich or berlin , the collection would have barely been noticed , considering how much art those cities already have , " friedrich said .
" mr. gunzenhauser certainly wanted his collection to get the most attention possible . " not only will the collection benefit from its connection to chemnitz , but , organizers hope , chemnitz will benefit from the collection . in general , investing in art as a means of boosting the economy has become a common tactic for european cities .
among the first to do so was bilbao - and to great effect .
the industrial town in northern spain underwent a renaissance after it opened its frank gehry-designed guggenheim museum .
the phenomenon soon got the name " the bilbao effect . " possible ' bilbao effect ' " its possible chemnitz could experience some ' bilbao effect ' from this museum , " the curator conceded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid mössinger was first to bring dylan paintings to the public " in terms of being an art city , chemnitz has been behind dresden and leipzig up to now .
but through the gunzenhauser collection , i imagine that the tables have turned , and now people will recognize chemnitz as a serious city of art and culture … .
we are expecting tourism to improve here as a result . " friedrich added that since the museum opened , he has been deluged by requests for information about how to get to the city , museum opening hours , catalogs , and people wanting to know how to give coupons for exhibit tickets as christmas presents . but whether the positive effect will be long-term or short-lived remains to be seen , he said . " of course , we 'll do our best to see that it lasts .
the collection certainly has enough potential to stay fresh for the long term . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a worldwide survey has revealed teenagers in wales are falling behind other countries in basic education .
the 15-year-olds scored below average in maths and reading and average in science , said the organisation for economic co-operation and development .
the uk as a whole fared worse than in previous years , but welsh students came bottom of the " home " nations .
the education minister welcomed the report as a " snapshot " of where wales stands on the international stage .
the programme for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- performance tables are based on tests taken by 15-year-olds and involved 400,000 15-year-olds from 57 countries . "
we are round about countries like azerbaijan and croatia and this should be some kind of joke but it is not " prof david reynolds , education expert the results are published every three years , but the uk did not participate in the last round of tests , taken in 2003 .
in what was the first year wales has been considered separately from england , welsh students fared significantly worse than their peers in their neighbouring country .
they tested below average in maths and reading , but average in science .
in maths , the mean score of students in england and scotland was " significantly higher " than in wales .
and while reading performance in england , scotland and northern ireland was similar , in wales the average score was lower .
performance in science across all four parts of the uk was similar .
but the report adds that the average score of students in wales was significantly lower than in england .
wales ' education minister jane hutt reacted to the report saying her priority was to secure better outcomes for learners , not just to score highly in pisa rankings .
however , she added : " not that we do not recognise the importance of pisa as a yardstick against which we can measure our progress .
' strengths and weaknesses ' " the real benefits of the pisa assessments will come not from the headline figures and league table rankings , but from the detailed analysis of strengths and weaknesses and what more we can learn from the best and most effective practice internationally . "
david reynolds , professor of education at plymouth university described the survey results for wales as " shocking " .
" we are round about countries like azerbaijan and croatia and this should be some kind of joke but it is not , " he said .
" there are two hints as to why this is happening .
we do n't seem to have enough able pupils .
" we always in wales were told that our problem was the lower achieving pupils .
but we have not got a high enough proportion of pupils doing well and so overall our scores are down .
" the other hint is that it is money .
over time the assembly probably has not spent on education what it should . "
prof reynolds called for the creation of a cross party commission to investigate the findings .
pisa researchers said they attempted to discover how well pupils could apply knowledge , rather than simply regurgitate facts and figures .
their results marked a sharp fall for britain overall from where it stood in 2000 .
it fell from eighth to 24th for maths , with some pupils in china scoring top marks in the subject .
in reading , the uk fell from seventh to 17th , placing it below countries including estonia and poland .

a worldwide survey has revealed teenagers in wales are falling behind other countries in basic education .
the 15-year-olds scored below average in maths and reading and average in science , said the organisation for economic co-operation and development .
the uk as a whole fared worse than in previous years , but welsh students came bottom of the " home " nations .
the education minister welcomed the report as a " snapshot " of where wales stands on the international stage .
the programme for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- performance tables are based on tests taken by 15-year-olds and involved 400,000 15-year-olds from 57 countries .
we are round about countries like azerbaijan and croatia and this should be some kind of joke but it is not prof david reynolds , education expert the results are published every three years , but the uk did not participate in the last round of tests , taken in 2003 .
in what was the first year wales has been considered separately from england , welsh students fared significantly worse than their peers in their neighbouring country .
they tested below average in maths and reading , but average in science .
in maths , the mean score of students in england and scotland was " significantly higher " than in wales .
and while reading performance in england , scotland and northern ireland was similar , in wales the average score was lower .
performance in science across all four parts of the uk was similar .
but the report adds that the average score of students in wales was significantly lower than in england .
wales ' education minister jane hutt reacted to the report saying her priority was to secure better outcomes for learners , not just to score highly in pisa rankings .
however , she added : " not that we do not recognise the importance of pisa as a yardstick against which we can measure our progress .
' strengths and weaknesses ' " the real benefits of the pisa assessments will come not from the headline figures and league table rankings , but from the detailed analysis of strengths and weaknesses and what more we can learn from the best and most effective practice internationally . "
david reynolds , professor of education at plymouth university described the survey results for wales as " shocking " .
" we are round about countries like azerbaijan and croatia and this should be some kind of joke but it is not , " he said .
" there are two hints as to why this is happening .
we do n't seem to have enough able pupils .
" we always in wales were told that our problem was the lower achieving pupils .
but we have not got a high enough proportion of pupils doing well and so overall our scores are down .
" the other hint is that it is money .
over time the assembly probably has not spent on education what it should . "
prof reynolds called for the creation of a cross party commission to investigate the findings .
pisa researchers said they attempted to discover how well pupils could apply knowledge , rather than simply regurgitate facts and figures .
their results marked a sharp fall for britain overall from where it stood in 2000 .
it fell from eighth to 24th for maths , with some pupils in china scoring top marks in the subject .
in reading , the uk fell from seventh to 17th , placing it below countries including estonia and poland .

mr trump will decide in the next 30 days whether or not to buy a site in county antrim .
the pair met in new york on tuesday after mr paisley found out the businessman was interested in investing in northern ireland .
the first minister said they had a good discussion .
last week the property tycoon had proposals turned down by aberdeenshire council to build the resort there .
environmental groups however , scottish ministers have stepped in to decide whether or not to give the site the go-ahead .
earlier on tuesday , the trump organisation 's head of international development , george sorial , said the company was not considering appealing the plans , for the menie estate near balmedie .
the trump international links scheme was to include two championship golf courses and 1,500 homes .
mr trump claimed he needed to build the houses to pay for the development , which he wanted to construct over the next five years at the 1,400 acre site .
the proposals were criticised by some environmental groups and local campaigners but , at the same time , received backing from some business figures .
a scottish government statement issued on tuesday said : " ministers recognise that the application raises issues of importance that require consideration at a national level .
" calling the application in allows ministers the opportunity to give full scrutiny to all aspects of this proposal before reaching a final decision . "

mr trump will decide in the next 30 days whether or not to buy a site in county antrim .
the pair met in new york on tuesday after mr paisley found out the businessman was interested in investing in northern ireland .
the first minister said they had a good discussion .
last week the property tycoon had proposals turned down by aberdeenshire council to build the resort there .
environmental groups however , scottish ministers have stepped in to decide whether or not to give the site the go-ahead .
earlier on tuesday , the trump organisation 's head of international development , george sorial , said the company was not considering appealing the plans , for the menie estate near balmedie .
the trump international links scheme was to include two championship golf courses and 1,500 homes .
mr trump claimed he needed to build the houses to pay for the development , which he wanted to construct over the next five years at the 1,400 acre site .
the proposals were criticised by some environmental groups and local campaigners but , at the same time , received backing from some business figures .
a scottish government statement issued on tuesday said : " ministers recognise that the application raises issues of importance that require consideration at a national level .
" calling the application in allows ministers the opportunity to give full scrutiny to all aspects of this proposal before reaching a final decision . "

more than 20 police armed with riot shields and batons were involved in a five-hour stand-off with 100 tourists from hubei province , local media say .
the last straw came at a windy beach where the tourists were not allowed to retrieve warm clothing from coaches .
the gambling hotspot has become a key destination for mainland tourists .
scuffle the tourists had complained to their guides that they wanted to see more of the former portuguese colony 's historic sites .
they said they were being pressured into buying goods .
a scuffle broke out at the beach when the tourists were not allowed to re-board their four locked coaches to get some warmer clothing .
police tried to push back the angry tourists with batons and detained at least four .
" some tourists refused to let some of our colleagues go and attempted to use violence , " one police officer told the south china morning post .
it was not until about 2200 local time -lrb- 1400 gmt -rrb- that government officials persuaded the tourists to return to their hotels .
macau tourism officials said the incident was a " one-off situation " .
tourist figures show that some 22 million people visited macau last year , most from the mainland .

shareholders accused the club 's owner and directors of not properly exploring other site options .
mr kenwright , also club chairman , was accused of " being the man who murdered the soul of everton " .
but he insisted he was looking at all the options available to the club , including staying at goodison park .
feelings have been running high for months as everton have entered into discussions with tesco and the authorities in kirkby - significantly outside the city boundaries - over a new home for the team .
and mr kenwright said that if the kirkby plan does not happen , everton have a contingency plan of reconsidering a redevelopment plan goodison park .
liverpool city council has also suggested an alternative site close to the city centre on scotland road . "
guys , i 'm not an idiot , i 'm also one of you " everton chairman bill kenwright , speaking to fans at the club 's agm however , it is believed that any rebuilding of goodison will cost about £ 250m , while the kirkby project will cost about £ 150m .
mr kenwright told shareholders : " i do listen to the fans , i do n't want to leave goodison either .
" but we have had no confirmation of the cost of the scotland road site , and we have also been told that it is not big enough for a 50,000-seater stadium . "
he added : " if the kirkby project does not happen , then the plan b will be to look again at goodison park .
" and i suppose that the scotland road site would have to become a plan c. "
' best in business ' he insisted that he is simply looking for the best deal for the club .
" often as a chairman you get conspiracy theories thrown at you and you have to say , ' guys , i 'm not an idiot , i 'm also one of you .
do n't you think if there was a possibility of xyz , that i would be jumping at it ? '
" the team that we brought in to look at these situations - you 'd think we 'd brought desperate dan and corky the cat in .
" we 've got the best in the business looking at all the options , including the kirkby move . "
the board is expected to submit a detailed planning application on the kirkby stadium shortly .
shareholders also had the chance to confirm robert earl , the entrepreneur behind the planet hollywood chain , as a new director .
earl , 56 and a " former " tottenham fan , told the meeting : " i have long been an admirer of bill , and this club has fantastic potential . "

shareholders accused the club 's owner and directors of not properly exploring other site options .
mr kenwright , also club chairman , was accused of " being the man who murdered the soul of everton " .

shareholders accused the club 's owner and directors of not properly exploring other site options .
mr kenwright , also club chairman , was accused of " being the man who murdered the soul of everton " .
but he insisted he was looking at all the options available to the club , including staying at goodison park .
feelings have been running high for months as everton have entered into discussions with tesco and the authorities in kirkby - significantly outside the city boundaries - over a new home for the team .
and mr kenwright said that if the kirkby plan does not happen , everton have a contingency plan of reconsidering a redevelopment plan goodison park .
liverpool city council has also suggested an alternative site close to the city centre on scotland road .
guys , i 'm not an idiot , i 'm also one of you everton chairman bill kenwright , speaking to fans at the club 's agm however , it is believed that any rebuilding of goodison will cost about £ 250m , while the kirkby project will cost about £ 150m .
mr kenwright told shareholders : " i do listen to the fans , i do n't want to leave goodison either .
" but we have had no confirmation of the cost of the scotland road site , and we have also been told that it is not big enough for a 50,000-seater stadium . "

' broaderband ' school people living in rural parts of the country have much less choice of broadband providers , are likely to get slower speeds and pay a different price .
and with super-fast broadband on the horizon , some commentators think things are set to get a lot worse .
if you live in a rural part of the country , you could be waiting decades to get the same service that your friends and relatives in the city enjoy .
" there is going to have to be an acceptance that broadband will be faster in the cities .
the model of equal access will have to be adapted , " said ian fogg , an analyst with jupiter research .
he added : " fibre costs such a fortune to roll out that it may take decades to get to ubiquitous coverage in rural areas . "
price divide next year sees the roll-out of the next-generation of adsl , dubbed adsl2 + , which promises speeds of up to 24mbps , but like its slower cousin speeds will be dependent on how far away from the exchange people live .
schools need broadband to use scholar education software broadband test unbundled services - where operators take over bt 's telephone exchanges with their own equipment - allows rivals to offer much cheaper broadband but , because unbundling an exchange costs in the region of £ 30,000 , providers tend to stick to urban areas .
" providers are loath to do this in rural areas where less people will be connected to each exchange , " said michael phillips of consumer website broadbandchoices.co.uk.
" there is a growing digital divide as people in built-up urban areas are able to take advantage of cheaper broadband and ' free ' line rental , while those in the country are left languishing on more expensive packages , " he said .
some of the most popular deals already have difference prices dependent on where you live .
talktalk 's broadband service is available in 25 % of unbundled exchanges but for those who live outside of the areas there is a premium of £ 15 .
sky broadband relies on other wholesale products in the places where it does not have access to unbundled exchanges while tiscali charges £ 8.24 per month for line rental .
cable has also traditionally avoided rural areas for economic reasons and talk of a nationwide fibre network to provide speeds of up to 100mbps would also have to be rolled out piecemeal .
how fast your adsl is depends on how close you live to the exchange universal broaderband ?
this is a far cry from the early days of telecommunications when it was expected that telephone services would extend from john o 'groats to lands end .
in the broadband world , there is no legal requirement for bt to make it available across the uk , although with figures estimating broadband reaches around 95 % of the country , in effect it has extended its universal service agreement to broadband .
" but if we move to fibre the notion that we 'd carpet the nation overnight is logistically implausible .
it is very likely to be a gradual process , " said peter mccarthy-ward , bt 's director of equivalence .
he thinks the lessons from first-generation broadband roll-out suggest that the speed divide will not be huge .
" our experience with broadband has shown us that the gap that remains can be astonishingly small , " he said .
there will be other technologies , such as wimax , to take up the shortfall , and government initiatives are likely to play a role .
in scotland , for example , the scottish government in partnership with telecoms provider thus , has set up an initiative known as pathfinder which aims to hook up 1,260 council offices and schools in north and south scotland to super-fast broadband connections .
gone are the days when connectivity extended to whole of the uk the pathfinder scheme was born of concern that scotland could be left behind in the race for fast broadband .
it is somewhat ironic that now many of the sites it has connected are ahead of metropolitan areas .
at st joseph 's college , a 780-pupil strong secondary school in dumfries , pupils have been enjoying an 80mbps connection since june of this year .
" the impact is immense on both teaching and learning .
long gone are the days of chalk and talk .
now pupils are part of the lesson , " said fiona purdie , an english teacher at the school .
" previously if a whole class logged on to a site the page would take ages to load now .
now it is instantaneous .
that makes a big difference to motivation , " said deputy head-teacher bernie jones .
but the new-found speeds are exposing some of the more patchy coverage children have when they go home .
" at home some still have dial-up while we still have some pupils with no access at all at home , " said ms jones .
radical approach in a small market-town in the netherlands , a novel , community-led approach to next-generation broadband has seen service provider ons net roll out fibre capable of delivering speeds of up to 100mbps to the homes of it 20,000 inhabitants .
for this users pay just 15 euros -lrb- £ 10.70 -rrb- per month .
the scheme has now been extended to nearby eindhoven and is being looked at a model that could be applied around the world .
broadband has revolutionised the way children are taught michael corbett of the uk 's community broadband network is planning to replicate the radical approach in walsall in birmingham .
" the ' pitch ' in nuenen is not about ' bandwidth ' ' fibre ' or anything techie .
nuenen has an elderly community , consequently ons net aimed to appeal to a 75 year old woman who does not own a computer nor used the internet , " he explained .
it is local services supporting security , home care , events on the local tv channel and improving the community that are attracting people .
in order to secure the necessary funds ons net was looking for an initial 35 % sign-up rate .
in fact it got closer to 85 % and posted a £ 1m profit in its first year .
such schemes could play an important role in the uk thinks mr corbett .
" it 's worth giving it a try .
it is better than asking gordon brown to sign a big cheque which he is very unlikely to do , " he said .
however the uk ultimately approaches the issue of a two-tier broadband nation , it is important to remember that digital divides are not just about getting access to remote areas , thinks tim johnson , an analyst with research firm point topic .
" there is a social divide that is just as deep .
40 % of the population do n't have access at all and that number is reducing rather slowly , " he said .
read a selection of your comments on this story : it 's impossible for me to get more than 256kbs broadband at home .
i live 6 miles from norwich but my exchange is in another village and is further away .
the area i live in has recently seen a massive rise in housing due to a new estate being built , but as with all the other infrastructure nothing gets updated or improved .
rad , norfolk broadband is simply not available at my house .
there seems to be no sign of it ever becoming available .
this precludes my working from home completely -lrb- i 'm an it consultant , quite capable of working off-site -rrb- .
it also restricts the facilities available to my children & in my view restricts them educationally & socially .
the cause of the problem is imo nothing more than bt 's miserly approach to repairing its infrastructure .
we are not too far away from the exchange ; merely on a line which is of too low quality .
apparently the supernormal profit generated by broadband is not enough to subside weak connections .
what is required , again imo , is a change to the telecoms universal service obligation to require landline providers to provide for data services at no less than .5mbps downstream .
simon smith , east bolton , near alnwick , northumberland you say there 's a gap growing between city and rural - but there are still patches of city that are really badly covered .
i live in bradley stoke , bristol , and i can only get 1.5meg download speed despite living a few miles from orange hq !
the exchange for bradley stoke is miles away in almondsbury so half of the town - over the 3.5m limit - get awful service but have to pay the same cost as those who get the full -lrb- or as close as you can get -rrb- 8meg service in the rest of bristol .
fair ?
not really .
isps need to offer cheaper service depending on how fast you can or want to connect .
the attitude now is charge everyone the same regardless and see how fast it goes .
if you 're lucky , you 'll get a good connection .
if you 're not you 'll get ripped off .
chris , bristol just do n't get me started ... it would be nice to be able to get broadband .
bt really are the most useless organisation in the uk and the regulators should be ashamed of themselves for the way they have allowed bt to get away with treating rural consumers .
we have had 18 months of delays , excuses incorrect information etc and are currently getting an update once a month that our case has been marked forward for review again in a month 's time .
absolutely useless mark blayney , carrshield hexham for years we 've been trying to get broadband , with no luck .
multiple times bt have informed us that we could get broadband , but after trying -lrb- which included changing plans , buying new hardware and even upgrading telephone lines -rrb- , we were told that we could n't get it .
this is made even worse by having people less than 2 miles away in all directions having broadband available , yet bt still have n't extended the line the extra 1-2 miles so that us and multiple other businesses can get it .
it annoys me that people in the cities , with internet already fast enough to do most online activities easily , are planned to get faster internet , yet us in rural areas are stuck with technology from the 1990s .
james gibbins , clyst hydon , devon , england i live in the fairly rural area of herefordshire and the constant speed difference between our house and even local cities is noticeable .
our local exchange gets about 2mbps i believe and we get approximately 1.5mbps , but hereford , just 25 miles away enjoys 4mbps if not even higher .
one of my friends achieves an appalling 512kbps speed .
far more major cities are enjoying very high speeds and i loath seeing the adverts for 16 or even 20mbps when i know we wo n't be getting this until at least 2011 .
as a part time web developer , the broadband-divide is a major issue and i really hope that the fibre roll out will be rapid enough that i wo n't be left even further behind than i currently am .
dan price , presteigne , uk it is not just rural areas .
i live in derry , northern ireland .
the bt exchange is not unbundled and the maximum it can provide is 1.5mb !
pádraig mckeag , united kingdom slow speeds in rural areas ?
i live in hampstead , london , just a stone throw away from the a41 .
despite having singed up with demon for a 8mbit / s connection , according the speedtest.net and the bt speed tester , i actually get about 1.4mbit / s down and 148kbit / s up .
according to bt this is because i live right in between two exchanges and there is no upgrade planned .
how much worse can it be in the country , where lower population would suggest more available bandwidth ?
t scholz , london , uk i live in camberwell , zone 2 in south east london .
the fastest speed i can get is 1.1mbs , well below the nation average .
i believe this is a problem with the brixton phone exchange .
i think it 's appalling that friends of mine who live in norfolk can get up to 8mbs whilst in london i am stuck with 1 .
also due to tariffs the way they are , i pay for " maximum speed " broadband , yet no one is doing anything to improve my service or give me discount as i am limited by the phonelines .
steve , camberwell it 's not just those in the country that have difficulty in broadband .
i live on the tip of the isle of dogs in london , barely a mile from canary wharf but the quality of broadband is patchy to say the least .
1mb is the top speed i can get and that 's being optimistic .
paul osborne , london you wrote : " in the broadband world , there is no legal requirement for bt to make it available across the uk , although with figures estimating broadband reaches around 95 % of the country , in effect it has extended its universal service agreement to broadband . "
i have to contest this .
by definition , the ' universal service obligation ' was there precisely to help the last few percent .
i know people who live in rural wiltshire who still can not get any broadband at all ; their exchange is ' enabled ' but they live too far from it , so they are still stuck on dial-up .

' broaderband ' school people living in rural parts of the country have much less choice of broadband providers , are likely to get slower speeds and pay a different price .
and with super-fast broadband on the horizon , some commentators think things are set to get a lot worse .
if you live in a rural part of the country , you could be waiting decades to get the same service that your friends and relatives in the city enjoy .
" there is going to have to be an acceptance that broadband will be faster in the cities .
the model of equal access will have to be adapted , " said ian fogg , an analyst with jupiter research .
he added : " fibre costs such a fortune to roll out that it may take decades to get to ubiquitous coverage in rural areas . "
price divide next year sees the roll-out of the next-generation of adsl , dubbed adsl2 + , which promises speeds of up to 24mbps , but like its slower cousin speeds will be dependent on how far away from the exchange people live .
schools need broadband to use scholar education software broadband test unbundled services - where operators take over bt 's telephone exchanges with their own equipment - allows rivals to offer much cheaper broadband but , because unbundling an exchange costs in the region of £ 30,000 , providers tend to stick to urban areas .
" providers are loath to do this in rural areas where less people will be connected to each exchange , " said michael phillips of consumer website broadbandchoices.co.uk.
" there is a growing digital divide as people in built-up urban areas are able to take advantage of cheaper broadband and ' free ' line rental , while those in the country are left languishing on more expensive packages , " he said .
some of the most popular deals already have difference prices dependent on where you live .
talktalk 's broadband service is available in 25 % of unbundled exchanges but for those who live outside of the areas there is a premium of £ 15 .
sky broadband relies on other wholesale products in the places where it does not have access to unbundled exchanges while tiscali charges £ 8.24 per month for line rental .
cable has also traditionally avoided rural areas for economic reasons and talk of a nationwide fibre network to provide speeds of up to 100mbps would also have to be rolled out piecemeal .
how fast your adsl is depends on how close you live to the exchange universal broaderband ?
this is a far cry from the early days of telecommunications when it was expected that telephone services would extend from john o 'groats to lands end .
in the broadband world , there is no legal requirement for bt to make it available across the uk , although with figures estimating broadband reaches around 95 % of the country , in effect it has extended its universal service agreement to broadband .
" but if we move to fibre the notion that we 'd carpet the nation overnight is logistically implausible .
it is very likely to be a gradual process , " said peter mccarthy-ward , bt 's director of equivalence .
he thinks the lessons from first-generation broadband roll-out suggest that the speed divide will not be huge .
" our experience with broadband has shown us that the gap that remains can be astonishingly small , " he said .
there will be other technologies , such as wimax , to take up the shortfall , and government initiatives are likely to play a role .
in scotland , for example , the scottish government in partnership with telecoms provider thus , has set up an initiative known as pathfinder which aims to hook up 1,260 council offices and schools in north and south scotland to super-fast broadband connections .
gone are the days when connectivity extended to whole of the uk the pathfinder scheme was born of concern that scotland could be left behind in the race for fast broadband .
it is somewhat ironic that now many of the sites it has connected are ahead of metropolitan areas .
at st joseph 's college , a 780-pupil strong secondary school in dumfries , pupils have been enjoying an 80mbps connection since june of this year .
" the impact is immense on both teaching and learning .
long gone are the days of chalk and talk .
now pupils are part of the lesson , " said fiona purdie , an english teacher at the school .
" previously if a whole class logged on to a site the page would take ages to load now .
now it is instantaneous .
that makes a big difference to motivation , " said deputy head-teacher bernie jones .
but the new-found speeds are exposing some of the more patchy coverage children have when they go home .
" at home some still have dial-up while we still have some pupils with no access at all at home , " said ms jones .
radical approach in a small market-town in the netherlands , a novel , community-led approach to next-generation broadband has seen service provider ons net roll out fibre capable of delivering speeds of up to 100mbps to the homes of it 20,000 inhabitants .
for this users pay just 15 euros -lrb- £ 10.70 -rrb- per month .
the scheme has now been extended to nearby eindhoven and is being looked at a model that could be applied around the world .
broadband has revolutionised the way children are taught michael corbett of the uk 's community broadband network is planning to replicate the radical approach in walsall in birmingham .
" the ' pitch ' in nuenen is not about ' bandwidth ' ' fibre ' or anything techie .
nuenen has an elderly community , consequently ons net aimed to appeal to a 75 year old woman who does not own a computer nor used the internet , " he explained .
it is local services supporting security , home care , events on the local tv channel and improving the community that are attracting people .
in order to secure the necessary funds ons net was looking for an initial 35 % sign-up rate .
in fact it got closer to 85 % and posted a £ 1m profit in its first year .
such schemes could play an important role in the uk thinks mr corbett .
" it 's worth giving it a try .
it is better than asking gordon brown to sign a big cheque which he is very unlikely to do , " he said .
however the uk ultimately approaches the issue of a two-tier broadband nation , it is important to remember that digital divides are not just about getting access to remote areas , thinks tim johnson , an analyst with research firm point topic .
" there is a social divide that is just as deep .
40 % of the population do n't have access at all and that number is reducing rather slowly , " he said .
read a selection of your comments on this story : it 's impossible for me to get more than 256kbs broadband at home .
i live 6 miles from norwich but my exchange is in another village and is further away .
the area i live in has recently seen a massive rise in housing due to a new estate being built , but as with all the other infrastructure nothing gets updated or improved .
rad , norfolk broadband is simply not available at my house .
there seems to be no sign of it ever becoming available .
this precludes my working from home completely -lrb- i 'm an it consultant , quite capable of working off-site -rrb- .
it also restricts the facilities available to my children & in my view restricts them educationally & socially .
the cause of the problem is imo nothing more than bt 's miserly approach to repairing its infrastructure .
we are not too far away from the exchange ; merely on a line which is of too low quality .
apparently the supernormal profit generated by broadband is not enough to subside weak connections .
what is required , again imo , is a change to the telecoms universal service obligation to require landline providers to provide for data services at no less than .5mbps downstream .
simon smith , east bolton , near alnwick , northumberland you say there 's a gap growing between city and rural - but there are still patches of city that are really badly covered .
i live in bradley stoke , bristol , and i can only get 1.5meg download speed despite living a few miles from orange hq !
the exchange for bradley stoke is miles away in almondsbury so half of the town - over the 3.5m limit - get awful service but have to pay the same cost as those who get the full -lrb- or as close as you can get -rrb- 8meg service in the rest of bristol .
fair ?
not really .
isps need to offer cheaper service depending on how fast you can or want to connect .
the attitude now is charge everyone the same regardless and see how fast it goes .
if you 're lucky , you 'll get a good connection .
if you 're not you 'll get ripped off .
chris , bristol just do n't get me started ... it would be nice to be able to get broadband .
bt really are the most useless organisation in the uk and the regulators should be ashamed of themselves for the way they have allowed bt to get away with treating rural consumers .
we have had 18 months of delays , excuses incorrect information etc and are currently getting an update once a month that our case has been marked forward for review again in a month 's time .
absolutely useless mark blayney , carrshield hexham for years we 've been trying to get broadband , with no luck .
multiple times bt have informed us that we could get broadband , but after trying -lrb- which included changing plans , buying new hardware and even upgrading telephone lines -rrb- , we were told that we could n't get it .
this is made even worse by having people less than 2 miles away in all directions having broadband available , yet bt still have n't extended the line the extra 1-2 miles so that us and multiple other businesses can get it .
it annoys me that people in the cities , with internet already fast enough to do most online activities easily , are planned to get faster internet , yet us in rural areas are stuck with technology from the 1990s .
james gibbins , clyst hydon , devon , england i live in the fairly rural area of herefordshire and the constant speed difference between our house and even local cities is noticeable .
our local exchange gets about 2mbps i believe and we get approximately 1.5mbps , but hereford , just 25 miles away enjoys 4mbps if not even higher .
one of my friends achieves an appalling 512kbps speed .

' broaderband ' school people living in rural parts of the country have much less choice of broadband providers , are likely to get slower speeds and pay a different price .
and with super-fast broadband on the horizon , some commentators think things are set to get a lot worse .
if you live in a rural part of the country , you could be waiting decades to get the same service that your friends and relatives in the city enjoy .
" there is going to have to be an acceptance that broadband will be faster in the cities .
the model of equal access will have to be adapted , " said ian fogg , an analyst with jupiter research .
he added : " fibre costs such a fortune to roll out that it may take decades to get to ubiquitous coverage in rural areas . "
price divide next year sees the roll-out of the next-generation of adsl , dubbed adsl2 + , which promises speeds of up to 24mbps , but like its slower cousin speeds will be dependent on how far away from the exchange people live .
schools need broadband to use scholar education software broadband test unbundled services - where operators take over bt 's telephone exchanges with their own equipment - allows rivals to offer much cheaper broadband but , because unbundling an exchange costs in the region of £ 30,000 , providers tend to stick to urban areas .
" providers are loath to do this in rural areas where less people will be connected to each exchange , " said michael phillips of consumer website broadbandchoices.co.uk.
" there is a growing digital divide as people in built-up urban areas are able to take advantage of cheaper broadband and ' free ' line rental , while those in the country are left languishing on more expensive packages , " he said .
some of the most popular deals already have difference prices dependent on where you live .
talktalk 's broadband service is available in 25 % of unbundled exchanges but for those who live outside of the areas there is a premium of £ 15 .
sky broadband relies on other wholesale products in the places where it does not have access to unbundled exchanges while tiscali charges £ 8.24 per month for line rental .
cable has also traditionally avoided rural areas for economic reasons and talk of a nationwide fibre network to provide speeds of up to 100mbps would also have to be rolled out piecemeal .
how fast your adsl is depends on how close you live to the exchange universal broaderband ?
this is a far cry from the early days of telecommunications when it was expected that telephone services would extend from john o 'groats to lands end .
in the broadband world , there is no legal requirement for bt to make it available across the uk , although with figures estimating broadband reaches around 95 % of the country , in effect it has extended its universal service agreement to broadband .
" but if we move to fibre the notion that we 'd carpet the nation overnight is logistically implausible .
it is very likely to be a gradual process , " said peter mccarthy-ward , bt 's director of equivalence .
he thinks the lessons from first-generation broadband roll-out suggest that the speed divide will not be huge .
" our experience with broadband has shown us that the gap that remains can be astonishingly small , " he said .
there will be other technologies , such as wimax , to take up the shortfall , and government initiatives are likely to play a role .
in scotland , for example , the scottish government in partnership with telecoms provider thus , has set up an initiative known as pathfinder which aims to hook up 1,260 council offices and schools in north and south scotland to super-fast broadband connections .
gone are the days when connectivity extended to whole of the uk the pathfinder scheme was born of concern that scotland could be left behind in the race for fast broadband .
it is somewhat ironic that now many of the sites it has connected are ahead of metropolitan areas .
at st joseph 's college , a 780-pupil strong secondary school in dumfries , pupils have been enjoying an 80mbps connection since june of this year .
" the impact is immense on both teaching and learning .
long gone are the days of chalk and talk .
now pupils are part of the lesson , " said fiona purdie , an english teacher at the school .
" previously if a whole class logged on to a site the page would take ages to load now .
now it is instantaneous .
that makes a big difference to motivation , " said deputy head-teacher bernie jones .
but the new-found speeds are exposing some of the more patchy coverage children have when they go home .
" at home some still have dial-up while we still have some pupils with no access at all at home , " said ms jones .
radical approach in a small market-town in the netherlands , a novel , community-led approach to next-generation broadband has seen service provider ons net roll out fibre capable of delivering speeds of up to 100mbps to the homes of it 20,000 inhabitants .
for this users pay just 15 euros -lrb- £ 10.70 -rrb- per month .
the scheme has now been extended to nearby eindhoven and is being looked at a model that could be applied around the world .
broadband has revolutionised the way children are taught michael corbett of the uk 's community broadband network is planning to replicate the radical approach in walsall in birmingham .
" the ' pitch ' in nuenen is not about ' bandwidth ' ' fibre ' or anything techie .
nuenen has an elderly community , consequently ons net aimed to appeal to a 75 year old woman who does not own a computer nor used the internet , " he explained .
it is local services supporting security , home care , events on the local tv channel and improving the community that are attracting people .
in order to secure the necessary funds ons net was looking for an initial 35 % sign-up rate .
in fact it got closer to 85 % and posted a £ 1m profit in its first year .
such schemes could play an important role in the uk thinks mr corbett .
" it 's worth giving it a try .
it is better than asking gordon brown to sign a big cheque which he is very unlikely to do , " he said .
however the uk ultimately approaches the issue of a two-tier broadband nation , it is important to remember that digital divides are not just about getting access to remote areas , thinks tim johnson , an analyst with research firm point topic .
" there is a social divide that is just as deep .
40 % of the population do n't have access at all and that number is reducing rather slowly , " he said .
read a selection of your comments on this story : it 's impossible for me to get more than 256kbs broadband at home .
i live 6 miles from norwich but my exchange is in another village and is further away .
the area i live in has recently seen a massive rise in housing due to a new estate being built , but as with all the other infrastructure nothing gets updated or improved .
rad , norfolk broadband is simply not available at my house .
there seems to be no sign of it ever becoming available .
this precludes my working from home completely -lrb- i 'm an it consultant , quite capable of working off-site -rrb- .
it also restricts the facilities available to my children & in my view restricts them educationally & socially .
the cause of the problem is imo nothing more than bt 's miserly approach to repairing its infrastructure .
we are not too far away from the exchange ; merely on a line which is of too low quality .
apparently the supernormal profit generated by broadband is not enough to subside weak connections .
what is required , again imo , is a change to the telecoms universal service obligation to require landline providers to provide for data services at no less than .5mbps downstream .
simon smith , east bolton , near alnwick , northumberland you say there 's a gap growing between city and rural - but there are still patches of city that are really badly covered .
i live in bradley stoke , bristol , and i can only get 1.5meg download speed despite living a few miles from orange hq !
the exchange for bradley stoke is miles away in almondsbury so half of the town - over the 3.5m limit - get awful service but have to pay the same cost as those who get the full -lrb- or as close as you can get -rrb- 8meg service in the rest of bristol .
fair ?
not really .
isps need to offer cheaper service depending on how fast you can or want to connect .
the attitude now is charge everyone the same regardless and see how fast it goes .
if you 're lucky , you 'll get a good connection .
if you 're not you 'll get ripped off .
chris , bristol just do n't get me started ... it would be nice to be able to get broadband .
bt really are the most useless organisation in the uk and the regulators should be ashamed of themselves for the way they have allowed bt to get away with treating rural consumers .
we have had 18 months of delays , excuses incorrect information etc and are currently getting an update once a month that our case has been marked forward for review again in a month 's time .
absolutely useless mark blayney , carrshield hexham for years we 've been trying to get broadband , with no luck .
multiple times bt have informed us that we could get broadband , but after trying -lrb- which included changing plans , buying new hardware and even upgrading telephone lines -rrb- , we were told that we could n't get it .
this is made even worse by having people less than 2 miles away in all directions having broadband available , yet bt still have n't extended the line the extra 1-2 miles so that us and multiple other businesses can get it .
it annoys me that people in the cities , with internet already fast enough to do most online activities easily , are planned to get faster internet , yet us in rural areas are stuck with technology from the 1990s .
james gibbins , clyst hydon , devon , england i live in the fairly rural area of herefordshire and the constant speed difference between our house and even local cities is noticeable .
our local exchange gets about 2mbps i believe and we get approximately 1.5mbps , but hereford , just 25 miles away enjoys 4mbps if not even higher .
one of my friends achieves an appalling 512kbps speed .
far more major cities are enjoying very high speeds and i loath seeing the adverts for 16 or even 20mbps when i know we wo n't be getting this until at least 2011 .
as a part time web developer , the broadband-divide is a major issue and i really hope that the fibre roll out will be rapid enough that i wo n't be left even further behind than i currently am .
dan price , presteigne , uk it is not just rural areas .
i live in derry , northern ireland .
the bt exchange is not unbundled and the maximum it can provide is 1.5mb !
pádraig mckeag , united kingdom slow speeds in rural areas ?
i live in hampstead , london , just a stone throw away from the a41 .
despite having singed up with demon for a 8mbit / s connection , according the speedtest.net and the bt speed tester , i actually get about 1.4mbit / s down and 148kbit / s up .
according to bt this is because i live right in between two exchanges and there is no upgrade planned .
how much worse can it be in the country , where lower population would suggest more available bandwidth ?
t scholz , london , uk i live in camberwell , zone 2 in south east london .
the fastest speed i can get is 1.1mbs , well below the nation average .
i believe this is a problem with the brixton phone exchange .
i think it 's appalling that friends of mine who live in norfolk can get up to 8mbs whilst in london i am stuck with 1 .
also due to tariffs the way they are , i pay for " maximum speed " broadband , yet no one is doing anything to improve my service or give me discount as i am limited by the phonelines .
steve , camberwell it 's not just those in the country that have difficulty in broadband .
i live on the tip of the isle of dogs in london , barely a mile from canary wharf but the quality of broadband is patchy to say the least .
1mb is the top speed i can get and that 's being optimistic .
paul osborne , london you wrote : " in the broadband world , there is no legal requirement for bt to make it available across the uk , although with figures estimating broadband reaches around 95 % of the country , in effect it has extended its universal service agreement to broadband . "
i have to contest this .
by definition , the ' universal service obligation ' was there precisely to help the last few percent .
i know people who live in rural wiltshire who still can not get any broadband at all ; their exchange is ' enabled ' but they live too far from it , so they are still stuck on dial-up .

read a selection of your comments on this story : it 's impossible for me to get more than 256kbs broadband at home .
i live 6 miles from norwich but my exchange is in another village and is further away .
the area i live in has recently seen a massive rise in housing due to a new estate being built , but as with all the other infrastructure nothing gets updated or improved .
rad , norfolk broadband is simply not available at my house .
there seems to be no sign of it ever becoming available .
this precludes my working from home completely -lrb- i 'm an it consultant , quite capable of working off-site -rrb- .
it also restricts the facilities available to my children & in my view restricts them educationally & socially .
the cause of the problem is imo nothing more than bt 's miserly approach to repairing its infrastructure .
we are not too far away from the exchange ; merely on a line which is of too low quality .
apparently the supernormal profit generated by broadband is not enough to subside weak connections .
what is required , again imo , is a change to the telecoms universal service obligation to require landline providers to provide for data services at no less than .5mbps downstream .
simon smith , east bolton , near alnwick , northumberland you say there 's a gap growing between city and rural - but there are still patches of city that are really badly covered .
i live in bradley stoke , bristol , and i can only get 1.5meg download speed despite living a few miles from orange hq !
the exchange for bradley stoke is miles away in almondsbury so half of the town - over the 3.5m limit - get awful service but have to pay the same cost as those who get the full -lrb- or as close as you can get -rrb- 8meg service in the rest of bristol .
fair ?
not really .
isps need to offer cheaper service depending on how fast you can or want to connect .
the attitude now is charge everyone the same regardless and see how fast it goes .
if you 're lucky , you 'll get a good connection .
if you 're not you 'll get ripped off .
chris , bristol just do n't get me started ... it would be nice to be able to get broadband .
bt really are the most useless organisation in the uk and the regulators should be ashamed of themselves for the way they have allowed bt to get away with treating rural consumers .
we have had 18 months of delays , excuses incorrect information etc and are currently getting an update once a month that our case has been marked forward for review again in a month 's time .
absolutely useless mark blayney , carrshield hexham for years we 've been trying to get broadband , with no luck .
multiple times bt have informed us that we could get broadband , but after trying -lrb- which included changing plans , buying new hardware and even upgrading telephone lines -rrb- , we were told that we could n't get it .
this is made even worse by having people less than 2 miles away in all directions having broadband available , yet bt still have n't extended the line the extra 1-2 miles so that us and multiple other businesses can get it .
it annoys me that people in the cities , with internet already fast enough to do most online activities easily , are planned to get faster internet , yet us in rural areas are stuck with technology from the 1990s .
james gibbins , clyst hydon , devon , england i live in the fairly rural area of herefordshire and the constant speed difference between our house and even local cities is noticeable .
our local exchange gets about 2mbps i believe and we get approximately 1.5mbps , but hereford , just 25 miles away enjoys 4mbps if not even higher .
one of my friends achieves an appalling 512kbps speed .
far more major cities are enjoying very high speeds and i loath seeing the adverts for 16 or even 20mbps when i know we wo n't be getting this until at least 2011 .
as a part time web developer , the broadband-divide is a major issue and i really hope that the fibre roll out will be rapid enough that i wo n't be left even further behind than i currently am .
dan price , presteigne , uk it is not just rural areas .
i live in derry , northern ireland .
the bt exchange is not unbundled and the maximum it can provide is 1.5mb !
pádraig mckeag , united kingdom slow speeds in rural areas ?
i live in hampstead , london , just a stone throw away from the a41 .
despite having singed up with demon for a 8mbit / s connection , according the speedtest.net and the bt speed tester , i actually get about 1.4mbit / s down and 148kbit / s up .
according to bt this is because i live right in between two exchanges and there is no upgrade planned .
how much worse can it be in the country , where lower population would suggest more available bandwidth ?
t scholz , london , uk i live in camberwell , zone 2 in south east london .
the fastest speed i can get is 1.1mbs , well below the nation average .
i believe this is a problem with the brixton phone exchange .
i think it 's appalling that friends of mine who live in norfolk can get up to 8mbs whilst in london i am stuck with 1 .
also due to tariffs the way they are , i pay for " maximum speed " broadband , yet no one is doing anything to improve my service or give me discount as i am limited by the phonelines .
steve , camberwell it 's not just those in the country that have difficulty in broadband .
i live on the tip of the isle of dogs in london , barely a mile from canary wharf but the quality of broadband is patchy to say the least .
1mb is the top speed i can get and that 's being optimistic .
paul osborne , london you wrote : " in the broadband world , there is no legal requirement for bt to make it available across the uk , although with figures estimating broadband reaches around 95 % of the country , in effect it has extended its universal service agreement to broadband . "
i have to contest this .
by definition , the ' universal service obligation ' was there precisely to help the last few percent .
i know people who live in rural wiltshire who still can not get any broadband at all ; their exchange is ' enabled ' but they live too far from it , so they are still stuck on dial-up .

' broaderband ' school people living in rural parts of the country have much less choice of broadband providers , are likely to get slower speeds and pay a different price .
and with super-fast broadband on the horizon , some commentators think things are set to get a lot worse .
if you live in a rural part of the country , you could be waiting decades to get the same service that your friends and relatives in the city enjoy .
" there is going to have to be an acceptance that broadband will be faster in the cities .
the model of equal access will have to be adapted , " said ian fogg , an analyst with jupiter research .
he added : " fibre costs such a fortune to roll out that it may take decades to get to ubiquitous coverage in rural areas . "
price divide next year sees the roll-out of the next-generation of adsl , dubbed adsl2 + , which promises speeds of up to 24mbps , but like its slower cousin speeds will be dependent on how far away from the exchange people live .
schools need broadband to use scholar education software broadband test unbundled services - where operators take over bt 's telephone exchanges with their own equipment - allows rivals to offer much cheaper broadband but , because unbundling an exchange costs in the region of £ 30,000 , providers tend to stick to urban areas .
" providers are loath to do this in rural areas where less people will be connected to each exchange , " said michael phillips of consumer website broadbandchoices.co.uk.
" there is a growing digital divide as people in built-up urban areas are able to take advantage of cheaper broadband and ' free ' line rental , while those in the country are left languishing on more expensive packages , " he said .
some of the most popular deals already have difference prices dependent on where you live .
talktalk 's broadband service is available in 25 % of unbundled exchanges but for those who live outside of the areas there is a premium of £ 15 .
sky broadband relies on other wholesale products in the places where it does not have access to unbundled exchanges while tiscali charges £ 8.24 per month for line rental .

read a selection of your comments on this story : it 's impossible for me to get more than 256kbs broadband at home .
i live 6 miles from norwich but my exchange is in another village and is further away .
the area i live in has recently seen a massive rise in housing due to a new estate being built , but as with all the other infrastructure nothing gets updated or improved .
rad , norfolk broadband is simply not available at my house .
there seems to be no sign of it ever becoming available .
this precludes my working from home completely -lrb- i 'm an it consultant , quite capable of working off-site -rrb- .
it also restricts the facilities available to my children & in my view restricts them educationally & socially .
the cause of the problem is imo nothing more than bt 's miserly approach to repairing its infrastructure .
we are not too far away from the exchange ; merely on a line which is of too low quality .
apparently the supernormal profit generated by broadband is not enough to subside weak connections .
what is required , again imo , is a change to the telecoms universal service obligation to require landline providers to provide for data services at no less than .5mbps downstream .
simon smith , east bolton , near alnwick , northumberland you say there 's a gap growing between city and rural - but there are still patches of city that are really badly covered .
i live in bradley stoke , bristol , and i can only get 1.5meg download speed despite living a few miles from orange hq !
the exchange for bradley stoke is miles away in almondsbury so half of the town - over the 3.5m limit - get awful service but have to pay the same cost as those who get the full -lrb- or as close as you can get -rrb- 8meg service in the rest of bristol .
fair ?
not really .
isps need to offer cheaper service depending on how fast you can or want to connect .
the attitude now is charge everyone the same regardless and see how fast it goes .
if you 're lucky , you 'll get a good connection .
if you 're not you 'll get ripped off .
chris , bristol just do n't get me started ... it would be nice to be able to get broadband .

absolutely useless mark blayney , carrshield hexham for years we 've been trying to get broadband , with no luck .
multiple times bt have informed us that we could get broadband , but after trying -lrb- which included changing plans , buying new hardware and even upgrading telephone lines -rrb- , we were told that we could n't get it .
this is made even worse by having people less than 2 miles away in all directions having broadband available , yet bt still have n't extended the line the extra 1-2 miles so that us and multiple other businesses can get it .
it annoys me that people in the cities , with internet already fast enough to do most online activities easily , are planned to get faster internet , yet us in rural areas are stuck with technology from the 1990s .
james gibbins , clyst hydon , devon , england i live in the fairly rural area of herefordshire and the constant speed difference between our house and even local cities is noticeable .
our local exchange gets about 2mbps i believe and we get approximately 1.5mbps , but hereford , just 25 miles away enjoys 4mbps if not even higher .
one of my friends achieves an appalling 512kbps speed .
far more major cities are enjoying very high speeds and i loath seeing the adverts for 16 or even 20mbps when i know we wo n't be getting this until at least 2011 .
as a part time web developer , the broadband-divide is a major issue and i really hope that the fibre roll out will be rapid enough that i wo n't be left even further behind than i currently am .

by definition , the ' universal service obligation ' was there precisely to help the last few percent .
i know people who live in rural wiltshire who still can not get any broadband at all ; their exchange is ' enabled ' but they live too far from it , so they are still stuck on dial-up .

' broaderband ' school people living in rural parts of the country have much less choice of broadband providers , are likely to get slower speeds and pay a different price .
and with super-fast broadband on the horizon , some commentators think things are set to get a lot worse .
if you live in a rural part of the country , you could be waiting decades to get the same service that your friends and relatives in the city enjoy .
" there is going to have to be an acceptance that broadband will be faster in the cities .
the model of equal access will have to be adapted , " said ian fogg , an analyst with jupiter research .
he added : " fibre costs such a fortune to roll out that it may take decades to get to ubiquitous coverage in rural areas . "
price divide next year sees the roll-out of the next-generation of adsl , dubbed adsl2 + , which promises speeds of up to 24mbps , but like its slower cousin speeds will be dependent on how far away from the exchange people live .
schools need broadband to use scholar education software broadband test unbundled services - where operators take over bt 's telephone exchanges with their own equipment - allows rivals to offer much cheaper broadband but , because unbundling an exchange costs in the region of £ 30,000 , providers tend to stick to urban areas .
" providers are loath to do this in rural areas where less people will be connected to each exchange , " said michael phillips of consumer website broadbandchoices.co.uk.
" there is a growing digital divide as people in built-up urban areas are able to take advantage of cheaper broadband and ' free ' line rental , while those in the country are left languishing on more expensive packages , " he said .
some of the most popular deals already have difference prices dependent on where you live .
talktalk 's broadband service is available in 25 % of unbundled exchanges but for those who live outside of the areas there is a premium of £ 15 .
sky broadband relies on other wholesale products in the places where it does not have access to unbundled exchanges while tiscali charges £ 8.24 per month for line rental .
cable has also traditionally avoided rural areas for economic reasons and talk of a nationwide fibre network to provide speeds of up to 100mbps would also have to be rolled out piecemeal .
how fast your adsl is depends on how close you live to the exchange universal broaderband ?
this is a far cry from the early days of telecommunications when it was expected that telephone services would extend from john o 'groats to lands end .
in the broadband world , there is no legal requirement for bt to make it available across the uk , although with figures estimating broadband reaches around 95 % of the country , in effect it has extended its universal service agreement to broadband .
" but if we move to fibre the notion that we 'd carpet the nation overnight is logistically implausible .
it is very likely to be a gradual process , " said peter mccarthy-ward , bt 's director of equivalence .
he thinks the lessons from first-generation broadband roll-out suggest that the speed divide will not be huge .
" our experience with broadband has shown us that the gap that remains can be astonishingly small , " he said .
there will be other technologies , such as wimax , to take up the shortfall , and government initiatives are likely to play a role .
in scotland , for example , the scottish government in partnership with telecoms provider thus , has set up an initiative known as pathfinder which aims to hook up 1,260 council offices and schools in north and south scotland to super-fast broadband connections .
gone are the days when connectivity extended to whole of the uk the pathfinder scheme was born of concern that scotland could be left behind in the race for fast broadband .
it is somewhat ironic that now many of the sites it has connected are ahead of metropolitan areas .
at st joseph 's college , a 780-pupil strong secondary school in dumfries , pupils have been enjoying an 80mbps connection since june of this year .
" the impact is immense on both teaching and learning .
long gone are the days of chalk and talk .
now pupils are part of the lesson , " said fiona purdie , an english teacher at the school .
" previously if a whole class logged on to a site the page would take ages to load now .
now it is instantaneous .
that makes a big difference to motivation , " said deputy head-teacher bernie jones .
but the new-found speeds are exposing some of the more patchy coverage children have when they go home .
" at home some still have dial-up while we still have some pupils with no access at all at home , " said ms jones .
radical approach in a small market-town in the netherlands , a novel , community-led approach to next-generation broadband has seen service provider ons net roll out fibre capable of delivering speeds of up to 100mbps to the homes of it 20,000 inhabitants .
for this users pay just 15 euros -lrb- £ 10.70 -rrb- per month .
the scheme has now been extended to nearby eindhoven and is being looked at a model that could be applied around the world .
broadband has revolutionised the way children are taught michael corbett of the uk 's community broadband network is planning to replicate the radical approach in walsall in birmingham .
" the ' pitch ' in nuenen is not about ' bandwidth ' ' fibre ' or anything techie .
nuenen has an elderly community , consequently ons net aimed to appeal to a 75 year old woman who does not own a computer nor used the internet , " he explained .
it is local services supporting security , home care , events on the local tv channel and improving the community that are attracting people .
in order to secure the necessary funds ons net was looking for an initial 35 % sign-up rate .
in fact it got closer to 85 % and posted a £ 1m profit in its first year .
such schemes could play an important role in the uk thinks mr corbett .
" it 's worth giving it a try .
it is better than asking gordon brown to sign a big cheque which he is very unlikely to do , " he said .
however the uk ultimately approaches the issue of a two-tier broadband nation , it is important to remember that digital divides are not just about getting access to remote areas , thinks tim johnson , an analyst with research firm point topic .
" there is a social divide that is just as deep .
