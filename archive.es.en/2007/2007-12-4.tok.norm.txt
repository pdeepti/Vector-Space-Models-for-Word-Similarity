jürgen klinsmann is being looked at to fill the vacancy , but he would face opposition from some fans despite being a great choice , says dw 's nick amies . it would n't be an exaggeration to compare the possibility of former germany coach - and england nemesis - jürgen klinsmann taking over as coach of the three lions to hillary clinton or barak obama becoming president of the united states of america .
in all three hypothetical cases , the most pertinent question remains the same : is the country ready or is that really a step too far ? the possibility of the united states electing a woman or an african-american into the white house is divisive to say the least .
the fact that mrs. clinton and mr. obama are even in the running at this very early stage of the presidential race says something about how attitudes , at least in some parts of the country , have changed in the us .
most of their detractors focus on their policy stances and personality traits rather than their gender or racial background , which is encouraging for a nation that has for centuries tended to view the commander in chief 's job as being reserved for white males only .
if only the same could be said for the opinions and attitudes of some of the england faithful when it comes to the possibility of klinsmann leading england .
still , klinsmann , who led germany to third place in the 2006 world cup and turned down a job offer from the us soccer federation , has hinted he might be interested in occupying the vacant england bench .
klinsi the mold breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi 's and germany 's success has always rankled england fans klinsmann is one of a rare breed ; a german who has endeared himself to the english soccer masses .
his two spells as a tottenham hotspurs player in the 1990 's are credited with rehabilitating the long-held image of conniving , arrogant and - heaven forbid - massively successful germans which had been cultivated through decades of smug tournament victories and much-reveled-in conquests over england .
his self-referential diving celebration after scoring showed a humorous side to the teutonic efficiency that had grated so much with england fans for so long while his contribution in making the premiership the star-studded internationally renowned league it is now can not be underestimated .
his coaching ability is also grudgingly respected on the island .
in his short tenure , klinsmann transformed germany from a nation infamous for grinding out results to a team purring with flair which - as long as that flair was not used to knock england out of any tournament - was appreciated by those english who lamented the lack of invention in their own team .
the german it 's okay to like bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far would klinsi 's popularity in england stretch ?
klinsi is what is commonly known in those circles where such things matter as " an okay german " for his contribution to the premiership and his philosophy of how the game should be played .
it must , however , be said that klinsmann only remains the good german while he is not responsible for any england heartbreak .
all that could change if he is made england coach .
the england job carries the most pressure of any managerial position in international soccer .
the expectation among the fans is hysterically high and probably unachievable .
despite going 41 years without a title since their only tournament success , fans always believe it is england 's right to win .
to keep these demanding supporters happy and lead england to victory is a hard task for any man , and even more so for a german .
section of fans stuck in the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some england fans would not welcome a german coach believe what you want about england 's notorious fans being rehabilitated or locked-up out of harms way .
the truth is there are still elements which sing " ten german bombers " , chant along to the " dambusters " theme and claim in song that hitler was testicularly-challenged .
animosity towards the germans arising from world war ii is sadly still alive in some less-enlightened quarters and the appointment of one who has been a hate-figure in his time as a player would certainly test how far the england faithful have come in their sensitivity training .
it is only six years ago that england got its first foreign coach .
the uproar over appointing an unassuming swede would be nothing compared to the narrow-minded maelstrom that would accompany the naming of a formerly cocky german as national coach .
right now , england fans are holding out in the hope that former chelsea coach jose mourinho will take charge .
while many are offering prayers that the special one will ride to their rescue , few are considering a future where jürgen klinsmann beams out at them from the dug-out in his standard fa blazer .
put common sense ahead of prejudice but they should .
those implications could be a team playing to its full potential under a young and visionary coach ; an england team feared across the world , not laughed at , and a team ready to put over four decades of underachievement behind it .
if klinsmann gets the job and people still have a problem with him being german while he is winning matches and tournaments for england , then something is very , very wrong .

" it 's a real pleasure to receive my good friend donald tusk ...
poland is a very important partner , and the voice of poland matters , " a buoyant eu commission president jose manuel barroso told journalists in brussels .
when tusk arrived in the commission - the eu 's executive - barroso met him with a beaming smile and an ebullient handshake which would not have been out of place in a christmas grotto .
and tusk replied in kind , referring to a new relationship of trust between his government and the brussels apparatus at least half a dozen times in his opening remarks and joking that he was relieved to have been allowed in after having given a marathon three-hour introductory speech to poland 's parliament 10 days ago .
even barroso 's spokesman , johannes laitenberger , received an ovation when he introduced tusk in polish - a linguistic feat met with cheers and whistles by the large contingent of polish visitors .
a breath of fresh air after kaczynskis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski brothers have been pariahs at the eu it was all a far cry from the tempestuous diplomacy of earlier times .
under tusk 's predecessor , the pugnacious jaroslaw kaczynski , relations between brussels and warsaw strained to breaking point .
in 2007 alone , kaczynski clashed bitterly with the eu over issues ranging from the vote allocated to poland under the new eu reform treaty to the construction of a bypass road through a nature reserve .
and his abrasive defence of polish interests won him few friends in brussels , where he was widely regarded as failing to understand the delicate system of compromises by which the eu functions .
" they seem not to have got the idea of give and take , " one senior brussels diplomat commented , in a reference to kaczynski and his twin brother lech , poland 's current president .
indeed , under the kaczynskis poland seemed set to win the title of europe 's " chief troublemaker , " as the twins threatened to veto a deal on the reform treaty at two successive summits .
tusk victory welcomed with relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk 's election victory caused brussels to sigh with relief tusk 's convincing win in parliamentary elections on october 21 , and his pledge to restore normality to the relationship with brussels , was hailed with relief in the eu 's capital .
" we discussed the future in a spirit of trust - of ' zaufanie , ' to use the polish word , " barroso joked on tuesday , winning a cheer of his own from his audience .
tusk has made trust his government 's watchword , and used the word some 45 times in his first speech .
and while many issues could still dampen the festive spirit - the bypass dispute , cod fishing quotas , energy security , and us plans to site parts of its missile shield in poland , to name but four - both men were convinced that they would no longer spoil the party .
" when we speak openly about things that can become a problem , both sides quickly find solutions , " tusk said .
even the end of the visit raised a cheer as laitenberger wished his audience " goodbye and good luck " in near-faultless polish .
festive goodwill in the capital of europe with the new spirit of cordiality shining through the gloom of a brussels december , both barroso and tusk looked delighted with their christmas message of peace in europe and goodwill to all men .
whether that festive spirit will translate into a happy new year for their relationship remains to be seen . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

six months after parliamentary elections , belgium remains without a government .
outgoing pm guy verhofstadt has launched mediation talks with the country 's main parties after belgian king albert approached him for help . verhofstadt hopes to mend the rupture between francophone and flemish-speaking leaders after coalition talks to form a new government collapsed last week .
this comes after king albert ii summoned verhofstadt on monday and asked him , according to a statement issued by the palace , " to inform the king on the way to get out of the impasse very swiftly , and to make all the contacts necessary to do so . "
belgian television reports have interpreted the belgian king 's move as bestowing “ urgent ” powers , including dealing with “ international matters , ” on prime minister guy verhofstadt .
but this would be in violation of the belgian constitution which does not provide for extended powers to governments without a parliamentary majority .
flemish christian democrat leader yves leterme , who was expected to succeed verhofstadt , told the king on saturday that he was unable to form a coalition after failing to reach a deal over how much power should be devolved to the regions .
haunted by the specter of division along linguistic lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's image is beginning to look a little tattered the deadlock has sparked fears that belgium would split into the flemish and french-speaking parts .
" our country is facing one of the most severe political crises of the last decades , " verhofstadt told a news conference in brussels .
" this situation can not and must not continue for much longer , " he added .
verhofstadt said the country needed fundamental state reform , adding that the country 's problems could be solved " when everyone recognized the seriousness of the situation and took responsibility . "
he said he wanted to reach an agreement on devolution and tackle urgent social and economic issues that go far beyond the authority of a caretaker government .
situation remains unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would-be pm leterme is of mixed parentage himself , but he has not built bridges between the two communities but verhofstadt , who was ousted in the june elections after eight years in office , did not give details of his plans or how the 2008 budget could be drafted under these circumstances .
belgium 's flemish majority wants more autonomy for the relatively rich region of flanders , a move seen as a political and financial threat in the french-speaking region of wallonia .
many flemish voters believe that their taxes - amongst the highest in the world - are used to subsidize the social security system in the south .
verhofstadt said the country 's image abroad was suffering because of the ongoing crisis .
business leaders say potential foreign investors will be driven away .
the liberal vld leader managed to largely keep a lid on devolution-related issues during his term of office .
but he was punished for that at the polls by flemish voters .
his rival leterme has , however , angered walloons by doubting their ability to learn flemish , as well as confusing the french and belgian national anthems . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internationals -pipe- 04.12.2007 klinsi the " good german " could be england 's wake-up call großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann 's passion and management skills should be the issue , not his nationality could a german really become coach of fierce rivals england ?
jürgen klinsmann is being looked at to fill the vacancy , but he would face opposition from some fans despite being a great choice , says dw 's nick amies . it would n't be an exaggeration to compare the possibility of former germany coach - and england nemesis - jürgen klinsmann taking over as coach of the three lions to hillary clinton or barak obama becoming president of the united states of america .
in all three hypothetical cases , the most pertinent question remains the same : is the country ready or is that really a step too far ? the possibility of the united states electing a woman or an african-american into the white house is divisive to say the least .
the fact that mrs. clinton and mr. obama are even in the running at this very early stage of the presidential race says something about how attitudes , at least in some parts of the country , have changed in the us .
most of their detractors focus on their policy stances and personality traits rather than their gender or racial background , which is encouraging for a nation that has for centuries tended to view the commander in chief 's job as being reserved for white males only .
if only the same could be said for the opinions and attitudes of some of the england faithful when it comes to the possibility of klinsmann leading england .
still , klinsmann , who led germany to third place in the 2006 world cup and turned down a job offer from the us soccer federation , has hinted he might be interested in occupying the vacant england bench .
klinsi the mold breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi 's and germany 's success has always rankled england fans klinsmann is one of a rare breed ; a german who has endeared himself to the english soccer masses .
his two spells as a tottenham hotspurs player in the 1990 's are credited with rehabilitating the long-held image of conniving , arrogant and - heaven forbid - massively successful germans which had been cultivated through decades of smug tournament victories and much-reveled-in conquests over england .
his self-referential diving celebration after scoring showed a humorous side to the teutonic efficiency that had grated so much with england fans for so long while his contribution in making the premiership the star-studded internationally renowned league it is now can not be underestimated .
his coaching ability is also grudgingly respected on the island .
in his short tenure , klinsmann transformed germany from a nation infamous for grinding out results to a team purring with flair which - as long as that flair was not used to knock england out of any tournament - was appreciated by those english who lamented the lack of invention in their own team .
the german it 's okay to like bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far would klinsi 's popularity in england stretch ?
klinsi is what is commonly known in those circles where such things matter as " an okay german " for his contribution to the premiership and his philosophy of how the game should be played .
it must , however , be said that klinsmann only remains the good german while he is not responsible for any england heartbreak .
all that could change if he is made england coach .
the england job carries the most pressure of any managerial position in international soccer .
the expectation among the fans is hysterically high and probably unachievable .
despite going 41 years without a title since their only tournament success , fans always believe it is england 's right to win .
to keep these demanding supporters happy and lead england to victory is a hard task for any man , and even more so for a german .
section of fans stuck in the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some england fans would not welcome a german coach believe what you want about england 's notorious fans being rehabilitated or locked-up out of harms way .
the truth is there are still elements which sing " ten german bombers " , chant along to the " dambusters " theme and claim in song that hitler was testicularly-challenged .
animosity towards the germans arising from world war ii is sadly still alive in some less-enlightened quarters and the appointment of one who has been a hate-figure in his time as a player would certainly test how far the england faithful have come in their sensitivity training .
it is only six years ago that england got its first foreign coach .
the uproar over appointing an unassuming swede would be nothing compared to the narrow-minded maelstrom that would accompany the naming of a formerly cocky german as national coach .
right now , england fans are holding out in the hope that former chelsea coach jose mourinho will take charge .
while many are offering prayers that the special one will ride to their rescue , few are considering a future where jürgen klinsmann beams out at them from the dug-out in his standard fa blazer .
put common sense ahead of prejudice but they should .
those implications could be a team playing to its full potential under a young and visionary coach ; an england team feared across the world , not laughed at , and a team ready to put over four decades of underachievement behind it .
if klinsmann gets the job and people still have a problem with him being german while he is winning matches and tournaments for england , then something is very , very wrong .
for a nation of supporters which craves success as much as england fans do , it should n't matter where their next coach comes from as long as he 's a winner . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 04.12.2007 pisa education studies come under examination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people still ca n't get their heads around the pisa testing system germany crept up the rankings in the latest comparative international education study .
but the results are once again fanning the flames of controversy in the ongoing debate over school reform . germany reached 13th place out of 57 countries tested in the results of the latest program for international student assessment - pisa - study , officially published on tuesday , nov .
4 . but any joy over improvement in standing was damped when the test 's creator at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , andreas schleicher , last week told the press that the improvement was more likely due to changes in the way the test was structured , than to any actual improvement on the part of german students . the discussion over germany 's school performance has been raging since 2000 , when the country landed in the bottom third of the rankings of 32 countries , and continued through 2003 , when germany still rated 18th in a list of 40 countries . those rankings " certainly served to alert the public of just how different our perception of the system was compared with its stance in the real world , " said rainer lehmann , a professor of education research at berlin 's humboldt university . indeed , the country 's mediocre ranking back in 2000 caught most germans , who thought highly of their school system , off guard .
the term pisa has since become a household word , reflecting the study 's resonance in the media . debate over studies ' relevance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could be moving towards a comprehensive system the debate has raised questions about the general relevance of comparative educational testing , pitting those who see tests as a useful comparative tool against those who focus on the shortcomings of big , international studies . most experts agree that big international studies have an important place in education policy . " the idea is that you have some natural variance between educational systems , and you try to capitalize upon this by looking at different influences , " said lehmann .
" the goal is to learn from other systems . " michael becker-mrotzeck , a professor in the department of language education at cologne university , agreed . " in principle , -lrb- these studies -rrb- tell us useful information about our school system , " he said .
" for instance , from the first and second pisa studies , germans learned that in no other country does social status of the parents have such a big effect on the academic success of their children . " in addition , the earlier studies showed weakness in certain basic competencies , like reading , math and science .
as a result , he said , schools have shifted focus - with visible results . in november an international test of elementary school competency showed that reading had " clearly improved . " " our education system reacted , quickly , " to the deficits uncovered by pisa , becker-mrotzeck said .
this led to the development of a spate of learning materials , and a host of creative concepts , such as reading nights and author-readings in schools . germany coming out of anti-testing era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has now accepted testing procedures unlike in the uk and the us , where educational testing has long been a buzzword and where standardized tests are routinely used to monitoring how much information is being passed from teachers to students , germany is fairly new to the game . after a spate of general tests in the early 70s showed similar weaknesses to those rediscovered by pisa in 2001 , the country underwent an anti-testing backlash that lasted a good 20 years . only recently have policymakers reinstated mass comparative testing in schools .
today , german schoolchildren face four " general " exams over the course of their 13 year school career - in 3rd , 8th , 10th and at the end of the 12th grade , becker-mrotzeck explained . " it is different than in the us or england , where they might have such tests twice a year , " said becker-mrozeck .
" i do n't think at that level germany is in danger of doing what they call in america , ' teaching to the test . " ' still , learning does n't take place via testing , said renate hendricks , a social democrat parliamentarian for the state of north-rhine westphalia , who specializes in education policy . " i think you can test what a person can do , but learning comes through motivation , curiosity , interest , and an emotional relationship to the teacher , " among other things , hendricks said . hendricks did acknowledge that comparative studies are useful for giving feedback aimed at improving schools .
" but if politicians are incapable of using the information they get to make positive change , then no , these studies are not useful , " she said . disparities in german system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pisa studies are flawed , say some she added that when the figures are broken down by social background , immense disparities in the german system are still evident in the newest pisa results . " now it is clear we have to do something , " she said .
" these politicians have to take off their rose-colored glasses .
or black glasses , or whatever they are wearing . " meanwhile , still other critics say the whole structure of pisa - indeed , the idea of widespread comparative international testing itself - is flawed .
the pisa study was also designed with " unrealistic goals , " according to joachim wuttke , a munich-based physicist , statistician and math teacher who has written two articles critiquing the methodology behind pisa and similar tests . tests weighted against germany , says expert " the ranking of states on a one-dimensional scale is not serious , " he said .
" you can construct tests that give different results , and this one is made in a way that shows germany is mediocre . " various factors can affect outcome .
the type of school system a country has is just one potential factor , he said , adding that the spectrum of students tested also differed from country to country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : differences in studies across europe are a problem " germany took great pains to get a representative sample of students , testing even in schools for special-needs students , " he said .
" meanwhile , finland excluded students with dyslexia from the test .
you ca n't do an international comparison of reading difficulties when you exclude some students . " ultimately , wuttke said tests like pisa " do n't test the system , they test the population . "
he pointed out that in highest-ranking finland , there are almost no immigrants . " if you compared results of all native students only , then finland is no longer at the top of the list , " he said . germany shocked out of stupor one thing the pisa proponents seem to agree on is that the results from 2001 shocked the country into a back-to-basics frenzy . " i see the main advantage of this test as having reoriented schools toward cognitive growth , " said humboldt university 's lehmann .
" every year you have a new set of educational goals seems to be defined - family education , sexual education , peace education , gender education ... but the core business seems to be forgotten . " but even there , wuttke sees pisa as more of a lost opportunity than a gain . " reading , math and science are important subjects , but it should n't come at the expense of other things like sports and music , " he said .
" i happen to think they are just as important . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 04.12.2007 belgian king asks outgoing prime minister for help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does verhofstadt really stand a chance of saving the divided kingdom ?
six months after parliamentary elections , belgium remains without a government .
outgoing pm guy verhofstadt has launched mediation talks with the country 's main parties after belgian king albert approached him for help . verhofstadt hopes to mend the rupture between francophone and flemish-speaking leaders after coalition talks to form a new government collapsed last week .
this comes after king albert ii summoned verhofstadt on monday and asked him , according to a statement issued by the palace , " to inform the king on the way to get out of the impasse very swiftly , and to make all the contacts necessary to do so . "
belgian television reports have interpreted the belgian king 's move as bestowing “ urgent ” powers , including dealing with “ international matters , ” on prime minister guy verhofstadt .
but this would be in violation of the belgian constitution which does not provide for extended powers to governments without a parliamentary majority .
flemish christian democrat leader yves leterme , who was expected to succeed verhofstadt , told the king on saturday that he was unable to form a coalition after failing to reach a deal over how much power should be devolved to the regions .
haunted by the specter of division along linguistic lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's image is beginning to look a little tattered the deadlock has sparked fears that belgium would split into the flemish and french-speaking parts .
" our country is facing one of the most severe political crises of the last decades , " verhofstadt told a news conference in brussels .
" this situation can not and must not continue for much longer , " he added .
verhofstadt said the country needed fundamental state reform , adding that the country 's problems could be solved " when everyone recognized the seriousness of the situation and took responsibility . "
he said he wanted to reach an agreement on devolution and tackle urgent social and economic issues that go far beyond the authority of a caretaker government .
situation remains unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would-be pm leterme is of mixed parentage himself , but he has not built bridges between the two communities but verhofstadt , who was ousted in the june elections after eight years in office , did not give details of his plans or how the 2008 budget could be drafted under these circumstances .
belgium 's flemish majority wants more autonomy for the relatively rich region of flanders , a move seen as a political and financial threat in the french-speaking region of wallonia .
many flemish voters believe that their taxes - amongst the highest in the world - are used to subsidize the social security system in the south .
verhofstadt said the country 's image abroad was suffering because of the ongoing crisis .

the liberal vld leader managed to largely keep a lid on devolution-related issues during his term of office .

six months after parliamentary elections , belgium remains without a government .
outgoing pm guy verhofstadt has launched mediation talks with the country 's main parties after belgian king albert approached him for help . verhofstadt hopes to mend the rupture between francophone and flemish-speaking leaders after coalition talks to form a new government collapsed last week .
this comes after king albert ii summoned verhofstadt on monday and asked him , according to a statement issued by the palace , " to inform the king on the way to get out of the impasse very swiftly , and to make all the contacts necessary to do so . "
belgian television reports have interpreted the belgian king 's move as bestowing “ urgent ” powers , including dealing with “ international matters , ” on prime minister guy verhofstadt .

the report stated that iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 . for nearly 18 months , solana has been trying to persuade the islamic republic to suspend uranium enrichment in exchange for a bundle of political , trade and economic incentives . solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said the national intelligence estimate -lrb- nie -rrb- report " proves that transparency about -lrb- iran 's -rrb- nuclear activities and its intentions are fundamental . " but us president george w. bush said that iran remains a danger and refused to rule out a military attack despite the new findings . " iran was dangerous , iran is dangerous and iran will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon , " bush told a white house press conference . the international atomic agency director general mohamed el baradei said on tuesday , nov .
4 , that the report tallied with the iaea investigation into the country 's nuclear program . a number of european countries , including germany , have already welcomed the us report as confirming that europe 's strategy of negotiations plus sanctions is keeping tehran in line with international demands . the nie report confirmed " the double approach chosen by the international community of incentives and measures from the united nations security council was right , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a statement released monday , nov .
3 . britain 's foreign ministry also said the carrot-and-stick approach was working to keep iran in line with international demands . " the report 's conclusions justify the action already taken by the international community to get to the bottom of iran 's nuclear program and to increase pressure on the regime to stop its enrichment and reprocessing activities , " a british foreign ministry spokeswoman told the afp news agency . international pressure successful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the double approach of sanctions and incentives needed to continue the national intelligence estimate , a consensus of all 16 us spy agencies , said in a report monday that it was confident that iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in late 2003 .
nie cited " moderate confidence " that the program had not been restarted as of mid-2007 . tehran could have the technical ability to build a nuclear weapon between 2010 and 2015 , but " we do not know if it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons , " the report stated . iran appears " less determined to develop nuclear weapons than we have been judging since 2005 , " the nie said .
the report concluded that it was likely that tehran had halted its nuclear program in response to international pressure , which " suggests that iran may be more vulnerable to influence on the issue than we judged previously . " europe 's mixed approach to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military work at iran 's nuclear facilities may have stopped four years ago the united nations security council has brought sanctions against iran twice for refusing to discontinue its uranium enrichment program .
enriched uranium can be used to build nuclear weapons , but iran has consistently said its program is purely used for civilian purposes . the five permanent members of the security council - britain , china , france , russia and the usa - plus germany met in paris over the weekend to discuss a third sanctions resolution but did not reach an agreement . in 2004 and 2005 , germany , along with britain and france , led a diplomatic initiative with tehran in which trade and other economic incentives were discussed in exchange for a halt on the uranium enrichment program . while the so-called eu-3 has since supported un-led sanctions against iran , it has also remained open to a more diplomatic strategy . report may be face-saver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran welcomed the report , saying it confirmed iran 's nuclear plans are peaceful us national security advisor stephen hadley said the report should n't be taken as a reason to lose vigilance . " there 's going to be a tendency of a lot of people to say : ' the problem 's less bad that we thought , let 's relax , " ' said hadley .
" our view is that would be a mistake . " hadley denied that us rhetoric on iran had escalated to step up international pressure .
in october , us president george w. bush raised the specters of " world war iii " or a " nuclear holocaust " occurring should teheran build a nuclear bomb . the estimate could have been a " face saving decision " because bush is not willing to strike militarily and has exhausted the efforts at the un security council , alex vatanka of the middle east institute told the dpa news agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 04.12.2007 pisa education studies come under examination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people still ca n't get their heads around the pisa testing system germany crept up the rankings in the latest comparative international education study .
but the results are once again fanning the flames of controversy in the ongoing debate over school reform . germany reached 13th place out of 57 countries tested in the results of the latest program for international student assessment - pisa - study , officially published on tuesday , nov .
4 . but any joy over improvement in standing was damped when the test 's creator at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , andreas schleicher , last week told the press that the improvement was more likely due to changes in the way the test was structured , than to any actual improvement on the part of german students . the discussion over germany 's school performance has been raging since 2000 , when the country landed in the bottom third of the rankings of 32 countries , and continued through 2003 , when germany still rated 18th in a list of 40 countries . those rankings " certainly served to alert the public of just how different our perception of the system was compared with its stance in the real world , " said rainer lehmann , a professor of education research at berlin 's humboldt university . indeed , the country 's mediocre ranking back in 2000 caught most germans , who thought highly of their school system , off guard .
the term pisa has since become a household word , reflecting the study 's resonance in the media . debate over studies ' relevance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could be moving towards a comprehensive system the debate has raised questions about the general relevance of comparative educational testing , pitting those who see tests as a useful comparative tool against those who focus on the shortcomings of big , international studies . most experts agree that big international studies have an important place in education policy . " the idea is that you have some natural variance between educational systems , and you try to capitalize upon this by looking at different influences , " said lehmann .
" the goal is to learn from other systems . " michael becker-mrotzeck , a professor in the department of language education at cologne university , agreed . " in principle , -lrb- these studies -rrb- tell us useful information about our school system , " he said .
" for instance , from the first and second pisa studies , germans learned that in no other country does social status of the parents have such a big effect on the academic success of their children . " in addition , the earlier studies showed weakness in certain basic competencies , like reading , math and science .
as a result , he said , schools have shifted focus - with visible results . in november an international test of elementary school competency showed that reading had " clearly improved . " " our education system reacted , quickly , " to the deficits uncovered by pisa , becker-mrotzeck said .
this led to the development of a spate of learning materials , and a host of creative concepts , such as reading nights and author-readings in schools . germany coming out of anti-testing era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has now accepted testing procedures unlike in the uk and the us , where educational testing has long been a buzzword and where standardized tests are routinely used to monitoring how much information is being passed from teachers to students , germany is fairly new to the game . after a spate of general tests in the early 70s showed similar weaknesses to those rediscovered by pisa in 2001 , the country underwent an anti-testing backlash that lasted a good 20 years . only recently have policymakers reinstated mass comparative testing in schools .
today , german schoolchildren face four " general " exams over the course of their 13 year school career - in 3rd , 8th , 10th and at the end of the 12th grade , becker-mrotzeck explained . " it is different than in the us or england , where they might have such tests twice a year , " said becker-mrozeck .
" i do n't think at that level germany is in danger of doing what they call in america , ' teaching to the test . " ' still , learning does n't take place via testing , said renate hendricks , a social democrat parliamentarian for the state of north-rhine westphalia , who specializes in education policy . " i think you can test what a person can do , but learning comes through motivation , curiosity , interest , and an emotional relationship to the teacher , " among other things , hendricks said . hendricks did acknowledge that comparative studies are useful for giving feedback aimed at improving schools .
" but if politicians are incapable of using the information they get to make positive change , then no , these studies are not useful , " she said . disparities in german system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pisa studies are flawed , say some she added that when the figures are broken down by social background , immense disparities in the german system are still evident in the newest pisa results . " now it is clear we have to do something , " she said .
" these politicians have to take off their rose-colored glasses .
or black glasses , or whatever they are wearing . " meanwhile , still other critics say the whole structure of pisa - indeed , the idea of widespread comparative international testing itself - is flawed .
the pisa study was also designed with " unrealistic goals , " according to joachim wuttke , a munich-based physicist , statistician and math teacher who has written two articles critiquing the methodology behind pisa and similar tests . tests weighted against germany , says expert " the ranking of states on a one-dimensional scale is not serious , " he said .
" you can construct tests that give different results , and this one is made in a way that shows germany is mediocre . " various factors can affect outcome .
the type of school system a country has is just one potential factor , he said , adding that the spectrum of students tested also differed from country to country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : differences in studies across europe are a problem " germany took great pains to get a representative sample of students , testing even in schools for special-needs students , " he said .
" meanwhile , finland excluded students with dyslexia from the test .
you ca n't do an international comparison of reading difficulties when you exclude some students . " ultimately , wuttke said tests like pisa " do n't test the system , they test the population . "
he pointed out that in highest-ranking finland , there are almost no immigrants . " if you compared results of all native students only , then finland is no longer at the top of the list , " he said . germany shocked out of stupor one thing the pisa proponents seem to agree on is that the results from 2001 shocked the country into a back-to-basics frenzy . " i see the main advantage of this test as having reoriented schools toward cognitive growth , " said humboldt university 's lehmann .
" every year you have a new set of educational goals seems to be defined - family education , sexual education , peace education , gender education ... but the core business seems to be forgotten . " but even there , wuttke sees pisa as more of a lost opportunity than a gain . " reading , math and science are important subjects , but it should n't come at the expense of other things like sports and music , " he said .
" i happen to think they are just as important . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 04.12.2007 pisa education studies come under examination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people still ca n't get their heads around the pisa testing system germany crept up the rankings in the latest comparative international education study .
but the results are once again fanning the flames of controversy in the ongoing debate over school reform . germany reached 13th place out of 57 countries tested in the results of the latest program for international student assessment - pisa - study , officially published on tuesday , nov .
4 . but any joy over improvement in standing was damped when the test 's creator at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , andreas schleicher , last week told the press that the improvement was more likely due to changes in the way the test was structured , than to any actual improvement on the part of german students . the discussion over germany 's school performance has been raging since 2000 , when the country landed in the bottom third of the rankings of 32 countries , and continued through 2003 , when germany still rated 18th in a list of 40 countries . those rankings " certainly served to alert the public of just how different our perception of the system was compared with its stance in the real world , " said rainer lehmann , a professor of education research at berlin 's humboldt university . indeed , the country 's mediocre ranking back in 2000 caught most germans , who thought highly of their school system , off guard .
the term pisa has since become a household word , reflecting the study 's resonance in the media . debate over studies ' relevance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could be moving towards a comprehensive system the debate has raised questions about the general relevance of comparative educational testing , pitting those who see tests as a useful comparative tool against those who focus on the shortcomings of big , international studies . most experts agree that big international studies have an important place in education policy . " the idea is that you have some natural variance between educational systems , and you try to capitalize upon this by looking at different influences , " said lehmann .
" the goal is to learn from other systems . " michael becker-mrotzeck , a professor in the department of language education at cologne university , agreed . " in principle , -lrb- these studies -rrb- tell us useful information about our school system , " he said .
" for instance , from the first and second pisa studies , germans learned that in no other country does social status of the parents have such a big effect on the academic success of their children . " in addition , the earlier studies showed weakness in certain basic competencies , like reading , math and science .
as a result , he said , schools have shifted focus - with visible results . in november an international test of elementary school competency showed that reading had " clearly improved . " " our education system reacted , quickly , " to the deficits uncovered by pisa , becker-mrotzeck said .
this led to the development of a spate of learning materials , and a host of creative concepts , such as reading nights and author-readings in schools . germany coming out of anti-testing era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has now accepted testing procedures unlike in the uk and the us , where educational testing has long been a buzzword and where standardized tests are routinely used to monitoring how much information is being passed from teachers to students , germany is fairly new to the game . after a spate of general tests in the early 70s showed similar weaknesses to those rediscovered by pisa in 2001 , the country underwent an anti-testing backlash that lasted a good 20 years . only recently have policymakers reinstated mass comparative testing in schools .
today , german schoolchildren face four " general " exams over the course of their 13 year school career - in 3rd , 8th , 10th and at the end of the 12th grade , becker-mrotzeck explained . " it is different than in the us or england , where they might have such tests twice a year , " said becker-mrozeck .
" i do n't think at that level germany is in danger of doing what they call in america , ' teaching to the test . " ' still , learning does n't take place via testing , said renate hendricks , a social democrat parliamentarian for the state of north-rhine westphalia , who specializes in education policy . " i think you can test what a person can do , but learning comes through motivation , curiosity , interest , and an emotional relationship to the teacher , " among other things , hendricks said . hendricks did acknowledge that comparative studies are useful for giving feedback aimed at improving schools .
" but if politicians are incapable of using the information they get to make positive change , then no , these studies are not useful , " she said . disparities in german system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pisa studies are flawed , say some she added that when the figures are broken down by social background , immense disparities in the german system are still evident in the newest pisa results . " now it is clear we have to do something , " she said .
" these politicians have to take off their rose-colored glasses .
or black glasses , or whatever they are wearing . " meanwhile , still other critics say the whole structure of pisa - indeed , the idea of widespread comparative international testing itself - is flawed .
the pisa study was also designed with " unrealistic goals , " according to joachim wuttke , a munich-based physicist , statistician and math teacher who has written two articles critiquing the methodology behind pisa and similar tests . tests weighted against germany , says expert " the ranking of states on a one-dimensional scale is not serious , " he said .
" you can construct tests that give different results , and this one is made in a way that shows germany is mediocre . " various factors can affect outcome .
the type of school system a country has is just one potential factor , he said , adding that the spectrum of students tested also differed from country to country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : differences in studies across europe are a problem " germany took great pains to get a representative sample of students , testing even in schools for special-needs students , " he said .
" meanwhile , finland excluded students with dyslexia from the test .
you ca n't do an international comparison of reading difficulties when you exclude some students . " ultimately , wuttke said tests like pisa " do n't test the system , they test the population . "
he pointed out that in highest-ranking finland , there are almost no immigrants . " if you compared results of all native students only , then finland is no longer at the top of the list , " he said . germany shocked out of stupor one thing the pisa proponents seem to agree on is that the results from 2001 shocked the country into a back-to-basics frenzy . " i see the main advantage of this test as having reoriented schools toward cognitive growth , " said humboldt university 's lehmann .
" every year you have a new set of educational goals seems to be defined - family education , sexual education , peace education , gender education ... but the core business seems to be forgotten . " but even there , wuttke sees pisa as more of a lost opportunity than a gain . " reading , math and science are important subjects , but it should n't come at the expense of other things like sports and music , " he said .
" i happen to think they are just as important . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this kind of sermon to bosses serves no purpose , like sermons by politicians in general , " ludwig georg braun , of the german chamber of commerce and industry , told the daily frankfurter rundschau . on monday , dec .
3 , chancellor merkel had said during talks about executive salaries that she did not see a problem with top managers being " well paid " as long as they " did a lot for their companies and their partners . " however , merkel stressed her belief that : " when directors ' failures are rewarded with fantastic bonuses , it damages trust in the social balance within our country , " as cited by afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel spoke out against failures being rewarded with bonuses german president horst köhler had said something similar last week . braun said tuesday that " it is up to the supervisory boards of companies to decide on the salaries they are willing to pay to recruit the best managers . " porsche paid over 100 million euros to mangers the issue arose last week when news of generous pay packages enjoyed by directors of the luxury sports car company porsche was reported . porsche said it had paid its six top board members a total of 112.7 million euros -lrb- $ 165 million -rrb- in bonuses for their performance in 2006 .
in the previous year , it had paid 45.2 million . the wall street journal reported that chief executive wendelin wiedeking alone was paid 68 million euros in compensation last year . the news broke around the same time that german postal workers won a hard-fought battle for a minimum wage of between eight and 9.80 euros an hour .
the announcement underscored an increasing disparity of wealth in europe 's biggest economy . poverty among those who work a study by the hans böckler foundation confirmed this week what many germans had already been feeling : that their buying power is steadily declining in the midst of a robust economic recovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking received nearly 70 million euros in bonuses " the distortion in the distribution of wealth and the rise of poverty among workers are a real problem for the economy and society as a whole , " claus schaefer , author of the study , told afp . at a press conference on tuesday , ekkehard schulz , head of the steel group thyssenkrupp , said : " i share the view of mrs. merkel and mr. köhler , " referring to bonuses paid to mangers . " excesses , especially when it is a question of severance pay , are not timely , and never were … , " he added . schulz himself earned around four million euros in the company 's last fiscal year .
he said he was was " satisfied " with his pay : " i am within the average of dax bosses , " he told afp , in reference to the german index of 30 blue chip groups . porsche , which is not listed on the dax index , earned more money trading derivatives than from selling cars in its fiscal year that ended july 31 .
stock-option transactions contributed a pretax of 3.59 billion euros to the group 's results . total net profit came to 4.242 billion euros , more than three times the result of 1.393 billion one year earlier , as cited by afp . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's a real pleasure to receive my good friend donald tusk ...
poland is a very important partner , and the voice of poland matters , " a buoyant eu commission president jose manuel barroso told journalists in brussels .
when tusk arrived in the commission - the eu 's executive - barroso met him with a beaming smile and an ebullient handshake which would not have been out of place in a christmas grotto .
and tusk replied in kind , referring to a new relationship of trust between his government and the brussels apparatus at least half a dozen times in his opening remarks and joking that he was relieved to have been allowed in after having given a marathon three-hour introductory speech to poland 's parliament 10 days ago .
even barroso 's spokesman , johannes laitenberger , received an ovation when he introduced tusk in polish - a linguistic feat met with cheers and whistles by the large contingent of polish visitors .
a breath of fresh air after kaczynskis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski brothers have been pariahs at the eu it was all a far cry from the tempestuous diplomacy of earlier times .
under tusk 's predecessor , the pugnacious jaroslaw kaczynski , relations between brussels and warsaw strained to breaking point .
in 2007 alone , kaczynski clashed bitterly with the eu over issues ranging from the vote allocated to poland under the new eu reform treaty to the construction of a bypass road through a nature reserve .
and his abrasive defence of polish interests won him few friends in brussels , where he was widely regarded as failing to understand the delicate system of compromises by which the eu functions .
" they seem not to have got the idea of give and take , " one senior brussels diplomat commented , in a reference to kaczynski and his twin brother lech , poland 's current president .
indeed , under the kaczynskis poland seemed set to win the title of europe 's " chief troublemaker , " as the twins threatened to veto a deal on the reform treaty at two successive summits .
tusk victory welcomed with relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk 's election victory caused brussels to sigh with relief tusk 's convincing win in parliamentary elections on october 21 , and his pledge to restore normality to the relationship with brussels , was hailed with relief in the eu 's capital .
" we discussed the future in a spirit of trust - of ' zaufanie , ' to use the polish word , " barroso joked on tuesday , winning a cheer of his own from his audience .
tusk has made trust his government 's watchword , and used the word some 45 times in his first speech .
and while many issues could still dampen the festive spirit - the bypass dispute , cod fishing quotas , energy security , and us plans to site parts of its missile shield in poland , to name but four - both men were convinced that they would no longer spoil the party .
" when we speak openly about things that can become a problem , both sides quickly find solutions , " tusk said .
even the end of the visit raised a cheer as laitenberger wished his audience " goodbye and good luck " in near-faultless polish .
festive goodwill in the capital of europe with the new spirit of cordiality shining through the gloom of a brussels december , both barroso and tusk looked delighted with their christmas message of peace in europe and goodwill to all men .
whether that festive spirit will translate into a happy new year for their relationship remains to be seen . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministry had called for investigations into the allegations of fraud . human rights groups were outraged at sarkozy 's move . " sarkozy 's reaction , which was totally isolated , is both incomprehensible and scandalous , " patrick baudouin , president of the paris-based international federation of human rights -lrb- fidh -rrb- , told afp . " this is a bad blow to democrats and human rights campaigners in russia . " " to give putin your support after unamimously condemned elections , is to compromise yourself and go against official policy " on human rights , he added . he called sarkozy 's call an " excess of zeal that was absolutely unnecessary " and said it was not to france 's credit . eu differs on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin 's party won over 60 percent of the parliamentary vote even all the eu members themselves do not agree about how to handle russia . diplomats told reuters reporters that the eu 's portuguese presidency was seeking agreement on monday among the 27 member states on a joint statement on the russian elections but that it was a challenge to get consensus on the text . on tuesday , the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , urged moscow to address the accusations of electoral irregularities in the russian poll . " everybody is aware that observers have denounced irregularities , " said johannes laitenberger , spokesman for the commission . " it is in the interest of russia to completely clarify all these allegations , " he told reporters in brussels , ac cited by afp . one diplomat told reuters that a draft of an eu statement that circulated on monday criticized moscow 's treatment of the election monitoring office of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and urged the russian government to permit osce monitors into the country to do a long-term survey in advance of a presidential election in march . economic interests at stake ? despite allegations that the opposition had been muzzled and ballots were rigged in the russian vote , the differing european responses to the election highlight the eu 's general problems in speaking with a single voice towards russia , which is its major energy supplier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chess champ kasparov crossed out all parties on his ballot sarkozy , for his part , has been critical of moscow 's handling of human rights , but opposition politicians have nonetheless accused him of putting economic interests above rights . daniele artur , russia expert at amnesty international in france , told afp that she was " very disappointed by -lsb- sarkozy 's -rsb- reaction " to sunday 's elections . " this is sheer realpolitik .
and yet we could have afforded to be much firmer , " she said . the eu similarly backpedaled last week when the portuguese presidency put out a critical statement three days after the arrest of opposition activists in russia , including former world chess champion garry kasparov .
it soon withdrew the statement and issued a milder version without explanation , reuters reported . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the report stated that iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 . for nearly 18 months , solana has been trying to persuade the islamic republic to suspend uranium enrichment in exchange for a bundle of political , trade and economic incentives . solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said the national intelligence estimate -lrb- nie -rrb- report " proves that transparency about -lrb- iran 's -rrb- nuclear activities and its intentions are fundamental . " but us president george w. bush said that iran remains a danger and refused to rule out a military attack despite the new findings . " iran was dangerous , iran is dangerous and iran will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon , " bush told a white house press conference . the international atomic agency director general mohamed el baradei said on tuesday , nov .
4 , that the report tallied with the iaea investigation into the country 's nuclear program . a number of european countries , including germany , have already welcomed the us report as confirming that europe 's strategy of negotiations plus sanctions is keeping tehran in line with international demands . the nie report confirmed " the double approach chosen by the international community of incentives and measures from the united nations security council was right , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a statement released monday , nov .

" it 's a real pleasure to receive my good friend donald tusk ...
poland is a very important partner , and the voice of poland matters , " a buoyant eu commission president jose manuel barroso told journalists in brussels .
when tusk arrived in the commission - the eu 's executive - barroso met him with a beaming smile and an ebullient handshake which would not have been out of place in a christmas grotto .
and tusk replied in kind , referring to a new relationship of trust between his government and the brussels apparatus at least half a dozen times in his opening remarks and joking that he was relieved to have been allowed in after having given a marathon three-hour introductory speech to poland 's parliament 10 days ago .
even barroso 's spokesman , johannes laitenberger , received an ovation when he introduced tusk in polish - a linguistic feat met with cheers and whistles by the large contingent of polish visitors .
a breath of fresh air after kaczynskis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski brothers have been pariahs at the eu it was all a far cry from the tempestuous diplomacy of earlier times .
under tusk 's predecessor , the pugnacious jaroslaw kaczynski , relations between brussels and warsaw strained to breaking point .
in 2007 alone , kaczynski clashed bitterly with the eu over issues ranging from the vote allocated to poland under the new eu reform treaty to the construction of a bypass road through a nature reserve .
and his abrasive defence of polish interests won him few friends in brussels , where he was widely regarded as failing to understand the delicate system of compromises by which the eu functions .
" they seem not to have got the idea of give and take , " one senior brussels diplomat commented , in a reference to kaczynski and his twin brother lech , poland 's current president .
indeed , under the kaczynskis poland seemed set to win the title of europe 's " chief troublemaker , " as the twins threatened to veto a deal on the reform treaty at two successive summits .
tusk victory welcomed with relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk 's election victory caused brussels to sigh with relief tusk 's convincing win in parliamentary elections on october 21 , and his pledge to restore normality to the relationship with brussels , was hailed with relief in the eu 's capital .
" we discussed the future in a spirit of trust - of ' zaufanie , ' to use the polish word , " barroso joked on tuesday , winning a cheer of his own from his audience .
tusk has made trust his government 's watchword , and used the word some 45 times in his first speech .
and while many issues could still dampen the festive spirit - the bypass dispute , cod fishing quotas , energy security , and us plans to site parts of its missile shield in poland , to name but four - both men were convinced that they would no longer spoil the party .
" when we speak openly about things that can become a problem , both sides quickly find solutions , " tusk said .
even the end of the visit raised a cheer as laitenberger wished his audience " goodbye and good luck " in near-faultless polish .
festive goodwill in the capital of europe with the new spirit of cordiality shining through the gloom of a brussels december , both barroso and tusk looked delighted with their christmas message of peace in europe and goodwill to all men .
whether that festive spirit will translate into a happy new year for their relationship remains to be seen . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 . the us space shuttle atlantis , to be launched from kennedy space center at cape canaveral , florida , is to deliver a european-built space laboratory named columbus to the international space station -lrb- iss -rrb- beginning thursday .
until now , only the united states and russia have had their own laboratories at the iss . " we have never had a permanent base in space before and i see this as a first step for europe in real spaceflight activities , " leopold eyharts , a french astronaut who works for the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , told afp news agency . eyharts is a member of the atlantis crew and will remain at the iss for two and a half months to prepare columbus for future scientific work . europe becoming key space player bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa 's columbus to be one of iss 's main manned modules his german colleague , hans schlegel , also an esa astronaut and a member of the atlantis crew , said the mission will be " a tremendous step , " as quoted by afp . schlegel told dpa new service that the mission marks europe 's entrance into permanent operations in space .
he also said there would be a lot at stake for german science . " we are becoming a more important partner for the international spaceflight community , " he said . esa 's lab , primarily built by eads-astrium in bremen , germany , was supposed to go into operation in 2004 .
but when the space shuttle columbia disintegrated upon re-entry into earth 's atmosphere in 2003 , killing all seven astronauts on board , shuttle flights were suspended . skeptics wanted to dismiss the project , which would have meant a loss of the 880 million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- already invested in it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working in the columbus laboratory last year until now , the americans have primarily called the shots at the iss , which is orbiting earth 400 -lrb- 246 miles -rrb- kilometers over head . that is soon to change with the arrival of the 13-ton columbus module , which is considered a jewel of science . a variety of experiments possible according to dpa , it has seven different racks that can be used for various types of research , including medical and material experiments ranging from the study of single-cell organisms and invertebrates to the basic physics of fluids . " only the core question is the same in all the experiments .
what happens in zero gravity ? "
columbus chief engineer rüdiger kledzik told dpa . such scientific experiments with microgravity are considered key to prepare humankind for living and working in space and for subsequent journeys toward mars and elsewhere . some experiments look at the loss of bone and muscle deterioration in zero gravity .
for instance , dpa said one expert who pointed out that in the weightlessness of space , humans lose 10 percent of their muscle mass per month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- with german astronaut thomas reiter in front of a scale model of the columbus researchers on the columbus will attempt to use the time-lapse effect to address two issues : to better understand how to fight diseases such as osteoporosis and to gain knowledge about future space flights that could last several months . a flight to mars and back would take around two years , for example .
the problem of muscle and bone loss must be solved such a mission can take place , the expert said . columbus will allow astronauts to conducts hundreds of experiments each year . german space center to control columbus the japanese also plan to send their own laboratory , called the kibo , which is to bet he fourth component at the iss , and the largest and most sophiscated at all .
it will be delivered in three different parts , with the first one scheduled for february 2008 . for the 11-day atlantis mission and delivery of columbus , three spacewalks are planned , two of which german astronaut schlegel will perfom .
another astronaut , rex walheim , will aid schlegel in attaching columbus to one of the iss 's modules . during another spacewalk by walheim and american stanley coils , two research platforms will also be set up . construction of columbus has cost cost to two billion euros , with germany the biggest contributor to the project - covering 41 percent of the total costs .
italy contributed 23 percent and france 18 percent respectively .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 04.12.2007 pisa education studies come under examination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people still ca n't get their heads around the pisa testing system germany crept up the rankings in the latest comparative international education study .
but the results are once again fanning the flames of controversy in the ongoing debate over school reform . germany reached 13th place out of 57 countries tested in the results of the latest program for international student assessment - pisa - study , officially published on tuesday , nov .
4 . but any joy over improvement in standing was damped when the test 's creator at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , andreas schleicher , last week told the press that the improvement was more likely due to changes in the way the test was structured , than to any actual improvement on the part of german students . the discussion over germany 's school performance has been raging since 2000 , when the country landed in the bottom third of the rankings of 32 countries , and continued through 2003 , when germany still rated 18th in a list of 40 countries . those rankings " certainly served to alert the public of just how different our perception of the system was compared with its stance in the real world , " said rainer lehmann , a professor of education research at berlin 's humboldt university . indeed , the country 's mediocre ranking back in 2000 caught most germans , who thought highly of their school system , off guard .
the term pisa has since become a household word , reflecting the study 's resonance in the media . debate over studies ' relevance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could be moving towards a comprehensive system the debate has raised questions about the general relevance of comparative educational testing , pitting those who see tests as a useful comparative tool against those who focus on the shortcomings of big , international studies . most experts agree that big international studies have an important place in education policy . " the idea is that you have some natural variance between educational systems , and you try to capitalize upon this by looking at different influences , " said lehmann .
" the goal is to learn from other systems . " michael becker-mrotzeck , a professor in the department of language education at cologne university , agreed . " in principle , -lrb- these studies -rrb- tell us useful information about our school system , " he said .
" for instance , from the first and second pisa studies , germans learned that in no other country does social status of the parents have such a big effect on the academic success of their children . " in addition , the earlier studies showed weakness in certain basic competencies , like reading , math and science .
as a result , he said , schools have shifted focus - with visible results . in november an international test of elementary school competency showed that reading had " clearly improved . " " our education system reacted , quickly , " to the deficits uncovered by pisa , becker-mrotzeck said .
this led to the development of a spate of learning materials , and a host of creative concepts , such as reading nights and author-readings in schools . germany coming out of anti-testing era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has now accepted testing procedures unlike in the uk and the us , where educational testing has long been a buzzword and where standardized tests are routinely used to monitoring how much information is being passed from teachers to students , germany is fairly new to the game . after a spate of general tests in the early 70s showed similar weaknesses to those rediscovered by pisa in 2001 , the country underwent an anti-testing backlash that lasted a good 20 years . only recently have policymakers reinstated mass comparative testing in schools .
today , german schoolchildren face four " general " exams over the course of their 13 year school career - in 3rd , 8th , 10th and at the end of the 12th grade , becker-mrotzeck explained . " it is different than in the us or england , where they might have such tests twice a year , " said becker-mrozeck .
" i do n't think at that level germany is in danger of doing what they call in america , ' teaching to the test . " ' still , learning does n't take place via testing , said renate hendricks , a social democrat parliamentarian for the state of north-rhine westphalia , who specializes in education policy . " i think you can test what a person can do , but learning comes through motivation , curiosity , interest , and an emotional relationship to the teacher , " among other things , hendricks said . hendricks did acknowledge that comparative studies are useful for giving feedback aimed at improving schools .
" but if politicians are incapable of using the information they get to make positive change , then no , these studies are not useful , " she said . disparities in german system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pisa studies are flawed , say some she added that when the figures are broken down by social background , immense disparities in the german system are still evident in the newest pisa results . " now it is clear we have to do something , " she said .
" these politicians have to take off their rose-colored glasses .
or black glasses , or whatever they are wearing . " meanwhile , still other critics say the whole structure of pisa - indeed , the idea of widespread comparative international testing itself - is flawed .
the pisa study was also designed with " unrealistic goals , " according to joachim wuttke , a munich-based physicist , statistician and math teacher who has written two articles critiquing the methodology behind pisa and similar tests . tests weighted against germany , says expert " the ranking of states on a one-dimensional scale is not serious , " he said .
" you can construct tests that give different results , and this one is made in a way that shows germany is mediocre . " various factors can affect outcome .
the type of school system a country has is just one potential factor , he said , adding that the spectrum of students tested also differed from country to country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : differences in studies across europe are a problem " germany took great pains to get a representative sample of students , testing even in schools for special-needs students , " he said .
" meanwhile , finland excluded students with dyslexia from the test .
you ca n't do an international comparison of reading difficulties when you exclude some students . " ultimately , wuttke said tests like pisa " do n't test the system , they test the population . "
he pointed out that in highest-ranking finland , there are almost no immigrants . " if you compared results of all native students only , then finland is no longer at the top of the list , " he said . germany shocked out of stupor one thing the pisa proponents seem to agree on is that the results from 2001 shocked the country into a back-to-basics frenzy . " i see the main advantage of this test as having reoriented schools toward cognitive growth , " said humboldt university 's lehmann .
" every year you have a new set of educational goals seems to be defined - family education , sexual education , peace education , gender education ... but the core business seems to be forgotten . " but even there , wuttke sees pisa as more of a lost opportunity than a gain . " reading , math and science are important subjects , but it should n't come at the expense of other things like sports and music , " he said .
" i happen to think they are just as important . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the results are once again fanning the flames of controversy in the ongoing debate over school reform . germany reached 13th place out of 57 countries tested in the results of the latest program for international student assessment - pisa - study , officially published on tuesday , nov .
4 . but any joy over improvement in standing was damped when the test 's creator at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , andreas schleicher , last week told the press that the improvement was more likely due to changes in the way the test was structured , than to any actual improvement on the part of german students . the discussion over germany 's school performance has been raging since 2000 , when the country landed in the bottom third of the rankings of 32 countries , and continued through 2003 , when germany still rated 18th in a list of 40 countries . those rankings " certainly served to alert the public of just how different our perception of the system was compared with its stance in the real world , " said rainer lehmann , a professor of education research at berlin 's humboldt university . indeed , the country 's mediocre ranking back in 2000 caught most germans , who thought highly of their school system , off guard .
the term pisa has since become a household word , reflecting the study 's resonance in the media . debate over studies ' relevance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could be moving towards a comprehensive system the debate has raised questions about the general relevance of comparative educational testing , pitting those who see tests as a useful comparative tool against those who focus on the shortcomings of big , international studies . most experts agree that big international studies have an important place in education policy . " the idea is that you have some natural variance between educational systems , and you try to capitalize upon this by looking at different influences , " said lehmann .
" the goal is to learn from other systems . " michael becker-mrotzeck , a professor in the department of language education at cologne university , agreed . " in principle , -lrb- these studies -rrb- tell us useful information about our school system , " he said .
" for instance , from the first and second pisa studies , germans learned that in no other country does social status of the parents have such a big effect on the academic success of their children . " in addition , the earlier studies showed weakness in certain basic competencies , like reading , math and science .
as a result , he said , schools have shifted focus - with visible results . in november an international test of elementary school competency showed that reading had " clearly improved . " " our education system reacted , quickly , " to the deficits uncovered by pisa , becker-mrotzeck said .
this led to the development of a spate of learning materials , and a host of creative concepts , such as reading nights and author-readings in schools . germany coming out of anti-testing era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has now accepted testing procedures unlike in the uk and the us , where educational testing has long been a buzzword and where standardized tests are routinely used to monitoring how much information is being passed from teachers to students , germany is fairly new to the game . after a spate of general tests in the early 70s showed similar weaknesses to those rediscovered by pisa in 2001 , the country underwent an anti-testing backlash that lasted a good 20 years . only recently have policymakers reinstated mass comparative testing in schools .
today , german schoolchildren face four " general " exams over the course of their 13 year school career - in 3rd , 8th , 10th and at the end of the 12th grade , becker-mrotzeck explained . " it is different than in the us or england , where they might have such tests twice a year , " said becker-mrozeck .
" i do n't think at that level germany is in danger of doing what they call in america , ' teaching to the test . " ' still , learning does n't take place via testing , said renate hendricks , a social democrat parliamentarian for the state of north-rhine westphalia , who specializes in education policy . " i think you can test what a person can do , but learning comes through motivation , curiosity , interest , and an emotional relationship to the teacher , " among other things , hendricks said . hendricks did acknowledge that comparative studies are useful for giving feedback aimed at improving schools .
" but if politicians are incapable of using the information they get to make positive change , then no , these studies are not useful , " she said . disparities in german system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pisa studies are flawed , say some she added that when the figures are broken down by social background , immense disparities in the german system are still evident in the newest pisa results . " now it is clear we have to do something , " she said .
" these politicians have to take off their rose-colored glasses .
or black glasses , or whatever they are wearing . " meanwhile , still other critics say the whole structure of pisa - indeed , the idea of widespread comparative international testing itself - is flawed .
the pisa study was also designed with " unrealistic goals , " according to joachim wuttke , a munich-based physicist , statistician and math teacher who has written two articles critiquing the methodology behind pisa and similar tests . tests weighted against germany , says expert " the ranking of states on a one-dimensional scale is not serious , " he said .
" you can construct tests that give different results , and this one is made in a way that shows germany is mediocre . " various factors can affect outcome .
the type of school system a country has is just one potential factor , he said , adding that the spectrum of students tested also differed from country to country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : differences in studies across europe are a problem " germany took great pains to get a representative sample of students , testing even in schools for special-needs students , " he said .
" meanwhile , finland excluded students with dyslexia from the test .
you ca n't do an international comparison of reading difficulties when you exclude some students . " ultimately , wuttke said tests like pisa " do n't test the system , they test the population . "
he pointed out that in highest-ranking finland , there are almost no immigrants . " if you compared results of all native students only , then finland is no longer at the top of the list , " he said . germany shocked out of stupor one thing the pisa proponents seem to agree on is that the results from 2001 shocked the country into a back-to-basics frenzy . " i see the main advantage of this test as having reoriented schools toward cognitive growth , " said humboldt university 's lehmann .
" every year you have a new set of educational goals seems to be defined - family education , sexual education , peace education , gender education ... but the core business seems to be forgotten . " but even there , wuttke sees pisa as more of a lost opportunity than a gain . " reading , math and science are important subjects , but it should n't come at the expense of other things like sports and music , " he said .

more than half of european households have internet access .
the number with hi-speed broadband connections have risen sharply , according to eu statistical agency eurostat . some 54 percent of homes in the european union 's 27 nations now have access to the world wide web , compared to 49 percent in the first quarter of 2006 .
the number of broadband connections has rocketed from 30 percent to 42 percent . the survey shows one in two people use an internet search engine , while 15 percent make voice-over-internet calls and 13 percent use peer-to-peer file sharing software for movies and music . but internet use varies widely across europe .
the dutch are the most wired up .

they are followed by the internet savvy estonians , who spawned the company skype . nearly a quarter of people in the netherlands dutch and luxembourg use the net to download music and movies , only 6 percent of czechs and irish do so . the european commission blames governments for the wide variation in the price and technology available to customers in the various member states , accusing them of not doing enough to open up the market .

" this kind of sermon to bosses serves no purpose , like sermons by politicians in general , " ludwig georg braun , of the german chamber of commerce and industry , told the daily frankfurter rundschau . on monday , dec .
3 , chancellor merkel had said during talks about executive salaries that she did not see a problem with top managers being " well paid " as long as they " did a lot for their companies and their partners . " however , merkel stressed her belief that : " when directors ' failures are rewarded with fantastic bonuses , it damages trust in the social balance within our country , " as cited by afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel spoke out against failures being rewarded with bonuses german president horst köhler had said something similar last week . braun said tuesday that " it is up to the supervisory boards of companies to decide on the salaries they are willing to pay to recruit the best managers . " porsche paid over 100 million euros to mangers the issue arose last week when news of generous pay packages enjoyed by directors of the luxury sports car company porsche was reported . porsche said it had paid its six top board members a total of 112.7 million euros -lrb- $ 165 million -rrb- in bonuses for their performance in 2006 .
in the previous year , it had paid 45.2 million . the wall street journal reported that chief executive wendelin wiedeking alone was paid 68 million euros in compensation last year . the news broke around the same time that german postal workers won a hard-fought battle for a minimum wage of between eight and 9.80 euros an hour .
the announcement underscored an increasing disparity of wealth in europe 's biggest economy . poverty among those who work a study by the hans böckler foundation confirmed this week what many germans had already been feeling : that their buying power is steadily declining in the midst of a robust economic recovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking received nearly 70 million euros in bonuses " the distortion in the distribution of wealth and the rise of poverty among workers are a real problem for the economy and society as a whole , " claus schaefer , author of the study , told afp . at a press conference on tuesday , ekkehard schulz , head of the steel group thyssenkrupp , said : " i share the view of mrs. merkel and mr. köhler , " referring to bonuses paid to mangers . " excesses , especially when it is a question of severance pay , are not timely , and never were … , " he added . schulz himself earned around four million euros in the company 's last fiscal year .
he said he was was " satisfied " with his pay : " i am within the average of dax bosses , " he told afp , in reference to the german index of 30 blue chip groups . porsche , which is not listed on the dax index , earned more money trading derivatives than from selling cars in its fiscal year that ended july 31 .
stock-option transactions contributed a pretax of 3.59 billion euros to the group 's results . total net profit came to 4.242 billion euros , more than three times the result of 1.393 billion one year earlier , as cited by afp . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 04.12.2007 eu to keep up pressure on iran after us report großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 , a us report said a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy envoy javier solana said the european union would keep up its twin track approach of dialogue and pressure .
the report stated that iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 . for nearly 18 months , solana has been trying to persuade the islamic republic to suspend uranium enrichment in exchange for a bundle of political , trade and economic incentives . solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said the national intelligence estimate -lrb- nie -rrb- report " proves that transparency about -lrb- iran 's -rrb- nuclear activities and its intentions are fundamental . " but us president george w. bush said that iran remains a danger and refused to rule out a military attack despite the new findings . " iran was dangerous , iran is dangerous and iran will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon , " bush told a white house press conference . the international atomic agency director general mohamed el baradei said on tuesday , nov .
4 , that the report tallied with the iaea investigation into the country 's nuclear program . a number of european countries , including germany , have already welcomed the us report as confirming that europe 's strategy of negotiations plus sanctions is keeping tehran in line with international demands . the nie report confirmed " the double approach chosen by the international community of incentives and measures from the united nations security council was right , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a statement released monday , nov .
3 . britain 's foreign ministry also said the carrot-and-stick approach was working to keep iran in line with international demands . " the report 's conclusions justify the action already taken by the international community to get to the bottom of iran 's nuclear program and to increase pressure on the regime to stop its enrichment and reprocessing activities , " a british foreign ministry spokeswoman told the afp news agency . international pressure successful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the double approach of sanctions and incentives needed to continue the national intelligence estimate , a consensus of all 16 us spy agencies , said in a report monday that it was confident that iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in late 2003 .
nie cited " moderate confidence " that the program had not been restarted as of mid-2007 . tehran could have the technical ability to build a nuclear weapon between 2010 and 2015 , but " we do not know if it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons , " the report stated . iran appears " less determined to develop nuclear weapons than we have been judging since 2005 , " the nie said .
the report concluded that it was likely that tehran had halted its nuclear program in response to international pressure , which " suggests that iran may be more vulnerable to influence on the issue than we judged previously . " europe 's mixed approach to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military work at iran 's nuclear facilities may have stopped four years ago the united nations security council has brought sanctions against iran twice for refusing to discontinue its uranium enrichment program .
enriched uranium can be used to build nuclear weapons , but iran has consistently said its program is purely used for civilian purposes . the five permanent members of the security council - britain , china , france , russia and the usa - plus germany met in paris over the weekend to discuss a third sanctions resolution but did not reach an agreement . in 2004 and 2005 , germany , along with britain and france , led a diplomatic initiative with tehran in which trade and other economic incentives were discussed in exchange for a halt on the uranium enrichment program . while the so-called eu-3 has since supported un-led sanctions against iran , it has also remained open to a more diplomatic strategy . report may be face-saver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran welcomed the report , saying it confirmed iran 's nuclear plans are peaceful us national security advisor stephen hadley said the report should n't be taken as a reason to lose vigilance . " there 's going to be a tendency of a lot of people to say : ' the problem 's less bad that we thought , let 's relax , " ' said hadley .
" our view is that would be a mistake . " hadley denied that us rhetoric on iran had escalated to step up international pressure .
in october , us president george w. bush raised the specters of " world war iii " or a " nuclear holocaust " occurring should teheran build a nuclear bomb . the estimate could have been a " face saving decision " because bush is not willing to strike militarily and has exhausted the efforts at the un security council , alex vatanka of the middle east institute told the dpa news agency . " at this stage of the game it is better to underplay the threat , " he said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de european powers push for tougher sanctions against iran germany , france and britain have said iran had not done enough to prove that its nuclear program had a peaceful purpose and the united nations should now consider tougher sanctions .

the report stated that iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 . for nearly 18 months , solana has been trying to persuade the islamic republic to suspend uranium enrichment in exchange for a bundle of political , trade and economic incentives . solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said the national intelligence estimate -lrb- nie -rrb- report " proves that transparency about -lrb- iran 's -rrb- nuclear activities and its intentions are fundamental . " but us president george w. bush said that iran remains a danger and refused to rule out a military attack despite the new findings . " iran was dangerous , iran is dangerous and iran will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon , " bush told a white house press conference . the international atomic agency director general mohamed el baradei said on tuesday , nov .
4 , that the report tallied with the iaea investigation into the country 's nuclear program . a number of european countries , including germany , have already welcomed the us report as confirming that europe 's strategy of negotiations plus sanctions is keeping tehran in line with international demands . the nie report confirmed " the double approach chosen by the international community of incentives and measures from the united nations security council was right , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a statement released monday , nov .
3 . britain 's foreign ministry also said the carrot-and-stick approach was working to keep iran in line with international demands . " the report 's conclusions justify the action already taken by the international community to get to the bottom of iran 's nuclear program and to increase pressure on the regime to stop its enrichment and reprocessing activities , " a british foreign ministry spokeswoman told the afp news agency . international pressure successful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the double approach of sanctions and incentives needed to continue the national intelligence estimate , a consensus of all 16 us spy agencies , said in a report monday that it was confident that iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in late 2003 .
nie cited " moderate confidence " that the program had not been restarted as of mid-2007 . tehran could have the technical ability to build a nuclear weapon between 2010 and 2015 , but " we do not know if it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons , " the report stated . iran appears " less determined to develop nuclear weapons than we have been judging since 2005 , " the nie said .
the report concluded that it was likely that tehran had halted its nuclear program in response to international pressure , which " suggests that iran may be more vulnerable to influence on the issue than we judged previously . " europe 's mixed approach to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military work at iran 's nuclear facilities may have stopped four years ago the united nations security council has brought sanctions against iran twice for refusing to discontinue its uranium enrichment program .
enriched uranium can be used to build nuclear weapons , but iran has consistently said its program is purely used for civilian purposes . the five permanent members of the security council - britain , china , france , russia and the usa - plus germany met in paris over the weekend to discuss a third sanctions resolution but did not reach an agreement . in 2004 and 2005 , germany , along with britain and france , led a diplomatic initiative with tehran in which trade and other economic incentives were discussed in exchange for a halt on the uranium enrichment program . while the so-called eu-3 has since supported un-led sanctions against iran , it has also remained open to a more diplomatic strategy . report may be face-saver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran welcomed the report , saying it confirmed iran 's nuclear plans are peaceful us national security advisor stephen hadley said the report should n't be taken as a reason to lose vigilance . " there 's going to be a tendency of a lot of people to say : ' the problem 's less bad that we thought , let 's relax , " ' said hadley .
" our view is that would be a mistake . " hadley denied that us rhetoric on iran had escalated to step up international pressure .
in october , us president george w. bush raised the specters of " world war iii " or a " nuclear holocaust " occurring should teheran build a nuclear bomb . the estimate could have been a " face saving decision " because bush is not willing to strike militarily and has exhausted the efforts at the un security council , alex vatanka of the middle east institute told the dpa news agency . " at this stage of the game it is better to underplay the threat , " he said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

six months after parliamentary elections , belgium remains without a government .
outgoing pm guy verhofstadt has launched mediation talks with the country 's main parties after belgian king albert approached him for help . verhofstadt hopes to mend the rupture between francophone and flemish-speaking leaders after coalition talks to form a new government collapsed last week .
this comes after king albert ii summoned verhofstadt on monday and asked him , according to a statement issued by the palace , " to inform the king on the way to get out of the impasse very swiftly , and to make all the contacts necessary to do so . "
belgian television reports have interpreted the belgian king 's move as bestowing “ urgent ” powers , including dealing with “ international matters , ” on prime minister guy verhofstadt .
but this would be in violation of the belgian constitution which does not provide for extended powers to governments without a parliamentary majority .
flemish christian democrat leader yves leterme , who was expected to succeed verhofstadt , told the king on saturday that he was unable to form a coalition after failing to reach a deal over how much power should be devolved to the regions .
haunted by the specter of division along linguistic lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's image is beginning to look a little tattered the deadlock has sparked fears that belgium would split into the flemish and french-speaking parts .
" our country is facing one of the most severe political crises of the last decades , " verhofstadt told a news conference in brussels .
" this situation can not and must not continue for much longer , " he added .
verhofstadt said the country needed fundamental state reform , adding that the country 's problems could be solved " when everyone recognized the seriousness of the situation and took responsibility . "
he said he wanted to reach an agreement on devolution and tackle urgent social and economic issues that go far beyond the authority of a caretaker government .
situation remains unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would-be pm leterme is of mixed parentage himself , but he has not built bridges between the two communities but verhofstadt , who was ousted in the june elections after eight years in office , did not give details of his plans or how the 2008 budget could be drafted under these circumstances .
belgium 's flemish majority wants more autonomy for the relatively rich region of flanders , a move seen as a political and financial threat in the french-speaking region of wallonia .
many flemish voters believe that their taxes - amongst the highest in the world - are used to subsidize the social security system in the south .
verhofstadt said the country 's image abroad was suffering because of the ongoing crisis .
business leaders say potential foreign investors will be driven away .
the liberal vld leader managed to largely keep a lid on devolution-related issues during his term of office .
but he was punished for that at the polls by flemish voters .

six months after parliamentary elections , belgium remains without a government .
outgoing pm guy verhofstadt has launched mediation talks with the country 's main parties after belgian king albert approached him for help . verhofstadt hopes to mend the rupture between francophone and flemish-speaking leaders after coalition talks to form a new government collapsed last week .
this comes after king albert ii summoned verhofstadt on monday and asked him , according to a statement issued by the palace , " to inform the king on the way to get out of the impasse very swiftly , and to make all the contacts necessary to do so . "
belgian television reports have interpreted the belgian king 's move as bestowing “ urgent ” powers , including dealing with “ international matters , ” on prime minister guy verhofstadt .
but this would be in violation of the belgian constitution which does not provide for extended powers to governments without a parliamentary majority .
flemish christian democrat leader yves leterme , who was expected to succeed verhofstadt , told the king on saturday that he was unable to form a coalition after failing to reach a deal over how much power should be devolved to the regions .
haunted by the specter of division along linguistic lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's image is beginning to look a little tattered the deadlock has sparked fears that belgium would split into the flemish and french-speaking parts .
" our country is facing one of the most severe political crises of the last decades , " verhofstadt told a news conference in brussels .
" this situation can not and must not continue for much longer , " he added .
verhofstadt said the country needed fundamental state reform , adding that the country 's problems could be solved " when everyone recognized the seriousness of the situation and took responsibility . "
he said he wanted to reach an agreement on devolution and tackle urgent social and economic issues that go far beyond the authority of a caretaker government .
situation remains unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would-be pm leterme is of mixed parentage himself , but he has not built bridges between the two communities but verhofstadt , who was ousted in the june elections after eight years in office , did not give details of his plans or how the 2008 budget could be drafted under these circumstances .
belgium 's flemish majority wants more autonomy for the relatively rich region of flanders , a move seen as a political and financial threat in the french-speaking region of wallonia .
many flemish voters believe that their taxes - amongst the highest in the world - are used to subsidize the social security system in the south .
verhofstadt said the country 's image abroad was suffering because of the ongoing crisis .
business leaders say potential foreign investors will be driven away .
the liberal vld leader managed to largely keep a lid on devolution-related issues during his term of office .
but he was punished for that at the polls by flemish voters .

" this kind of sermon to bosses serves no purpose , like sermons by politicians in general , " ludwig georg braun , of the german chamber of commerce and industry , told the daily frankfurter rundschau . on monday , dec .
3 , chancellor merkel had said during talks about executive salaries that she did not see a problem with top managers being " well paid " as long as they " did a lot for their companies and their partners . " however , merkel stressed her belief that : " when directors ' failures are rewarded with fantastic bonuses , it damages trust in the social balance within our country , " as cited by afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel spoke out against failures being rewarded with bonuses german president horst köhler had said something similar last week . braun said tuesday that " it is up to the supervisory boards of companies to decide on the salaries they are willing to pay to recruit the best managers . " porsche paid over 100 million euros to mangers the issue arose last week when news of generous pay packages enjoyed by directors of the luxury sports car company porsche was reported . porsche said it had paid its six top board members a total of 112.7 million euros -lrb- $ 165 million -rrb- in bonuses for their performance in 2006 .
in the previous year , it had paid 45.2 million . the wall street journal reported that chief executive wendelin wiedeking alone was paid 68 million euros in compensation last year . the news broke around the same time that german postal workers won a hard-fought battle for a minimum wage of between eight and 9.80 euros an hour .
the announcement underscored an increasing disparity of wealth in europe 's biggest economy . poverty among those who work a study by the hans böckler foundation confirmed this week what many germans had already been feeling : that their buying power is steadily declining in the midst of a robust economic recovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking received nearly 70 million euros in bonuses " the distortion in the distribution of wealth and the rise of poverty among workers are a real problem for the economy and society as a whole , " claus schaefer , author of the study , told afp . at a press conference on tuesday , ekkehard schulz , head of the steel group thyssenkrupp , said : " i share the view of mrs. merkel and mr. köhler , " referring to bonuses paid to mangers . " excesses , especially when it is a question of severance pay , are not timely , and never were … , " he added . schulz himself earned around four million euros in the company 's last fiscal year .
he said he was was " satisfied " with his pay : " i am within the average of dax bosses , " he told afp , in reference to the german index of 30 blue chip groups . porsche , which is not listed on the dax index , earned more money trading derivatives than from selling cars in its fiscal year that ended july 31 .
stock-option transactions contributed a pretax of 3.59 billion euros to the group 's results . total net profit came to 4.242 billion euros , more than three times the result of 1.393 billion one year earlier , as cited by afp . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's a real pleasure to receive my good friend donald tusk ...
poland is a very important partner , and the voice of poland matters , " a buoyant eu commission president jose manuel barroso told journalists in brussels .
when tusk arrived in the commission - the eu 's executive - barroso met him with a beaming smile and an ebullient handshake which would not have been out of place in a christmas grotto .
and tusk replied in kind , referring to a new relationship of trust between his government and the brussels apparatus at least half a dozen times in his opening remarks and joking that he was relieved to have been allowed in after having given a marathon three-hour introductory speech to poland 's parliament 10 days ago .
even barroso 's spokesman , johannes laitenberger , received an ovation when he introduced tusk in polish - a linguistic feat met with cheers and whistles by the large contingent of polish visitors .
a breath of fresh air after kaczynskis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski brothers have been pariahs at the eu it was all a far cry from the tempestuous diplomacy of earlier times .
under tusk 's predecessor , the pugnacious jaroslaw kaczynski , relations between brussels and warsaw strained to breaking point .
in 2007 alone , kaczynski clashed bitterly with the eu over issues ranging from the vote allocated to poland under the new eu reform treaty to the construction of a bypass road through a nature reserve .
and his abrasive defence of polish interests won him few friends in brussels , where he was widely regarded as failing to understand the delicate system of compromises by which the eu functions .
" they seem not to have got the idea of give and take , " one senior brussels diplomat commented , in a reference to kaczynski and his twin brother lech , poland 's current president .
indeed , under the kaczynskis poland seemed set to win the title of europe 's " chief troublemaker , " as the twins threatened to veto a deal on the reform treaty at two successive summits .
tusk victory welcomed with relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk 's election victory caused brussels to sigh with relief tusk 's convincing win in parliamentary elections on october 21 , and his pledge to restore normality to the relationship with brussels , was hailed with relief in the eu 's capital .
" we discussed the future in a spirit of trust - of ' zaufanie , ' to use the polish word , " barroso joked on tuesday , winning a cheer of his own from his audience .
tusk has made trust his government 's watchword , and used the word some 45 times in his first speech .
and while many issues could still dampen the festive spirit - the bypass dispute , cod fishing quotas , energy security , and us plans to site parts of its missile shield in poland , to name but four - both men were convinced that they would no longer spoil the party .
" when we speak openly about things that can become a problem , both sides quickly find solutions , " tusk said .
even the end of the visit raised a cheer as laitenberger wished his audience " goodbye and good luck " in near-faultless polish .
festive goodwill in the capital of europe with the new spirit of cordiality shining through the gloom of a brussels december , both barroso and tusk looked delighted with their christmas message of peace in europe and goodwill to all men .

" it 's a real pleasure to receive my good friend donald tusk ...
poland is a very important partner , and the voice of poland matters , " a buoyant eu commission president jose manuel barroso told journalists in brussels .
when tusk arrived in the commission - the eu 's executive - barroso met him with a beaming smile and an ebullient handshake which would not have been out of place in a christmas grotto .
and tusk replied in kind , referring to a new relationship of trust between his government and the brussels apparatus at least half a dozen times in his opening remarks and joking that he was relieved to have been allowed in after having given a marathon three-hour introductory speech to poland 's parliament 10 days ago .
even barroso 's spokesman , johannes laitenberger , received an ovation when he introduced tusk in polish - a linguistic feat met with cheers and whistles by the large contingent of polish visitors .
a breath of fresh air after kaczynskis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski brothers have been pariahs at the eu it was all a far cry from the tempestuous diplomacy of earlier times .
under tusk 's predecessor , the pugnacious jaroslaw kaczynski , relations between brussels and warsaw strained to breaking point .
in 2007 alone , kaczynski clashed bitterly with the eu over issues ranging from the vote allocated to poland under the new eu reform treaty to the construction of a bypass road through a nature reserve .
and his abrasive defence of polish interests won him few friends in brussels , where he was widely regarded as failing to understand the delicate system of compromises by which the eu functions .
" they seem not to have got the idea of give and take , " one senior brussels diplomat commented , in a reference to kaczynski and his twin brother lech , poland 's current president .
indeed , under the kaczynskis poland seemed set to win the title of europe 's " chief troublemaker , " as the twins threatened to veto a deal on the reform treaty at two successive summits .
tusk victory welcomed with relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk 's election victory caused brussels to sigh with relief tusk 's convincing win in parliamentary elections on october 21 , and his pledge to restore normality to the relationship with brussels , was hailed with relief in the eu 's capital .
" we discussed the future in a spirit of trust - of ' zaufanie , ' to use the polish word , " barroso joked on tuesday , winning a cheer of his own from his audience .
tusk has made trust his government 's watchword , and used the word some 45 times in his first speech .
and while many issues could still dampen the festive spirit - the bypass dispute , cod fishing quotas , energy security , and us plans to site parts of its missile shield in poland , to name but four - both men were convinced that they would no longer spoil the party .
" when we speak openly about things that can become a problem , both sides quickly find solutions , " tusk said .

but the results are once again fanning the flames of controversy in the ongoing debate over school reform . germany reached 13th place out of 57 countries tested in the results of the latest program for international student assessment - pisa - study , officially published on tuesday , nov .
4 . but any joy over improvement in standing was damped when the test 's creator at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , andreas schleicher , last week told the press that the improvement was more likely due to changes in the way the test was structured , than to any actual improvement on the part of german students . the discussion over germany 's school performance has been raging since 2000 , when the country landed in the bottom third of the rankings of 32 countries , and continued through 2003 , when germany still rated 18th in a list of 40 countries . those rankings " certainly served to alert the public of just how different our perception of the system was compared with its stance in the real world , " said rainer lehmann , a professor of education research at berlin 's humboldt university . indeed , the country 's mediocre ranking back in 2000 caught most germans , who thought highly of their school system , off guard .
the term pisa has since become a household word , reflecting the study 's resonance in the media . debate over studies ' relevance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could be moving towards a comprehensive system the debate has raised questions about the general relevance of comparative educational testing , pitting those who see tests as a useful comparative tool against those who focus on the shortcomings of big , international studies . most experts agree that big international studies have an important place in education policy . " the idea is that you have some natural variance between educational systems , and you try to capitalize upon this by looking at different influences , " said lehmann .
" the goal is to learn from other systems . " michael becker-mrotzeck , a professor in the department of language education at cologne university , agreed . " in principle , -lrb- these studies -rrb- tell us useful information about our school system , " he said .
" for instance , from the first and second pisa studies , germans learned that in no other country does social status of the parents have such a big effect on the academic success of their children . " in addition , the earlier studies showed weakness in certain basic competencies , like reading , math and science .
as a result , he said , schools have shifted focus - with visible results . in november an international test of elementary school competency showed that reading had " clearly improved . " " our education system reacted , quickly , " to the deficits uncovered by pisa , becker-mrotzeck said .
this led to the development of a spate of learning materials , and a host of creative concepts , such as reading nights and author-readings in schools . germany coming out of anti-testing era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has now accepted testing procedures unlike in the uk and the us , where educational testing has long been a buzzword and where standardized tests are routinely used to monitoring how much information is being passed from teachers to students , germany is fairly new to the game . after a spate of general tests in the early 70s showed similar weaknesses to those rediscovered by pisa in 2001 , the country underwent an anti-testing backlash that lasted a good 20 years . only recently have policymakers reinstated mass comparative testing in schools .
today , german schoolchildren face four " general " exams over the course of their 13 year school career - in 3rd , 8th , 10th and at the end of the 12th grade , becker-mrotzeck explained . " it is different than in the us or england , where they might have such tests twice a year , " said becker-mrozeck .
" i do n't think at that level germany is in danger of doing what they call in america , ' teaching to the test . " ' still , learning does n't take place via testing , said renate hendricks , a social democrat parliamentarian for the state of north-rhine westphalia , who specializes in education policy . " i think you can test what a person can do , but learning comes through motivation , curiosity , interest , and an emotional relationship to the teacher , " among other things , hendricks said . hendricks did acknowledge that comparative studies are useful for giving feedback aimed at improving schools .
" but if politicians are incapable of using the information they get to make positive change , then no , these studies are not useful , " she said . disparities in german system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pisa studies are flawed , say some she added that when the figures are broken down by social background , immense disparities in the german system are still evident in the newest pisa results . " now it is clear we have to do something , " she said .
" these politicians have to take off their rose-colored glasses .
or black glasses , or whatever they are wearing . " meanwhile , still other critics say the whole structure of pisa - indeed , the idea of widespread comparative international testing itself - is flawed .
the pisa study was also designed with " unrealistic goals , " according to joachim wuttke , a munich-based physicist , statistician and math teacher who has written two articles critiquing the methodology behind pisa and similar tests . tests weighted against germany , says expert " the ranking of states on a one-dimensional scale is not serious , " he said .
" you can construct tests that give different results , and this one is made in a way that shows germany is mediocre . " various factors can affect outcome .
the type of school system a country has is just one potential factor , he said , adding that the spectrum of students tested also differed from country to country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : differences in studies across europe are a problem " germany took great pains to get a representative sample of students , testing even in schools for special-needs students , " he said .
" meanwhile , finland excluded students with dyslexia from the test .
you ca n't do an international comparison of reading difficulties when you exclude some students . " ultimately , wuttke said tests like pisa " do n't test the system , they test the population . "
he pointed out that in highest-ranking finland , there are almost no immigrants . " if you compared results of all native students only , then finland is no longer at the top of the list , " he said . germany shocked out of stupor one thing the pisa proponents seem to agree on is that the results from 2001 shocked the country into a back-to-basics frenzy . " i see the main advantage of this test as having reoriented schools toward cognitive growth , " said humboldt university 's lehmann .
" every year you have a new set of educational goals seems to be defined - family education , sexual education , peace education , gender education ... but the core business seems to be forgotten . " but even there , wuttke sees pisa as more of a lost opportunity than a gain . " reading , math and science are important subjects , but it should n't come at the expense of other things like sports and music , " he said .

jürgen klinsmann is being looked at to fill the vacancy , but he would face opposition from some fans despite being a great choice , says dw 's nick amies . it would n't be an exaggeration to compare the possibility of former germany coach - and england nemesis - jürgen klinsmann taking over as coach of the three lions to hillary clinton or barak obama becoming president of the united states of america .
in all three hypothetical cases , the most pertinent question remains the same : is the country ready or is that really a step too far ? the possibility of the united states electing a woman or an african-american into the white house is divisive to say the least .
the fact that mrs. clinton and mr. obama are even in the running at this very early stage of the presidential race says something about how attitudes , at least in some parts of the country , have changed in the us .
most of their detractors focus on their policy stances and personality traits rather than their gender or racial background , which is encouraging for a nation that has for centuries tended to view the commander in chief 's job as being reserved for white males only .
if only the same could be said for the opinions and attitudes of some of the england faithful when it comes to the possibility of klinsmann leading england .
still , klinsmann , who led germany to third place in the 2006 world cup and turned down a job offer from the us soccer federation , has hinted he might be interested in occupying the vacant england bench .
klinsi the mold breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi 's and germany 's success has always rankled england fans klinsmann is one of a rare breed ; a german who has endeared himself to the english soccer masses .
his two spells as a tottenham hotspurs player in the 1990 's are credited with rehabilitating the long-held image of conniving , arrogant and - heaven forbid - massively successful germans which had been cultivated through decades of smug tournament victories and much-reveled-in conquests over england .
his self-referential diving celebration after scoring showed a humorous side to the teutonic efficiency that had grated so much with england fans for so long while his contribution in making the premiership the star-studded internationally renowned league it is now can not be underestimated .
his coaching ability is also grudgingly respected on the island .
in his short tenure , klinsmann transformed germany from a nation infamous for grinding out results to a team purring with flair which - as long as that flair was not used to knock england out of any tournament - was appreciated by those english who lamented the lack of invention in their own team .
the german it 's okay to like bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far would klinsi 's popularity in england stretch ?
klinsi is what is commonly known in those circles where such things matter as " an okay german " for his contribution to the premiership and his philosophy of how the game should be played .
it must , however , be said that klinsmann only remains the good german while he is not responsible for any england heartbreak .
all that could change if he is made england coach .
the england job carries the most pressure of any managerial position in international soccer .
the expectation among the fans is hysterically high and probably unachievable .
despite going 41 years without a title since their only tournament success , fans always believe it is england 's right to win .
to keep these demanding supporters happy and lead england to victory is a hard task for any man , and even more so for a german .
section of fans stuck in the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some england fans would not welcome a german coach believe what you want about england 's notorious fans being rehabilitated or locked-up out of harms way .
the truth is there are still elements which sing " ten german bombers " , chant along to the " dambusters " theme and claim in song that hitler was testicularly-challenged .
animosity towards the germans arising from world war ii is sadly still alive in some less-enlightened quarters and the appointment of one who has been a hate-figure in his time as a player would certainly test how far the england faithful have come in their sensitivity training .
it is only six years ago that england got its first foreign coach .
the uproar over appointing an unassuming swede would be nothing compared to the narrow-minded maelstrom that would accompany the naming of a formerly cocky german as national coach .
right now , england fans are holding out in the hope that former chelsea coach jose mourinho will take charge .
while many are offering prayers that the special one will ride to their rescue , few are considering a future where jürgen klinsmann beams out at them from the dug-out in his standard fa blazer .
put common sense ahead of prejudice but they should .
those implications could be a team playing to its full potential under a young and visionary coach ; an england team feared across the world , not laughed at , and a team ready to put over four decades of underachievement behind it .
if klinsmann gets the job and people still have a problem with him being german while he is winning matches and tournaments for england , then something is very , very wrong .
for a nation of supporters which craves success as much as england fans do , it should n't matter where their next coach comes from as long as he 's a winner . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said that final decisions about membership should be made at the end of talks . merkel distances cdu from spd merkel 's comments in her monday speech were apparently an attempt to demarcate policy differences on turkey between her conservative cdu and her center-left junior coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . according to reuters , eu diplomats said france wanted to have the word " accession " eliminated from the section concerning negotiations with turkey in a statement on the eu 's enlargement policy , which the bloc 's foreign ministers are due to approve on monday . ankara has said it wants nothing but membership and has rejected the idea of an " enhanced partnership " with the eu . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internationals -pipe- 04.12.2007 klinsi the " good german " could be england 's wake-up call großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann 's passion and management skills should be the issue , not his nationality could a german really become coach of fierce rivals england ?
jürgen klinsmann is being looked at to fill the vacancy , but he would face opposition from some fans despite being a great choice , says dw 's nick amies . it would n't be an exaggeration to compare the possibility of former germany coach - and england nemesis - jürgen klinsmann taking over as coach of the three lions to hillary clinton or barak obama becoming president of the united states of america .
in all three hypothetical cases , the most pertinent question remains the same : is the country ready or is that really a step too far ? the possibility of the united states electing a woman or an african-american into the white house is divisive to say the least .
the fact that mrs. clinton and mr. obama are even in the running at this very early stage of the presidential race says something about how attitudes , at least in some parts of the country , have changed in the us .
most of their detractors focus on their policy stances and personality traits rather than their gender or racial background , which is encouraging for a nation that has for centuries tended to view the commander in chief 's job as being reserved for white males only .
if only the same could be said for the opinions and attitudes of some of the england faithful when it comes to the possibility of klinsmann leading england .
still , klinsmann , who led germany to third place in the 2006 world cup and turned down a job offer from the us soccer federation , has hinted he might be interested in occupying the vacant england bench .
klinsi the mold breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi 's and germany 's success has always rankled england fans klinsmann is one of a rare breed ; a german who has endeared himself to the english soccer masses .
his two spells as a tottenham hotspurs player in the 1990 's are credited with rehabilitating the long-held image of conniving , arrogant and - heaven forbid - massively successful germans which had been cultivated through decades of smug tournament victories and much-reveled-in conquests over england .
his self-referential diving celebration after scoring showed a humorous side to the teutonic efficiency that had grated so much with england fans for so long while his contribution in making the premiership the star-studded internationally renowned league it is now can not be underestimated .
his coaching ability is also grudgingly respected on the island .
in his short tenure , klinsmann transformed germany from a nation infamous for grinding out results to a team purring with flair which - as long as that flair was not used to knock england out of any tournament - was appreciated by those english who lamented the lack of invention in their own team .
the german it 's okay to like bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far would klinsi 's popularity in england stretch ?
klinsi is what is commonly known in those circles where such things matter as " an okay german " for his contribution to the premiership and his philosophy of how the game should be played .
it must , however , be said that klinsmann only remains the good german while he is not responsible for any england heartbreak .
all that could change if he is made england coach .
the england job carries the most pressure of any managerial position in international soccer .
the expectation among the fans is hysterically high and probably unachievable .
despite going 41 years without a title since their only tournament success , fans always believe it is england 's right to win .
to keep these demanding supporters happy and lead england to victory is a hard task for any man , and even more so for a german .
section of fans stuck in the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some england fans would not welcome a german coach believe what you want about england 's notorious fans being rehabilitated or locked-up out of harms way .
the truth is there are still elements which sing " ten german bombers " , chant along to the " dambusters " theme and claim in song that hitler was testicularly-challenged .
animosity towards the germans arising from world war ii is sadly still alive in some less-enlightened quarters and the appointment of one who has been a hate-figure in his time as a player would certainly test how far the england faithful have come in their sensitivity training .
it is only six years ago that england got its first foreign coach .
the uproar over appointing an unassuming swede would be nothing compared to the narrow-minded maelstrom that would accompany the naming of a formerly cocky german as national coach .
right now , england fans are holding out in the hope that former chelsea coach jose mourinho will take charge .
while many are offering prayers that the special one will ride to their rescue , few are considering a future where jürgen klinsmann beams out at them from the dug-out in his standard fa blazer .
put common sense ahead of prejudice but they should .
those implications could be a team playing to its full potential under a young and visionary coach ; an england team feared across the world , not laughed at , and a team ready to put over four decades of underachievement behind it .
if klinsmann gets the job and people still have a problem with him being german while he is winning matches and tournaments for england , then something is very , very wrong .
for a nation of supporters which craves success as much as england fans do , it should n't matter where their next coach comes from as long as he 's a winner . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most of the eu has been at odds with putin . the french leader nicolas sarkozy 's gesture clearly showed he was not toeing the european union line and put him at odds with neighbor and close ally germany .
the german government had called sunday 's parliamentary elections in russia " neither free , fair nor democratic " by western standards . other eu governments have also voiced concern over reports of election irregularities and indeed , the european union 's portuguese presidency said tuesday that russia 's legislative election " did not meet international standards and commitments . " the european union " regrets ... that there were many reports and allegations of media restrictions as well as harassment of opposition parties and ngos in the run up to the elections and on election day , " the presidency said in a statement , as reported by afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso other western goverenments also criticized the polls . sarkozy contradicted his own foreign ministry sarkozy 's telephone call to president putin - the leading candidate for russia 's united party that won an landslide victory , securing 315 of 450 seats in parliament - contradicted not only the eu 's stance , but also his own foreign ministry 's criticism of the conduct of the poll .
the ministry had called for investigations into the allegations of fraud . human rights groups were outraged at sarkozy 's move .

" it 's a real pleasure to receive my good friend donald tusk ...
poland is a very important partner , and the voice of poland matters , " a buoyant eu commission president jose manuel barroso told journalists in brussels .
when tusk arrived in the commission - the eu 's executive - barroso met him with a beaming smile and an ebullient handshake which would not have been out of place in a christmas grotto .
and tusk replied in kind , referring to a new relationship of trust between his government and the brussels apparatus at least half a dozen times in his opening remarks and joking that he was relieved to have been allowed in after having given a marathon three-hour introductory speech to poland 's parliament 10 days ago .
even barroso 's spokesman , johannes laitenberger , received an ovation when he introduced tusk in polish - a linguistic feat met with cheers and whistles by the large contingent of polish visitors .
a breath of fresh air after kaczynskis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski brothers have been pariahs at the eu it was all a far cry from the tempestuous diplomacy of earlier times .
under tusk 's predecessor , the pugnacious jaroslaw kaczynski , relations between brussels and warsaw strained to breaking point .
in 2007 alone , kaczynski clashed bitterly with the eu over issues ranging from the vote allocated to poland under the new eu reform treaty to the construction of a bypass road through a nature reserve .
and his abrasive defence of polish interests won him few friends in brussels , where he was widely regarded as failing to understand the delicate system of compromises by which the eu functions .
" they seem not to have got the idea of give and take , " one senior brussels diplomat commented , in a reference to kaczynski and his twin brother lech , poland 's current president .
indeed , under the kaczynskis poland seemed set to win the title of europe 's " chief troublemaker , " as the twins threatened to veto a deal on the reform treaty at two successive summits .
tusk victory welcomed with relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk 's election victory caused brussels to sigh with relief tusk 's convincing win in parliamentary elections on october 21 , and his pledge to restore normality to the relationship with brussels , was hailed with relief in the eu 's capital .
" we discussed the future in a spirit of trust - of ' zaufanie , ' to use the polish word , " barroso joked on tuesday , winning a cheer of his own from his audience .
tusk has made trust his government 's watchword , and used the word some 45 times in his first speech .
and while many issues could still dampen the festive spirit - the bypass dispute , cod fishing quotas , energy security , and us plans to site parts of its missile shield in poland , to name but four - both men were convinced that they would no longer spoil the party .
" when we speak openly about things that can become a problem , both sides quickly find solutions , " tusk said .
even the end of the visit raised a cheer as laitenberger wished his audience " goodbye and good luck " in near-faultless polish .
festive goodwill in the capital of europe with the new spirit of cordiality shining through the gloom of a brussels december , both barroso and tusk looked delighted with their christmas message of peace in europe and goodwill to all men .
whether that festive spirit will translate into a happy new year for their relationship remains to be seen . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 , that the report tallied with the iaea investigation into the country 's nuclear program . a number of european countries , including germany , have already welcomed the us report as confirming that europe 's strategy of negotiations plus sanctions is keeping tehran in line with international demands . the nie report confirmed " the double approach chosen by the international community of incentives and measures from the united nations security council was right , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a statement released monday , nov .
3 . britain 's foreign ministry also said the carrot-and-stick approach was working to keep iran in line with international demands . " the report 's conclusions justify the action already taken by the international community to get to the bottom of iran 's nuclear program and to increase pressure on the regime to stop its enrichment and reprocessing activities , " a british foreign ministry spokeswoman told the afp news agency . international pressure successful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the double approach of sanctions and incentives needed to continue the national intelligence estimate , a consensus of all 16 us spy agencies , said in a report monday that it was confident that iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in late 2003 .
nie cited " moderate confidence " that the program had not been restarted as of mid-2007 . tehran could have the technical ability to build a nuclear weapon between 2010 and 2015 , but " we do not know if it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons , " the report stated . iran appears " less determined to develop nuclear weapons than we have been judging since 2005 , " the nie said .
the report concluded that it was likely that tehran had halted its nuclear program in response to international pressure , which " suggests that iran may be more vulnerable to influence on the issue than we judged previously . " europe 's mixed approach to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military work at iran 's nuclear facilities may have stopped four years ago the united nations security council has brought sanctions against iran twice for refusing to discontinue its uranium enrichment program .
enriched uranium can be used to build nuclear weapons , but iran has consistently said its program is purely used for civilian purposes . the five permanent members of the security council - britain , china , france , russia and the usa - plus germany met in paris over the weekend to discuss a third sanctions resolution but did not reach an agreement . in 2004 and 2005 , germany , along with britain and france , led a diplomatic initiative with tehran in which trade and other economic incentives were discussed in exchange for a halt on the uranium enrichment program . while the so-called eu-3 has since supported un-led sanctions against iran , it has also remained open to a more diplomatic strategy . report may be face-saver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran welcomed the report , saying it confirmed iran 's nuclear plans are peaceful us national security advisor stephen hadley said the report should n't be taken as a reason to lose vigilance . " there 's going to be a tendency of a lot of people to say : ' the problem 's less bad that we thought , let 's relax , " ' said hadley .
" our view is that would be a mistake . " hadley denied that us rhetoric on iran had escalated to step up international pressure .
in october , us president george w. bush raised the specters of " world war iii " or a " nuclear holocaust " occurring should teheran build a nuclear bomb . the estimate could have been a " face saving decision " because bush is not willing to strike militarily and has exhausted the efforts at the un security council , alex vatanka of the middle east institute told the dpa news agency .

jürgen klinsmann is being looked at to fill the vacancy , but he would face opposition from some fans despite being a great choice , says dw 's nick amies . it would n't be an exaggeration to compare the possibility of former germany coach - and england nemesis - jürgen klinsmann taking over as coach of the three lions to hillary clinton or barak obama becoming president of the united states of america .
in all three hypothetical cases , the most pertinent question remains the same : is the country ready or is that really a step too far ? the possibility of the united states electing a woman or an african-american into the white house is divisive to say the least .
the fact that mrs. clinton and mr. obama are even in the running at this very early stage of the presidential race says something about how attitudes , at least in some parts of the country , have changed in the us .
most of their detractors focus on their policy stances and personality traits rather than their gender or racial background , which is encouraging for a nation that has for centuries tended to view the commander in chief 's job as being reserved for white males only .
if only the same could be said for the opinions and attitudes of some of the england faithful when it comes to the possibility of klinsmann leading england .
still , klinsmann , who led germany to third place in the 2006 world cup and turned down a job offer from the us soccer federation , has hinted he might be interested in occupying the vacant england bench .
klinsi the mold breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi 's and germany 's success has always rankled england fans klinsmann is one of a rare breed ; a german who has endeared himself to the english soccer masses .
his two spells as a tottenham hotspurs player in the 1990 's are credited with rehabilitating the long-held image of conniving , arrogant and - heaven forbid - massively successful germans which had been cultivated through decades of smug tournament victories and much-reveled-in conquests over england .
his self-referential diving celebration after scoring showed a humorous side to the teutonic efficiency that had grated so much with england fans for so long while his contribution in making the premiership the star-studded internationally renowned league it is now can not be underestimated .
his coaching ability is also grudgingly respected on the island .
in his short tenure , klinsmann transformed germany from a nation infamous for grinding out results to a team purring with flair which - as long as that flair was not used to knock england out of any tournament - was appreciated by those english who lamented the lack of invention in their own team .

klinsi is what is commonly known in those circles where such things matter as " an okay german " for his contribution to the premiership and his philosophy of how the game should be played .
it must , however , be said that klinsmann only remains the good german while he is not responsible for any england heartbreak .
all that could change if he is made england coach .
the england job carries the most pressure of any managerial position in international soccer .
the expectation among the fans is hysterically high and probably unachievable .

animosity towards the germans arising from world war ii is sadly still alive in some less-enlightened quarters and the appointment of one who has been a hate-figure in his time as a player would certainly test how far the england faithful have come in their sensitivity training .
it is only six years ago that england got its first foreign coach .
the uproar over appointing an unassuming swede would be nothing compared to the narrow-minded maelstrom that would accompany the naming of a formerly cocky german as national coach .

six months after parliamentary elections , belgium remains without a government .
outgoing pm guy verhofstadt has launched mediation talks with the country 's main parties after belgian king albert approached him for help . verhofstadt hopes to mend the rupture between francophone and flemish-speaking leaders after coalition talks to form a new government collapsed last week .
this comes after king albert ii summoned verhofstadt on monday and asked him , according to a statement issued by the palace , " to inform the king on the way to get out of the impasse very swiftly , and to make all the contacts necessary to do so . "
belgian television reports have interpreted the belgian king 's move as bestowing “ urgent ” powers , including dealing with “ international matters , ” on prime minister guy verhofstadt .
but this would be in violation of the belgian constitution which does not provide for extended powers to governments without a parliamentary majority .
flemish christian democrat leader yves leterme , who was expected to succeed verhofstadt , told the king on saturday that he was unable to form a coalition after failing to reach a deal over how much power should be devolved to the regions .
haunted by the specter of division along linguistic lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's image is beginning to look a little tattered the deadlock has sparked fears that belgium would split into the flemish and french-speaking parts .
" our country is facing one of the most severe political crises of the last decades , " verhofstadt told a news conference in brussels .
" this situation can not and must not continue for much longer , " he added .
verhofstadt said the country needed fundamental state reform , adding that the country 's problems could be solved " when everyone recognized the seriousness of the situation and took responsibility . "
he said he wanted to reach an agreement on devolution and tackle urgent social and economic issues that go far beyond the authority of a caretaker government .
situation remains unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would-be pm leterme is of mixed parentage himself , but he has not built bridges between the two communities but verhofstadt , who was ousted in the june elections after eight years in office , did not give details of his plans or how the 2008 budget could be drafted under these circumstances .
belgium 's flemish majority wants more autonomy for the relatively rich region of flanders , a move seen as a political and financial threat in the french-speaking region of wallonia .
many flemish voters believe that their taxes - amongst the highest in the world - are used to subsidize the social security system in the south .
verhofstadt said the country 's image abroad was suffering because of the ongoing crisis .
business leaders say potential foreign investors will be driven away .
the liberal vld leader managed to largely keep a lid on devolution-related issues during his term of office .
but he was punished for that at the polls by flemish voters .

six months after parliamentary elections , belgium remains without a government .
outgoing pm guy verhofstadt has launched mediation talks with the country 's main parties after belgian king albert approached him for help . verhofstadt hopes to mend the rupture between francophone and flemish-speaking leaders after coalition talks to form a new government collapsed last week .
this comes after king albert ii summoned verhofstadt on monday and asked him , according to a statement issued by the palace , " to inform the king on the way to get out of the impasse very swiftly , and to make all the contacts necessary to do so . "
belgian television reports have interpreted the belgian king 's move as bestowing “ urgent ” powers , including dealing with “ international matters , ” on prime minister guy verhofstadt .
but this would be in violation of the belgian constitution which does not provide for extended powers to governments without a parliamentary majority .
flemish christian democrat leader yves leterme , who was expected to succeed verhofstadt , told the king on saturday that he was unable to form a coalition after failing to reach a deal over how much power should be devolved to the regions .
haunted by the specter of division along linguistic lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's image is beginning to look a little tattered the deadlock has sparked fears that belgium would split into the flemish and french-speaking parts .
" our country is facing one of the most severe political crises of the last decades , " verhofstadt told a news conference in brussels .
" this situation can not and must not continue for much longer , " he added .
verhofstadt said the country needed fundamental state reform , adding that the country 's problems could be solved " when everyone recognized the seriousness of the situation and took responsibility . "
he said he wanted to reach an agreement on devolution and tackle urgent social and economic issues that go far beyond the authority of a caretaker government .
situation remains unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would-be pm leterme is of mixed parentage himself , but he has not built bridges between the two communities but verhofstadt , who was ousted in the june elections after eight years in office , did not give details of his plans or how the 2008 budget could be drafted under these circumstances .
belgium 's flemish majority wants more autonomy for the relatively rich region of flanders , a move seen as a political and financial threat in the french-speaking region of wallonia .
many flemish voters believe that their taxes - amongst the highest in the world - are used to subsidize the social security system in the south .
verhofstadt said the country 's image abroad was suffering because of the ongoing crisis .
business leaders say potential foreign investors will be driven away .
the liberal vld leader managed to largely keep a lid on devolution-related issues during his term of office .
but he was punished for that at the polls by flemish voters .
his rival leterme has , however , angered walloons by doubting their ability to learn flemish , as well as confusing the french and belgian national anthems . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de belgian political crisis and talk of linguistic divisions continue as the belgian government remains locked in a stalemate over the formation of a coalition , the divisions along linguistic lines have fuelled fears that the flemish and french-speaking regions may go their separate ways .

in belgium 's parliamentary elections sunday , one issue bound to feature is the power struggle between the french-speaking walloons and the dutch-speaking flemish .

most of the eu has been at odds with putin . the french leader nicolas sarkozy 's gesture clearly showed he was not toeing the european union line and put him at odds with neighbor and close ally germany .
the german government had called sunday 's parliamentary elections in russia " neither free , fair nor democratic " by western standards . other eu governments have also voiced concern over reports of election irregularities and indeed , the european union 's portuguese presidency said tuesday that russia 's legislative election " did not meet international standards and commitments . " the european union " regrets ... that there were many reports and allegations of media restrictions as well as harassment of opposition parties and ngos in the run up to the elections and on election day , " the presidency said in a statement , as reported by afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso other western goverenments also criticized the polls . sarkozy contradicted his own foreign ministry sarkozy 's telephone call to president putin - the leading candidate for russia 's united party that won an landslide victory , securing 315 of 450 seats in parliament - contradicted not only the eu 's stance , but also his own foreign ministry 's criticism of the conduct of the poll .
the ministry had called for investigations into the allegations of fraud . human rights groups were outraged at sarkozy 's move . " sarkozy 's reaction , which was totally isolated , is both incomprehensible and scandalous , " patrick baudouin , president of the paris-based international federation of human rights -lrb- fidh -rrb- , told afp . " this is a bad blow to democrats and human rights campaigners in russia . " " to give putin your support after unamimously condemned elections , is to compromise yourself and go against official policy " on human rights , he added . he called sarkozy 's call an " excess of zeal that was absolutely unnecessary " and said it was not to france 's credit . eu differs on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin 's party won over 60 percent of the parliamentary vote even all the eu members themselves do not agree about how to handle russia . diplomats told reuters reporters that the eu 's portuguese presidency was seeking agreement on monday among the 27 member states on a joint statement on the russian elections but that it was a challenge to get consensus on the text . on tuesday , the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , urged moscow to address the accusations of electoral irregularities in the russian poll . " everybody is aware that observers have denounced irregularities , " said johannes laitenberger , spokesman for the commission . " it is in the interest of russia to completely clarify all these allegations , " he told reporters in brussels , ac cited by afp . one diplomat told reuters that a draft of an eu statement that circulated on monday criticized moscow 's treatment of the election monitoring office of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and urged the russian government to permit osce monitors into the country to do a long-term survey in advance of a presidential election in march . economic interests at stake ? despite allegations that the opposition had been muzzled and ballots were rigged in the russian vote , the differing european responses to the election highlight the eu 's general problems in speaking with a single voice towards russia , which is its major energy supplier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chess champ kasparov crossed out all parties on his ballot sarkozy , for his part , has been critical of moscow 's handling of human rights , but opposition politicians have nonetheless accused him of putting economic interests above rights . daniele artur , russia expert at amnesty international in france , told afp that she was " very disappointed by -lsb- sarkozy 's -rsb- reaction " to sunday 's elections . " this is sheer realpolitik .
and yet we could have afforded to be much firmer , " she said . the eu similarly backpedaled last week when the portuguese presidency put out a critical statement three days after the arrest of opposition activists in russia , including former world chess champion garry kasparov .
it soon withdrew the statement and issued a milder version without explanation , reuters reported . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

six months after parliamentary elections , belgium remains without a government .
outgoing pm guy verhofstadt has launched mediation talks with the country 's main parties after belgian king albert approached him for help . verhofstadt hopes to mend the rupture between francophone and flemish-speaking leaders after coalition talks to form a new government collapsed last week .
this comes after king albert ii summoned verhofstadt on monday and asked him , according to a statement issued by the palace , " to inform the king on the way to get out of the impasse very swiftly , and to make all the contacts necessary to do so . "
belgian television reports have interpreted the belgian king 's move as bestowing “ urgent ” powers , including dealing with “ international matters , ” on prime minister guy verhofstadt .
but this would be in violation of the belgian constitution which does not provide for extended powers to governments without a parliamentary majority .
flemish christian democrat leader yves leterme , who was expected to succeed verhofstadt , told the king on saturday that he was unable to form a coalition after failing to reach a deal over how much power should be devolved to the regions .
haunted by the specter of division along linguistic lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's image is beginning to look a little tattered the deadlock has sparked fears that belgium would split into the flemish and french-speaking parts .
" our country is facing one of the most severe political crises of the last decades , " verhofstadt told a news conference in brussels .
" this situation can not and must not continue for much longer , " he added .
verhofstadt said the country needed fundamental state reform , adding that the country 's problems could be solved " when everyone recognized the seriousness of the situation and took responsibility . "
he said he wanted to reach an agreement on devolution and tackle urgent social and economic issues that go far beyond the authority of a caretaker government .
situation remains unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would-be pm leterme is of mixed parentage himself , but he has not built bridges between the two communities but verhofstadt , who was ousted in the june elections after eight years in office , did not give details of his plans or how the 2008 budget could be drafted under these circumstances .
belgium 's flemish majority wants more autonomy for the relatively rich region of flanders , a move seen as a political and financial threat in the french-speaking region of wallonia .
many flemish voters believe that their taxes - amongst the highest in the world - are used to subsidize the social security system in the south .
verhofstadt said the country 's image abroad was suffering because of the ongoing crisis .
business leaders say potential foreign investors will be driven away .
the liberal vld leader managed to largely keep a lid on devolution-related issues during his term of office .
but he was punished for that at the polls by flemish voters .
his rival leterme has , however , angered walloons by doubting their ability to learn flemish , as well as confusing the french and belgian national anthems . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the report stated that iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 . for nearly 18 months , solana has been trying to persuade the islamic republic to suspend uranium enrichment in exchange for a bundle of political , trade and economic incentives . solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said the national intelligence estimate -lrb- nie -rrb- report " proves that transparency about -lrb- iran 's -rrb- nuclear activities and its intentions are fundamental . " but us president george w. bush said that iran remains a danger and refused to rule out a military attack despite the new findings . " iran was dangerous , iran is dangerous and iran will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon , " bush told a white house press conference . the international atomic agency director general mohamed el baradei said on tuesday , nov .
4 , that the report tallied with the iaea investigation into the country 's nuclear program . a number of european countries , including germany , have already welcomed the us report as confirming that europe 's strategy of negotiations plus sanctions is keeping tehran in line with international demands . the nie report confirmed " the double approach chosen by the international community of incentives and measures from the united nations security council was right , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a statement released monday , nov .
3 . britain 's foreign ministry also said the carrot-and-stick approach was working to keep iran in line with international demands . " the report 's conclusions justify the action already taken by the international community to get to the bottom of iran 's nuclear program and to increase pressure on the regime to stop its enrichment and reprocessing activities , " a british foreign ministry spokeswoman told the afp news agency . international pressure successful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the double approach of sanctions and incentives needed to continue the national intelligence estimate , a consensus of all 16 us spy agencies , said in a report monday that it was confident that iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in late 2003 .
nie cited " moderate confidence " that the program had not been restarted as of mid-2007 . tehran could have the technical ability to build a nuclear weapon between 2010 and 2015 , but " we do not know if it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons , " the report stated . iran appears " less determined to develop nuclear weapons than we have been judging since 2005 , " the nie said .
the report concluded that it was likely that tehran had halted its nuclear program in response to international pressure , which " suggests that iran may be more vulnerable to influence on the issue than we judged previously . " europe 's mixed approach to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military work at iran 's nuclear facilities may have stopped four years ago the united nations security council has brought sanctions against iran twice for refusing to discontinue its uranium enrichment program .
enriched uranium can be used to build nuclear weapons , but iran has consistently said its program is purely used for civilian purposes . the five permanent members of the security council - britain , china , france , russia and the usa - plus germany met in paris over the weekend to discuss a third sanctions resolution but did not reach an agreement . in 2004 and 2005 , germany , along with britain and france , led a diplomatic initiative with tehran in which trade and other economic incentives were discussed in exchange for a halt on the uranium enrichment program . while the so-called eu-3 has since supported un-led sanctions against iran , it has also remained open to a more diplomatic strategy . report may be face-saver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran welcomed the report , saying it confirmed iran 's nuclear plans are peaceful us national security advisor stephen hadley said the report should n't be taken as a reason to lose vigilance . " there 's going to be a tendency of a lot of people to say : ' the problem 's less bad that we thought , let 's relax , " ' said hadley .
" our view is that would be a mistake . " hadley denied that us rhetoric on iran had escalated to step up international pressure .
in october , us president george w. bush raised the specters of " world war iii " or a " nuclear holocaust " occurring should teheran build a nuclear bomb . the estimate could have been a " face saving decision " because bush is not willing to strike militarily and has exhausted the efforts at the un security council , alex vatanka of the middle east institute told the dpa news agency .

6 . the us space shuttle atlantis , to be launched from kennedy space center at cape canaveral , florida , is to deliver a european-built space laboratory named columbus to the international space station -lrb- iss -rrb- beginning thursday .
until now , only the united states and russia have had their own laboratories at the iss . " we have never had a permanent base in space before and i see this as a first step for europe in real spaceflight activities , " leopold eyharts , a french astronaut who works for the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , told afp news agency . eyharts is a member of the atlantis crew and will remain at the iss for two and a half months to prepare columbus for future scientific work . europe becoming key space player bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa 's columbus to be one of iss 's main manned modules his german colleague , hans schlegel , also an esa astronaut and a member of the atlantis crew , said the mission will be " a tremendous step , " as quoted by afp . schlegel told dpa new service that the mission marks europe 's entrance into permanent operations in space .
he also said there would be a lot at stake for german science . " we are becoming a more important partner for the international spaceflight community , " he said . esa 's lab , primarily built by eads-astrium in bremen , germany , was supposed to go into operation in 2004 .
but when the space shuttle columbia disintegrated upon re-entry into earth 's atmosphere in 2003 , killing all seven astronauts on board , shuttle flights were suspended . skeptics wanted to dismiss the project , which would have meant a loss of the 880 million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- already invested in it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working in the columbus laboratory last year until now , the americans have primarily called the shots at the iss , which is orbiting earth 400 -lrb- 246 miles -rrb- kilometers over head . that is soon to change with the arrival of the 13-ton columbus module , which is considered a jewel of science . a variety of experiments possible according to dpa , it has seven different racks that can be used for various types of research , including medical and material experiments ranging from the study of single-cell organisms and invertebrates to the basic physics of fluids . " only the core question is the same in all the experiments .
what happens in zero gravity ? "
columbus chief engineer rüdiger kledzik told dpa . such scientific experiments with microgravity are considered key to prepare humankind for living and working in space and for subsequent journeys toward mars and elsewhere . some experiments look at the loss of bone and muscle deterioration in zero gravity .
for instance , dpa said one expert who pointed out that in the weightlessness of space , humans lose 10 percent of their muscle mass per month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- with german astronaut thomas reiter in front of a scale model of the columbus researchers on the columbus will attempt to use the time-lapse effect to address two issues : to better understand how to fight diseases such as osteoporosis and to gain knowledge about future space flights that could last several months . a flight to mars and back would take around two years , for example .
the problem of muscle and bone loss must be solved such a mission can take place , the expert said . columbus will allow astronauts to conducts hundreds of experiments each year . german space center to control columbus the japanese also plan to send their own laboratory , called the kibo , which is to bet he fourth component at the iss , and the largest and most sophiscated at all .
it will be delivered in three different parts , with the first one scheduled for february 2008 . for the 11-day atlantis mission and delivery of columbus , three spacewalks are planned , two of which german astronaut schlegel will perfom .
another astronaut , rex walheim , will aid schlegel in attaching columbus to one of the iss 's modules . during another spacewalk by walheim and american stanley coils , two research platforms will also be set up . construction of columbus has cost cost to two billion euros , with germany the biggest contributor to the project - covering 41 percent of the total costs .
italy contributed 23 percent and france 18 percent respectively .

most of the eu has been at odds with putin . the french leader nicolas sarkozy 's gesture clearly showed he was not toeing the european union line and put him at odds with neighbor and close ally germany .
the german government had called sunday 's parliamentary elections in russia " neither free , fair nor democratic " by western standards . other eu governments have also voiced concern over reports of election irregularities and indeed , the european union 's portuguese presidency said tuesday that russia 's legislative election " did not meet international standards and commitments . " the european union " regrets ... that there were many reports and allegations of media restrictions as well as harassment of opposition parties and ngos in the run up to the elections and on election day , " the presidency said in a statement , as reported by afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso other western goverenments also criticized the polls . sarkozy contradicted his own foreign ministry sarkozy 's telephone call to president putin - the leading candidate for russia 's united party that won an landslide victory , securing 315 of 450 seats in parliament - contradicted not only the eu 's stance , but also his own foreign ministry 's criticism of the conduct of the poll .
the ministry had called for investigations into the allegations of fraud . human rights groups were outraged at sarkozy 's move . " sarkozy 's reaction , which was totally isolated , is both incomprehensible and scandalous , " patrick baudouin , president of the paris-based international federation of human rights -lrb- fidh -rrb- , told afp . " this is a bad blow to democrats and human rights campaigners in russia . " " to give putin your support after unamimously condemned elections , is to compromise yourself and go against official policy " on human rights , he added . he called sarkozy 's call an " excess of zeal that was absolutely unnecessary " and said it was not to france 's credit . eu differs on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin 's party won over 60 percent of the parliamentary vote even all the eu members themselves do not agree about how to handle russia . diplomats told reuters reporters that the eu 's portuguese presidency was seeking agreement on monday among the 27 member states on a joint statement on the russian elections but that it was a challenge to get consensus on the text . on tuesday , the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , urged moscow to address the accusations of electoral irregularities in the russian poll . " everybody is aware that observers have denounced irregularities , " said johannes laitenberger , spokesman for the commission . " it is in the interest of russia to completely clarify all these allegations , " he told reporters in brussels , ac cited by afp . one diplomat told reuters that a draft of an eu statement that circulated on monday criticized moscow 's treatment of the election monitoring office of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and urged the russian government to permit osce monitors into the country to do a long-term survey in advance of a presidential election in march . economic interests at stake ? despite allegations that the opposition had been muzzled and ballots were rigged in the russian vote , the differing european responses to the election highlight the eu 's general problems in speaking with a single voice towards russia , which is its major energy supplier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chess champ kasparov crossed out all parties on his ballot sarkozy , for his part , has been critical of moscow 's handling of human rights , but opposition politicians have nonetheless accused him of putting economic interests above rights . daniele artur , russia expert at amnesty international in france , told afp that she was " very disappointed by -lsb- sarkozy 's -rsb- reaction " to sunday 's elections . " this is sheer realpolitik .
and yet we could have afforded to be much firmer , " she said . the eu similarly backpedaled last week when the portuguese presidency put out a critical statement three days after the arrest of opposition activists in russia , including former world chess champion garry kasparov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 04.12.2007 pisa education studies come under examination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people still ca n't get their heads around the pisa testing system germany crept up the rankings in the latest comparative international education study .
but the results are once again fanning the flames of controversy in the ongoing debate over school reform . germany reached 13th place out of 57 countries tested in the results of the latest program for international student assessment - pisa - study , officially published on tuesday , nov .
4 . but any joy over improvement in standing was damped when the test 's creator at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , andreas schleicher , last week told the press that the improvement was more likely due to changes in the way the test was structured , than to any actual improvement on the part of german students . the discussion over germany 's school performance has been raging since 2000 , when the country landed in the bottom third of the rankings of 32 countries , and continued through 2003 , when germany still rated 18th in a list of 40 countries . those rankings " certainly served to alert the public of just how different our perception of the system was compared with its stance in the real world , " said rainer lehmann , a professor of education research at berlin 's humboldt university . indeed , the country 's mediocre ranking back in 2000 caught most germans , who thought highly of their school system , off guard .
the term pisa has since become a household word , reflecting the study 's resonance in the media . debate over studies ' relevance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could be moving towards a comprehensive system the debate has raised questions about the general relevance of comparative educational testing , pitting those who see tests as a useful comparative tool against those who focus on the shortcomings of big , international studies . most experts agree that big international studies have an important place in education policy . " the idea is that you have some natural variance between educational systems , and you try to capitalize upon this by looking at different influences , " said lehmann .
" the goal is to learn from other systems . " michael becker-mrotzeck , a professor in the department of language education at cologne university , agreed . " in principle , -lrb- these studies -rrb- tell us useful information about our school system , " he said .
" for instance , from the first and second pisa studies , germans learned that in no other country does social status of the parents have such a big effect on the academic success of their children . " in addition , the earlier studies showed weakness in certain basic competencies , like reading , math and science .
as a result , he said , schools have shifted focus - with visible results . in november an international test of elementary school competency showed that reading had " clearly improved . " " our education system reacted , quickly , " to the deficits uncovered by pisa , becker-mrotzeck said .
this led to the development of a spate of learning materials , and a host of creative concepts , such as reading nights and author-readings in schools . germany coming out of anti-testing era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has now accepted testing procedures unlike in the uk and the us , where educational testing has long been a buzzword and where standardized tests are routinely used to monitoring how much information is being passed from teachers to students , germany is fairly new to the game . after a spate of general tests in the early 70s showed similar weaknesses to those rediscovered by pisa in 2001 , the country underwent an anti-testing backlash that lasted a good 20 years . only recently have policymakers reinstated mass comparative testing in schools .
today , german schoolchildren face four " general " exams over the course of their 13 year school career - in 3rd , 8th , 10th and at the end of the 12th grade , becker-mrotzeck explained . " it is different than in the us or england , where they might have such tests twice a year , " said becker-mrozeck .
" i do n't think at that level germany is in danger of doing what they call in america , ' teaching to the test . " ' still , learning does n't take place via testing , said renate hendricks , a social democrat parliamentarian for the state of north-rhine westphalia , who specializes in education policy . " i think you can test what a person can do , but learning comes through motivation , curiosity , interest , and an emotional relationship to the teacher , " among other things , hendricks said . hendricks did acknowledge that comparative studies are useful for giving feedback aimed at improving schools .
" but if politicians are incapable of using the information they get to make positive change , then no , these studies are not useful , " she said . disparities in german system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pisa studies are flawed , say some she added that when the figures are broken down by social background , immense disparities in the german system are still evident in the newest pisa results . " now it is clear we have to do something , " she said .
" these politicians have to take off their rose-colored glasses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 04.12.2007 pisa education studies come under examination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people still ca n't get their heads around the pisa testing system germany crept up the rankings in the latest comparative international education study .
but the results are once again fanning the flames of controversy in the ongoing debate over school reform . germany reached 13th place out of 57 countries tested in the results of the latest program for international student assessment - pisa - study , officially published on tuesday , nov .
4 . but any joy over improvement in standing was damped when the test 's creator at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , andreas schleicher , last week told the press that the improvement was more likely due to changes in the way the test was structured , than to any actual improvement on the part of german students . the discussion over germany 's school performance has been raging since 2000 , when the country landed in the bottom third of the rankings of 32 countries , and continued through 2003 , when germany still rated 18th in a list of 40 countries . those rankings " certainly served to alert the public of just how different our perception of the system was compared with its stance in the real world , " said rainer lehmann , a professor of education research at berlin 's humboldt university . indeed , the country 's mediocre ranking back in 2000 caught most germans , who thought highly of their school system , off guard .
the term pisa has since become a household word , reflecting the study 's resonance in the media . debate over studies ' relevance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could be moving towards a comprehensive system the debate has raised questions about the general relevance of comparative educational testing , pitting those who see tests as a useful comparative tool against those who focus on the shortcomings of big , international studies . most experts agree that big international studies have an important place in education policy . " the idea is that you have some natural variance between educational systems , and you try to capitalize upon this by looking at different influences , " said lehmann .
" the goal is to learn from other systems . " michael becker-mrotzeck , a professor in the department of language education at cologne university , agreed . " in principle , -lrb- these studies -rrb- tell us useful information about our school system , " he said .
" for instance , from the first and second pisa studies , germans learned that in no other country does social status of the parents have such a big effect on the academic success of their children . " in addition , the earlier studies showed weakness in certain basic competencies , like reading , math and science .
as a result , he said , schools have shifted focus - with visible results . in november an international test of elementary school competency showed that reading had " clearly improved . " " our education system reacted , quickly , " to the deficits uncovered by pisa , becker-mrotzeck said .
this led to the development of a spate of learning materials , and a host of creative concepts , such as reading nights and author-readings in schools . germany coming out of anti-testing era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has now accepted testing procedures unlike in the uk and the us , where educational testing has long been a buzzword and where standardized tests are routinely used to monitoring how much information is being passed from teachers to students , germany is fairly new to the game . after a spate of general tests in the early 70s showed similar weaknesses to those rediscovered by pisa in 2001 , the country underwent an anti-testing backlash that lasted a good 20 years . only recently have policymakers reinstated mass comparative testing in schools .
today , german schoolchildren face four " general " exams over the course of their 13 year school career - in 3rd , 8th , 10th and at the end of the 12th grade , becker-mrotzeck explained . " it is different than in the us or england , where they might have such tests twice a year , " said becker-mrozeck .
" i do n't think at that level germany is in danger of doing what they call in america , ' teaching to the test . " ' still , learning does n't take place via testing , said renate hendricks , a social democrat parliamentarian for the state of north-rhine westphalia , who specializes in education policy . " i think you can test what a person can do , but learning comes through motivation , curiosity , interest , and an emotional relationship to the teacher , " among other things , hendricks said . hendricks did acknowledge that comparative studies are useful for giving feedback aimed at improving schools .
" but if politicians are incapable of using the information they get to make positive change , then no , these studies are not useful , " she said . disparities in german system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pisa studies are flawed , say some she added that when the figures are broken down by social background , immense disparities in the german system are still evident in the newest pisa results . " now it is clear we have to do something , " she said .
" these politicians have to take off their rose-colored glasses .

but the results are once again fanning the flames of controversy in the ongoing debate over school reform . germany reached 13th place out of 57 countries tested in the results of the latest program for international student assessment - pisa - study , officially published on tuesday , nov .
4 . but any joy over improvement in standing was damped when the test 's creator at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , andreas schleicher , last week told the press that the improvement was more likely due to changes in the way the test was structured , than to any actual improvement on the part of german students . the discussion over germany 's school performance has been raging since 2000 , when the country landed in the bottom third of the rankings of 32 countries , and continued through 2003 , when germany still rated 18th in a list of 40 countries . those rankings " certainly served to alert the public of just how different our perception of the system was compared with its stance in the real world , " said rainer lehmann , a professor of education research at berlin 's humboldt university . indeed , the country 's mediocre ranking back in 2000 caught most germans , who thought highly of their school system , off guard .
the term pisa has since become a household word , reflecting the study 's resonance in the media . debate over studies ' relevance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could be moving towards a comprehensive system the debate has raised questions about the general relevance of comparative educational testing , pitting those who see tests as a useful comparative tool against those who focus on the shortcomings of big , international studies . most experts agree that big international studies have an important place in education policy . " the idea is that you have some natural variance between educational systems , and you try to capitalize upon this by looking at different influences , " said lehmann .
" the goal is to learn from other systems . " michael becker-mrotzeck , a professor in the department of language education at cologne university , agreed . " in principle , -lrb- these studies -rrb- tell us useful information about our school system , " he said .
" for instance , from the first and second pisa studies , germans learned that in no other country does social status of the parents have such a big effect on the academic success of their children . " in addition , the earlier studies showed weakness in certain basic competencies , like reading , math and science .
as a result , he said , schools have shifted focus - with visible results . in november an international test of elementary school competency showed that reading had " clearly improved . " " our education system reacted , quickly , " to the deficits uncovered by pisa , becker-mrotzeck said .
this led to the development of a spate of learning materials , and a host of creative concepts , such as reading nights and author-readings in schools . germany coming out of anti-testing era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has now accepted testing procedures unlike in the uk and the us , where educational testing has long been a buzzword and where standardized tests are routinely used to monitoring how much information is being passed from teachers to students , germany is fairly new to the game . after a spate of general tests in the early 70s showed similar weaknesses to those rediscovered by pisa in 2001 , the country underwent an anti-testing backlash that lasted a good 20 years . only recently have policymakers reinstated mass comparative testing in schools .
today , german schoolchildren face four " general " exams over the course of their 13 year school career - in 3rd , 8th , 10th and at the end of the 12th grade , becker-mrotzeck explained . " it is different than in the us or england , where they might have such tests twice a year , " said becker-mrozeck .
" i do n't think at that level germany is in danger of doing what they call in america , ' teaching to the test . " ' still , learning does n't take place via testing , said renate hendricks , a social democrat parliamentarian for the state of north-rhine westphalia , who specializes in education policy . " i think you can test what a person can do , but learning comes through motivation , curiosity , interest , and an emotional relationship to the teacher , " among other things , hendricks said . hendricks did acknowledge that comparative studies are useful for giving feedback aimed at improving schools .
" but if politicians are incapable of using the information they get to make positive change , then no , these studies are not useful , " she said . disparities in german system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pisa studies are flawed , say some she added that when the figures are broken down by social background , immense disparities in the german system are still evident in the newest pisa results . " now it is clear we have to do something , " she said .
" these politicians have to take off their rose-colored glasses .
or black glasses , or whatever they are wearing . " meanwhile , still other critics say the whole structure of pisa - indeed , the idea of widespread comparative international testing itself - is flawed .
the pisa study was also designed with " unrealistic goals , " according to joachim wuttke , a munich-based physicist , statistician and math teacher who has written two articles critiquing the methodology behind pisa and similar tests . tests weighted against germany , says expert " the ranking of states on a one-dimensional scale is not serious , " he said .
" you can construct tests that give different results , and this one is made in a way that shows germany is mediocre . " various factors can affect outcome .
the type of school system a country has is just one potential factor , he said , adding that the spectrum of students tested also differed from country to country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : differences in studies across europe are a problem " germany took great pains to get a representative sample of students , testing even in schools for special-needs students , " he said .
" meanwhile , finland excluded students with dyslexia from the test .
you ca n't do an international comparison of reading difficulties when you exclude some students . " ultimately , wuttke said tests like pisa " do n't test the system , they test the population . "
he pointed out that in highest-ranking finland , there are almost no immigrants . " if you compared results of all native students only , then finland is no longer at the top of the list , " he said . germany shocked out of stupor one thing the pisa proponents seem to agree on is that the results from 2001 shocked the country into a back-to-basics frenzy . " i see the main advantage of this test as having reoriented schools toward cognitive growth , " said humboldt university 's lehmann .
" every year you have a new set of educational goals seems to be defined - family education , sexual education , peace education , gender education ... but the core business seems to be forgotten . " but even there , wuttke sees pisa as more of a lost opportunity than a gain . " reading , math and science are important subjects , but it should n't come at the expense of other things like sports and music , " he said .

most of the eu has been at odds with putin . the french leader nicolas sarkozy 's gesture clearly showed he was not toeing the european union line and put him at odds with neighbor and close ally germany .
the german government had called sunday 's parliamentary elections in russia " neither free , fair nor democratic " by western standards . other eu governments have also voiced concern over reports of election irregularities and indeed , the european union 's portuguese presidency said tuesday that russia 's legislative election " did not meet international standards and commitments . " the european union " regrets ... that there were many reports and allegations of media restrictions as well as harassment of opposition parties and ngos in the run up to the elections and on election day , " the presidency said in a statement , as reported by afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso other western goverenments also criticized the polls . sarkozy contradicted his own foreign ministry sarkozy 's telephone call to president putin - the leading candidate for russia 's united party that won an landslide victory , securing 315 of 450 seats in parliament - contradicted not only the eu 's stance , but also his own foreign ministry 's criticism of the conduct of the poll .
the ministry had called for investigations into the allegations of fraud . human rights groups were outraged at sarkozy 's move . " sarkozy 's reaction , which was totally isolated , is both incomprehensible and scandalous , " patrick baudouin , president of the paris-based international federation of human rights -lrb- fidh -rrb- , told afp . " this is a bad blow to democrats and human rights campaigners in russia . " " to give putin your support after unamimously condemned elections , is to compromise yourself and go against official policy " on human rights , he added . he called sarkozy 's call an " excess of zeal that was absolutely unnecessary " and said it was not to france 's credit . eu differs on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin 's party won over 60 percent of the parliamentary vote even all the eu members themselves do not agree about how to handle russia . diplomats told reuters reporters that the eu 's portuguese presidency was seeking agreement on monday among the 27 member states on a joint statement on the russian elections but that it was a challenge to get consensus on the text . on tuesday , the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , urged moscow to address the accusations of electoral irregularities in the russian poll . " everybody is aware that observers have denounced irregularities , " said johannes laitenberger , spokesman for the commission . " it is in the interest of russia to completely clarify all these allegations , " he told reporters in brussels , ac cited by afp . one diplomat told reuters that a draft of an eu statement that circulated on monday criticized moscow 's treatment of the election monitoring office of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and urged the russian government to permit osce monitors into the country to do a long-term survey in advance of a presidential election in march . economic interests at stake ? despite allegations that the opposition had been muzzled and ballots were rigged in the russian vote , the differing european responses to the election highlight the eu 's general problems in speaking with a single voice towards russia , which is its major energy supplier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chess champ kasparov crossed out all parties on his ballot sarkozy , for his part , has been critical of moscow 's handling of human rights , but opposition politicians have nonetheless accused him of putting economic interests above rights . daniele artur , russia expert at amnesty international in france , told afp that she was " very disappointed by -lsb- sarkozy 's -rsb- reaction " to sunday 's elections . " this is sheer realpolitik .
and yet we could have afforded to be much firmer , " she said . the eu similarly backpedaled last week when the portuguese presidency put out a critical statement three days after the arrest of opposition activists in russia , including former world chess champion garry kasparov .

" it 's a real pleasure to receive my good friend donald tusk ...
poland is a very important partner , and the voice of poland matters , " a buoyant eu commission president jose manuel barroso told journalists in brussels .
when tusk arrived in the commission - the eu 's executive - barroso met him with a beaming smile and an ebullient handshake which would not have been out of place in a christmas grotto .
and tusk replied in kind , referring to a new relationship of trust between his government and the brussels apparatus at least half a dozen times in his opening remarks and joking that he was relieved to have been allowed in after having given a marathon three-hour introductory speech to poland 's parliament 10 days ago .
even barroso 's spokesman , johannes laitenberger , received an ovation when he introduced tusk in polish - a linguistic feat met with cheers and whistles by the large contingent of polish visitors .
a breath of fresh air after kaczynskis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski brothers have been pariahs at the eu it was all a far cry from the tempestuous diplomacy of earlier times .
under tusk 's predecessor , the pugnacious jaroslaw kaczynski , relations between brussels and warsaw strained to breaking point .
in 2007 alone , kaczynski clashed bitterly with the eu over issues ranging from the vote allocated to poland under the new eu reform treaty to the construction of a bypass road through a nature reserve .
and his abrasive defence of polish interests won him few friends in brussels , where he was widely regarded as failing to understand the delicate system of compromises by which the eu functions .
" they seem not to have got the idea of give and take , " one senior brussels diplomat commented , in a reference to kaczynski and his twin brother lech , poland 's current president .
indeed , under the kaczynskis poland seemed set to win the title of europe 's " chief troublemaker , " as the twins threatened to veto a deal on the reform treaty at two successive summits .
tusk victory welcomed with relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk 's election victory caused brussels to sigh with relief tusk 's convincing win in parliamentary elections on october 21 , and his pledge to restore normality to the relationship with brussels , was hailed with relief in the eu 's capital .
" we discussed the future in a spirit of trust - of ' zaufanie , ' to use the polish word , " barroso joked on tuesday , winning a cheer of his own from his audience .
tusk has made trust his government 's watchword , and used the word some 45 times in his first speech .
and while many issues could still dampen the festive spirit - the bypass dispute , cod fishing quotas , energy security , and us plans to site parts of its missile shield in poland , to name but four - both men were convinced that they would no longer spoil the party .
" when we speak openly about things that can become a problem , both sides quickly find solutions , " tusk said .
even the end of the visit raised a cheer as laitenberger wished his audience " goodbye and good luck " in near-faultless polish .
festive goodwill in the capital of europe with the new spirit of cordiality shining through the gloom of a brussels december , both barroso and tusk looked delighted with their christmas message of peace in europe and goodwill to all men .

" it 's a real pleasure to receive my good friend donald tusk ...
poland is a very important partner , and the voice of poland matters , " a buoyant eu commission president jose manuel barroso told journalists in brussels .
when tusk arrived in the commission - the eu 's executive - barroso met him with a beaming smile and an ebullient handshake which would not have been out of place in a christmas grotto .
and tusk replied in kind , referring to a new relationship of trust between his government and the brussels apparatus at least half a dozen times in his opening remarks and joking that he was relieved to have been allowed in after having given a marathon three-hour introductory speech to poland 's parliament 10 days ago .
even barroso 's spokesman , johannes laitenberger , received an ovation when he introduced tusk in polish - a linguistic feat met with cheers and whistles by the large contingent of polish visitors .
a breath of fresh air after kaczynskis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski brothers have been pariahs at the eu it was all a far cry from the tempestuous diplomacy of earlier times .
under tusk 's predecessor , the pugnacious jaroslaw kaczynski , relations between brussels and warsaw strained to breaking point .
in 2007 alone , kaczynski clashed bitterly with the eu over issues ranging from the vote allocated to poland under the new eu reform treaty to the construction of a bypass road through a nature reserve .
and his abrasive defence of polish interests won him few friends in brussels , where he was widely regarded as failing to understand the delicate system of compromises by which the eu functions .
" they seem not to have got the idea of give and take , " one senior brussels diplomat commented , in a reference to kaczynski and his twin brother lech , poland 's current president .
indeed , under the kaczynskis poland seemed set to win the title of europe 's " chief troublemaker , " as the twins threatened to veto a deal on the reform treaty at two successive summits .
tusk victory welcomed with relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk 's election victory caused brussels to sigh with relief tusk 's convincing win in parliamentary elections on october 21 , and his pledge to restore normality to the relationship with brussels , was hailed with relief in the eu 's capital .
" we discussed the future in a spirit of trust - of ' zaufanie , ' to use the polish word , " barroso joked on tuesday , winning a cheer of his own from his audience .
tusk has made trust his government 's watchword , and used the word some 45 times in his first speech .
and while many issues could still dampen the festive spirit - the bypass dispute , cod fishing quotas , energy security , and us plans to site parts of its missile shield in poland , to name but four - both men were convinced that they would no longer spoil the party .
" when we speak openly about things that can become a problem , both sides quickly find solutions , " tusk said .
even the end of the visit raised a cheer as laitenberger wished his audience " goodbye and good luck " in near-faultless polish .
festive goodwill in the capital of europe with the new spirit of cordiality shining through the gloom of a brussels december , both barroso and tusk looked delighted with their christmas message of peace in europe and goodwill to all men .
whether that festive spirit will translate into a happy new year for their relationship remains to be seen . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 2007 alone , kaczynski clashed bitterly with the eu over issues ranging from the vote allocated to poland under the new eu reform treaty to the construction of a bypass road through a nature reserve .
and his abrasive defence of polish interests won him few friends in brussels , where he was widely regarded as failing to understand the delicate system of compromises by which the eu functions .
" they seem not to have got the idea of give and take , " one senior brussels diplomat commented , in a reference to kaczynski and his twin brother lech , poland 's current president .
indeed , under the kaczynskis poland seemed set to win the title of europe 's " chief troublemaker , " as the twins threatened to veto a deal on the reform treaty at two successive summits .

" we discussed the future in a spirit of trust - of ' zaufanie , ' to use the polish word , " barroso joked on tuesday , winning a cheer of his own from his audience .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internationals -pipe- 04.12.2007 klinsi the " good german " could be england 's wake-up call großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann 's passion and management skills should be the issue , not his nationality could a german really become coach of fierce rivals england ?
jürgen klinsmann is being looked at to fill the vacancy , but he would face opposition from some fans despite being a great choice , says dw 's nick amies . it would n't be an exaggeration to compare the possibility of former germany coach - and england nemesis - jürgen klinsmann taking over as coach of the three lions to hillary clinton or barak obama becoming president of the united states of america .
in all three hypothetical cases , the most pertinent question remains the same : is the country ready or is that really a step too far ? the possibility of the united states electing a woman or an african-american into the white house is divisive to say the least .
the fact that mrs. clinton and mr. obama are even in the running at this very early stage of the presidential race says something about how attitudes , at least in some parts of the country , have changed in the us .
most of their detractors focus on their policy stances and personality traits rather than their gender or racial background , which is encouraging for a nation that has for centuries tended to view the commander in chief 's job as being reserved for white males only .
if only the same could be said for the opinions and attitudes of some of the england faithful when it comes to the possibility of klinsmann leading england .
still , klinsmann , who led germany to third place in the 2006 world cup and turned down a job offer from the us soccer federation , has hinted he might be interested in occupying the vacant england bench .
klinsi the mold breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi 's and germany 's success has always rankled england fans klinsmann is one of a rare breed ; a german who has endeared himself to the english soccer masses .
his two spells as a tottenham hotspurs player in the 1990 's are credited with rehabilitating the long-held image of conniving , arrogant and - heaven forbid - massively successful germans which had been cultivated through decades of smug tournament victories and much-reveled-in conquests over england .
his self-referential diving celebration after scoring showed a humorous side to the teutonic efficiency that had grated so much with england fans for so long while his contribution in making the premiership the star-studded internationally renowned league it is now can not be underestimated .
his coaching ability is also grudgingly respected on the island .
in his short tenure , klinsmann transformed germany from a nation infamous for grinding out results to a team purring with flair which - as long as that flair was not used to knock england out of any tournament - was appreciated by those english who lamented the lack of invention in their own team .
the german it 's okay to like bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far would klinsi 's popularity in england stretch ?
klinsi is what is commonly known in those circles where such things matter as " an okay german " for his contribution to the premiership and his philosophy of how the game should be played .
it must , however , be said that klinsmann only remains the good german while he is not responsible for any england heartbreak .
all that could change if he is made england coach .
the england job carries the most pressure of any managerial position in international soccer .
the expectation among the fans is hysterically high and probably unachievable .
despite going 41 years without a title since their only tournament success , fans always believe it is england 's right to win .
to keep these demanding supporters happy and lead england to victory is a hard task for any man , and even more so for a german .
section of fans stuck in the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some england fans would not welcome a german coach believe what you want about england 's notorious fans being rehabilitated or locked-up out of harms way .
the truth is there are still elements which sing " ten german bombers " , chant along to the " dambusters " theme and claim in song that hitler was testicularly-challenged .
animosity towards the germans arising from world war ii is sadly still alive in some less-enlightened quarters and the appointment of one who has been a hate-figure in his time as a player would certainly test how far the england faithful have come in their sensitivity training .

klinsi is what is commonly known in those circles where such things matter as " an okay german " for his contribution to the premiership and his philosophy of how the game should be played .
it must , however , be said that klinsmann only remains the good german while he is not responsible for any england heartbreak .

the expectation among the fans is hysterically high and probably unachievable .

his self-referential diving celebration after scoring showed a humorous side to the teutonic efficiency that had grated so much with england fans for so long while his contribution in making the premiership the star-studded internationally renowned league it is now can not be underestimated .
his coaching ability is also grudgingly respected on the island .
in his short tenure , klinsmann transformed germany from a nation infamous for grinding out results to a team purring with flair which - as long as that flair was not used to knock england out of any tournament - was appreciated by those english who lamented the lack of invention in their own team .
the german it 's okay to like bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far would klinsi 's popularity in england stretch ?
klinsi is what is commonly known in those circles where such things matter as " an okay german " for his contribution to the premiership and his philosophy of how the game should be played .
it must , however , be said that klinsmann only remains the good german while he is not responsible for any england heartbreak .
all that could change if he is made england coach .
the england job carries the most pressure of any managerial position in international soccer .
the expectation among the fans is hysterically high and probably unachievable .
despite going 41 years without a title since their only tournament success , fans always believe it is england 's right to win .

animosity towards the germans arising from world war ii is sadly still alive in some less-enlightened quarters and the appointment of one who has been a hate-figure in his time as a player would certainly test how far the england faithful have come in their sensitivity training .

the uproar over appointing an unassuming swede would be nothing compared to the narrow-minded maelstrom that would accompany the naming of a formerly cocky german as national coach .

jürgen klinsmann is being looked at to fill the vacancy , but he would face opposition from some fans despite being a great choice , says dw 's nick amies . it would n't be an exaggeration to compare the possibility of former germany coach - and england nemesis - jürgen klinsmann taking over as coach of the three lions to hillary clinton or barak obama becoming president of the united states of america .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 04.12.2007 pisa education studies come under examination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people still ca n't get their heads around the pisa testing system germany crept up the rankings in the latest comparative international education study .
but the results are once again fanning the flames of controversy in the ongoing debate over school reform . germany reached 13th place out of 57 countries tested in the results of the latest program for international student assessment - pisa - study , officially published on tuesday , nov .
4 . but any joy over improvement in standing was damped when the test 's creator at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , andreas schleicher , last week told the press that the improvement was more likely due to changes in the way the test was structured , than to any actual improvement on the part of german students . the discussion over germany 's school performance has been raging since 2000 , when the country landed in the bottom third of the rankings of 32 countries , and continued through 2003 , when germany still rated 18th in a list of 40 countries . those rankings " certainly served to alert the public of just how different our perception of the system was compared with its stance in the real world , " said rainer lehmann , a professor of education research at berlin 's humboldt university . indeed , the country 's mediocre ranking back in 2000 caught most germans , who thought highly of their school system , off guard .
the term pisa has since become a household word , reflecting the study 's resonance in the media . debate over studies ' relevance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could be moving towards a comprehensive system the debate has raised questions about the general relevance of comparative educational testing , pitting those who see tests as a useful comparative tool against those who focus on the shortcomings of big , international studies . most experts agree that big international studies have an important place in education policy . " the idea is that you have some natural variance between educational systems , and you try to capitalize upon this by looking at different influences , " said lehmann .
" the goal is to learn from other systems . " michael becker-mrotzeck , a professor in the department of language education at cologne university , agreed . " in principle , -lrb- these studies -rrb- tell us useful information about our school system , " he said .
" for instance , from the first and second pisa studies , germans learned that in no other country does social status of the parents have such a big effect on the academic success of their children . " in addition , the earlier studies showed weakness in certain basic competencies , like reading , math and science .
as a result , he said , schools have shifted focus - with visible results . in november an international test of elementary school competency showed that reading had " clearly improved . " " our education system reacted , quickly , " to the deficits uncovered by pisa , becker-mrotzeck said .
this led to the development of a spate of learning materials , and a host of creative concepts , such as reading nights and author-readings in schools . germany coming out of anti-testing era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has now accepted testing procedures unlike in the uk and the us , where educational testing has long been a buzzword and where standardized tests are routinely used to monitoring how much information is being passed from teachers to students , germany is fairly new to the game . after a spate of general tests in the early 70s showed similar weaknesses to those rediscovered by pisa in 2001 , the country underwent an anti-testing backlash that lasted a good 20 years . only recently have policymakers reinstated mass comparative testing in schools .
today , german schoolchildren face four " general " exams over the course of their 13 year school career - in 3rd , 8th , 10th and at the end of the 12th grade , becker-mrotzeck explained . " it is different than in the us or england , where they might have such tests twice a year , " said becker-mrozeck .
" i do n't think at that level germany is in danger of doing what they call in america , ' teaching to the test . " ' still , learning does n't take place via testing , said renate hendricks , a social democrat parliamentarian for the state of north-rhine westphalia , who specializes in education policy . " i think you can test what a person can do , but learning comes through motivation , curiosity , interest , and an emotional relationship to the teacher , " among other things , hendricks said . hendricks did acknowledge that comparative studies are useful for giving feedback aimed at improving schools .
" but if politicians are incapable of using the information they get to make positive change , then no , these studies are not useful , " she said . disparities in german system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pisa studies are flawed , say some she added that when the figures are broken down by social background , immense disparities in the german system are still evident in the newest pisa results .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 04.12.2007 pisa education studies come under examination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people still ca n't get their heads around the pisa testing system germany crept up the rankings in the latest comparative international education study .
but the results are once again fanning the flames of controversy in the ongoing debate over school reform . germany reached 13th place out of 57 countries tested in the results of the latest program for international student assessment - pisa - study , officially published on tuesday , nov .
4 . but any joy over improvement in standing was damped when the test 's creator at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , andreas schleicher , last week told the press that the improvement was more likely due to changes in the way the test was structured , than to any actual improvement on the part of german students . the discussion over germany 's school performance has been raging since 2000 , when the country landed in the bottom third of the rankings of 32 countries , and continued through 2003 , when germany still rated 18th in a list of 40 countries . those rankings " certainly served to alert the public of just how different our perception of the system was compared with its stance in the real world , " said rainer lehmann , a professor of education research at berlin 's humboldt university . indeed , the country 's mediocre ranking back in 2000 caught most germans , who thought highly of their school system , off guard .
the term pisa has since become a household word , reflecting the study 's resonance in the media . debate over studies ' relevance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could be moving towards a comprehensive system the debate has raised questions about the general relevance of comparative educational testing , pitting those who see tests as a useful comparative tool against those who focus on the shortcomings of big , international studies . most experts agree that big international studies have an important place in education policy . " the idea is that you have some natural variance between educational systems , and you try to capitalize upon this by looking at different influences , " said lehmann .
" the goal is to learn from other systems . " michael becker-mrotzeck , a professor in the department of language education at cologne university , agreed . " in principle , -lrb- these studies -rrb- tell us useful information about our school system , " he said .
" for instance , from the first and second pisa studies , germans learned that in no other country does social status of the parents have such a big effect on the academic success of their children . " in addition , the earlier studies showed weakness in certain basic competencies , like reading , math and science .
as a result , he said , schools have shifted focus - with visible results . in november an international test of elementary school competency showed that reading had " clearly improved . " " our education system reacted , quickly , " to the deficits uncovered by pisa , becker-mrotzeck said .
this led to the development of a spate of learning materials , and a host of creative concepts , such as reading nights and author-readings in schools . germany coming out of anti-testing era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has now accepted testing procedures unlike in the uk and the us , where educational testing has long been a buzzword and where standardized tests are routinely used to monitoring how much information is being passed from teachers to students , germany is fairly new to the game . after a spate of general tests in the early 70s showed similar weaknesses to those rediscovered by pisa in 2001 , the country underwent an anti-testing backlash that lasted a good 20 years . only recently have policymakers reinstated mass comparative testing in schools .
today , german schoolchildren face four " general " exams over the course of their 13 year school career - in 3rd , 8th , 10th and at the end of the 12th grade , becker-mrotzeck explained . " it is different than in the us or england , where they might have such tests twice a year , " said becker-mrozeck .
" i do n't think at that level germany is in danger of doing what they call in america , ' teaching to the test . " ' still , learning does n't take place via testing , said renate hendricks , a social democrat parliamentarian for the state of north-rhine westphalia , who specializes in education policy . " i think you can test what a person can do , but learning comes through motivation , curiosity , interest , and an emotional relationship to the teacher , " among other things , hendricks said . hendricks did acknowledge that comparative studies are useful for giving feedback aimed at improving schools .
" but if politicians are incapable of using the information they get to make positive change , then no , these studies are not useful , " she said . disparities in german system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pisa studies are flawed , say some she added that when the figures are broken down by social background , immense disparities in the german system are still evident in the newest pisa results . " now it is clear we have to do something , " she said .

but the results are once again fanning the flames of controversy in the ongoing debate over school reform . germany reached 13th place out of 57 countries tested in the results of the latest program for international student assessment - pisa - study , officially published on tuesday , nov .
4 . but any joy over improvement in standing was damped when the test 's creator at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , andreas schleicher , last week told the press that the improvement was more likely due to changes in the way the test was structured , than to any actual improvement on the part of german students . the discussion over germany 's school performance has been raging since 2000 , when the country landed in the bottom third of the rankings of 32 countries , and continued through 2003 , when germany still rated 18th in a list of 40 countries . those rankings " certainly served to alert the public of just how different our perception of the system was compared with its stance in the real world , " said rainer lehmann , a professor of education research at berlin 's humboldt university . indeed , the country 's mediocre ranking back in 2000 caught most germans , who thought highly of their school system , off guard .
the term pisa has since become a household word , reflecting the study 's resonance in the media . debate over studies ' relevance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could be moving towards a comprehensive system the debate has raised questions about the general relevance of comparative educational testing , pitting those who see tests as a useful comparative tool against those who focus on the shortcomings of big , international studies . most experts agree that big international studies have an important place in education policy . " the idea is that you have some natural variance between educational systems , and you try to capitalize upon this by looking at different influences , " said lehmann .
" the goal is to learn from other systems . " michael becker-mrotzeck , a professor in the department of language education at cologne university , agreed . " in principle , -lrb- these studies -rrb- tell us useful information about our school system , " he said .
" for instance , from the first and second pisa studies , germans learned that in no other country does social status of the parents have such a big effect on the academic success of their children . " in addition , the earlier studies showed weakness in certain basic competencies , like reading , math and science .
as a result , he said , schools have shifted focus - with visible results . in november an international test of elementary school competency showed that reading had " clearly improved . " " our education system reacted , quickly , " to the deficits uncovered by pisa , becker-mrotzeck said .
this led to the development of a spate of learning materials , and a host of creative concepts , such as reading nights and author-readings in schools . germany coming out of anti-testing era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has now accepted testing procedures unlike in the uk and the us , where educational testing has long been a buzzword and where standardized tests are routinely used to monitoring how much information is being passed from teachers to students , germany is fairly new to the game . after a spate of general tests in the early 70s showed similar weaknesses to those rediscovered by pisa in 2001 , the country underwent an anti-testing backlash that lasted a good 20 years . only recently have policymakers reinstated mass comparative testing in schools .
today , german schoolchildren face four " general " exams over the course of their 13 year school career - in 3rd , 8th , 10th and at the end of the 12th grade , becker-mrotzeck explained . " it is different than in the us or england , where they might have such tests twice a year , " said becker-mrozeck .
" i do n't think at that level germany is in danger of doing what they call in america , ' teaching to the test . " ' still , learning does n't take place via testing , said renate hendricks , a social democrat parliamentarian for the state of north-rhine westphalia , who specializes in education policy . " i think you can test what a person can do , but learning comes through motivation , curiosity , interest , and an emotional relationship to the teacher , " among other things , hendricks said . hendricks did acknowledge that comparative studies are useful for giving feedback aimed at improving schools .
" but if politicians are incapable of using the information they get to make positive change , then no , these studies are not useful , " she said . disparities in german system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pisa studies are flawed , say some she added that when the figures are broken down by social background , immense disparities in the german system are still evident in the newest pisa results . " now it is clear we have to do something , " she said .
" these politicians have to take off their rose-colored glasses .
or black glasses , or whatever they are wearing . " meanwhile , still other critics say the whole structure of pisa - indeed , the idea of widespread comparative international testing itself - is flawed .
the pisa study was also designed with " unrealistic goals , " according to joachim wuttke , a munich-based physicist , statistician and math teacher who has written two articles critiquing the methodology behind pisa and similar tests . tests weighted against germany , says expert " the ranking of states on a one-dimensional scale is not serious , " he said .
" you can construct tests that give different results , and this one is made in a way that shows germany is mediocre . " various factors can affect outcome .
the type of school system a country has is just one potential factor , he said , adding that the spectrum of students tested also differed from country to country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : differences in studies across europe are a problem " germany took great pains to get a representative sample of students , testing even in schools for special-needs students , " he said .
" meanwhile , finland excluded students with dyslexia from the test .
you ca n't do an international comparison of reading difficulties when you exclude some students . " ultimately , wuttke said tests like pisa " do n't test the system , they test the population . "
he pointed out that in highest-ranking finland , there are almost no immigrants . " if you compared results of all native students only , then finland is no longer at the top of the list , " he said . germany shocked out of stupor one thing the pisa proponents seem to agree on is that the results from 2001 shocked the country into a back-to-basics frenzy . " i see the main advantage of this test as having reoriented schools toward cognitive growth , " said humboldt university 's lehmann .
" every year you have a new set of educational goals seems to be defined - family education , sexual education , peace education , gender education ... but the core business seems to be forgotten . " but even there , wuttke sees pisa as more of a lost opportunity than a gain . " reading , math and science are important subjects , but it should n't come at the expense of other things like sports and music , " he said .

the report stated that iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 . for nearly 18 months , solana has been trying to persuade the islamic republic to suspend uranium enrichment in exchange for a bundle of political , trade and economic incentives . solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said the national intelligence estimate -lrb- nie -rrb- report " proves that transparency about -lrb- iran 's -rrb- nuclear activities and its intentions are fundamental . " but us president george w. bush said that iran remains a danger and refused to rule out a military attack despite the new findings . " iran was dangerous , iran is dangerous and iran will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon , " bush told a white house press conference . the international atomic agency director general mohamed el baradei said on tuesday , nov .
4 , that the report tallied with the iaea investigation into the country 's nuclear program . a number of european countries , including germany , have already welcomed the us report as confirming that europe 's strategy of negotiations plus sanctions is keeping tehran in line with international demands . the nie report confirmed " the double approach chosen by the international community of incentives and measures from the united nations security council was right , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a statement released monday , nov .
3 . britain 's foreign ministry also said the carrot-and-stick approach was working to keep iran in line with international demands . " the report 's conclusions justify the action already taken by the international community to get to the bottom of iran 's nuclear program and to increase pressure on the regime to stop its enrichment and reprocessing activities , " a british foreign ministry spokeswoman told the afp news agency . international pressure successful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the double approach of sanctions and incentives needed to continue the national intelligence estimate , a consensus of all 16 us spy agencies , said in a report monday that it was confident that iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in late 2003 .
nie cited " moderate confidence " that the program had not been restarted as of mid-2007 . tehran could have the technical ability to build a nuclear weapon between 2010 and 2015 , but " we do not know if it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons , " the report stated . iran appears " less determined to develop nuclear weapons than we have been judging since 2005 , " the nie said .
the report concluded that it was likely that tehran had halted its nuclear program in response to international pressure , which " suggests that iran may be more vulnerable to influence on the issue than we judged previously . " europe 's mixed approach to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military work at iran 's nuclear facilities may have stopped four years ago the united nations security council has brought sanctions against iran twice for refusing to discontinue its uranium enrichment program .
enriched uranium can be used to build nuclear weapons , but iran has consistently said its program is purely used for civilian purposes . the five permanent members of the security council - britain , china , france , russia and the usa - plus germany met in paris over the weekend to discuss a third sanctions resolution but did not reach an agreement . in 2004 and 2005 , germany , along with britain and france , led a diplomatic initiative with tehran in which trade and other economic incentives were discussed in exchange for a halt on the uranium enrichment program . while the so-called eu-3 has since supported un-led sanctions against iran , it has also remained open to a more diplomatic strategy . report may be face-saver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran welcomed the report , saying it confirmed iran 's nuclear plans are peaceful us national security advisor stephen hadley said the report should n't be taken as a reason to lose vigilance . " there 's going to be a tendency of a lot of people to say : ' the problem 's less bad that we thought , let 's relax , " ' said hadley .
" our view is that would be a mistake . " hadley denied that us rhetoric on iran had escalated to step up international pressure .
in october , us president george w. bush raised the specters of " world war iii " or a " nuclear holocaust " occurring should teheran build a nuclear bomb . the estimate could have been a " face saving decision " because bush is not willing to strike militarily and has exhausted the efforts at the un security council , alex vatanka of the middle east institute told the dpa news agency .

six months after parliamentary elections , belgium remains without a government .
outgoing pm guy verhofstadt has launched mediation talks with the country 's main parties after belgian king albert approached him for help . verhofstadt hopes to mend the rupture between francophone and flemish-speaking leaders after coalition talks to form a new government collapsed last week .
this comes after king albert ii summoned verhofstadt on monday and asked him , according to a statement issued by the palace , " to inform the king on the way to get out of the impasse very swiftly , and to make all the contacts necessary to do so . "
belgian television reports have interpreted the belgian king 's move as bestowing “ urgent ” powers , including dealing with “ international matters , ” on prime minister guy verhofstadt .
but this would be in violation of the belgian constitution which does not provide for extended powers to governments without a parliamentary majority .
flemish christian democrat leader yves leterme , who was expected to succeed verhofstadt , told the king on saturday that he was unable to form a coalition after failing to reach a deal over how much power should be devolved to the regions .
haunted by the specter of division along linguistic lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's image is beginning to look a little tattered the deadlock has sparked fears that belgium would split into the flemish and french-speaking parts .
" our country is facing one of the most severe political crises of the last decades , " verhofstadt told a news conference in brussels .
" this situation can not and must not continue for much longer , " he added .
verhofstadt said the country needed fundamental state reform , adding that the country 's problems could be solved " when everyone recognized the seriousness of the situation and took responsibility . "
he said he wanted to reach an agreement on devolution and tackle urgent social and economic issues that go far beyond the authority of a caretaker government .
situation remains unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would-be pm leterme is of mixed parentage himself , but he has not built bridges between the two communities but verhofstadt , who was ousted in the june elections after eight years in office , did not give details of his plans or how the 2008 budget could be drafted under these circumstances .

six months after parliamentary elections , belgium remains without a government .
outgoing pm guy verhofstadt has launched mediation talks with the country 's main parties after belgian king albert approached him for help . verhofstadt hopes to mend the rupture between francophone and flemish-speaking leaders after coalition talks to form a new government collapsed last week .
this comes after king albert ii summoned verhofstadt on monday and asked him , according to a statement issued by the palace , " to inform the king on the way to get out of the impasse very swiftly , and to make all the contacts necessary to do so . "
belgian television reports have interpreted the belgian king 's move as bestowing “ urgent ” powers , including dealing with “ international matters , ” on prime minister guy verhofstadt .
but this would be in violation of the belgian constitution which does not provide for extended powers to governments without a parliamentary majority .
flemish christian democrat leader yves leterme , who was expected to succeed verhofstadt , told the king on saturday that he was unable to form a coalition after failing to reach a deal over how much power should be devolved to the regions .
haunted by the specter of division along linguistic lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's image is beginning to look a little tattered the deadlock has sparked fears that belgium would split into the flemish and french-speaking parts .
" our country is facing one of the most severe political crises of the last decades , " verhofstadt told a news conference in brussels .
" this situation can not and must not continue for much longer , " he added .
verhofstadt said the country needed fundamental state reform , adding that the country 's problems could be solved " when everyone recognized the seriousness of the situation and took responsibility . "
he said he wanted to reach an agreement on devolution and tackle urgent social and economic issues that go far beyond the authority of a caretaker government .
situation remains unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would-be pm leterme is of mixed parentage himself , but he has not built bridges between the two communities but verhofstadt , who was ousted in the june elections after eight years in office , did not give details of his plans or how the 2008 budget could be drafted under these circumstances .
belgium 's flemish majority wants more autonomy for the relatively rich region of flanders , a move seen as a political and financial threat in the french-speaking region of wallonia .
many flemish voters believe that their taxes - amongst the highest in the world - are used to subsidize the social security system in the south .
verhofstadt said the country 's image abroad was suffering because of the ongoing crisis .
business leaders say potential foreign investors will be driven away .
the liberal vld leader managed to largely keep a lid on devolution-related issues during his term of office .
but he was punished for that at the polls by flemish voters .

" " what can we say of this political cowardice ?
we expect our leaders to lead , and lead with moral courage , " said the writers in an open letter published tuesday in african and european newspapers . " when they fail to do so they leave all of us morally impoverished . " debate over participation of zimbabwean president the summit , scheduled for dec .
8-9 in portugal , is the first of its kind since 2000 , said non-governmental organization crisis action , which publicised the letter in advance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has been accused of violently oppressing the opposition governance and human rights , peace and security , migration , energy and climate change , and trade are on the agenda in portugal , which currently holds the eu presidency .
the meeting is seen as an effort from europe to strength ties with africa at a time when china is also expanding economic activity on the impoverished continent . britain 's prime minister gordon brown has said he would not attend the conference if zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe is also there , citing the leader 's human rights record .
mugabe has widely been accused of running his country 's economy into the ground and suppressing political opposition . zimbabwe has the world 's highest inflation rate and the world bank has said it has the fastest shrinking economy outside a war zone . former international development secretary valerie amos , now a member of britain 's upper house of lord 's , will go to lisbon in brown 's place . except for czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who is also expected not to attend the summit , other european leaders have not followed brown 's stance : german chancellor angela merkel has said she will stay silent on the situation in zimbabwe . the majority of eu countries , including presidency-holder portugal , have backed the african union 's position that mugabe be allowed to join in the meeting . darfur crisis heats up with fresh attacks activists have also criticized the participation of leaders from sudan at the lisbon conference .
the northern african country has taken heat for allegedly supporting militia groups accused of atrocities in the darfur region . bildunterschrift : many of the refugees from the darfur region have settled in camps in neighboring chad darfur , located in western sudan on the chadian border , has been the scene of ethnic killings for the past several years . armed conflict broke out again tuesday morning in the area when chad 's army attacked an anti-government rebel group for a second day in their mountain hideout near the darfur region of sudan . the violence comes just several weeks before an eu peacekeeping force of up to 3,700 troops is set to deploy to eastern chad as part of a un mission to protect civilian refugees and foreign aid workers . eu member states have been accused of delays in providing promised aircraft , helicopters and medical units to the mission , reported reuters news service . " millions of africans and europeans would expect zimbabwe and darfur to be at the very top of the agenda , " wrote the authors in their open letter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 04.12.2007 eu to keep up pressure on iran after us report großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 , a us report said a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy envoy javier solana said the european union would keep up its twin track approach of dialogue and pressure .
the report stated that iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 . for nearly 18 months , solana has been trying to persuade the islamic republic to suspend uranium enrichment in exchange for a bundle of political , trade and economic incentives . solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said the national intelligence estimate -lrb- nie -rrb- report " proves that transparency about -lrb- iran 's -rrb- nuclear activities and its intentions are fundamental . " but us president george w. bush said that iran remains a danger and refused to rule out a military attack despite the new findings . " iran was dangerous , iran is dangerous and iran will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon , " bush told a white house press conference . the international atomic agency director general mohamed el baradei said on tuesday , nov .
4 , that the report tallied with the iaea investigation into the country 's nuclear program . a number of european countries , including germany , have already welcomed the us report as confirming that europe 's strategy of negotiations plus sanctions is keeping tehran in line with international demands . the nie report confirmed " the double approach chosen by the international community of incentives and measures from the united nations security council was right , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a statement released monday , nov .
3 . britain 's foreign ministry also said the carrot-and-stick approach was working to keep iran in line with international demands . " the report 's conclusions justify the action already taken by the international community to get to the bottom of iran 's nuclear program and to increase pressure on the regime to stop its enrichment and reprocessing activities , " a british foreign ministry spokeswoman told the afp news agency . international pressure successful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the double approach of sanctions and incentives needed to continue the national intelligence estimate , a consensus of all 16 us spy agencies , said in a report monday that it was confident that iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in late 2003 .
nie cited " moderate confidence " that the program had not been restarted as of mid-2007 . tehran could have the technical ability to build a nuclear weapon between 2010 and 2015 , but " we do not know if it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons , " the report stated . iran appears " less determined to develop nuclear weapons than we have been judging since 2005 , " the nie said .
the report concluded that it was likely that tehran had halted its nuclear program in response to international pressure , which " suggests that iran may be more vulnerable to influence on the issue than we judged previously . " europe 's mixed approach to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military work at iran 's nuclear facilities may have stopped four years ago the united nations security council has brought sanctions against iran twice for refusing to discontinue its uranium enrichment program .
enriched uranium can be used to build nuclear weapons , but iran has consistently said its program is purely used for civilian purposes . the five permanent members of the security council - britain , china , france , russia and the usa - plus germany met in paris over the weekend to discuss a third sanctions resolution but did not reach an agreement . in 2004 and 2005 , germany , along with britain and france , led a diplomatic initiative with tehran in which trade and other economic incentives were discussed in exchange for a halt on the uranium enrichment program . while the so-called eu-3 has since supported un-led sanctions against iran , it has also remained open to a more diplomatic strategy . report may be face-saver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran welcomed the report , saying it confirmed iran 's nuclear plans are peaceful us national security advisor stephen hadley said the report should n't be taken as a reason to lose vigilance . " there 's going to be a tendency of a lot of people to say : ' the problem 's less bad that we thought , let 's relax , " ' said hadley .
" our view is that would be a mistake . " hadley denied that us rhetoric on iran had escalated to step up international pressure .
in october , us president george w. bush raised the specters of " world war iii " or a " nuclear holocaust " occurring should teheran build a nuclear bomb . the estimate could have been a " face saving decision " because bush is not willing to strike militarily and has exhausted the efforts at the un security council , alex vatanka of the middle east institute told the dpa news agency . " at this stage of the game it is better to underplay the threat , " he said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 04.12.2007 poland 's tusk tastes christmas cheer during first brussels visit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk 's first visit to brussels as prime minister was a warm one the european commission press room is not often associated with christmas cheer , but as poland 's new prime minister donald tusk visited on tuesday the goodwill and good humour positively sloshed around the building . " it 's a real pleasure to receive my good friend donald tusk ...
poland is a very important partner , and the voice of poland matters , " a buoyant eu commission president jose manuel barroso told journalists in brussels .
when tusk arrived in the commission - the eu 's executive - barroso met him with a beaming smile and an ebullient handshake which would not have been out of place in a christmas grotto .
and tusk replied in kind , referring to a new relationship of trust between his government and the brussels apparatus at least half a dozen times in his opening remarks and joking that he was relieved to have been allowed in after having given a marathon three-hour introductory speech to poland 's parliament 10 days ago .
even barroso 's spokesman , johannes laitenberger , received an ovation when he introduced tusk in polish - a linguistic feat met with cheers and whistles by the large contingent of polish visitors .
a breath of fresh air after kaczynskis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski brothers have been pariahs at the eu it was all a far cry from the tempestuous diplomacy of earlier times .
under tusk 's predecessor , the pugnacious jaroslaw kaczynski , relations between brussels and warsaw strained to breaking point .
in 2007 alone , kaczynski clashed bitterly with the eu over issues ranging from the vote allocated to poland under the new eu reform treaty to the construction of a bypass road through a nature reserve .
and his abrasive defence of polish interests won him few friends in brussels , where he was widely regarded as failing to understand the delicate system of compromises by which the eu functions .
" they seem not to have got the idea of give and take , " one senior brussels diplomat commented , in a reference to kaczynski and his twin brother lech , poland 's current president .
indeed , under the kaczynskis poland seemed set to win the title of europe 's " chief troublemaker , " as the twins threatened to veto a deal on the reform treaty at two successive summits .
tusk victory welcomed with relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk 's election victory caused brussels to sigh with relief tusk 's convincing win in parliamentary elections on october 21 , and his pledge to restore normality to the relationship with brussels , was hailed with relief in the eu 's capital .
" we discussed the future in a spirit of trust - of ' zaufanie , ' to use the polish word , " barroso joked on tuesday , winning a cheer of his own from his audience .
tusk has made trust his government 's watchword , and used the word some 45 times in his first speech .
and while many issues could still dampen the festive spirit - the bypass dispute , cod fishing quotas , energy security , and us plans to site parts of its missile shield in poland , to name but four - both men were convinced that they would no longer spoil the party .
" when we speak openly about things that can become a problem , both sides quickly find solutions , " tusk said .

" it 's a real pleasure to receive my good friend donald tusk ...
poland is a very important partner , and the voice of poland matters , " a buoyant eu commission president jose manuel barroso told journalists in brussels .
when tusk arrived in the commission - the eu 's executive - barroso met him with a beaming smile and an ebullient handshake which would not have been out of place in a christmas grotto .
and tusk replied in kind , referring to a new relationship of trust between his government and the brussels apparatus at least half a dozen times in his opening remarks and joking that he was relieved to have been allowed in after having given a marathon three-hour introductory speech to poland 's parliament 10 days ago .
even barroso 's spokesman , johannes laitenberger , received an ovation when he introduced tusk in polish - a linguistic feat met with cheers and whistles by the large contingent of polish visitors .
a breath of fresh air after kaczynskis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski brothers have been pariahs at the eu it was all a far cry from the tempestuous diplomacy of earlier times .
under tusk 's predecessor , the pugnacious jaroslaw kaczynski , relations between brussels and warsaw strained to breaking point .
in 2007 alone , kaczynski clashed bitterly with the eu over issues ranging from the vote allocated to poland under the new eu reform treaty to the construction of a bypass road through a nature reserve .
and his abrasive defence of polish interests won him few friends in brussels , where he was widely regarded as failing to understand the delicate system of compromises by which the eu functions .
" they seem not to have got the idea of give and take , " one senior brussels diplomat commented , in a reference to kaczynski and his twin brother lech , poland 's current president .
indeed , under the kaczynskis poland seemed set to win the title of europe 's " chief troublemaker , " as the twins threatened to veto a deal on the reform treaty at two successive summits .
tusk victory welcomed with relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk 's election victory caused brussels to sigh with relief tusk 's convincing win in parliamentary elections on october 21 , and his pledge to restore normality to the relationship with brussels , was hailed with relief in the eu 's capital .
" we discussed the future in a spirit of trust - of ' zaufanie , ' to use the polish word , " barroso joked on tuesday , winning a cheer of his own from his audience .
tusk has made trust his government 's watchword , and used the word some 45 times in his first speech .
and while many issues could still dampen the festive spirit - the bypass dispute , cod fishing quotas , energy security , and us plans to site parts of its missile shield in poland , to name but four - both men were convinced that they would no longer spoil the party .
" when we speak openly about things that can become a problem , both sides quickly find solutions , " tusk said .
even the end of the visit raised a cheer as laitenberger wished his audience " goodbye and good luck " in near-faultless polish .
festive goodwill in the capital of europe with the new spirit of cordiality shining through the gloom of a brussels december , both barroso and tusk looked delighted with their christmas message of peace in europe and goodwill to all men .

the report stated that iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 . for nearly 18 months , solana has been trying to persuade the islamic republic to suspend uranium enrichment in exchange for a bundle of political , trade and economic incentives . solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said the national intelligence estimate -lrb- nie -rrb- report " proves that transparency about -lrb- iran 's -rrb- nuclear activities and its intentions are fundamental . " but us president george w. bush said that iran remains a danger and refused to rule out a military attack despite the new findings . " iran was dangerous , iran is dangerous and iran will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon , " bush told a white house press conference . the international atomic agency director general mohamed el baradei said on tuesday , nov .
4 , that the report tallied with the iaea investigation into the country 's nuclear program . a number of european countries , including germany , have already welcomed the us report as confirming that europe 's strategy of negotiations plus sanctions is keeping tehran in line with international demands . the nie report confirmed " the double approach chosen by the international community of incentives and measures from the united nations security council was right , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a statement released monday , nov .
3 . britain 's foreign ministry also said the carrot-and-stick approach was working to keep iran in line with international demands . " the report 's conclusions justify the action already taken by the international community to get to the bottom of iran 's nuclear program and to increase pressure on the regime to stop its enrichment and reprocessing activities , " a british foreign ministry spokeswoman told the afp news agency . international pressure successful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the double approach of sanctions and incentives needed to continue the national intelligence estimate , a consensus of all 16 us spy agencies , said in a report monday that it was confident that iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in late 2003 .
nie cited " moderate confidence " that the program had not been restarted as of mid-2007 . tehran could have the technical ability to build a nuclear weapon between 2010 and 2015 , but " we do not know if it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons , " the report stated . iran appears " less determined to develop nuclear weapons than we have been judging since 2005 , " the nie said .
the report concluded that it was likely that tehran had halted its nuclear program in response to international pressure , which " suggests that iran may be more vulnerable to influence on the issue than we judged previously . " europe 's mixed approach to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military work at iran 's nuclear facilities may have stopped four years ago the united nations security council has brought sanctions against iran twice for refusing to discontinue its uranium enrichment program .
enriched uranium can be used to build nuclear weapons , but iran has consistently said its program is purely used for civilian purposes . the five permanent members of the security council - britain , china , france , russia and the usa - plus germany met in paris over the weekend to discuss a third sanctions resolution but did not reach an agreement . in 2004 and 2005 , germany , along with britain and france , led a diplomatic initiative with tehran in which trade and other economic incentives were discussed in exchange for a halt on the uranium enrichment program . while the so-called eu-3 has since supported un-led sanctions against iran , it has also remained open to a more diplomatic strategy . report may be face-saver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran welcomed the report , saying it confirmed iran 's nuclear plans are peaceful us national security advisor stephen hadley said the report should n't be taken as a reason to lose vigilance . " there 's going to be a tendency of a lot of people to say : ' the problem 's less bad that we thought , let 's relax , " ' said hadley .
" our view is that would be a mistake . " hadley denied that us rhetoric on iran had escalated to step up international pressure .
in october , us president george w. bush raised the specters of " world war iii " or a " nuclear holocaust " occurring should teheran build a nuclear bomb . the estimate could have been a " face saving decision " because bush is not willing to strike militarily and has exhausted the efforts at the un security council , alex vatanka of the middle east institute told the dpa news agency .

six months after parliamentary elections , belgium remains without a government .
outgoing pm guy verhofstadt has launched mediation talks with the country 's main parties after belgian king albert approached him for help . verhofstadt hopes to mend the rupture between francophone and flemish-speaking leaders after coalition talks to form a new government collapsed last week .
this comes after king albert ii summoned verhofstadt on monday and asked him , according to a statement issued by the palace , " to inform the king on the way to get out of the impasse very swiftly , and to make all the contacts necessary to do so . "
belgian television reports have interpreted the belgian king 's move as bestowing “ urgent ” powers , including dealing with “ international matters , ” on prime minister guy verhofstadt .
but this would be in violation of the belgian constitution which does not provide for extended powers to governments without a parliamentary majority .
flemish christian democrat leader yves leterme , who was expected to succeed verhofstadt , told the king on saturday that he was unable to form a coalition after failing to reach a deal over how much power should be devolved to the regions .
haunted by the specter of division along linguistic lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's image is beginning to look a little tattered the deadlock has sparked fears that belgium would split into the flemish and french-speaking parts .
" our country is facing one of the most severe political crises of the last decades , " verhofstadt told a news conference in brussels .
" this situation can not and must not continue for much longer , " he added .
verhofstadt said the country needed fundamental state reform , adding that the country 's problems could be solved " when everyone recognized the seriousness of the situation and took responsibility . "
he said he wanted to reach an agreement on devolution and tackle urgent social and economic issues that go far beyond the authority of a caretaker government .
situation remains unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would-be pm leterme is of mixed parentage himself , but he has not built bridges between the two communities but verhofstadt , who was ousted in the june elections after eight years in office , did not give details of his plans or how the 2008 budget could be drafted under these circumstances .
belgium 's flemish majority wants more autonomy for the relatively rich region of flanders , a move seen as a political and financial threat in the french-speaking region of wallonia .
many flemish voters believe that their taxes - amongst the highest in the world - are used to subsidize the social security system in the south .
verhofstadt said the country 's image abroad was suffering because of the ongoing crisis .
business leaders say potential foreign investors will be driven away .
the liberal vld leader managed to largely keep a lid on devolution-related issues during his term of office .

" iran was dangerous , iran is dangerous and iran will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon , " bush told a white house press conference . the international atomic agency director general mohamed el baradei said on tuesday , nov .
4 , that the report tallied with the iaea investigation into the country 's nuclear program . a number of european countries , including germany , have already welcomed the us report as confirming that europe 's strategy of negotiations plus sanctions is keeping tehran in line with international demands . the nie report confirmed " the double approach chosen by the international community of incentives and measures from the united nations security council was right , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a statement released monday , nov .
3 . britain 's foreign ministry also said the carrot-and-stick approach was working to keep iran in line with international demands . " the report 's conclusions justify the action already taken by the international community to get to the bottom of iran 's nuclear program and to increase pressure on the regime to stop its enrichment and reprocessing activities , " a british foreign ministry spokeswoman told the afp news agency . international pressure successful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the double approach of sanctions and incentives needed to continue the national intelligence estimate , a consensus of all 16 us spy agencies , said in a report monday that it was confident that iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in late 2003 .
nie cited " moderate confidence " that the program had not been restarted as of mid-2007 . tehran could have the technical ability to build a nuclear weapon between 2010 and 2015 , but " we do not know if it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons , " the report stated . iran appears " less determined to develop nuclear weapons than we have been judging since 2005 , " the nie said .
the report concluded that it was likely that tehran had halted its nuclear program in response to international pressure , which " suggests that iran may be more vulnerable to influence on the issue than we judged previously . " europe 's mixed approach to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military work at iran 's nuclear facilities may have stopped four years ago the united nations security council has brought sanctions against iran twice for refusing to discontinue its uranium enrichment program .
enriched uranium can be used to build nuclear weapons , but iran has consistently said its program is purely used for civilian purposes . the five permanent members of the security council - britain , china , france , russia and the usa - plus germany met in paris over the weekend to discuss a third sanctions resolution but did not reach an agreement . in 2004 and 2005 , germany , along with britain and france , led a diplomatic initiative with tehran in which trade and other economic incentives were discussed in exchange for a halt on the uranium enrichment program . while the so-called eu-3 has since supported un-led sanctions against iran , it has also remained open to a more diplomatic strategy . report may be face-saver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran welcomed the report , saying it confirmed iran 's nuclear plans are peaceful us national security advisor stephen hadley said the report should n't be taken as a reason to lose vigilance . " there 's going to be a tendency of a lot of people to say : ' the problem 's less bad that we thought , let 's relax , " ' said hadley .
" our view is that would be a mistake . " hadley denied that us rhetoric on iran had escalated to step up international pressure .
in october , us president george w. bush raised the specters of " world war iii " or a " nuclear holocaust " occurring should teheran build a nuclear bomb . the estimate could have been a " face saving decision " because bush is not willing to strike militarily and has exhausted the efforts at the un security council , alex vatanka of the middle east institute told the dpa news agency .

six months after parliamentary elections , belgium remains without a government .
outgoing pm guy verhofstadt has launched mediation talks with the country 's main parties after belgian king albert approached him for help . verhofstadt hopes to mend the rupture between francophone and flemish-speaking leaders after coalition talks to form a new government collapsed last week .
this comes after king albert ii summoned verhofstadt on monday and asked him , according to a statement issued by the palace , " to inform the king on the way to get out of the impasse very swiftly , and to make all the contacts necessary to do so . "
belgian television reports have interpreted the belgian king 's move as bestowing “ urgent ” powers , including dealing with “ international matters , ” on prime minister guy verhofstadt .
but this would be in violation of the belgian constitution which does not provide for extended powers to governments without a parliamentary majority .
flemish christian democrat leader yves leterme , who was expected to succeed verhofstadt , told the king on saturday that he was unable to form a coalition after failing to reach a deal over how much power should be devolved to the regions .
haunted by the specter of division along linguistic lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's image is beginning to look a little tattered the deadlock has sparked fears that belgium would split into the flemish and french-speaking parts .
" our country is facing one of the most severe political crises of the last decades , " verhofstadt told a news conference in brussels .
" this situation can not and must not continue for much longer , " he added .
verhofstadt said the country needed fundamental state reform , adding that the country 's problems could be solved " when everyone recognized the seriousness of the situation and took responsibility . "
he said he wanted to reach an agreement on devolution and tackle urgent social and economic issues that go far beyond the authority of a caretaker government .
situation remains unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would-be pm leterme is of mixed parentage himself , but he has not built bridges between the two communities but verhofstadt , who was ousted in the june elections after eight years in office , did not give details of his plans or how the 2008 budget could be drafted under these circumstances .
belgium 's flemish majority wants more autonomy for the relatively rich region of flanders , a move seen as a political and financial threat in the french-speaking region of wallonia .
many flemish voters believe that their taxes - amongst the highest in the world - are used to subsidize the social security system in the south .
verhofstadt said the country 's image abroad was suffering because of the ongoing crisis .
business leaders say potential foreign investors will be driven away .
the liberal vld leader managed to largely keep a lid on devolution-related issues during his term of office .
but he was punished for that at the polls by flemish voters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 04.12.2007 sarkozy 's congratulatory call to putin irks eu members großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one human rights activist called sarkozy 's call to putin " realpolitik " the european union was up in arms on tuesday after french president nicolas sarkozy called russian president vladimir putin to congratulate him on sunday 's elections .
most of the eu has been at odds with putin . the french leader nicolas sarkozy 's gesture clearly showed he was not toeing the european union line and put him at odds with neighbor and close ally germany .
the german government had called sunday 's parliamentary elections in russia " neither free , fair nor democratic " by western standards . other eu governments have also voiced concern over reports of election irregularities and indeed , the european union 's portuguese presidency said tuesday that russia 's legislative election " did not meet international standards and commitments . " the european union " regrets ... that there were many reports and allegations of media restrictions as well as harassment of opposition parties and ngos in the run up to the elections and on election day , " the presidency said in a statement , as reported by afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso other western goverenments also criticized the polls . sarkozy contradicted his own foreign ministry sarkozy 's telephone call to president putin - the leading candidate for russia 's united party that won an landslide victory , securing 315 of 450 seats in parliament - contradicted not only the eu 's stance , but also his own foreign ministry 's criticism of the conduct of the poll .
the ministry had called for investigations into the allegations of fraud . human rights groups were outraged at sarkozy 's move . " sarkozy 's reaction , which was totally isolated , is both incomprehensible and scandalous , " patrick baudouin , president of the paris-based international federation of human rights -lrb- fidh -rrb- , told afp . " this is a bad blow to democrats and human rights campaigners in russia . " " to give putin your support after unamimously condemned elections , is to compromise yourself and go against official policy " on human rights , he added . he called sarkozy 's call an " excess of zeal that was absolutely unnecessary " and said it was not to france 's credit . eu differs on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin 's party won over 60 percent of the parliamentary vote even all the eu members themselves do not agree about how to handle russia . diplomats told reuters reporters that the eu 's portuguese presidency was seeking agreement on monday among the 27 member states on a joint statement on the russian elections but that it was a challenge to get consensus on the text . on tuesday , the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , urged moscow to address the accusations of electoral irregularities in the russian poll . " everybody is aware that observers have denounced irregularities , " said johannes laitenberger , spokesman for the commission . " it is in the interest of russia to completely clarify all these allegations , " he told reporters in brussels , ac cited by afp . one diplomat told reuters that a draft of an eu statement that circulated on monday criticized moscow 's treatment of the election monitoring office of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and urged the russian government to permit osce monitors into the country to do a long-term survey in advance of a presidential election in march . economic interests at stake ? despite allegations that the opposition had been muzzled and ballots were rigged in the russian vote , the differing european responses to the election highlight the eu 's general problems in speaking with a single voice towards russia , which is its major energy supplier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chess champ kasparov crossed out all parties on his ballot sarkozy , for his part , has been critical of moscow 's handling of human rights , but opposition politicians have nonetheless accused him of putting economic interests above rights . daniele artur , russia expert at amnesty international in france , told afp that she was " very disappointed by -lsb- sarkozy 's -rsb- reaction " to sunday 's elections . " this is sheer realpolitik .
and yet we could have afforded to be much firmer , " she said . the eu similarly backpedaled last week when the portuguese presidency put out a critical statement three days after the arrest of opposition activists in russia , including former world chess champion garry kasparov .
it soon withdrew the statement and issued a milder version without explanation , reuters reported . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most of the eu has been at odds with putin . the french leader nicolas sarkozy 's gesture clearly showed he was not toeing the european union line and put him at odds with neighbor and close ally germany .
the german government had called sunday 's parliamentary elections in russia " neither free , fair nor democratic " by western standards . other eu governments have also voiced concern over reports of election irregularities and indeed , the european union 's portuguese presidency said tuesday that russia 's legislative election " did not meet international standards and commitments . " the european union " regrets ... that there were many reports and allegations of media restrictions as well as harassment of opposition parties and ngos in the run up to the elections and on election day , " the presidency said in a statement , as reported by afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso other western goverenments also criticized the polls . sarkozy contradicted his own foreign ministry sarkozy 's telephone call to president putin - the leading candidate for russia 's united party that won an landslide victory , securing 315 of 450 seats in parliament - contradicted not only the eu 's stance , but also his own foreign ministry 's criticism of the conduct of the poll .
the ministry had called for investigations into the allegations of fraud . human rights groups were outraged at sarkozy 's move .

" this is a bad blow to democrats and human rights campaigners in russia . " " to give putin your support after unamimously condemned elections , is to compromise yourself and go against official policy " on human rights , he added . he called sarkozy 's call an " excess of zeal that was absolutely unnecessary " and said it was not to france 's credit . eu differs on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin 's party won over 60 percent of the parliamentary vote even all the eu members themselves do not agree about how to handle russia . diplomats told reuters reporters that the eu 's portuguese presidency was seeking agreement on monday among the 27 member states on a joint statement on the russian elections but that it was a challenge to get consensus on the text . on tuesday , the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , urged moscow to address the accusations of electoral irregularities in the russian poll . " everybody is aware that observers have denounced irregularities , " said johannes laitenberger , spokesman for the commission . " it is in the interest of russia to completely clarify all these allegations , " he told reporters in brussels , ac cited by afp . one diplomat told reuters that a draft of an eu statement that circulated on monday criticized moscow 's treatment of the election monitoring office of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and urged the russian government to permit osce monitors into the country to do a long-term survey in advance of a presidential election in march . economic interests at stake ? despite allegations that the opposition had been muzzled and ballots were rigged in the russian vote , the differing european responses to the election highlight the eu 's general problems in speaking with a single voice towards russia , which is its major energy supplier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chess champ kasparov crossed out all parties on his ballot sarkozy , for his part , has been critical of moscow 's handling of human rights , but opposition politicians have nonetheless accused him of putting economic interests above rights . daniele artur , russia expert at amnesty international in france , told afp that she was " very disappointed by -lsb- sarkozy 's -rsb- reaction " to sunday 's elections . " this is sheer realpolitik .
and yet we could have afforded to be much firmer , " she said . the eu similarly backpedaled last week when the portuguese presidency put out a critical statement three days after the arrest of opposition activists in russia , including former world chess champion garry kasparov .

in the previous year , it had paid 45.2 million . the wall street journal reported that chief executive wendelin wiedeking alone was paid 68 million euros in compensation last year . the news broke around the same time that german postal workers won a hard-fought battle for a minimum wage of between eight and 9.80 euros an hour .
the announcement underscored an increasing disparity of wealth in europe 's biggest economy . poverty among those who work a study by the hans böckler foundation confirmed this week what many germans had already been feeling : that their buying power is steadily declining in the midst of a robust economic recovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking received nearly 70 million euros in bonuses " the distortion in the distribution of wealth and the rise of poverty among workers are a real problem for the economy and society as a whole , " claus schaefer , author of the study , told afp . at a press conference on tuesday , ekkehard schulz , head of the steel group thyssenkrupp , said : " i share the view of mrs. merkel and mr. köhler , " referring to bonuses paid to mangers . " excesses , especially when it is a question of severance pay , are not timely , and never were … , " he added . schulz himself earned around four million euros in the company 's last fiscal year .
he said he was was " satisfied " with his pay : " i am within the average of dax bosses , " he told afp , in reference to the german index of 30 blue chip groups . porsche , which is not listed on the dax index , earned more money trading derivatives than from selling cars in its fiscal year that ended july 31 .
stock-option transactions contributed a pretax of 3.59 billion euros to the group 's results . total net profit came to 4.242 billion euros , more than three times the result of 1.393 billion one year earlier , as cited by afp . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

poland is a very important partner , and the voice of poland matters , " a buoyant eu commission president jose manuel barroso told journalists in brussels .
when tusk arrived in the commission - the eu 's executive - barroso met him with a beaming smile and an ebullient handshake which would not have been out of place in a christmas grotto .
and tusk replied in kind , referring to a new relationship of trust between his government and the brussels apparatus at least half a dozen times in his opening remarks and joking that he was relieved to have been allowed in after having given a marathon three-hour introductory speech to poland 's parliament 10 days ago .
even barroso 's spokesman , johannes laitenberger , received an ovation when he introduced tusk in polish - a linguistic feat met with cheers and whistles by the large contingent of polish visitors .
a breath of fresh air after kaczynskis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski brothers have been pariahs at the eu it was all a far cry from the tempestuous diplomacy of earlier times .
under tusk 's predecessor , the pugnacious jaroslaw kaczynski , relations between brussels and warsaw strained to breaking point .
in 2007 alone , kaczynski clashed bitterly with the eu over issues ranging from the vote allocated to poland under the new eu reform treaty to the construction of a bypass road through a nature reserve .
and his abrasive defence of polish interests won him few friends in brussels , where he was widely regarded as failing to understand the delicate system of compromises by which the eu functions .
" they seem not to have got the idea of give and take , " one senior brussels diplomat commented , in a reference to kaczynski and his twin brother lech , poland 's current president .
indeed , under the kaczynskis poland seemed set to win the title of europe 's " chief troublemaker , " as the twins threatened to veto a deal on the reform treaty at two successive summits .
tusk victory welcomed with relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk 's election victory caused brussels to sigh with relief tusk 's convincing win in parliamentary elections on october 21 , and his pledge to restore normality to the relationship with brussels , was hailed with relief in the eu 's capital .
" we discussed the future in a spirit of trust - of ' zaufanie , ' to use the polish word , " barroso joked on tuesday , winning a cheer of his own from his audience .
tusk has made trust his government 's watchword , and used the word some 45 times in his first speech .
and while many issues could still dampen the festive spirit - the bypass dispute , cod fishing quotas , energy security , and us plans to site parts of its missile shield in poland , to name but four - both men were convinced that they would no longer spoil the party .
" when we speak openly about things that can become a problem , both sides quickly find solutions , " tusk said .
even the end of the visit raised a cheer as laitenberger wished his audience " goodbye and good luck " in near-faultless polish .
festive goodwill in the capital of europe with the new spirit of cordiality shining through the gloom of a brussels december , both barroso and tusk looked delighted with their christmas message of peace in europe and goodwill to all men .

the report stated that iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 . for nearly 18 months , solana has been trying to persuade the islamic republic to suspend uranium enrichment in exchange for a bundle of political , trade and economic incentives . solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said the national intelligence estimate -lrb- nie -rrb- report " proves that transparency about -lrb- iran 's -rrb- nuclear activities and its intentions are fundamental . " but us president george w. bush said that iran remains a danger and refused to rule out a military attack despite the new findings .

3 . britain 's foreign ministry also said the carrot-and-stick approach was working to keep iran in line with international demands . " the report 's conclusions justify the action already taken by the international community to get to the bottom of iran 's nuclear program and to increase pressure on the regime to stop its enrichment and reprocessing activities , " a british foreign ministry spokeswoman told the afp news agency . international pressure successful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the double approach of sanctions and incentives needed to continue the national intelligence estimate , a consensus of all 16 us spy agencies , said in a report monday that it was confident that iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in late 2003 .

" our view is that would be a mistake . " hadley denied that us rhetoric on iran had escalated to step up international pressure .
in october , us president george w. bush raised the specters of " world war iii " or a " nuclear holocaust " occurring should teheran build a nuclear bomb . the estimate could have been a " face saving decision " because bush is not willing to strike militarily and has exhausted the efforts at the un security council , alex vatanka of the middle east institute told the dpa news agency .

jürgen klinsmann is being looked at to fill the vacancy , but he would face opposition from some fans despite being a great choice , says dw 's nick amies . it would n't be an exaggeration to compare the possibility of former germany coach - and england nemesis - jürgen klinsmann taking over as coach of the three lions to hillary clinton or barak obama becoming president of the united states of america .
in all three hypothetical cases , the most pertinent question remains the same : is the country ready or is that really a step too far ? the possibility of the united states electing a woman or an african-american into the white house is divisive to say the least .
the fact that mrs. clinton and mr. obama are even in the running at this very early stage of the presidential race says something about how attitudes , at least in some parts of the country , have changed in the us .
most of their detractors focus on their policy stances and personality traits rather than their gender or racial background , which is encouraging for a nation that has for centuries tended to view the commander in chief 's job as being reserved for white males only .
if only the same could be said for the opinions and attitudes of some of the england faithful when it comes to the possibility of klinsmann leading england .
still , klinsmann , who led germany to third place in the 2006 world cup and turned down a job offer from the us soccer federation , has hinted he might be interested in occupying the vacant england bench .
klinsi the mold breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi 's and germany 's success has always rankled england fans klinsmann is one of a rare breed ; a german who has endeared himself to the english soccer masses .
his two spells as a tottenham hotspurs player in the 1990 's are credited with rehabilitating the long-held image of conniving , arrogant and - heaven forbid - massively successful germans which had been cultivated through decades of smug tournament victories and much-reveled-in conquests over england .
his self-referential diving celebration after scoring showed a humorous side to the teutonic efficiency that had grated so much with england fans for so long while his contribution in making the premiership the star-studded internationally renowned league it is now can not be underestimated .
his coaching ability is also grudgingly respected on the island .
in his short tenure , klinsmann transformed germany from a nation infamous for grinding out results to a team purring with flair which - as long as that flair was not used to knock england out of any tournament - was appreciated by those english who lamented the lack of invention in their own team .
the german it 's okay to like bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far would klinsi 's popularity in england stretch ?
klinsi is what is commonly known in those circles where such things matter as " an okay german " for his contribution to the premiership and his philosophy of how the game should be played .
it must , however , be said that klinsmann only remains the good german while he is not responsible for any england heartbreak .
all that could change if he is made england coach .
the england job carries the most pressure of any managerial position in international soccer .
the expectation among the fans is hysterically high and probably unachievable .
despite going 41 years without a title since their only tournament success , fans always believe it is england 's right to win .
to keep these demanding supporters happy and lead england to victory is a hard task for any man , and even more so for a german .
section of fans stuck in the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some england fans would not welcome a german coach believe what you want about england 's notorious fans being rehabilitated or locked-up out of harms way .
the truth is there are still elements which sing " ten german bombers " , chant along to the " dambusters " theme and claim in song that hitler was testicularly-challenged .
animosity towards the germans arising from world war ii is sadly still alive in some less-enlightened quarters and the appointment of one who has been a hate-figure in his time as a player would certainly test how far the england faithful have come in their sensitivity training .
it is only six years ago that england got its first foreign coach .
the uproar over appointing an unassuming swede would be nothing compared to the narrow-minded maelstrom that would accompany the naming of a formerly cocky german as national coach .
right now , england fans are holding out in the hope that former chelsea coach jose mourinho will take charge .
while many are offering prayers that the special one will ride to their rescue , few are considering a future where jürgen klinsmann beams out at them from the dug-out in his standard fa blazer .
put common sense ahead of prejudice but they should .
those implications could be a team playing to its full potential under a young and visionary coach ; an england team feared across the world , not laughed at , and a team ready to put over four decades of underachievement behind it .
if klinsmann gets the job and people still have a problem with him being german while he is winning matches and tournaments for england , then something is very , very wrong .

but the results are once again fanning the flames of controversy in the ongoing debate over school reform . germany reached 13th place out of 57 countries tested in the results of the latest program for international student assessment - pisa - study , officially published on tuesday , nov .
4 . but any joy over improvement in standing was damped when the test 's creator at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , andreas schleicher , last week told the press that the improvement was more likely due to changes in the way the test was structured , than to any actual improvement on the part of german students . the discussion over germany 's school performance has been raging since 2000 , when the country landed in the bottom third of the rankings of 32 countries , and continued through 2003 , when germany still rated 18th in a list of 40 countries . those rankings " certainly served to alert the public of just how different our perception of the system was compared with its stance in the real world , " said rainer lehmann , a professor of education research at berlin 's humboldt university . indeed , the country 's mediocre ranking back in 2000 caught most germans , who thought highly of their school system , off guard .
the term pisa has since become a household word , reflecting the study 's resonance in the media . debate over studies ' relevance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could be moving towards a comprehensive system the debate has raised questions about the general relevance of comparative educational testing , pitting those who see tests as a useful comparative tool against those who focus on the shortcomings of big , international studies . most experts agree that big international studies have an important place in education policy . " the idea is that you have some natural variance between educational systems , and you try to capitalize upon this by looking at different influences , " said lehmann .
" the goal is to learn from other systems . " michael becker-mrotzeck , a professor in the department of language education at cologne university , agreed . " in principle , -lrb- these studies -rrb- tell us useful information about our school system , " he said .
" for instance , from the first and second pisa studies , germans learned that in no other country does social status of the parents have such a big effect on the academic success of their children . " in addition , the earlier studies showed weakness in certain basic competencies , like reading , math and science .
as a result , he said , schools have shifted focus - with visible results . in november an international test of elementary school competency showed that reading had " clearly improved . " " our education system reacted , quickly , " to the deficits uncovered by pisa , becker-mrotzeck said .
this led to the development of a spate of learning materials , and a host of creative concepts , such as reading nights and author-readings in schools . germany coming out of anti-testing era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has now accepted testing procedures unlike in the uk and the us , where educational testing has long been a buzzword and where standardized tests are routinely used to monitoring how much information is being passed from teachers to students , germany is fairly new to the game . after a spate of general tests in the early 70s showed similar weaknesses to those rediscovered by pisa in 2001 , the country underwent an anti-testing backlash that lasted a good 20 years . only recently have policymakers reinstated mass comparative testing in schools .
today , german schoolchildren face four " general " exams over the course of their 13 year school career - in 3rd , 8th , 10th and at the end of the 12th grade , becker-mrotzeck explained . " it is different than in the us or england , where they might have such tests twice a year , " said becker-mrozeck .
" i do n't think at that level germany is in danger of doing what they call in america , ' teaching to the test . " ' still , learning does n't take place via testing , said renate hendricks , a social democrat parliamentarian for the state of north-rhine westphalia , who specializes in education policy . " i think you can test what a person can do , but learning comes through motivation , curiosity , interest , and an emotional relationship to the teacher , " among other things , hendricks said . hendricks did acknowledge that comparative studies are useful for giving feedback aimed at improving schools .
" but if politicians are incapable of using the information they get to make positive change , then no , these studies are not useful , " she said . disparities in german system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pisa studies are flawed , say some she added that when the figures are broken down by social background , immense disparities in the german system are still evident in the newest pisa results . " now it is clear we have to do something , " she said .
" these politicians have to take off their rose-colored glasses .
or black glasses , or whatever they are wearing . " meanwhile , still other critics say the whole structure of pisa - indeed , the idea of widespread comparative international testing itself - is flawed .
the pisa study was also designed with " unrealistic goals , " according to joachim wuttke , a munich-based physicist , statistician and math teacher who has written two articles critiquing the methodology behind pisa and similar tests . tests weighted against germany , says expert " the ranking of states on a one-dimensional scale is not serious , " he said .
" you can construct tests that give different results , and this one is made in a way that shows germany is mediocre . " various factors can affect outcome .
the type of school system a country has is just one potential factor , he said , adding that the spectrum of students tested also differed from country to country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : differences in studies across europe are a problem " germany took great pains to get a representative sample of students , testing even in schools for special-needs students , " he said .
" meanwhile , finland excluded students with dyslexia from the test .
you ca n't do an international comparison of reading difficulties when you exclude some students . " ultimately , wuttke said tests like pisa " do n't test the system , they test the population . "
he pointed out that in highest-ranking finland , there are almost no immigrants . " if you compared results of all native students only , then finland is no longer at the top of the list , " he said . germany shocked out of stupor one thing the pisa proponents seem to agree on is that the results from 2001 shocked the country into a back-to-basics frenzy . " i see the main advantage of this test as having reoriented schools toward cognitive growth , " said humboldt university 's lehmann .
" every year you have a new set of educational goals seems to be defined - family education , sexual education , peace education , gender education ... but the core business seems to be forgotten . " but even there , wuttke sees pisa as more of a lost opportunity than a gain . " reading , math and science are important subjects , but it should n't come at the expense of other things like sports and music , " he said .
" i happen to think they are just as important . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 . but any joy over improvement in standing was damped when the test 's creator at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , andreas schleicher , last week told the press that the improvement was more likely due to changes in the way the test was structured , than to any actual improvement on the part of german students . the discussion over germany 's school performance has been raging since 2000 , when the country landed in the bottom third of the rankings of 32 countries , and continued through 2003 , when germany still rated 18th in a list of 40 countries . those rankings " certainly served to alert the public of just how different our perception of the system was compared with its stance in the real world , " said rainer lehmann , a professor of education research at berlin 's humboldt university . indeed , the country 's mediocre ranking back in 2000 caught most germans , who thought highly of their school system , off guard .
the term pisa has since become a household word , reflecting the study 's resonance in the media . debate over studies ' relevance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could be moving towards a comprehensive system the debate has raised questions about the general relevance of comparative educational testing , pitting those who see tests as a useful comparative tool against those who focus on the shortcomings of big , international studies . most experts agree that big international studies have an important place in education policy . " the idea is that you have some natural variance between educational systems , and you try to capitalize upon this by looking at different influences , " said lehmann .
" the goal is to learn from other systems . " michael becker-mrotzeck , a professor in the department of language education at cologne university , agreed . " in principle , -lrb- these studies -rrb- tell us useful information about our school system , " he said .
" for instance , from the first and second pisa studies , germans learned that in no other country does social status of the parents have such a big effect on the academic success of their children . " in addition , the earlier studies showed weakness in certain basic competencies , like reading , math and science .
as a result , he said , schools have shifted focus - with visible results . in november an international test of elementary school competency showed that reading had " clearly improved . " " our education system reacted , quickly , " to the deficits uncovered by pisa , becker-mrotzeck said .
this led to the development of a spate of learning materials , and a host of creative concepts , such as reading nights and author-readings in schools . germany coming out of anti-testing era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has now accepted testing procedures unlike in the uk and the us , where educational testing has long been a buzzword and where standardized tests are routinely used to monitoring how much information is being passed from teachers to students , germany is fairly new to the game . after a spate of general tests in the early 70s showed similar weaknesses to those rediscovered by pisa in 2001 , the country underwent an anti-testing backlash that lasted a good 20 years . only recently have policymakers reinstated mass comparative testing in schools .
today , german schoolchildren face four " general " exams over the course of their 13 year school career - in 3rd , 8th , 10th and at the end of the 12th grade , becker-mrotzeck explained . " it is different than in the us or england , where they might have such tests twice a year , " said becker-mrozeck .
" i do n't think at that level germany is in danger of doing what they call in america , ' teaching to the test . " ' still , learning does n't take place via testing , said renate hendricks , a social democrat parliamentarian for the state of north-rhine westphalia , who specializes in education policy . " i think you can test what a person can do , but learning comes through motivation , curiosity , interest , and an emotional relationship to the teacher , " among other things , hendricks said . hendricks did acknowledge that comparative studies are useful for giving feedback aimed at improving schools .
" but if politicians are incapable of using the information they get to make positive change , then no , these studies are not useful , " she said . disparities in german system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pisa studies are flawed , say some she added that when the figures are broken down by social background , immense disparities in the german system are still evident in the newest pisa results . " now it is clear we have to do something , " she said .
" these politicians have to take off their rose-colored glasses .
or black glasses , or whatever they are wearing . " meanwhile , still other critics say the whole structure of pisa - indeed , the idea of widespread comparative international testing itself - is flawed .
the pisa study was also designed with " unrealistic goals , " according to joachim wuttke , a munich-based physicist , statistician and math teacher who has written two articles critiquing the methodology behind pisa and similar tests . tests weighted against germany , says expert " the ranking of states on a one-dimensional scale is not serious , " he said .
" you can construct tests that give different results , and this one is made in a way that shows germany is mediocre . " various factors can affect outcome .
the type of school system a country has is just one potential factor , he said , adding that the spectrum of students tested also differed from country to country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : differences in studies across europe are a problem " germany took great pains to get a representative sample of students , testing even in schools for special-needs students , " he said .
" meanwhile , finland excluded students with dyslexia from the test .
you ca n't do an international comparison of reading difficulties when you exclude some students . " ultimately , wuttke said tests like pisa " do n't test the system , they test the population . "
he pointed out that in highest-ranking finland , there are almost no immigrants . " if you compared results of all native students only , then finland is no longer at the top of the list , " he said . germany shocked out of stupor one thing the pisa proponents seem to agree on is that the results from 2001 shocked the country into a back-to-basics frenzy . " i see the main advantage of this test as having reoriented schools toward cognitive growth , " said humboldt university 's lehmann .
" every year you have a new set of educational goals seems to be defined - family education , sexual education , peace education , gender education ... but the core business seems to be forgotten . " but even there , wuttke sees pisa as more of a lost opportunity than a gain . " reading , math and science are important subjects , but it should n't come at the expense of other things like sports and music , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internationals -pipe- 04.12.2007 klinsi the " good german " could be england 's wake-up call großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann 's passion and management skills should be the issue , not his nationality could a german really become coach of fierce rivals england ?
jürgen klinsmann is being looked at to fill the vacancy , but he would face opposition from some fans despite being a great choice , says dw 's nick amies . it would n't be an exaggeration to compare the possibility of former germany coach - and england nemesis - jürgen klinsmann taking over as coach of the three lions to hillary clinton or barak obama becoming president of the united states of america .
in all three hypothetical cases , the most pertinent question remains the same : is the country ready or is that really a step too far ? the possibility of the united states electing a woman or an african-american into the white house is divisive to say the least .
the fact that mrs. clinton and mr. obama are even in the running at this very early stage of the presidential race says something about how attitudes , at least in some parts of the country , have changed in the us .
most of their detractors focus on their policy stances and personality traits rather than their gender or racial background , which is encouraging for a nation that has for centuries tended to view the commander in chief 's job as being reserved for white males only .
if only the same could be said for the opinions and attitudes of some of the england faithful when it comes to the possibility of klinsmann leading england .
still , klinsmann , who led germany to third place in the 2006 world cup and turned down a job offer from the us soccer federation , has hinted he might be interested in occupying the vacant england bench .
klinsi the mold breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi 's and germany 's success has always rankled england fans klinsmann is one of a rare breed ; a german who has endeared himself to the english soccer masses .
his two spells as a tottenham hotspurs player in the 1990 's are credited with rehabilitating the long-held image of conniving , arrogant and - heaven forbid - massively successful germans which had been cultivated through decades of smug tournament victories and much-reveled-in conquests over england .

klinsi is what is commonly known in those circles where such things matter as " an okay german " for his contribution to the premiership and his philosophy of how the game should be played .
it must , however , be said that klinsmann only remains the good german while he is not responsible for any england heartbreak .
all that could change if he is made england coach .
the england job carries the most pressure of any managerial position in international soccer .
the expectation among the fans is hysterically high and probably unachievable .

jürgen klinsmann is being looked at to fill the vacancy , but he would face opposition from some fans despite being a great choice , says dw 's nick amies . it would n't be an exaggeration to compare the possibility of former germany coach - and england nemesis - jürgen klinsmann taking over as coach of the three lions to hillary clinton or barak obama becoming president of the united states of america .
in all three hypothetical cases , the most pertinent question remains the same : is the country ready or is that really a step too far ? the possibility of the united states electing a woman or an african-american into the white house is divisive to say the least .
the fact that mrs. clinton and mr. obama are even in the running at this very early stage of the presidential race says something about how attitudes , at least in some parts of the country , have changed in the us .
most of their detractors focus on their policy stances and personality traits rather than their gender or racial background , which is encouraging for a nation that has for centuries tended to view the commander in chief 's job as being reserved for white males only .
if only the same could be said for the opinions and attitudes of some of the england faithful when it comes to the possibility of klinsmann leading england .
still , klinsmann , who led germany to third place in the 2006 world cup and turned down a job offer from the us soccer federation , has hinted he might be interested in occupying the vacant england bench .
klinsi the mold breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi 's and germany 's success has always rankled england fans klinsmann is one of a rare breed ; a german who has endeared himself to the english soccer masses .
his two spells as a tottenham hotspurs player in the 1990 's are credited with rehabilitating the long-held image of conniving , arrogant and - heaven forbid - massively successful germans which had been cultivated through decades of smug tournament victories and much-reveled-in conquests over england .
his self-referential diving celebration after scoring showed a humorous side to the teutonic efficiency that had grated so much with england fans for so long while his contribution in making the premiership the star-studded internationally renowned league it is now can not be underestimated .
his coaching ability is also grudgingly respected on the island .
in his short tenure , klinsmann transformed germany from a nation infamous for grinding out results to a team purring with flair which - as long as that flair was not used to knock england out of any tournament - was appreciated by those english who lamented the lack of invention in their own team .

" it 's a real pleasure to receive my good friend donald tusk ...
poland is a very important partner , and the voice of poland matters , " a buoyant eu commission president jose manuel barroso told journalists in brussels .
when tusk arrived in the commission - the eu 's executive - barroso met him with a beaming smile and an ebullient handshake which would not have been out of place in a christmas grotto .
and tusk replied in kind , referring to a new relationship of trust between his government and the brussels apparatus at least half a dozen times in his opening remarks and joking that he was relieved to have been allowed in after having given a marathon three-hour introductory speech to poland 's parliament 10 days ago .
even barroso 's spokesman , johannes laitenberger , received an ovation when he introduced tusk in polish - a linguistic feat met with cheers and whistles by the large contingent of polish visitors .
a breath of fresh air after kaczynskis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski brothers have been pariahs at the eu it was all a far cry from the tempestuous diplomacy of earlier times .
under tusk 's predecessor , the pugnacious jaroslaw kaczynski , relations between brussels and warsaw strained to breaking point .
in 2007 alone , kaczynski clashed bitterly with the eu over issues ranging from the vote allocated to poland under the new eu reform treaty to the construction of a bypass road through a nature reserve .
and his abrasive defence of polish interests won him few friends in brussels , where he was widely regarded as failing to understand the delicate system of compromises by which the eu functions .
" they seem not to have got the idea of give and take , " one senior brussels diplomat commented , in a reference to kaczynski and his twin brother lech , poland 's current president .
indeed , under the kaczynskis poland seemed set to win the title of europe 's " chief troublemaker , " as the twins threatened to veto a deal on the reform treaty at two successive summits .
tusk victory welcomed with relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk 's election victory caused brussels to sigh with relief tusk 's convincing win in parliamentary elections on october 21 , and his pledge to restore normality to the relationship with brussels , was hailed with relief in the eu 's capital .
" we discussed the future in a spirit of trust - of ' zaufanie , ' to use the polish word , " barroso joked on tuesday , winning a cheer of his own from his audience .
tusk has made trust his government 's watchword , and used the word some 45 times in his first speech .
and while many issues could still dampen the festive spirit - the bypass dispute , cod fishing quotas , energy security , and us plans to site parts of its missile shield in poland , to name but four - both men were convinced that they would no longer spoil the party .
" when we speak openly about things that can become a problem , both sides quickly find solutions , " tusk said .
even the end of the visit raised a cheer as laitenberger wished his audience " goodbye and good luck " in near-faultless polish .
festive goodwill in the capital of europe with the new spirit of cordiality shining through the gloom of a brussels december , both barroso and tusk looked delighted with their christmas message of peace in europe and goodwill to all men .

but the results are once again fanning the flames of controversy in the ongoing debate over school reform . germany reached 13th place out of 57 countries tested in the results of the latest program for international student assessment - pisa - study , officially published on tuesday , nov .
4 . but any joy over improvement in standing was damped when the test 's creator at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , andreas schleicher , last week told the press that the improvement was more likely due to changes in the way the test was structured , than to any actual improvement on the part of german students . the discussion over germany 's school performance has been raging since 2000 , when the country landed in the bottom third of the rankings of 32 countries , and continued through 2003 , when germany still rated 18th in a list of 40 countries . those rankings " certainly served to alert the public of just how different our perception of the system was compared with its stance in the real world , " said rainer lehmann , a professor of education research at berlin 's humboldt university . indeed , the country 's mediocre ranking back in 2000 caught most germans , who thought highly of their school system , off guard .
the term pisa has since become a household word , reflecting the study 's resonance in the media . debate over studies ' relevance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could be moving towards a comprehensive system the debate has raised questions about the general relevance of comparative educational testing , pitting those who see tests as a useful comparative tool against those who focus on the shortcomings of big , international studies . most experts agree that big international studies have an important place in education policy . " the idea is that you have some natural variance between educational systems , and you try to capitalize upon this by looking at different influences , " said lehmann .
" the goal is to learn from other systems . " michael becker-mrotzeck , a professor in the department of language education at cologne university , agreed . " in principle , -lrb- these studies -rrb- tell us useful information about our school system , " he said .
" for instance , from the first and second pisa studies , germans learned that in no other country does social status of the parents have such a big effect on the academic success of their children . " in addition , the earlier studies showed weakness in certain basic competencies , like reading , math and science .
as a result , he said , schools have shifted focus - with visible results . in november an international test of elementary school competency showed that reading had " clearly improved . " " our education system reacted , quickly , " to the deficits uncovered by pisa , becker-mrotzeck said .
this led to the development of a spate of learning materials , and a host of creative concepts , such as reading nights and author-readings in schools . germany coming out of anti-testing era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has now accepted testing procedures unlike in the uk and the us , where educational testing has long been a buzzword and where standardized tests are routinely used to monitoring how much information is being passed from teachers to students , germany is fairly new to the game . after a spate of general tests in the early 70s showed similar weaknesses to those rediscovered by pisa in 2001 , the country underwent an anti-testing backlash that lasted a good 20 years . only recently have policymakers reinstated mass comparative testing in schools .
today , german schoolchildren face four " general " exams over the course of their 13 year school career - in 3rd , 8th , 10th and at the end of the 12th grade , becker-mrotzeck explained . " it is different than in the us or england , where they might have such tests twice a year , " said becker-mrozeck .
" i do n't think at that level germany is in danger of doing what they call in america , ' teaching to the test . " ' still , learning does n't take place via testing , said renate hendricks , a social democrat parliamentarian for the state of north-rhine westphalia , who specializes in education policy . " i think you can test what a person can do , but learning comes through motivation , curiosity , interest , and an emotional relationship to the teacher , " among other things , hendricks said . hendricks did acknowledge that comparative studies are useful for giving feedback aimed at improving schools .
" but if politicians are incapable of using the information they get to make positive change , then no , these studies are not useful , " she said . disparities in german system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pisa studies are flawed , say some she added that when the figures are broken down by social background , immense disparities in the german system are still evident in the newest pisa results . " now it is clear we have to do something , " she said .
" these politicians have to take off their rose-colored glasses .
or black glasses , or whatever they are wearing . " meanwhile , still other critics say the whole structure of pisa - indeed , the idea of widespread comparative international testing itself - is flawed .
the pisa study was also designed with " unrealistic goals , " according to joachim wuttke , a munich-based physicist , statistician and math teacher who has written two articles critiquing the methodology behind pisa and similar tests . tests weighted against germany , says expert " the ranking of states on a one-dimensional scale is not serious , " he said .
" you can construct tests that give different results , and this one is made in a way that shows germany is mediocre . " various factors can affect outcome .
the type of school system a country has is just one potential factor , he said , adding that the spectrum of students tested also differed from country to country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : differences in studies across europe are a problem " germany took great pains to get a representative sample of students , testing even in schools for special-needs students , " he said .
" meanwhile , finland excluded students with dyslexia from the test .
you ca n't do an international comparison of reading difficulties when you exclude some students . " ultimately , wuttke said tests like pisa " do n't test the system , they test the population . "
he pointed out that in highest-ranking finland , there are almost no immigrants . " if you compared results of all native students only , then finland is no longer at the top of the list , " he said . germany shocked out of stupor one thing the pisa proponents seem to agree on is that the results from 2001 shocked the country into a back-to-basics frenzy . " i see the main advantage of this test as having reoriented schools toward cognitive growth , " said humboldt university 's lehmann .
" every year you have a new set of educational goals seems to be defined - family education , sexual education , peace education , gender education ... but the core business seems to be forgotten . " but even there , wuttke sees pisa as more of a lost opportunity than a gain . " reading , math and science are important subjects , but it should n't come at the expense of other things like sports and music , " he said .
" i happen to think they are just as important . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jürgen klinsmann is being looked at to fill the vacancy , but he would face opposition from some fans despite being a great choice , says dw 's nick amies . it would n't be an exaggeration to compare the possibility of former germany coach - and england nemesis - jürgen klinsmann taking over as coach of the three lions to hillary clinton or barak obama becoming president of the united states of america .
in all three hypothetical cases , the most pertinent question remains the same : is the country ready or is that really a step too far ? the possibility of the united states electing a woman or an african-american into the white house is divisive to say the least .
the fact that mrs. clinton and mr. obama are even in the running at this very early stage of the presidential race says something about how attitudes , at least in some parts of the country , have changed in the us .
most of their detractors focus on their policy stances and personality traits rather than their gender or racial background , which is encouraging for a nation that has for centuries tended to view the commander in chief 's job as being reserved for white males only .
if only the same could be said for the opinions and attitudes of some of the england faithful when it comes to the possibility of klinsmann leading england .
still , klinsmann , who led germany to third place in the 2006 world cup and turned down a job offer from the us soccer federation , has hinted he might be interested in occupying the vacant england bench .
klinsi the mold breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi 's and germany 's success has always rankled england fans klinsmann is one of a rare breed ; a german who has endeared himself to the english soccer masses .
his two spells as a tottenham hotspurs player in the 1990 's are credited with rehabilitating the long-held image of conniving , arrogant and - heaven forbid - massively successful germans which had been cultivated through decades of smug tournament victories and much-reveled-in conquests over england .
his self-referential diving celebration after scoring showed a humorous side to the teutonic efficiency that had grated so much with england fans for so long while his contribution in making the premiership the star-studded internationally renowned league it is now can not be underestimated .
his coaching ability is also grudgingly respected on the island .
in his short tenure , klinsmann transformed germany from a nation infamous for grinding out results to a team purring with flair which - as long as that flair was not used to knock england out of any tournament - was appreciated by those english who lamented the lack of invention in their own team .
the german it 's okay to like bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far would klinsi 's popularity in england stretch ?
klinsi is what is commonly known in those circles where such things matter as " an okay german " for his contribution to the premiership and his philosophy of how the game should be played .
it must , however , be said that klinsmann only remains the good german while he is not responsible for any england heartbreak .
all that could change if he is made england coach .
the england job carries the most pressure of any managerial position in international soccer .
the expectation among the fans is hysterically high and probably unachievable .
despite going 41 years without a title since their only tournament success , fans always believe it is england 's right to win .
to keep these demanding supporters happy and lead england to victory is a hard task for any man , and even more so for a german .
section of fans stuck in the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some england fans would not welcome a german coach believe what you want about england 's notorious fans being rehabilitated or locked-up out of harms way .
the truth is there are still elements which sing " ten german bombers " , chant along to the " dambusters " theme and claim in song that hitler was testicularly-challenged .
animosity towards the germans arising from world war ii is sadly still alive in some less-enlightened quarters and the appointment of one who has been a hate-figure in his time as a player would certainly test how far the england faithful have come in their sensitivity training .
it is only six years ago that england got its first foreign coach .
the uproar over appointing an unassuming swede would be nothing compared to the narrow-minded maelstrom that would accompany the naming of a formerly cocky german as national coach .
right now , england fans are holding out in the hope that former chelsea coach jose mourinho will take charge .
while many are offering prayers that the special one will ride to their rescue , few are considering a future where jürgen klinsmann beams out at them from the dug-out in his standard fa blazer .
put common sense ahead of prejudice but they should .
those implications could be a team playing to its full potential under a young and visionary coach ; an england team feared across the world , not laughed at , and a team ready to put over four decades of underachievement behind it .
if klinsmann gets the job and people still have a problem with him being german while he is winning matches and tournaments for england , then something is very , very wrong .
for a nation of supporters which craves success as much as england fans do , it should n't matter where their next coach comes from as long as he 's a winner . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the report stated that iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 . for nearly 18 months , solana has been trying to persuade the islamic republic to suspend uranium enrichment in exchange for a bundle of political , trade and economic incentives . solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said the national intelligence estimate -lrb- nie -rrb- report " proves that transparency about -lrb- iran 's -rrb- nuclear activities and its intentions are fundamental . " but us president george w. bush said that iran remains a danger and refused to rule out a military attack despite the new findings . " iran was dangerous , iran is dangerous and iran will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon , " bush told a white house press conference . the international atomic agency director general mohamed el baradei said on tuesday , nov .
4 , that the report tallied with the iaea investigation into the country 's nuclear program . a number of european countries , including germany , have already welcomed the us report as confirming that europe 's strategy of negotiations plus sanctions is keeping tehran in line with international demands . the nie report confirmed " the double approach chosen by the international community of incentives and measures from the united nations security council was right , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a statement released monday , nov .
3 . britain 's foreign ministry also said the carrot-and-stick approach was working to keep iran in line with international demands . " the report 's conclusions justify the action already taken by the international community to get to the bottom of iran 's nuclear program and to increase pressure on the regime to stop its enrichment and reprocessing activities , " a british foreign ministry spokeswoman told the afp news agency . international pressure successful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the double approach of sanctions and incentives needed to continue the national intelligence estimate , a consensus of all 16 us spy agencies , said in a report monday that it was confident that iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in late 2003 .
nie cited " moderate confidence " that the program had not been restarted as of mid-2007 . tehran could have the technical ability to build a nuclear weapon between 2010 and 2015 , but " we do not know if it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons , " the report stated . iran appears " less determined to develop nuclear weapons than we have been judging since 2005 , " the nie said .
the report concluded that it was likely that tehran had halted its nuclear program in response to international pressure , which " suggests that iran may be more vulnerable to influence on the issue than we judged previously . " europe 's mixed approach to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military work at iran 's nuclear facilities may have stopped four years ago the united nations security council has brought sanctions against iran twice for refusing to discontinue its uranium enrichment program .
enriched uranium can be used to build nuclear weapons , but iran has consistently said its program is purely used for civilian purposes . the five permanent members of the security council - britain , china , france , russia and the usa - plus germany met in paris over the weekend to discuss a third sanctions resolution but did not reach an agreement . in 2004 and 2005 , germany , along with britain and france , led a diplomatic initiative with tehran in which trade and other economic incentives were discussed in exchange for a halt on the uranium enrichment program . while the so-called eu-3 has since supported un-led sanctions against iran , it has also remained open to a more diplomatic strategy . report may be face-saver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran welcomed the report , saying it confirmed iran 's nuclear plans are peaceful us national security advisor stephen hadley said the report should n't be taken as a reason to lose vigilance . " there 's going to be a tendency of a lot of people to say : ' the problem 's less bad that we thought , let 's relax , " ' said hadley .
" our view is that would be a mistake . " hadley denied that us rhetoric on iran had escalated to step up international pressure .
in october , us president george w. bush raised the specters of " world war iii " or a " nuclear holocaust " occurring should teheran build a nuclear bomb . the estimate could have been a " face saving decision " because bush is not willing to strike militarily and has exhausted the efforts at the un security council , alex vatanka of the middle east institute told the dpa news agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 04.12.2007 pisa education studies come under examination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people still ca n't get their heads around the pisa testing system germany crept up the rankings in the latest comparative international education study .
but the results are once again fanning the flames of controversy in the ongoing debate over school reform . germany reached 13th place out of 57 countries tested in the results of the latest program for international student assessment - pisa - study , officially published on tuesday , nov .
4 . but any joy over improvement in standing was damped when the test 's creator at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , andreas schleicher , last week told the press that the improvement was more likely due to changes in the way the test was structured , than to any actual improvement on the part of german students . the discussion over germany 's school performance has been raging since 2000 , when the country landed in the bottom third of the rankings of 32 countries , and continued through 2003 , when germany still rated 18th in a list of 40 countries . those rankings " certainly served to alert the public of just how different our perception of the system was compared with its stance in the real world , " said rainer lehmann , a professor of education research at berlin 's humboldt university . indeed , the country 's mediocre ranking back in 2000 caught most germans , who thought highly of their school system , off guard .
the term pisa has since become a household word , reflecting the study 's resonance in the media . debate over studies ' relevance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could be moving towards a comprehensive system the debate has raised questions about the general relevance of comparative educational testing , pitting those who see tests as a useful comparative tool against those who focus on the shortcomings of big , international studies . most experts agree that big international studies have an important place in education policy . " the idea is that you have some natural variance between educational systems , and you try to capitalize upon this by looking at different influences , " said lehmann .
" the goal is to learn from other systems . " michael becker-mrotzeck , a professor in the department of language education at cologne university , agreed . " in principle , -lrb- these studies -rrb- tell us useful information about our school system , " he said .
" for instance , from the first and second pisa studies , germans learned that in no other country does social status of the parents have such a big effect on the academic success of their children . " in addition , the earlier studies showed weakness in certain basic competencies , like reading , math and science .
as a result , he said , schools have shifted focus - with visible results . in november an international test of elementary school competency showed that reading had " clearly improved . " " our education system reacted , quickly , " to the deficits uncovered by pisa , becker-mrotzeck said .
this led to the development of a spate of learning materials , and a host of creative concepts , such as reading nights and author-readings in schools . germany coming out of anti-testing era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has now accepted testing procedures unlike in the uk and the us , where educational testing has long been a buzzword and where standardized tests are routinely used to monitoring how much information is being passed from teachers to students , germany is fairly new to the game . after a spate of general tests in the early 70s showed similar weaknesses to those rediscovered by pisa in 2001 , the country underwent an anti-testing backlash that lasted a good 20 years . only recently have policymakers reinstated mass comparative testing in schools .
today , german schoolchildren face four " general " exams over the course of their 13 year school career - in 3rd , 8th , 10th and at the end of the 12th grade , becker-mrotzeck explained . " it is different than in the us or england , where they might have such tests twice a year , " said becker-mrozeck .
" i do n't think at that level germany is in danger of doing what they call in america , ' teaching to the test . " ' still , learning does n't take place via testing , said renate hendricks , a social democrat parliamentarian for the state of north-rhine westphalia , who specializes in education policy . " i think you can test what a person can do , but learning comes through motivation , curiosity , interest , and an emotional relationship to the teacher , " among other things , hendricks said . hendricks did acknowledge that comparative studies are useful for giving feedback aimed at improving schools .
" but if politicians are incapable of using the information they get to make positive change , then no , these studies are not useful , " she said . disparities in german system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pisa studies are flawed , say some she added that when the figures are broken down by social background , immense disparities in the german system are still evident in the newest pisa results . " now it is clear we have to do something , " she said .
" these politicians have to take off their rose-colored glasses .
or black glasses , or whatever they are wearing . " meanwhile , still other critics say the whole structure of pisa - indeed , the idea of widespread comparative international testing itself - is flawed .
the pisa study was also designed with " unrealistic goals , " according to joachim wuttke , a munich-based physicist , statistician and math teacher who has written two articles critiquing the methodology behind pisa and similar tests . tests weighted against germany , says expert " the ranking of states on a one-dimensional scale is not serious , " he said .
" you can construct tests that give different results , and this one is made in a way that shows germany is mediocre . " various factors can affect outcome .
the type of school system a country has is just one potential factor , he said , adding that the spectrum of students tested also differed from country to country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : differences in studies across europe are a problem " germany took great pains to get a representative sample of students , testing even in schools for special-needs students , " he said .
" meanwhile , finland excluded students with dyslexia from the test .
you ca n't do an international comparison of reading difficulties when you exclude some students . " ultimately , wuttke said tests like pisa " do n't test the system , they test the population . "
he pointed out that in highest-ranking finland , there are almost no immigrants . " if you compared results of all native students only , then finland is no longer at the top of the list , " he said . germany shocked out of stupor one thing the pisa proponents seem to agree on is that the results from 2001 shocked the country into a back-to-basics frenzy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internationals -pipe- 04.12.2007 klinsi the " good german " could be england 's wake-up call großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann 's passion and management skills should be the issue , not his nationality could a german really become coach of fierce rivals england ?
jürgen klinsmann is being looked at to fill the vacancy , but he would face opposition from some fans despite being a great choice , says dw 's nick amies . it would n't be an exaggeration to compare the possibility of former germany coach - and england nemesis - jürgen klinsmann taking over as coach of the three lions to hillary clinton or barak obama becoming president of the united states of america .
in all three hypothetical cases , the most pertinent question remains the same : is the country ready or is that really a step too far ? the possibility of the united states electing a woman or an african-american into the white house is divisive to say the least .
the fact that mrs. clinton and mr. obama are even in the running at this very early stage of the presidential race says something about how attitudes , at least in some parts of the country , have changed in the us .
most of their detractors focus on their policy stances and personality traits rather than their gender or racial background , which is encouraging for a nation that has for centuries tended to view the commander in chief 's job as being reserved for white males only .
if only the same could be said for the opinions and attitudes of some of the england faithful when it comes to the possibility of klinsmann leading england .
still , klinsmann , who led germany to third place in the 2006 world cup and turned down a job offer from the us soccer federation , has hinted he might be interested in occupying the vacant england bench .
klinsi the mold breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi 's and germany 's success has always rankled england fans klinsmann is one of a rare breed ; a german who has endeared himself to the english soccer masses .
his two spells as a tottenham hotspurs player in the 1990 's are credited with rehabilitating the long-held image of conniving , arrogant and - heaven forbid - massively successful germans which had been cultivated through decades of smug tournament victories and much-reveled-in conquests over england .
his self-referential diving celebration after scoring showed a humorous side to the teutonic efficiency that had grated so much with england fans for so long while his contribution in making the premiership the star-studded internationally renowned league it is now can not be underestimated .
his coaching ability is also grudgingly respected on the island .
in his short tenure , klinsmann transformed germany from a nation infamous for grinding out results to a team purring with flair which - as long as that flair was not used to knock england out of any tournament - was appreciated by those english who lamented the lack of invention in their own team .
the german it 's okay to like bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far would klinsi 's popularity in england stretch ?
klinsi is what is commonly known in those circles where such things matter as " an okay german " for his contribution to the premiership and his philosophy of how the game should be played .
it must , however , be said that klinsmann only remains the good german while he is not responsible for any england heartbreak .
all that could change if he is made england coach .
the england job carries the most pressure of any managerial position in international soccer .
the expectation among the fans is hysterically high and probably unachievable .
despite going 41 years without a title since their only tournament success , fans always believe it is england 's right to win .
to keep these demanding supporters happy and lead england to victory is a hard task for any man , and even more so for a german .
section of fans stuck in the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some england fans would not welcome a german coach believe what you want about england 's notorious fans being rehabilitated or locked-up out of harms way .
the truth is there are still elements which sing " ten german bombers " , chant along to the " dambusters " theme and claim in song that hitler was testicularly-challenged .
animosity towards the germans arising from world war ii is sadly still alive in some less-enlightened quarters and the appointment of one who has been a hate-figure in his time as a player would certainly test how far the england faithful have come in their sensitivity training .
it is only six years ago that england got its first foreign coach .
the uproar over appointing an unassuming swede would be nothing compared to the narrow-minded maelstrom that would accompany the naming of a formerly cocky german as national coach .
right now , england fans are holding out in the hope that former chelsea coach jose mourinho will take charge .
while many are offering prayers that the special one will ride to their rescue , few are considering a future where jürgen klinsmann beams out at them from the dug-out in his standard fa blazer .
put common sense ahead of prejudice but they should .
those implications could be a team playing to its full potential under a young and visionary coach ; an england team feared across the world , not laughed at , and a team ready to put over four decades of underachievement behind it .
if klinsmann gets the job and people still have a problem with him being german while he is winning matches and tournaments for england , then something is very , very wrong .
for a nation of supporters which craves success as much as england fans do , it should n't matter where their next coach comes from as long as he 's a winner . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de rumor mill churns out jobs in la , london for klinsmann you used to know where you were with jürgen klinsmann .
until he took over the german national team , it was most likely to be on a beach in california .
these days , klinsi could be anywhere if you listen to soccer rumors .
-lrb- 27.08.2007 -rrb- england , germany push charged soccer rivalry forward the historic combination of pain and pleasure that resurfaces each time germany and england meet on the soccer pitch has kept one of europe 's greatest rivalries alive for decades .

six months after parliamentary elections , belgium remains without a government .
outgoing pm guy verhofstadt has launched mediation talks with the country 's main parties after belgian king albert approached him for help . verhofstadt hopes to mend the rupture between francophone and flemish-speaking leaders after coalition talks to form a new government collapsed last week .
this comes after king albert ii summoned verhofstadt on monday and asked him , according to a statement issued by the palace , " to inform the king on the way to get out of the impasse very swiftly , and to make all the contacts necessary to do so . "
belgian television reports have interpreted the belgian king 's move as bestowing “ urgent ” powers , including dealing with “ international matters , ” on prime minister guy verhofstadt .
but this would be in violation of the belgian constitution which does not provide for extended powers to governments without a parliamentary majority .
flemish christian democrat leader yves leterme , who was expected to succeed verhofstadt , told the king on saturday that he was unable to form a coalition after failing to reach a deal over how much power should be devolved to the regions .
haunted by the specter of division along linguistic lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's image is beginning to look a little tattered the deadlock has sparked fears that belgium would split into the flemish and french-speaking parts .
" our country is facing one of the most severe political crises of the last decades , " verhofstadt told a news conference in brussels .
" this situation can not and must not continue for much longer , " he added .
verhofstadt said the country needed fundamental state reform , adding that the country 's problems could be solved " when everyone recognized the seriousness of the situation and took responsibility . "
he said he wanted to reach an agreement on devolution and tackle urgent social and economic issues that go far beyond the authority of a caretaker government .
situation remains unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would-be pm leterme is of mixed parentage himself , but he has not built bridges between the two communities but verhofstadt , who was ousted in the june elections after eight years in office , did not give details of his plans or how the 2008 budget could be drafted under these circumstances .
belgium 's flemish majority wants more autonomy for the relatively rich region of flanders , a move seen as a political and financial threat in the french-speaking region of wallonia .
many flemish voters believe that their taxes - amongst the highest in the world - are used to subsidize the social security system in the south .
verhofstadt said the country 's image abroad was suffering because of the ongoing crisis .
business leaders say potential foreign investors will be driven away .
the liberal vld leader managed to largely keep a lid on devolution-related issues during his term of office .
but he was punished for that at the polls by flemish voters .
his rival leterme has , however , angered walloons by doubting their ability to learn flemish , as well as confusing the french and belgian national anthems . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in all three hypothetical cases , the most pertinent question remains the same : is the country ready or is that really a step too far ? the possibility of the united states electing a woman or an african-american into the white house is divisive to say the least .

animosity towards the germans arising from world war ii is sadly still alive in some less-enlightened quarters and the appointment of one who has been a hate-figure in his time as a player would certainly test how far the england faithful have come in their sensitivity training .
it is only six years ago that england got its first foreign coach .
the uproar over appointing an unassuming swede would be nothing compared to the narrow-minded maelstrom that would accompany the naming of a formerly cocky german as national coach .
right now , england fans are holding out in the hope that former chelsea coach jose mourinho will take charge .
while many are offering prayers that the special one will ride to their rescue , few are considering a future where jürgen klinsmann beams out at them from the dug-out in his standard fa blazer .
put common sense ahead of prejudice but they should .
those implications could be a team playing to its full potential under a young and visionary coach ; an england team feared across the world , not laughed at , and a team ready to put over four decades of underachievement behind it .
if klinsmann gets the job and people still have a problem with him being german while he is winning matches and tournaments for england , then something is very , very wrong .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internationals -pipe- 04.12.2007 klinsi the " good german " could be england 's wake-up call großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann 's passion and management skills should be the issue , not his nationality could a german really become coach of fierce rivals england ?
jürgen klinsmann is being looked at to fill the vacancy , but he would face opposition from some fans despite being a great choice , says dw 's nick amies . it would n't be an exaggeration to compare the possibility of former germany coach - and england nemesis - jürgen klinsmann taking over as coach of the three lions to hillary clinton or barak obama becoming president of the united states of america .
in all three hypothetical cases , the most pertinent question remains the same : is the country ready or is that really a step too far ? the possibility of the united states electing a woman or an african-american into the white house is divisive to say the least .
the fact that mrs. clinton and mr. obama are even in the running at this very early stage of the presidential race says something about how attitudes , at least in some parts of the country , have changed in the us .
most of their detractors focus on their policy stances and personality traits rather than their gender or racial background , which is encouraging for a nation that has for centuries tended to view the commander in chief 's job as being reserved for white males only .
if only the same could be said for the opinions and attitudes of some of the england faithful when it comes to the possibility of klinsmann leading england .
still , klinsmann , who led germany to third place in the 2006 world cup and turned down a job offer from the us soccer federation , has hinted he might be interested in occupying the vacant england bench .
klinsi the mold breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi 's and germany 's success has always rankled england fans klinsmann is one of a rare breed ; a german who has endeared himself to the english soccer masses .
his two spells as a tottenham hotspurs player in the 1990 's are credited with rehabilitating the long-held image of conniving , arrogant and - heaven forbid - massively successful germans which had been cultivated through decades of smug tournament victories and much-reveled-in conquests over england .
his self-referential diving celebration after scoring showed a humorous side to the teutonic efficiency that had grated so much with england fans for so long while his contribution in making the premiership the star-studded internationally renowned league it is now can not be underestimated .
his coaching ability is also grudgingly respected on the island .
in his short tenure , klinsmann transformed germany from a nation infamous for grinding out results to a team purring with flair which - as long as that flair was not used to knock england out of any tournament - was appreciated by those english who lamented the lack of invention in their own team .
the german it 's okay to like bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far would klinsi 's popularity in england stretch ?
klinsi is what is commonly known in those circles where such things matter as " an okay german " for his contribution to the premiership and his philosophy of how the game should be played .
it must , however , be said that klinsmann only remains the good german while he is not responsible for any england heartbreak .
all that could change if he is made england coach .
the england job carries the most pressure of any managerial position in international soccer .
the expectation among the fans is hysterically high and probably unachievable .
despite going 41 years without a title since their only tournament success , fans always believe it is england 's right to win .
to keep these demanding supporters happy and lead england to victory is a hard task for any man , and even more so for a german .
section of fans stuck in the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some england fans would not welcome a german coach believe what you want about england 's notorious fans being rehabilitated or locked-up out of harms way .
the truth is there are still elements which sing " ten german bombers " , chant along to the " dambusters " theme and claim in song that hitler was testicularly-challenged .
animosity towards the germans arising from world war ii is sadly still alive in some less-enlightened quarters and the appointment of one who has been a hate-figure in his time as a player would certainly test how far the england faithful have come in their sensitivity training .
it is only six years ago that england got its first foreign coach .
the uproar over appointing an unassuming swede would be nothing compared to the narrow-minded maelstrom that would accompany the naming of a formerly cocky german as national coach .
right now , england fans are holding out in the hope that former chelsea coach jose mourinho will take charge .
while many are offering prayers that the special one will ride to their rescue , few are considering a future where jürgen klinsmann beams out at them from the dug-out in his standard fa blazer .

those implications could be a team playing to its full potential under a young and visionary coach ; an england team feared across the world , not laughed at , and a team ready to put over four decades of underachievement behind it .
if klinsmann gets the job and people still have a problem with him being german while he is winning matches and tournaments for england , then something is very , very wrong .

" " what can we say of this political cowardice ?
we expect our leaders to lead , and lead with moral courage , " said the writers in an open letter published tuesday in african and european newspapers .

the meeting is seen as an effort from europe to strength ties with africa at a time when china is also expanding economic activity on the impoverished continent . britain 's prime minister gordon brown has said he would not attend the conference if zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe is also there , citing the leader 's human rights record .
mugabe has widely been accused of running his country 's economy into the ground and suppressing political opposition . zimbabwe has the world 's highest inflation rate and the world bank has said it has the fastest shrinking economy outside a war zone . former international development secretary valerie amos , now a member of britain 's upper house of lord 's , will go to lisbon in brown 's place . except for czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who is also expected not to attend the summit , other european leaders have not followed brown 's stance : german chancellor angela merkel has said she will stay silent on the situation in zimbabwe . the majority of eu countries , including presidency-holder portugal , have backed the african union 's position that mugabe be allowed to join in the meeting . darfur crisis heats up with fresh attacks activists have also criticized the participation of leaders from sudan at the lisbon conference .
the northern african country has taken heat for allegedly supporting militia groups accused of atrocities in the darfur region . bildunterschrift : many of the refugees from the darfur region have settled in camps in neighboring chad darfur , located in western sudan on the chadian border , has been the scene of ethnic killings for the past several years . armed conflict broke out again tuesday morning in the area when chad 's army attacked an anti-government rebel group for a second day in their mountain hideout near the darfur region of sudan . the violence comes just several weeks before an eu peacekeeping force of up to 3,700 troops is set to deploy to eastern chad as part of a un mission to protect civilian refugees and foreign aid workers . eu member states have been accused of delays in providing promised aircraft , helicopters and medical units to the mission , reported reuters news service .

most of the eu has been at odds with putin . the french leader nicolas sarkozy 's gesture clearly showed he was not toeing the european union line and put him at odds with neighbor and close ally germany .
the german government had called sunday 's parliamentary elections in russia " neither free , fair nor democratic " by western standards . other eu governments have also voiced concern over reports of election irregularities and indeed , the european union 's portuguese presidency said tuesday that russia 's legislative election " did not meet international standards and commitments . " the european union " regrets ... that there were many reports and allegations of media restrictions as well as harassment of opposition parties and ngos in the run up to the elections and on election day , " the presidency said in a statement , as reported by afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso other western goverenments also criticized the polls . sarkozy contradicted his own foreign ministry sarkozy 's telephone call to president putin - the leading candidate for russia 's united party that won an landslide victory , securing 315 of 450 seats in parliament - contradicted not only the eu 's stance , but also his own foreign ministry 's criticism of the conduct of the poll .
the ministry had called for investigations into the allegations of fraud . human rights groups were outraged at sarkozy 's move . " sarkozy 's reaction , which was totally isolated , is both incomprehensible and scandalous , " patrick baudouin , president of the paris-based international federation of human rights -lrb- fidh -rrb- , told afp . " this is a bad blow to democrats and human rights campaigners in russia . " " to give putin your support after unamimously condemned elections , is to compromise yourself and go against official policy " on human rights , he added . he called sarkozy 's call an " excess of zeal that was absolutely unnecessary " and said it was not to france 's credit . eu differs on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin 's party won over 60 percent of the parliamentary vote even all the eu members themselves do not agree about how to handle russia . diplomats told reuters reporters that the eu 's portuguese presidency was seeking agreement on monday among the 27 member states on a joint statement on the russian elections but that it was a challenge to get consensus on the text . on tuesday , the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , urged moscow to address the accusations of electoral irregularities in the russian poll . " everybody is aware that observers have denounced irregularities , " said johannes laitenberger , spokesman for the commission . " it is in the interest of russia to completely clarify all these allegations , " he told reporters in brussels , ac cited by afp . one diplomat told reuters that a draft of an eu statement that circulated on monday criticized moscow 's treatment of the election monitoring office of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and urged the russian government to permit osce monitors into the country to do a long-term survey in advance of a presidential election in march . economic interests at stake ? despite allegations that the opposition had been muzzled and ballots were rigged in the russian vote , the differing european responses to the election highlight the eu 's general problems in speaking with a single voice towards russia , which is its major energy supplier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chess champ kasparov crossed out all parties on his ballot sarkozy , for his part , has been critical of moscow 's handling of human rights , but opposition politicians have nonetheless accused him of putting economic interests above rights . daniele artur , russia expert at amnesty international in france , told afp that she was " very disappointed by -lsb- sarkozy 's -rsb- reaction " to sunday 's elections . " this is sheer realpolitik .
and yet we could have afforded to be much firmer , " she said . the eu similarly backpedaled last week when the portuguese presidency put out a critical statement three days after the arrest of opposition activists in russia , including former world chess champion garry kasparov .
it soon withdrew the statement and issued a milder version without explanation , reuters reported . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this kind of sermon to bosses serves no purpose , like sermons by politicians in general , " ludwig georg braun , of the german chamber of commerce and industry , told the daily frankfurter rundschau . on monday , dec .
3 , chancellor merkel had said during talks about executive salaries that she did not see a problem with top managers being " well paid " as long as they " did a lot for their companies and their partners . " however , merkel stressed her belief that : " when directors ' failures are rewarded with fantastic bonuses , it damages trust in the social balance within our country , " as cited by afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel spoke out against failures being rewarded with bonuses german president horst köhler had said something similar last week . braun said tuesday that " it is up to the supervisory boards of companies to decide on the salaries they are willing to pay to recruit the best managers . " porsche paid over 100 million euros to mangers the issue arose last week when news of generous pay packages enjoyed by directors of the luxury sports car company porsche was reported . porsche said it had paid its six top board members a total of 112.7 million euros -lrb- $ 165 million -rrb- in bonuses for their performance in 2006 .
in the previous year , it had paid 45.2 million . the wall street journal reported that chief executive wendelin wiedeking alone was paid 68 million euros in compensation last year . the news broke around the same time that german postal workers won a hard-fought battle for a minimum wage of between eight and 9.80 euros an hour .
the announcement underscored an increasing disparity of wealth in europe 's biggest economy . poverty among those who work a study by the hans böckler foundation confirmed this week what many germans had already been feeling : that their buying power is steadily declining in the midst of a robust economic recovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking received nearly 70 million euros in bonuses " the distortion in the distribution of wealth and the rise of poverty among workers are a real problem for the economy and society as a whole , " claus schaefer , author of the study , told afp . at a press conference on tuesday , ekkehard schulz , head of the steel group thyssenkrupp , said : " i share the view of mrs. merkel and mr. köhler , " referring to bonuses paid to mangers . " excesses , especially when it is a question of severance pay , are not timely , and never were … , " he added . schulz himself earned around four million euros in the company 's last fiscal year .
he said he was was " satisfied " with his pay : " i am within the average of dax bosses , " he told afp , in reference to the german index of 30 blue chip groups . porsche , which is not listed on the dax index , earned more money trading derivatives than from selling cars in its fiscal year that ended july 31 .
stock-option transactions contributed a pretax of 3.59 billion euros to the group 's results . total net profit came to 4.242 billion euros , more than three times the result of 1.393 billion one year earlier , as cited by afp . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the report stated that iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 . for nearly 18 months , solana has been trying to persuade the islamic republic to suspend uranium enrichment in exchange for a bundle of political , trade and economic incentives . solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , said the national intelligence estimate -lrb- nie -rrb- report " proves that transparency about -lrb- iran 's -rrb- nuclear activities and its intentions are fundamental . " but us president george w. bush said that iran remains a danger and refused to rule out a military attack despite the new findings . " iran was dangerous , iran is dangerous and iran will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon , " bush told a white house press conference . the international atomic agency director general mohamed el baradei said on tuesday , nov .
4 , that the report tallied with the iaea investigation into the country 's nuclear program . a number of european countries , including germany , have already welcomed the us report as confirming that europe 's strategy of negotiations plus sanctions is keeping tehran in line with international demands . the nie report confirmed " the double approach chosen by the international community of incentives and measures from the united nations security council was right , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in a statement released monday , nov .
3 . britain 's foreign ministry also said the carrot-and-stick approach was working to keep iran in line with international demands . " the report 's conclusions justify the action already taken by the international community to get to the bottom of iran 's nuclear program and to increase pressure on the regime to stop its enrichment and reprocessing activities , " a british foreign ministry spokeswoman told the afp news agency . international pressure successful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the double approach of sanctions and incentives needed to continue the national intelligence estimate , a consensus of all 16 us spy agencies , said in a report monday that it was confident that iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in late 2003 .
nie cited " moderate confidence " that the program had not been restarted as of mid-2007 . tehran could have the technical ability to build a nuclear weapon between 2010 and 2015 , but " we do not know if it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons , " the report stated . iran appears " less determined to develop nuclear weapons than we have been judging since 2005 , " the nie said .
the report concluded that it was likely that tehran had halted its nuclear program in response to international pressure , which " suggests that iran may be more vulnerable to influence on the issue than we judged previously . " europe 's mixed approach to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military work at iran 's nuclear facilities may have stopped four years ago the united nations security council has brought sanctions against iran twice for refusing to discontinue its uranium enrichment program .
enriched uranium can be used to build nuclear weapons , but iran has consistently said its program is purely used for civilian purposes . the five permanent members of the security council - britain , china , france , russia and the usa - plus germany met in paris over the weekend to discuss a third sanctions resolution but did not reach an agreement . in 2004 and 2005 , germany , along with britain and france , led a diplomatic initiative with tehran in which trade and other economic incentives were discussed in exchange for a halt on the uranium enrichment program . while the so-called eu-3 has since supported un-led sanctions against iran , it has also remained open to a more diplomatic strategy . report may be face-saver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran welcomed the report , saying it confirmed iran 's nuclear plans are peaceful us national security advisor stephen hadley said the report should n't be taken as a reason to lose vigilance . " there 's going to be a tendency of a lot of people to say : ' the problem 's less bad that we thought , let 's relax , " ' said hadley .
" our view is that would be a mistake . " hadley denied that us rhetoric on iran had escalated to step up international pressure .
in october , us president george w. bush raised the specters of " world war iii " or a " nuclear holocaust " occurring should teheran build a nuclear bomb . the estimate could have been a " face saving decision " because bush is not willing to strike militarily and has exhausted the efforts at the un security council , alex vatanka of the middle east institute told the dpa news agency . " at this stage of the game it is better to underplay the threat , " he said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this kind of sermon to bosses serves no purpose , like sermons by politicians in general , " ludwig georg braun , of the german chamber of commerce and industry , told the daily frankfurter rundschau . on monday , dec .
3 , chancellor merkel had said during talks about executive salaries that she did not see a problem with top managers being " well paid " as long as they " did a lot for their companies and their partners . " however , merkel stressed her belief that : " when directors ' failures are rewarded with fantastic bonuses , it damages trust in the social balance within our country , " as cited by afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel spoke out against failures being rewarded with bonuses german president horst köhler had said something similar last week . braun said tuesday that " it is up to the supervisory boards of companies to decide on the salaries they are willing to pay to recruit the best managers . " porsche paid over 100 million euros to mangers the issue arose last week when news of generous pay packages enjoyed by directors of the luxury sports car company porsche was reported . porsche said it had paid its six top board members a total of 112.7 million euros -lrb- $ 165 million -rrb- in bonuses for their performance in 2006 .
in the previous year , it had paid 45.2 million . the wall street journal reported that chief executive wendelin wiedeking alone was paid 68 million euros in compensation last year . the news broke around the same time that german postal workers won a hard-fought battle for a minimum wage of between eight and 9.80 euros an hour .
the announcement underscored an increasing disparity of wealth in europe 's biggest economy . poverty among those who work a study by the hans böckler foundation confirmed this week what many germans had already been feeling : that their buying power is steadily declining in the midst of a robust economic recovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking received nearly 70 million euros in bonuses " the distortion in the distribution of wealth and the rise of poverty among workers are a real problem for the economy and society as a whole , " claus schaefer , author of the study , told afp . at a press conference on tuesday , ekkehard schulz , head of the steel group thyssenkrupp , said : " i share the view of mrs. merkel and mr. köhler , " referring to bonuses paid to mangers . " excesses , especially when it is a question of severance pay , are not timely , and never were … , " he added . schulz himself earned around four million euros in the company 's last fiscal year .
he said he was was " satisfied " with his pay : " i am within the average of dax bosses , " he told afp , in reference to the german index of 30 blue chip groups . porsche , which is not listed on the dax index , earned more money trading derivatives than from selling cars in its fiscal year that ended july 31 .
stock-option transactions contributed a pretax of 3.59 billion euros to the group 's results . total net profit came to 4.242 billion euros , more than three times the result of 1.393 billion one year earlier , as cited by afp . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this kind of sermon to bosses serves no purpose , like sermons by politicians in general , " ludwig georg braun , of the german chamber of commerce and industry , told the daily frankfurter rundschau . on monday , dec .
3 , chancellor merkel had said during talks about executive salaries that she did not see a problem with top managers being " well paid " as long as they " did a lot for their companies and their partners . " however , merkel stressed her belief that : " when directors ' failures are rewarded with fantastic bonuses , it damages trust in the social balance within our country , " as cited by afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel spoke out against failures being rewarded with bonuses german president horst köhler had said something similar last week . braun said tuesday that " it is up to the supervisory boards of companies to decide on the salaries they are willing to pay to recruit the best managers . " porsche paid over 100 million euros to mangers the issue arose last week when news of generous pay packages enjoyed by directors of the luxury sports car company porsche was reported . porsche said it had paid its six top board members a total of 112.7 million euros -lrb- $ 165 million -rrb- in bonuses for their performance in 2006 .
in the previous year , it had paid 45.2 million . the wall street journal reported that chief executive wendelin wiedeking alone was paid 68 million euros in compensation last year . the news broke around the same time that german postal workers won a hard-fought battle for a minimum wage of between eight and 9.80 euros an hour .
the announcement underscored an increasing disparity of wealth in europe 's biggest economy . poverty among those who work a study by the hans böckler foundation confirmed this week what many germans had already been feeling : that their buying power is steadily declining in the midst of a robust economic recovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking received nearly 70 million euros in bonuses " the distortion in the distribution of wealth and the rise of poverty among workers are a real problem for the economy and society as a whole , " claus schaefer , author of the study , told afp . at a press conference on tuesday , ekkehard schulz , head of the steel group thyssenkrupp , said : " i share the view of mrs. merkel and mr. köhler , " referring to bonuses paid to mangers . " excesses , especially when it is a question of severance pay , are not timely , and never were … , " he added . schulz himself earned around four million euros in the company 's last fiscal year .
he said he was was " satisfied " with his pay : " i am within the average of dax bosses , " he told afp , in reference to the german index of 30 blue chip groups . porsche , which is not listed on the dax index , earned more money trading derivatives than from selling cars in its fiscal year that ended july 31 .
stock-option transactions contributed a pretax of 3.59 billion euros to the group 's results . total net profit came to 4.242 billion euros , more than three times the result of 1.393 billion one year earlier , as cited by afp . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 04.12.2007 pisa education studies come under examination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people still ca n't get their heads around the pisa testing system germany crept up the rankings in the latest comparative international education study .
but the results are once again fanning the flames of controversy in the ongoing debate over school reform . germany reached 13th place out of 57 countries tested in the results of the latest program for international student assessment - pisa - study , officially published on tuesday , nov .
4 . but any joy over improvement in standing was damped when the test 's creator at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , andreas schleicher , last week told the press that the improvement was more likely due to changes in the way the test was structured , than to any actual improvement on the part of german students . the discussion over germany 's school performance has been raging since 2000 , when the country landed in the bottom third of the rankings of 32 countries , and continued through 2003 , when germany still rated 18th in a list of 40 countries . those rankings " certainly served to alert the public of just how different our perception of the system was compared with its stance in the real world , " said rainer lehmann , a professor of education research at berlin 's humboldt university . indeed , the country 's mediocre ranking back in 2000 caught most germans , who thought highly of their school system , off guard .
the term pisa has since become a household word , reflecting the study 's resonance in the media . debate over studies ' relevance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could be moving towards a comprehensive system the debate has raised questions about the general relevance of comparative educational testing , pitting those who see tests as a useful comparative tool against those who focus on the shortcomings of big , international studies . most experts agree that big international studies have an important place in education policy . " the idea is that you have some natural variance between educational systems , and you try to capitalize upon this by looking at different influences , " said lehmann .
" the goal is to learn from other systems . " michael becker-mrotzeck , a professor in the department of language education at cologne university , agreed . " in principle , -lrb- these studies -rrb- tell us useful information about our school system , " he said .
" for instance , from the first and second pisa studies , germans learned that in no other country does social status of the parents have such a big effect on the academic success of their children . " in addition , the earlier studies showed weakness in certain basic competencies , like reading , math and science .
as a result , he said , schools have shifted focus - with visible results . in november an international test of elementary school competency showed that reading had " clearly improved . " " our education system reacted , quickly , " to the deficits uncovered by pisa , becker-mrotzeck said .
this led to the development of a spate of learning materials , and a host of creative concepts , such as reading nights and author-readings in schools . germany coming out of anti-testing era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has now accepted testing procedures unlike in the uk and the us , where educational testing has long been a buzzword and where standardized tests are routinely used to monitoring how much information is being passed from teachers to students , germany is fairly new to the game . after a spate of general tests in the early 70s showed similar weaknesses to those rediscovered by pisa in 2001 , the country underwent an anti-testing backlash that lasted a good 20 years . only recently have policymakers reinstated mass comparative testing in schools .
today , german schoolchildren face four " general " exams over the course of their 13 year school career - in 3rd , 8th , 10th and at the end of the 12th grade , becker-mrotzeck explained . " it is different than in the us or england , where they might have such tests twice a year , " said becker-mrozeck .
" i do n't think at that level germany is in danger of doing what they call in america , ' teaching to the test . " ' still , learning does n't take place via testing , said renate hendricks , a social democrat parliamentarian for the state of north-rhine westphalia , who specializes in education policy . " i think you can test what a person can do , but learning comes through motivation , curiosity , interest , and an emotional relationship to the teacher , " among other things , hendricks said . hendricks did acknowledge that comparative studies are useful for giving feedback aimed at improving schools .
" but if politicians are incapable of using the information they get to make positive change , then no , these studies are not useful , " she said . disparities in german system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pisa studies are flawed , say some she added that when the figures are broken down by social background , immense disparities in the german system are still evident in the newest pisa results . " now it is clear we have to do something , " she said .
" these politicians have to take off their rose-colored glasses .
or black glasses , or whatever they are wearing . " meanwhile , still other critics say the whole structure of pisa - indeed , the idea of widespread comparative international testing itself - is flawed .
the pisa study was also designed with " unrealistic goals , " according to joachim wuttke , a munich-based physicist , statistician and math teacher who has written two articles critiquing the methodology behind pisa and similar tests . tests weighted against germany , says expert " the ranking of states on a one-dimensional scale is not serious , " he said .
" you can construct tests that give different results , and this one is made in a way that shows germany is mediocre . " various factors can affect outcome .
the type of school system a country has is just one potential factor , he said , adding that the spectrum of students tested also differed from country to country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : differences in studies across europe are a problem " germany took great pains to get a representative sample of students , testing even in schools for special-needs students , " he said .
" meanwhile , finland excluded students with dyslexia from the test .
you ca n't do an international comparison of reading difficulties when you exclude some students . " ultimately , wuttke said tests like pisa " do n't test the system , they test the population . "
he pointed out that in highest-ranking finland , there are almost no immigrants . " if you compared results of all native students only , then finland is no longer at the top of the list , " he said . germany shocked out of stupor one thing the pisa proponents seem to agree on is that the results from 2001 shocked the country into a back-to-basics frenzy . " i see the main advantage of this test as having reoriented schools toward cognitive growth , " said humboldt university 's lehmann .
" every year you have a new set of educational goals seems to be defined - family education , sexual education , peace education , gender education ... but the core business seems to be forgotten . " but even there , wuttke sees pisa as more of a lost opportunity than a gain . " reading , math and science are important subjects , but it should n't come at the expense of other things like sports and music , " he said .
" i happen to think they are just as important . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

six months after parliamentary elections , belgium remains without a government .
outgoing pm guy verhofstadt has launched mediation talks with the country 's main parties after belgian king albert approached him for help . verhofstadt hopes to mend the rupture between francophone and flemish-speaking leaders after coalition talks to form a new government collapsed last week .
this comes after king albert ii summoned verhofstadt on monday and asked him , according to a statement issued by the palace , " to inform the king on the way to get out of the impasse very swiftly , and to make all the contacts necessary to do so . "
belgian television reports have interpreted the belgian king 's move as bestowing “ urgent ” powers , including dealing with “ international matters , ” on prime minister guy verhofstadt .
but this would be in violation of the belgian constitution which does not provide for extended powers to governments without a parliamentary majority .
flemish christian democrat leader yves leterme , who was expected to succeed verhofstadt , told the king on saturday that he was unable to form a coalition after failing to reach a deal over how much power should be devolved to the regions .
haunted by the specter of division along linguistic lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's image is beginning to look a little tattered the deadlock has sparked fears that belgium would split into the flemish and french-speaking parts .
" our country is facing one of the most severe political crises of the last decades , " verhofstadt told a news conference in brussels .
" this situation can not and must not continue for much longer , " he added .
verhofstadt said the country needed fundamental state reform , adding that the country 's problems could be solved " when everyone recognized the seriousness of the situation and took responsibility . "
he said he wanted to reach an agreement on devolution and tackle urgent social and economic issues that go far beyond the authority of a caretaker government .
situation remains unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would-be pm leterme is of mixed parentage himself , but he has not built bridges between the two communities but verhofstadt , who was ousted in the june elections after eight years in office , did not give details of his plans or how the 2008 budget could be drafted under these circumstances .

verhofstadt said the country 's image abroad was suffering because of the ongoing crisis .

the liberal vld leader managed to largely keep a lid on devolution-related issues during his term of office .

six months after parliamentary elections , belgium remains without a government .
outgoing pm guy verhofstadt has launched mediation talks with the country 's main parties after belgian king albert approached him for help . verhofstadt hopes to mend the rupture between francophone and flemish-speaking leaders after coalition talks to form a new government collapsed last week .
this comes after king albert ii summoned verhofstadt on monday and asked him , according to a statement issued by the palace , " to inform the king on the way to get out of the impasse very swiftly , and to make all the contacts necessary to do so . "
belgian television reports have interpreted the belgian king 's move as bestowing “ urgent ” powers , including dealing with “ international matters , ” on prime minister guy verhofstadt .
but this would be in violation of the belgian constitution which does not provide for extended powers to governments without a parliamentary majority .
flemish christian democrat leader yves leterme , who was expected to succeed verhofstadt , told the king on saturday that he was unable to form a coalition after failing to reach a deal over how much power should be devolved to the regions .
haunted by the specter of division along linguistic lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's image is beginning to look a little tattered the deadlock has sparked fears that belgium would split into the flemish and french-speaking parts .
" our country is facing one of the most severe political crises of the last decades , " verhofstadt told a news conference in brussels .
" this situation can not and must not continue for much longer , " he added .
verhofstadt said the country needed fundamental state reform , adding that the country 's problems could be solved " when everyone recognized the seriousness of the situation and took responsibility . "
he said he wanted to reach an agreement on devolution and tackle urgent social and economic issues that go far beyond the authority of a caretaker government .
situation remains unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would-be pm leterme is of mixed parentage himself , but he has not built bridges between the two communities but verhofstadt , who was ousted in the june elections after eight years in office , did not give details of his plans or how the 2008 budget could be drafted under these circumstances .
belgium 's flemish majority wants more autonomy for the relatively rich region of flanders , a move seen as a political and financial threat in the french-speaking region of wallonia .
many flemish voters believe that their taxes - amongst the highest in the world - are used to subsidize the social security system in the south .
verhofstadt said the country 's image abroad was suffering because of the ongoing crisis .
business leaders say potential foreign investors will be driven away .
the liberal vld leader managed to largely keep a lid on devolution-related issues during his term of office .
but he was punished for that at the polls by flemish voters .
his rival leterme has , however , angered walloons by doubting their ability to learn flemish , as well as confusing the french and belgian national anthems . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

columbus chief engineer rüdiger kledzik told dpa . such scientific experiments with microgravity are considered key to prepare humankind for living and working in space and for subsequent journeys toward mars and elsewhere . some experiments look at the loss of bone and muscle deterioration in zero gravity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internationals -pipe- 04.12.2007 klinsi the " good german " could be england 's wake-up call großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann 's passion and management skills should be the issue , not his nationality could a german really become coach of fierce rivals england ?
jürgen klinsmann is being looked at to fill the vacancy , but he would face opposition from some fans despite being a great choice , says dw 's nick amies . it would n't be an exaggeration to compare the possibility of former germany coach - and england nemesis - jürgen klinsmann taking over as coach of the three lions to hillary clinton or barak obama becoming president of the united states of america .
in all three hypothetical cases , the most pertinent question remains the same : is the country ready or is that really a step too far ? the possibility of the united states electing a woman or an african-american into the white house is divisive to say the least .
the fact that mrs. clinton and mr. obama are even in the running at this very early stage of the presidential race says something about how attitudes , at least in some parts of the country , have changed in the us .
most of their detractors focus on their policy stances and personality traits rather than their gender or racial background , which is encouraging for a nation that has for centuries tended to view the commander in chief 's job as being reserved for white males only .
if only the same could be said for the opinions and attitudes of some of the england faithful when it comes to the possibility of klinsmann leading england .
still , klinsmann , who led germany to third place in the 2006 world cup and turned down a job offer from the us soccer federation , has hinted he might be interested in occupying the vacant england bench .
klinsi the mold breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi 's and germany 's success has always rankled england fans klinsmann is one of a rare breed ; a german who has endeared himself to the english soccer masses .
his two spells as a tottenham hotspurs player in the 1990 's are credited with rehabilitating the long-held image of conniving , arrogant and - heaven forbid - massively successful germans which had been cultivated through decades of smug tournament victories and much-reveled-in conquests over england .
his self-referential diving celebration after scoring showed a humorous side to the teutonic efficiency that had grated so much with england fans for so long while his contribution in making the premiership the star-studded internationally renowned league it is now can not be underestimated .
his coaching ability is also grudgingly respected on the island .
in his short tenure , klinsmann transformed germany from a nation infamous for grinding out results to a team purring with flair which - as long as that flair was not used to knock england out of any tournament - was appreciated by those english who lamented the lack of invention in their own team .
the german it 's okay to like bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far would klinsi 's popularity in england stretch ?
klinsi is what is commonly known in those circles where such things matter as " an okay german " for his contribution to the premiership and his philosophy of how the game should be played .
it must , however , be said that klinsmann only remains the good german while he is not responsible for any england heartbreak .
all that could change if he is made england coach .
the england job carries the most pressure of any managerial position in international soccer .
the expectation among the fans is hysterically high and probably unachievable .
despite going 41 years without a title since their only tournament success , fans always believe it is england 's right to win .
to keep these demanding supporters happy and lead england to victory is a hard task for any man , and even more so for a german .
section of fans stuck in the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some england fans would not welcome a german coach believe what you want about england 's notorious fans being rehabilitated or locked-up out of harms way .
the truth is there are still elements which sing " ten german bombers " , chant along to the " dambusters " theme and claim in song that hitler was testicularly-challenged .
animosity towards the germans arising from world war ii is sadly still alive in some less-enlightened quarters and the appointment of one who has been a hate-figure in his time as a player would certainly test how far the england faithful have come in their sensitivity training .
it is only six years ago that england got its first foreign coach .
the uproar over appointing an unassuming swede would be nothing compared to the narrow-minded maelstrom that would accompany the naming of a formerly cocky german as national coach .
right now , england fans are holding out in the hope that former chelsea coach jose mourinho will take charge .
while many are offering prayers that the special one will ride to their rescue , few are considering a future where jürgen klinsmann beams out at them from the dug-out in his standard fa blazer .
put common sense ahead of prejudice but they should .
those implications could be a team playing to its full potential under a young and visionary coach ; an england team feared across the world , not laughed at , and a team ready to put over four decades of underachievement behind it .
if klinsmann gets the job and people still have a problem with him being german while he is winning matches and tournaments for england , then something is very , very wrong .
for a nation of supporters which craves success as much as england fans do , it should n't matter where their next coach comes from as long as he 's a winner . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said that final decisions about membership should be made at the end of talks . merkel distances cdu from spd merkel 's comments in her monday speech were apparently an attempt to demarcate policy differences on turkey between her conservative cdu and her center-left junior coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . according to reuters , eu diplomats said france wanted to have the word " accession " eliminated from the section concerning negotiations with turkey in a statement on the eu 's enlargement policy , which the bloc 's foreign ministers are due to approve on monday . ankara has said it wants nothing but membership and has rejected the idea of an " enhanced partnership " with the eu . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

poland is a very important partner , and the voice of poland matters , " a buoyant eu commission president jose manuel barroso told journalists in brussels .
when tusk arrived in the commission - the eu 's executive - barroso met him with a beaming smile and an ebullient handshake which would not have been out of place in a christmas grotto .
and tusk replied in kind , referring to a new relationship of trust between his government and the brussels apparatus at least half a dozen times in his opening remarks and joking that he was relieved to have been allowed in after having given a marathon three-hour introductory speech to poland 's parliament 10 days ago .

and his abrasive defence of polish interests won him few friends in brussels , where he was widely regarded as failing to understand the delicate system of compromises by which the eu functions .

" we discussed the future in a spirit of trust - of ' zaufanie , ' to use the polish word , " barroso joked on tuesday , winning a cheer of his own from his audience .

most of the eu has been at odds with putin . the french leader nicolas sarkozy 's gesture clearly showed he was not toeing the european union line and put him at odds with neighbor and close ally germany .
the german government had called sunday 's parliamentary elections in russia " neither free , fair nor democratic " by western standards . other eu governments have also voiced concern over reports of election irregularities and indeed , the european union 's portuguese presidency said tuesday that russia 's legislative election " did not meet international standards and commitments . " the european union " regrets ... that there were many reports and allegations of media restrictions as well as harassment of opposition parties and ngos in the run up to the elections and on election day , " the presidency said in a statement , as reported by afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso other western goverenments also criticized the polls . sarkozy contradicted his own foreign ministry sarkozy 's telephone call to president putin - the leading candidate for russia 's united party that won an landslide victory , securing 315 of 450 seats in parliament - contradicted not only the eu 's stance , but also his own foreign ministry 's criticism of the conduct of the poll .
the ministry had called for investigations into the allegations of fraud . human rights groups were outraged at sarkozy 's move . " sarkozy 's reaction , which was totally isolated , is both incomprehensible and scandalous , " patrick baudouin , president of the paris-based international federation of human rights -lrb- fidh -rrb- , told afp . " this is a bad blow to democrats and human rights campaigners in russia . " " to give putin your support after unamimously condemned elections , is to compromise yourself and go against official policy " on human rights , he added . he called sarkozy 's call an " excess of zeal that was absolutely unnecessary " and said it was not to france 's credit . eu differs on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin 's party won over 60 percent of the parliamentary vote even all the eu members themselves do not agree about how to handle russia . diplomats told reuters reporters that the eu 's portuguese presidency was seeking agreement on monday among the 27 member states on a joint statement on the russian elections but that it was a challenge to get consensus on the text . on tuesday , the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , urged moscow to address the accusations of electoral irregularities in the russian poll . " everybody is aware that observers have denounced irregularities , " said johannes laitenberger , spokesman for the commission . " it is in the interest of russia to completely clarify all these allegations , " he told reporters in brussels , ac cited by afp . one diplomat told reuters that a draft of an eu statement that circulated on monday criticized moscow 's treatment of the election monitoring office of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and urged the russian government to permit osce monitors into the country to do a long-term survey in advance of a presidential election in march . economic interests at stake ? despite allegations that the opposition had been muzzled and ballots were rigged in the russian vote , the differing european responses to the election highlight the eu 's general problems in speaking with a single voice towards russia , which is its major energy supplier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chess champ kasparov crossed out all parties on his ballot sarkozy , for his part , has been critical of moscow 's handling of human rights , but opposition politicians have nonetheless accused him of putting economic interests above rights . daniele artur , russia expert at amnesty international in france , told afp that she was " very disappointed by -lsb- sarkozy 's -rsb- reaction " to sunday 's elections . " this is sheer realpolitik .
and yet we could have afforded to be much firmer , " she said . the eu similarly backpedaled last week when the portuguese presidency put out a critical statement three days after the arrest of opposition activists in russia , including former world chess champion garry kasparov .
it soon withdrew the statement and issued a milder version without explanation , reuters reported . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most of the eu has been at odds with putin . the french leader nicolas sarkozy 's gesture clearly showed he was not toeing the european union line and put him at odds with neighbor and close ally germany .
the german government had called sunday 's parliamentary elections in russia " neither free , fair nor democratic " by western standards . other eu governments have also voiced concern over reports of election irregularities and indeed , the european union 's portuguese presidency said tuesday that russia 's legislative election " did not meet international standards and commitments . " the european union " regrets ... that there were many reports and allegations of media restrictions as well as harassment of opposition parties and ngos in the run up to the elections and on election day , " the presidency said in a statement , as reported by afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso other western goverenments also criticized the polls . sarkozy contradicted his own foreign ministry sarkozy 's telephone call to president putin - the leading candidate for russia 's united party that won an landslide victory , securing 315 of 450 seats in parliament - contradicted not only the eu 's stance , but also his own foreign ministry 's criticism of the conduct of the poll .
the ministry had called for investigations into the allegations of fraud . human rights groups were outraged at sarkozy 's move . " sarkozy 's reaction , which was totally isolated , is both incomprehensible and scandalous , " patrick baudouin , president of the paris-based international federation of human rights -lrb- fidh -rrb- , told afp . " this is a bad blow to democrats and human rights campaigners in russia . " " to give putin your support after unamimously condemned elections , is to compromise yourself and go against official policy " on human rights , he added . he called sarkozy 's call an " excess of zeal that was absolutely unnecessary " and said it was not to france 's credit . eu differs on russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin 's party won over 60 percent of the parliamentary vote even all the eu members themselves do not agree about how to handle russia . diplomats told reuters reporters that the eu 's portuguese presidency was seeking agreement on monday among the 27 member states on a joint statement on the russian elections but that it was a challenge to get consensus on the text . on tuesday , the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , urged moscow to address the accusations of electoral irregularities in the russian poll . " everybody is aware that observers have denounced irregularities , " said johannes laitenberger , spokesman for the commission . " it is in the interest of russia to completely clarify all these allegations , " he told reporters in brussels , ac cited by afp . one diplomat told reuters that a draft of an eu statement that circulated on monday criticized moscow 's treatment of the election monitoring office of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and urged the russian government to permit osce monitors into the country to do a long-term survey in advance of a presidential election in march . economic interests at stake ? despite allegations that the opposition had been muzzled and ballots were rigged in the russian vote , the differing european responses to the election highlight the eu 's general problems in speaking with a single voice towards russia , which is its major energy supplier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chess champ kasparov crossed out all parties on his ballot sarkozy , for his part , has been critical of moscow 's handling of human rights , but opposition politicians have nonetheless accused him of putting economic interests above rights . daniele artur , russia expert at amnesty international in france , told afp that she was " very disappointed by -lsb- sarkozy 's -rsb- reaction " to sunday 's elections . " this is sheer realpolitik .
and yet we could have afforded to be much firmer , " she said . the eu similarly backpedaled last week when the portuguese presidency put out a critical statement three days after the arrest of opposition activists in russia , including former world chess champion garry kasparov .
it soon withdrew the statement and issued a milder version without explanation , reuters reported . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more than half the 295 women who died during or after pregnancy between 2003 and 2005 were overweight or obese .
experts say the number of deaths - from a total of two million pregnancies - is low but the trend is very worrying .
the confidential enquiries into maternal deaths -lrb- cemach -rrb- report calls for more support and advice for obese women before and during pregnancy .
obese pregnant women are probably at four or five times greater risk of suffering maternal death than a woman of normal weight - and the same for their babies dying dr gwyneth lewis maternity tsar calculate your bmi gwyneth lewis , cemach director and the government 's maternity tsar , said the figures showed that childbirth was very safe in the uk .
but she said the growing evidence of a link to obesity was a cause for concern .
graph : bmi at a glance the figures suggest that a modest amount of extra weight in pregnancy carries little extra risk , but obesity poses a significant problem .
fifteen per cent of the mothers who died were morbid or super-morbidly obese .
dr lewis said : " obese pregnant women are probably at four or five times greater risk of suffering maternal death than a woman of normal weight - and the same for their babies dying . "
nutrition advice she is concerned many women are not aware of the risk associated with obesity .
overall , the uk has one of the lowest rates of maternal death in the world .
however , the death rate in the uk has begun to rise .
in 2003-05 it stood at almost 13.95 per 100,000 births , up from 13.07 in 2000-02 , and just 9.83 in 1985-87 .
with obesity levels predicted to soar experts say it is vital that women are fully aware they should try to get to a healthy weight before trying to conceive .
the report says excess weight not only puts a woman at risk of medical complications , it can mask symptoms and cause logistical problems .
in one case , there was a delay in spotting that a woman was at risk of seizures , because a blood pressure cuff could not fit around her arm .
new equipment at the queen elizabeth hospital in gateshead , consultant obstetricians are already seeing a shift in their clinics and delivery suites .
dr helene brandon said around a third of the pregnant mothers they see are obese , and in an average year they care for several women with a body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- of more than 50 .
dr brandon 's maternity unit has a new operating table that would place those women in the highest risk category of super-morbidly obese .
the maternity unit has had to buy a new operating table that can hold up to 40 stone -lrb- 254kg -rrb- in weight .
it is regularly in use , as around half of obese pregnant women end up having a caesarean section .
the operation usually requires at least one extra assistant for the surgeon to help manage the bulk of the patient .
dr brandon said obese patients face higher risks of certain complications .
she said : " the most common ones are dangerously high blood pressure , heart disease such as angina which could cause a heart attack in pregnancy - and obese patients are much more prone to bleeding . "
struggle with weight several miles away on an estate in jarrow one of her patients , maria thornton is working hard to reduce the risks to herself and her baby .
maria is six months pregnant and weighs 19-and-a-half stone -lrb- 124kg -rrb- .
she has had a lifelong struggle with her weight , and had gastric band surgery several years ago .
in her last pregnancy , maria developed diabetes because of her weight , which brought home to her the risks to her own health from obesity .
although she is now well informed about the potential health problems maria is shocked that obesity is emerging as a factor in maternal deaths .
she said : " it is really quite scary .
you know there are risks , but you do n't think of them in terms of fatality - you kind of think it makes the pregnancy harder or you 've got more obstacles to overcome .
" but to hear that it can cost you your life at the end of the day is quite frightening . "
now maria is going several times a week to the sure start scheme in perth green to use the gym .
as a result of regular exercise she has only put on three pounds -lrb- 1.36kg -rrb- in this pregnancy , following the medical advice that obese women should aim to maintain their weight .

a report by bliss said demand for care in neonatal units in wales had jumped by 13 % in 2006 , while the number of specialist nurses rose only by 2 % .
it also said overcrowding meant some new admissions were turned away .
the welsh assembly government said bliss had been advising it on neo-natal facilities and developing specialist services for children and young people .
however , a spokesperson said : " we can not comment on reports we have n't had an opportunity to study in detail . "
travel the charity for premature babies said no unit in wales currently met the recommended nursing levels .
it said more than 100 specialist nurses were needed - increasing the workforce by 27 % - to meet recommended minimum standards in wales .
the study said services were being " stretched to breaking point " and said the units had to close their doors for an average of 24 days in a six-month period .
it said that this meant mothers and babies sometimes had to travel long distances to access the care they need .
louise downie , from st mellons , in cardiff , was moved from the university hospital of wales after she went into labour at 34 weeks in december 2006 .
ms downie said there was not a neonatal cot available for her and she was taken to nevill hall hospital in abergavenny within hours .
" you would think , living on the doorstep of the university hospital of wales , you would get access to the best health care - but i had to travel 30 miles away , " she said .
after seven days at nevill hall , her son sammy was transferred back to the university hospital and was there for five days before being discharged .
ms downie said the whole process and her experience had made her wary of a second pregnancy .
the report showed demand for care in neonatal units in wales had jumped by 13 % in 2006 , while the number of specialist nurses rose only by 2 % .
tina donnelly , director of the royal college of nursing -lrb- rcn -rrb- wales , said she was concerned with the findings .
" it is essential that nursing numbers and skills match and are available , when required , to meet the needs of patients , " she added .
the rcn believes nhs health organisations in wales should have statuary responsibility to provide the right number of registered nurses for patient care .
' under-resourced ' " without this in place we will see an impact on service provision and the level of patient care , as is the case with the neo-natal units in wales , " ms donnelly added .
the report by bliss also said there was no dedicated transport system in place in wales to transfer babies safely between units .
based on replies from 11 of wales ' 13 units , the charity also surveyed parents of sick or premature babies on their experience of neonatal care .
bliss chief executive andy cole told bbc radio wales he hoped the assembly government and health commission wales , which in 2005 began a review of neonatal services , would develop a " really strong strategic plan " for the speciality .
he said : " these are n't nurses that grow on trees , they require training .
they will require a couple of years to come on line .
" we need to see there is some investment coming in now to make sure those nurses are recruited and retained , they are valued within the nhs and to make sure we are dealing with the issue now . "

louise downie went into labour when she was 34 weeks pregnant ms downie said there was not a neonatal cot available for her and she was taken to nevill hall hospital in abergavenny within hours .
" you would think , living on the doorstep of the university hospital of wales , you would get access to the best health care - but i had to travel 30 miles away , " she said .
after seven days at nevill hall , her son sammy was transferred back to the university hospital and was there for five days before being discharged .
ms downie said the whole process and her experience had made her wary of a second pregnancy .
the report showed demand for care in neonatal units in wales had jumped by 13 % in 2006 , while the number of specialist nurses rose only by 2 % .
tina donnelly , director of the royal college of nursing -lrb- rcn -rrb- wales , said she was concerned with the findings .
" it is essential that nursing numbers and skills match and are available , when required , to meet the needs of patients , " she added .
the rcn believes nhs health organisations in wales should have statuary responsibility to provide the right number of registered nurses for patient care .
' under-resourced ' " without this in place we will see an impact on service provision and the level of patient care , as is the case with the neo-natal units in wales , " ms donnelly added .
the report by bliss also said there was no dedicated transport system in place in wales to transfer babies safely between units .
based on replies from 11 of wales ' 13 units , the charity also surveyed parents of sick or premature babies on their experience of neonatal care .
bliss chief executive andy cole told bbc radio wales he hoped the assembly government and health commission wales , which in 2005 began a review of neonatal services , would develop a " really strong strategic plan " for the speciality .
he said : " these are n't nurses that grow on trees , they require training .
they will require a couple of years to come on line .
" we need to see there is some investment coming in now to make sure those nurses are recruited and retained , they are valued within the nhs and to make sure we are dealing with the issue now . "

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- why do we need faster broadband ?
bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- tuesday , 4 december 2007 , 09:04 gmt why do we need faster broadband ?
by jane wakefield technology reporter , bbc news a lot of what has been written about broadband has focused on obsession with speed .
but for most consumers the size of the pipe or the bandwidth it carries is of little importance as long as they can get done all the things they need to get done .
without the obvious need for more bandwidth it is hard for companies such as bt to justify committing to a multi-billion spend on new networks .
yet for the services to happen the capacity needs to be there .
this chicken and egg dilemma is perhaps the biggest facing the industry as it considers its next move in the broadband sphere .
ofcom has been proactive in the debate and is currently in the middle of a consultation on the issue but even it admits there is no obvious killer app .
" we are struggling to see new commercial applications .
the same old applications are popping up that did when broadband was being talked about- such as video-conferencing and telemedicine , " said clive carter , principal of strategy and market developments at ofcom .
video networking most pundits agree that a new age is dawning where using your broadband connection for a bit of web surfing and sending the odd e-mail has ended in favour of video-dominated applications services such as youtube have proved that consumers want to watch video online and this has gathered pace with offering such as the bbc iplayer and channel 4 's catch-up service allowing viewers to access on-demand tv .
according to nielsen online , some 21 million britons -lrb- 63 % of those online -rrb- visited tv , video and movies sites in september 2007 , which is a rise of 28 % from the same time last year with the time they spent on these sites up 91 % .
" britons are displaying an increasingly significant appetite for supplementing their viewing habits online , " said nielsen online analyst alex burmeister .
" whether it 's additional content related to a particular tv programme or actually watching episodes or videos through their computer , we are starting to see a significant spread of entertainment consumption form the so-called lean back method of a tv to the lean forward method of the pc , " he said .
in a 100mbps world , pundits expect that the social networking sites that are currently proving so popular with users and virtual worlds such as second life will have hd 2-way video conferencing included as standard .
downloading increase but in today 's world there is no real evidence of pent-up demand for more bandwidth .
" no-one is screaming for 50mbps now aside from a few geeks who wo n't really do anything useful with it but at the same time it is remarkable people 's ability to use capacity , " said tim johnson , chief analyst at broadband research firm point topic .
for many the case for fast networks is one of " build it and they will come " .
uk internet service provider plusnet has noticed a marked increase in the amount of downloading its users are doing - up to 6.4 gigabytes per month from 5 gigabytes this time last year .
when it upgraded customers to a 8mbps connection - which is the service 70 % of its users now have - it saw a 25 % increase in usage .
" every time we 've seen an increase in speed , applications have come along to swallow it up , " said neil armstrong , product director at plusnet .
some of the answers to how consumers will may use future capacity lie in what others are already doing with it .
south korea is often held up as the most technically advanced nation in the world when it comes to broadband .
households in the cities enjoy between 50mbps and 100mbps on average .
much of the demand for bandwidth in south korea comes from gamers , where video games seem to be a national pastime .
it is not just bandwidth that gamers need , it is speed of response , or latency but as a general rule the faster the download speeds , the faster the upload speeds and that is a must for online gaming .
in the uk the gaming market is also growing and for some , such as professional gamer michael o 'dell , there is a belief that gaming is about to go mass market .
according to a survey conducted by broadbandchoices.co.uk , nearly half of the online population -lrb- 48 % -rrb- play online games .
despite this only 19 % said they wanted high definition gaming services from next-generation broadband .
but for mr o 'dell , who heads up team dignitas - a group of professional gamers competing for some serious prize-money - super-fast broadband speed is not a luxury but a necessity if his team wants to compete on the global stage .
swedish gamers enjoy speeds of up to 100mbps as standard in south korea , 43 % of the population has a presence in the online gaming world 19 % of brits say they play online games broadband speeds around the world most of his players languish on 2mbps connections and some are of poor quality making it harder for them to practice .
" it is difficult for people to play competitively online due to their connections .
it is well-known in the gaming world that the swedes have the best connections in europe , with many getting a 100mbps for £ 14 a month .
no-one in the uk can get that , " he said .
it is in great contrast to the public gaming tournaments they attend , such as the recent i32 event hosted at newbury racecourse , where speeds of up to 100mbps are easily attainable thanks to the use of so-called local area networks .
at these lan parties , conditions for gaming are perfect , said mr o 'dell .
" we have a super high-speed network which allows up to a thousand people to play without any performance issues .
that is the ideal situation , " he said .

by jane wakefield technology reporter , bbc news super-fast broadband is a must for gamers a lot of what has been written about broadband has focused on obsession with speed .
but for most consumers the size of the pipe or the bandwidth it carries is of little importance as long as they can get done all the things they need to get done .
without the obvious need for more bandwidth it is hard for companies such as bt to justify committing to a multi-billion spend on new networks .
yet for the services to happen the capacity needs to be there .
this chicken and egg dilemma is perhaps the biggest facing the industry as it considers its next move in the broadband sphere .
ofcom has been proactive in the debate and is currently in the middle of a consultation on the issue but even it admits there is no obvious killer app .
" we are struggling to see new commercial applications .
the same old applications are popping up that did when broadband was being talked about- such as video-conferencing and telemedicine , " said clive carter , principal of strategy and market developments at ofcom .
video networking hd is n't just for wildlife documentaries most pundits agree that a new age is dawning where using your broadband connection for a bit of web surfing and sending the odd e-mail has ended in favour of video-dominated applications services such as youtube have proved that consumers want to watch video online and this has gathered pace with offering such as the bbc iplayer and channel 4 's catch-up service allowing viewers to access on-demand tv .
according to nielsen online , some 21 million britons -lrb- 63 % of those online -rrb- visited tv , video and movies sites in september 2007 , which is a rise of 28 % from the same time last year with the time they spent on these sites up 91 % .
" britons are displaying an increasingly significant appetite for supplementing their viewing habits online , " said nielsen online analyst alex burmeister .
" whether it 's additional content related to a particular tv programme or actually watching episodes or videos through their computer , we are starting to see a significant spread of entertainment consumption form the so-called lean back method of a tv to the lean forward method of the pc , " he said .
in a 100mbps world , pundits expect that the social networking sites that are currently proving so popular with users and virtual worlds such as second life will have hd 2-way video conferencing included as standard .
downloading increase is there evidence of pent-up demand for faster services ?
but in today 's world there is no real evidence of pent-up demand for more bandwidth .
" no-one is screaming for 50mbps now aside from a few geeks who wo n't really do anything useful with it but at the same time it is remarkable people 's ability to use capacity , " said tim johnson , chief analyst at broadband research firm point topic .
for many the case for fast networks is one of " build it and they will come " .
uk internet service provider plusnet has noticed a marked increase in the amount of downloading its users are doing - up to 6.4 gigabytes per month from 5 gigabytes this time last year .
when it upgraded customers to a 8mbps connection - which is the service 70 % of its users now have - it saw a 25 % increase in usage .
" every time we 've seen an increase in speed , applications have come along to swallow it up , " said neil armstrong , product director at plusnet .
some of the answers to how consumers will may use future capacity lie in what others are already doing with it .
south korea is often held up as the most technically advanced nation in the world when it comes to broadband .
households in the cities enjoy between 50mbps and 100mbps on average .
much of the demand for bandwidth in south korea comes from gamers , where video games seem to be a national pastime .
it is not just bandwidth that gamers need , it is speed of response , or latency but as a general rule the faster the download speeds , the faster the upload speeds and that is a must for online gaming .
in the uk the gaming market is also growing and for some , such as professional gamer michael o 'dell , there is a belief that gaming is about to go mass market .
according to a survey conducted by broadbandchoices.co.uk , nearly half of the online population -lrb- 48 % -rrb- play online games .
despite this only 19 % said they wanted high definition gaming services from next-generation broadband .
but for mr o 'dell , who heads up team dignitas - a group of professional gamers competing for some serious prize-money - super-fast broadband speed is not a luxury but a necessity if his team wants to compete on the global stage .
swedish gamers enjoy speeds of up to 100mbps as standard in south korea , 43 % of the population has a presence in the online gaming world 19 % of brits say they play online games broadband speeds around the world most of his players languish on 2mbps connections and some are of poor quality making it harder for them to practice .
" it is difficult for people to play competitively online due to their connections .
it is well-known in the gaming world that the swedes have the best connections in europe , with many getting a 100mbps for £ 14 a month .
no-one in the uk can get that , " he said .
it is in great contrast to the public gaming tournaments they attend , such as the recent i32 event hosted at newbury racecourse , where speeds of up to 100mbps are easily attainable thanks to the use of so-called local area networks .
at these lan parties , conditions for gaming are perfect , said mr o 'dell .
" we have a super high-speed network which allows up to a thousand people to play without any performance issues .
that is the ideal situation , " he said .

by jane wakefield technology reporter , bbc news super-fast broadband is a must for gamers a lot of what has been written about broadband has focused on obsession with speed .
but for most consumers the size of the pipe or the bandwidth it carries is of little importance as long as they can get done all the things they need to get done .
without the obvious need for more bandwidth it is hard for companies such as bt to justify committing to a multi-billion spend on new networks .
yet for the services to happen the capacity needs to be there .
this chicken and egg dilemma is perhaps the biggest facing the industry as it considers its next move in the broadband sphere .
ofcom has been proactive in the debate and is currently in the middle of a consultation on the issue but even it admits there is no obvious killer app .
" we are struggling to see new commercial applications .
the same old applications are popping up that did when broadband was being talked about- such as video-conferencing and telemedicine , " said clive carter , principal of strategy and market developments at ofcom .
video networking hd is n't just for wildlife documentaries most pundits agree that a new age is dawning where using your broadband connection for a bit of web surfing and sending the odd e-mail has ended in favour of video-dominated applications services such as youtube have proved that consumers want to watch video online and this has gathered pace with offering such as the bbc iplayer and channel 4 's catch-up service allowing viewers to access on-demand tv .
according to nielsen online , some 21 million britons -lrb- 63 % of those online -rrb- visited tv , video and movies sites in september 2007 , which is a rise of 28 % from the same time last year with the time they spent on these sites up 91 % .
" britons are displaying an increasingly significant appetite for supplementing their viewing habits online , " said nielsen online analyst alex burmeister .
" whether it 's additional content related to a particular tv programme or actually watching episodes or videos through their computer , we are starting to see a significant spread of entertainment consumption form the so-called lean back method of a tv to the lean forward method of the pc , " he said .
in a 100mbps world , pundits expect that the social networking sites that are currently proving so popular with users and virtual worlds such as second life will have hd 2-way video conferencing included as standard .
downloading increase is there evidence of pent-up demand for faster services ?
but in today 's world there is no real evidence of pent-up demand for more bandwidth .
" no-one is screaming for 50mbps now aside from a few geeks who wo n't really do anything useful with it but at the same time it is remarkable people 's ability to use capacity , " said tim johnson , chief analyst at broadband research firm point topic .
for many the case for fast networks is one of " build it and they will come " .
uk internet service provider plusnet has noticed a marked increase in the amount of downloading its users are doing - up to 6.4 gigabytes per month from 5 gigabytes this time last year .
when it upgraded customers to a 8mbps connection - which is the service 70 % of its users now have - it saw a 25 % increase in usage .
" every time we 've seen an increase in speed , applications have come along to swallow it up , " said neil armstrong , product director at plusnet .
some of the answers to how consumers will may use future capacity lie in what others are already doing with it .
south korea is often held up as the most technically advanced nation in the world when it comes to broadband .
households in the cities enjoy between 50mbps and 100mbps on average .
much of the demand for bandwidth in south korea comes from gamers , where video games seem to be a national pastime .
it is not just bandwidth that gamers need , it is speed of response , or latency but as a general rule the faster the download speeds , the faster the upload speeds and that is a must for online gaming .
in the uk the gaming market is also growing and for some , such as professional gamer michael o 'dell , there is a belief that gaming is about to go mass market .
according to a survey conducted by broadbandchoices.co.uk , nearly half of the online population -lrb- 48 % -rrb- play online games .
despite this only 19 % said they wanted high definition gaming services from next-generation broadband .
but for mr o 'dell , who heads up team dignitas - a group of professional gamers competing for some serious prize-money - super-fast broadband speed is not a luxury but a necessity if his team wants to compete on the global stage .
swedish gamers enjoy speeds of up to 100mbps as standard in south korea , 43 % of the population has a presence in the online gaming world 19 % of brits say they play online games broadband speeds around the world most of his players languish on 2mbps connections and some are of poor quality making it harder for them to practice .
" it is difficult for people to play competitively online due to their connections .
it is well-known in the gaming world that the swedes have the best connections in europe , with many getting a 100mbps for £ 14 a month .
no-one in the uk can get that , " he said .
it is in great contrast to the public gaming tournaments they attend , such as the recent i32 event hosted at newbury racecourse , where speeds of up to 100mbps are easily attainable thanks to the use of so-called local area networks .
at these lan parties , conditions for gaming are perfect , said mr o 'dell .
" we have a super high-speed network which allows up to a thousand people to play without any performance issues .
that is the ideal situation , " he said .
while gaming is likely to play a role in hoovering up next-generation capacity , few think it will be the killer application for the mass market .
it seems likely that the real bandwidth basher will come from a service yet to be thought of and one that may only come about when the extra capacity is there to serve it .

south korea is often held up as the most technically advanced nation in the world when it comes to broadband .
households in the cities enjoy between 50mbps and 100mbps on average .
much of the demand for bandwidth in south korea comes from gamers , where video games seem to be a national pastime .
it is not just bandwidth that gamers need , it is speed of response , or latency but as a general rule the faster the download speeds , the faster the upload speeds and that is a must for online gaming .
in the uk the gaming market is also growing and for some , such as professional gamer michael o 'dell , there is a belief that gaming is about to go mass market .
according to a survey conducted by broadbandchoices.co.uk , nearly half of the online population -lrb- 48 % -rrb- play online games .
despite this only 19 % said they wanted high definition gaming services from next-generation broadband .
but for mr o 'dell , who heads up team dignitas - a group of professional gamers competing for some serious prize-money - super-fast broadband speed is not a luxury but a necessity if his team wants to compete on the global stage .
swedish gamers enjoy speeds of up to 100mbps as standard in south korea , 43 % of the population has a presence in the online gaming world 19 % of brits say they play online games broadband speeds around the world most of his players languish on 2mbps connections and some are of poor quality making it harder for them to practice .

no-one in the uk can get that , " he said .
it is in great contrast to the public gaming tournaments they attend , such as the recent i32 event hosted at newbury racecourse , where speeds of up to 100mbps are easily attainable thanks to the use of so-called local area networks .
at these lan parties , conditions for gaming are perfect , said mr o 'dell .
" we have a super high-speed network which allows up to a thousand people to play without any performance issues .
that is the ideal situation , " he said .
while gaming is likely to play a role in hoovering up next-generation capacity , few think it will be the killer application for the mass market .
it seems likely that the real bandwidth basher will come from a service yet to be thought of and one that may only come about when the extra capacity is there to serve it .

by jane wakefield technology reporter , bbc news super-fast broadband is a must for gamers a lot of what has been written about broadband has focused on obsession with speed .
but for most consumers the size of the pipe or the bandwidth it carries is of little importance as long as they can get done all the things they need to get done .
without the obvious need for more bandwidth it is hard for companies such as bt to justify committing to a multi-billion spend on new networks .

net users in the uk have rated the ability to download dvd-quality films quickly as the service they most want from next-generation broadband .
in a survey conducted by broadbandchoices.co.uk , users put it ahead of video calls , high definition video downloads and home surveillance .
some 18 % said they downloaded films although it was the online activity they devoted the least time to .
the most popular activities are still sufing and checking e-mail .
some 61 % rated " downloading dvd quality films in five minutes " as the most interesting application for future broadband services .
the survey was intended to get a feel from what consumers may want from next-generation broadband in the light of recent questions about how and when the uk should move to super-fast services .
what future services do people want ?
downloading dvd quality film in five minutes - 61 % downloading high definition tv programmes on demand - 48 % video calling to friends / family over the internet - 46 % cctv home surveillance via broadband - 42 % high defnition gaming services - 19 % what will deliver next-generation broadband ?
however , there was uncertainty over how whether people would be prepared to pay extra for such services , with 60 % responding either no or do n't know .
the services people rated the most exciting drivers of next-generation broadband were the ones they spent the least time on currently .
" from our results it does appear a little contradictory that respondents rated ' watching tv ' or downloading films as being the least amount of time spent on the internet in a week and yet when asked which future service would be of most interest rated them as the most popular , " said michael phillips , product director at broadbandchoices.co.uk.
" it could be that current services are not at a high enough standard to warrant utilising video services .
if speeds were improved , consumers are more likely to use broadband to watch tv and / or download films , " said mr phillips .
gaming regulator ofcom is in the middle of a consultation on the issue future net services while mps hosted a westminster eforum on the issue two weeks ago , which was followed up by a broadband summit , hosted by minister for competitiveness stephen timms .
the issue hinges on whether the uk is falling behind the rest of the world , where fibre networks capable of delivering speeds of up to 100mbps are starting to become commonplace .
in south korea , one of the world 's most advanced nations when it comes to super-fast broadband , some 90 % percent of homes can get connections between 50 and 100mbps .
the biggest driver there is gaming where some 43 % percent have a presence in the online gaming world .
in the uk , it is hoped that video , and particularly high-definition video , will drive services .

bt and ofcom have stated in recent weeks that there is no clear demand for more bandwidth from consumers .
" with consumer demand for upgrading the uk 's broadband infrastructure being unclear there may even be some advantage in the uk holding back on broadband development in the short term and instead keep track on broadband progress in other countries to help us learn from their experiences , " said mr phillips .
there are many who think the most important job is to sort out current broadband speeds , where there is a huge disparity between advertised speeds and the speeds people are actually getting .
a report from consumer group which earlier in the year found that some customers on so-called 8mbps packages actually get less than 1mbps .
ofcom 's own speeds tests found that the average customer got 39 % of their promised speed .
factors that affect the speed users get include the distance they are from the exchange and the quality of wiring within their home .
" we need transparency from providers on the kind of speeds customers can actually expect to get , rather than flashy advertising and ever increasing top speeds and this needs to be carried forward with the future of broadband , " said mr phillips .

net users in the uk have rated the ability to download dvd-quality films quickly as the service they most want from next-generation broadband .
in a survey conducted by broadbandchoices.co.uk , users put it ahead of video calls , high definition video downloads and home surveillance .
some 18 % said they downloaded films although it was the online activity they devoted the least time to .
the most popular activities are still sufing and checking e-mail .
some 61 % rated " downloading dvd quality films in five minutes " as the most interesting application for future broadband services .
the survey was intended to get a feel from what consumers may want from next-generation broadband in the light of recent questions about how and when the uk should move to super-fast services .

net users in the uk have rated the ability to download dvd-quality films quickly as the service they most want from next-generation broadband .
in a survey conducted by broadbandchoices.co.uk , users put it ahead of video calls , high definition video downloads and home surveillance .
some 18 % said they downloaded films although it was the online activity they devoted the least time to .
the most popular activities are still sufing and checking e-mail .
some 61 % rated " downloading dvd quality films in five minutes " as the most interesting application for future broadband services .
the survey was intended to get a feel from what consumers may want from next-generation broadband in the light of recent questions about how and when the uk should move to super-fast services .
what future services do people want ?

however , there was uncertainty over how whether people would be prepared to pay extra for such services , with 60 % responding either no or do n't know .
the services people rated the most exciting drivers of next-generation broadband were the ones they spent the least time on currently .
" from our results it does appear a little contradictory that respondents rated ' watching tv ' or downloading films as being the least amount of time spent on the internet in a week and yet when asked which future service would be of most interest rated them as the most popular , " said michael phillips , product director at broadbandchoices.co.uk.
" it could be that current services are not at a high enough standard to warrant utilising video services .

the issue hinges on whether the uk is falling behind the rest of the world , where fibre networks capable of delivering speeds of up to 100mbps are starting to become commonplace .
in south korea , one of the world 's most advanced nations when it comes to super-fast broadband , some 90 % percent of homes can get connections between 50 and 100mbps .
the biggest driver there is gaming where some 43 % percent have a presence in the online gaming world .

gaming regulator ofcom is in the middle of a consultation on the issue future net services while mps hosted a westminster eforum on the issue two weeks ago , which was followed up by a broadband summit , hosted by minister for competitiveness stephen timms .
the issue hinges on whether the uk is falling behind the rest of the world , where fibre networks capable of delivering speeds of up to 100mbps are starting to become commonplace .
in south korea , one of the world 's most advanced nations when it comes to super-fast broadband , some 90 % percent of homes can get connections between 50 and 100mbps .
the biggest driver there is gaming where some 43 % percent have a presence in the online gaming world .
in the uk , it is hoped that video , and particularly high-definition video , will drive services .
current issues what do people do with current broadband 100 % check email 98 % surf / shop / bank 56 % watch video clips 49 % play online games 46 % download music and films 37 % listen to the radio 28 % watch tv programmes broadband speeds around the world virgin media has pledged to upgrade its cable network - which reaches more than 50 % of the population - by the end of next year while bt is considering the option of rolling out a limited fibre network .
bt and ofcom have stated in recent weeks that there is no clear demand for more bandwidth from consumers .
" with consumer demand for upgrading the uk 's broadband infrastructure being unclear there may even be some advantage in the uk holding back on broadband development in the short term and instead keep track on broadband progress in other countries to help us learn from their experiences , " said mr phillips .
there are many who think the most important job is to sort out current broadband speeds , where there is a huge disparity between advertised speeds and the speeds people are actually getting .
a report from consumer group which earlier in the year found that some customers on so-called 8mbps packages actually get less than 1mbps .
ofcom 's own speeds tests found that the average customer got 39 % of their promised speed .
factors that affect the speed users get include the distance they are from the exchange and the quality of wiring within their home .
" we need transparency from providers on the kind of speeds customers can actually expect to get , rather than flashy advertising and ever increasing top speeds and this needs to be carried forward with the future of broadband , " said mr phillips .

mr verhofstadt , a dutch-speaking liberal leader , described his mission as " very temporary and very limited " .
the political crisis has left belgium without a government since elections in june .
the dutch- and french-speaking parties are split over autonomy plans .
flemish christian democrat leader yves leterme has given up coalition talks .
mr verhofstadt said he had " hesitated for a long time before accepting " the request from king albert ii .
the king asked him to " inform him in the very short term about the way to end the current impasse " , a statement from the royal palace said .
there had been speculation that the king would ask mr verhofstadt to lead an emergency government .
instead , mr verhofstadt has the job of bringing the political rivals back to the negotiating table and brokering a deal on institutional reforms .
post-election setback " our nation is going through one of the most serious political crises of the past decades , " he said on monday evening .
on saturday , mr leterme , whose party narrowly won the election , gave up his second attempt to form a coalition , amid recriminations from french-speakers that his demands for greater devolution risked splitting the country .
mr leterme was nominated to form a government after his party came ahead in the poll , winning 30 seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament , ending eight years in opposition .
his flemish christian democrats said the dutch- and french-speaking liberals had signed up to his reform programme , but that the french-speaking christian democrats had declined to do so .
correspondents say the french-speaking southern region of wallonia fears that greater regional self-rule will deprive it of federal tax revenues and have a negative impact on social services .
unemployment in wallonia is more than double that of flanders .
the walloons make up about 40 % of belgium 's 10.5m population , while the flemings , who are based in the northern half of the country , represent the majority .
no single party bridges the linguistic and geographic gulf between belgium 's two regions .
