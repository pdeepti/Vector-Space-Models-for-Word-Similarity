johannes hübner from germany 's avd motoring club said drivers should brace for higher prices at fueling stations across the country . gas goes up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices will climb even further " we expect fuel prices to increase by another three to four cent per liter , " he said .
" we 'll have to see whether oil companies will keep prices that high throughout the year .
much will depend on developments on the global energy market .
but i think that consumers will have to put up with a two-cent-per-liter hike on average in 2007 . " driving may also become more expensive for haulers using inter-city road connections .
the road toll system for heavy trucks no longer applies to the autobahn motorway network only , but has been extended to three heavily frequented overland roads leading through several german states . more money for pension funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers will have to pay more for their pensions germans will also have to fork out more this year for their contributions to the statutory pension system .
premiums have increased by almost half a percent to total 19.9 percent of people 's incomes .
taxes on capital gains will be levied at a much lower ceiling . and a special wealth tax goes up by 3 percent for individuals making more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 330,000 -rrb- a year .
also , special benefits for commuters are cut completely if the distance between their homes and workplaces is under 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- . checking welfare recipients bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials will check unemployment recipients more carefully in addition , agencies are now taking a closer look at who 's entitled to state benefits . " whoever turns down an acceptable job offer will see their unemployment benefit payments reduced , " said john-philip hammersen , a spokesman for the central employment agency in nuremberg . he added that the abuse of the welfare system has to be curbed dramatically . " regulations to this effect will be applied more stringently from now on , " he said .
" those who opt to turn down a reasonable offer for the second or third time will risk losing up to 100 percent of all benefits . " nevertheless experts do n't expect a new round of public moaning and groaning over this year 's financial challenges .
after all , most people here do seem to appreciate that the good times are over and unlikely to return any time soon . harry graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : good news for germany 's economy although sales tax increases at the beginning of 2007 are likely to temporarily dampen the german economy , the economic outlook for next year is extremely positive , says dw-radio 's karl zawadzky .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 02.01.2007 drumming up support for the eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has much on her agenda as she kicks off the eu presidency .
her biggest challenge , however , will be breathing new life into a nearly dead eu constitution , says dw 's bernd riegert . germans are capable of enthusiasm .
they clearly displayed that when they hosted the soccer world cup in the summer of 2006 .
if only a tad of such enthusiasm flows into germany 's approach to the eu presidency , much can be achieved . merkel can succeed greatly if she manages to handle european politics not with scepticism and doubt , but with a positive , extroverted approach .
she should motivate her european team in a manner akin to former german soccer coach jürgen klinsmann , who took his players all the way to the 2006 world cup semi-final . the stalled eu constitution desperately needs someone with that kind of enthusiasm to get it back on track .
with the 50th anniversary of european unification coincidentally occurring during germany 's eu presidency tenure , merkel and her team have a major chance to rally support for the eu treaty , and thus , for europe 's future . clear results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel looked toward the future of the eu during her new year 's address hopefully , the chancellor will do more than merely give nice speeches and organize multi-cultural events near the brandenburg gate in berlin . the european political " fan " is going to have to see clear results in the eu constitution debate in order to get enthused about the treaty .
in keeping with the soccer metaphor , what is needed is scored goals rather than artful dribbling . europeans want to know what the constitution is to be composed of , what rules it should contain , and how it can be adopted .
two years following france and the netherland 's rejection of the constitution should be enough time to have redefined where things should go . little leeway to be fair , one does have to admit that " coach merkel " does not have much leeway in establishing the framework . france will elect a new president this year ; britain will gain a new prime minister this summer .
no one knows how the new leaders of these two important eu countries will behave in the debate over the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer coach jürgen klinsmann is known for his sunny attitude the eu presidency under germany must not only tackle the eu 's constitution , it must also urgently improve ties with gas-supplier russia , forge relationships with other possible gas-suppliers in central asia and take a different approach to the middle east , from which europe receives much of its energy . attitude change ? merkel can start in her own backyard in drumming up support for europe .
many of her ministers are against a pan-european collectivization of tasks . the attitude tends to be along the lines of : everything bad stems from the eu bureaucracy in brussels ; everything good will be decided by berlin .
unfortunately , this simplistic , false logic is widespread . six months is not much time to fulfil so many expectations .

her biggest challenge , however , will be breathing new life into a nearly dead eu constitution , says dw 's bernd riegert . germans are capable of enthusiasm .
they clearly displayed that when they hosted the soccer world cup in the summer of 2006 .
if only a tad of such enthusiasm flows into germany 's approach to the eu presidency , much can be achieved . merkel can succeed greatly if she manages to handle european politics not with scepticism and doubt , but with a positive , extroverted approach .
she should motivate her european team in a manner akin to former german soccer coach jürgen klinsmann , who took his players all the way to the 2006 world cup semi-final . the stalled eu constitution desperately needs someone with that kind of enthusiasm to get it back on track .
with the 50th anniversary of european unification coincidentally occurring during germany 's eu presidency tenure , merkel and her team have a major chance to rally support for the eu treaty , and thus , for europe 's future . clear results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel looked toward the future of the eu during her new year 's address hopefully , the chancellor will do more than merely give nice speeches and organize multi-cultural events near the brandenburg gate in berlin . the european political " fan " is going to have to see clear results in the eu constitution debate in order to get enthused about the treaty .
in keeping with the soccer metaphor , what is needed is scored goals rather than artful dribbling . europeans want to know what the constitution is to be composed of , what rules it should contain , and how it can be adopted .
two years following france and the netherland 's rejection of the constitution should be enough time to have redefined where things should go . little leeway to be fair , one does have to admit that " coach merkel " does not have much leeway in establishing the framework . france will elect a new president this year ; britain will gain a new prime minister this summer .
no one knows how the new leaders of these two important eu countries will behave in the debate over the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer coach jürgen klinsmann is known for his sunny attitude the eu presidency under germany must not only tackle the eu 's constitution , it must also urgently improve ties with gas-supplier russia , forge relationships with other possible gas-suppliers in central asia and take a different approach to the middle east , from which europe receives much of its energy . attitude change ? merkel can start in her own backyard in drumming up support for europe .
many of her ministers are against a pan-european collectivization of tasks . the attitude tends to be along the lines of : everything bad stems from the eu bureaucracy in brussels ; everything good will be decided by berlin .
unfortunately , this simplistic , false logic is widespread . six months is not much time to fulfil so many expectations .

the site was initially to be sealed up , but is now planned as a museum . ron lerke calls out a greeting and his voice echoes into the darkness - 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of it , to be exact .
he is underground , in what used to be the west german government 's ultra-secret atomic bunker , located deep in western germany near the french border .
and it ’ s here , in a tunnel stretching into a black abyss , that a restored section of the bunker will be used for the first time . lerke is head engineer of the project to turn the bunker into a tourist site .
he walks slowly with a flashlight through the bunker , 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- underground , as danger warnings line the walls on the way to decontamination showers , sleeping quarters , a hospital , even a room set up for cutting hair . most of the rooms are empty and unlit , with dirt floors .
in the first 100 meters , at least five massive steel doors are set into the wall , ready to slide shut in case of emergency . this area is a tiny sliver in the 19 kilometers of subterranean passageways , but when it ’ s opened up as a museum in early 2008 , it will offer the public what they never would have seen - an area where a chosen 3,000 people would have holed up for 30 days after a nuclear attack . “ we call it the fortress of the nuclear age , " said florian mausbach , president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning who leads the project . secrecy spurred public interest in the end , mausbach says the bunker was never actually used to house government officials , who would have left west germany ’ s nearby capital of bonn to find refuge there .
by the late 1990 ’ s , after the capital had moved to berlin , lawmakers decided to close down the structure , and started in 2001 to seal it up and bury it forever . but the public wanted a peek inside , said mausbach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tunnels stretch for 18 kilometers “ there 's a lot of interest by the people around that area and beyond to look around in the tunnel , because it was always a secret , " he said .
" so i thought we should keep part of the tunnel . " its location typifies the cold war balance between life and destruction , added mausbach . after the government toyed with the idea of selling the tunnel - some ideas were to convert it into a disco or an area to cultivate mushrooms - mausbach said the finance ministry agreed on the idea of a small museum , which was actually cheaper than sealing the area up forever . not really a secret the museum entrance is nestled into a hill , amidst a backdrop of dense forest and vineyards overlooking the town of ahrweiler .
down a dirt path , through a gate lined with barbed wire , is one of 38 entrances to this network of bunkers . markus heibel of the federal office for building and regional planning said that , though the existence of the bunker was meant to be a well-kept secret during the cold war and afterward , it required almost 200 local employees . " it was not really a secret , " he said .
" they also knew about it in east germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker was a well-known secret in fact , the underground labyrinth dates back to the late 19th century , when tunnels meant for moving supplies by train were built all the way into france .
during world war ii , concentration camp prisoners slaved away building v2 rockets in the tunnels .
by 1960 , west germany began the 12-year project of turning it all into a nuclear bunker in compliance with nato stipulations . with all that history , locals welcome turning the bunker into a museum . jürgen reiche , head of haus der geschichte museum in bonn , leads the museum side of this project .
he says the bunker ’ s history closely parallels that of germany - and that restoring even some of the complex into a museum is vital to remembering germany ’ s past . “ it ’ s not only a bunker - it is part of german history , ” he said . provoking questions only four windows exist in the entire 19 kilometer complex .
one of them is near the planned entrance to the museum , with a view no larger than a sheet of paper .
it ’ s bombproof and can be covered by a sliding steel plate .
but in 2008 , it will be opened up - for a stark look at the nuclear age . as reiche looks over plans for the museum , he says that the experience will lead visitors to ask the right questions about the bunker ’ s significance , both then and now . “ if the earth is destroyed , you can ’ t live on it , " he said .

many were forced to take part in sadistic medical experiments which have left their mark six decades later .
still others saw family members killed in front of them , surviving by chance . it was these victims of the nazis forced labor program that a special fund set up six years ago tried to help .
and six years and 1.7 million victims later , the fund sent out its last checks on dec .
31 . " this is n't just about money , " günter saathoff , director of the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation that administers the fund , told the associated press .
" it 's much more about morality : these payments are one way that germany recognizes the wrongs inflicted on its victims . " profiting from slave labor the fund was created by legislation passed by the german government in 2000 after years of debate .
it started processing claims the following year .
the fund was endowed with 5.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- , with the money coming equally from both the german government and companies such as volkswagen , daimlerchrysler , bayer and deutsche bank , who profited from forced labor during the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the holocaust memorial in berlin the fund also compensated victims who currently live around europe including the former soviet union , israel and the us .

and he says that the money is insufficient . " i am thankful for what i got , " kowalewski told the associated press .
" but germany is rich - richer than us - and i think people who underwent pseudo-medical experiments should be getting payments until the end of their lives .

premiums for statutory unemployment insurance will go down , but that 's where the good news ends . a wide range of consumer goods in germany has become more expensive , thanks to a special new year 's present from the government in berlin .
it 's imposed a 3 percent valued added tax increase on clothes , cars , furniture , electrical appliances and other goods , bringing vat up to 19 percent . this is expected to reduce the shopping activities of ordinary citizens after many a shopping spree in 2006 .

her biggest challenge , however , will be breathing new life into a nearly dead eu constitution , says dw 's bernd riegert . germans are capable of enthusiasm .
they clearly displayed that when they hosted the soccer world cup in the summer of 2006 .
if only a tad of such enthusiasm flows into germany 's approach to the eu presidency , much can be achieved . merkel can succeed greatly if she manages to handle european politics not with scepticism and doubt , but with a positive , extroverted approach .
she should motivate her european team in a manner akin to former german soccer coach jürgen klinsmann , who took his players all the way to the 2006 world cup semi-final . the stalled eu constitution desperately needs someone with that kind of enthusiasm to get it back on track .
with the 50th anniversary of european unification coincidentally occurring during germany 's eu presidency tenure , merkel and her team have a major chance to rally support for the eu treaty , and thus , for europe 's future . clear results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel looked toward the future of the eu during her new year 's address hopefully , the chancellor will do more than merely give nice speeches and organize multi-cultural events near the brandenburg gate in berlin . the european political " fan " is going to have to see clear results in the eu constitution debate in order to get enthused about the treaty .
in keeping with the soccer metaphor , what is needed is scored goals rather than artful dribbling . europeans want to know what the constitution is to be composed of , what rules it should contain , and how it can be adopted .
two years following france and the netherland 's rejection of the constitution should be enough time to have redefined where things should go . little leeway to be fair , one does have to admit that " coach merkel " does not have much leeway in establishing the framework . france will elect a new president this year ; britain will gain a new prime minister this summer .
no one knows how the new leaders of these two important eu countries will behave in the debate over the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer coach jürgen klinsmann is known for his sunny attitude the eu presidency under germany must not only tackle the eu 's constitution , it must also urgently improve ties with gas-supplier russia , forge relationships with other possible gas-suppliers in central asia and take a different approach to the middle east , from which europe receives much of its energy . attitude change ? merkel can start in her own backyard in drumming up support for europe .
many of her ministers are against a pan-european collectivization of tasks . the attitude tends to be along the lines of : everything bad stems from the eu bureaucracy in brussels ; everything good will be decided by berlin .
unfortunately , this simplistic , false logic is widespread . six months is not much time to fulfil so many expectations .
germany will not have an easy time of it .
fanmeile -lrb- fan mile -rrb- was chosen as the german word of the year in 2006 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 02.01.2007 historic cold war bunker to become a museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entrance to the new cold war bunker museum during the cold war , a secret underground bunker for the west german government was constructed to protect a chosen few in case of an atomic attack .
the site was initially to be sealed up , but is now planned as a museum . ron lerke calls out a greeting and his voice echoes into the darkness - 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of it , to be exact .
he is underground , in what used to be the west german government 's ultra-secret atomic bunker , located deep in western germany near the french border .
and it ’ s here , in a tunnel stretching into a black abyss , that a restored section of the bunker will be used for the first time . lerke is head engineer of the project to turn the bunker into a tourist site .
he walks slowly with a flashlight through the bunker , 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- underground , as danger warnings line the walls on the way to decontamination showers , sleeping quarters , a hospital , even a room set up for cutting hair . most of the rooms are empty and unlit , with dirt floors .
in the first 100 meters , at least five massive steel doors are set into the wall , ready to slide shut in case of emergency . this area is a tiny sliver in the 19 kilometers of subterranean passageways , but when it ’ s opened up as a museum in early 2008 , it will offer the public what they never would have seen - an area where a chosen 3,000 people would have holed up for 30 days after a nuclear attack . “ we call it the fortress of the nuclear age , " said florian mausbach , president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning who leads the project . secrecy spurred public interest in the end , mausbach says the bunker was never actually used to house government officials , who would have left west germany ’ s nearby capital of bonn to find refuge there .
by the late 1990 ’ s , after the capital had moved to berlin , lawmakers decided to close down the structure , and started in 2001 to seal it up and bury it forever . but the public wanted a peek inside , said mausbach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tunnels stretch for 18 kilometers “ there 's a lot of interest by the people around that area and beyond to look around in the tunnel , because it was always a secret , " he said .
" so i thought we should keep part of the tunnel . " its location typifies the cold war balance between life and destruction , added mausbach . after the government toyed with the idea of selling the tunnel - some ideas were to convert it into a disco or an area to cultivate mushrooms - mausbach said the finance ministry agreed on the idea of a small museum , which was actually cheaper than sealing the area up forever . not really a secret the museum entrance is nestled into a hill , amidst a backdrop of dense forest and vineyards overlooking the town of ahrweiler .
down a dirt path , through a gate lined with barbed wire , is one of 38 entrances to this network of bunkers . markus heibel of the federal office for building and regional planning said that , though the existence of the bunker was meant to be a well-kept secret during the cold war and afterward , it required almost 200 local employees . " it was not really a secret , " he said .
" they also knew about it in east germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker was a well-known secret in fact , the underground labyrinth dates back to the late 19th century , when tunnels meant for moving supplies by train were built all the way into france .
during world war ii , concentration camp prisoners slaved away building v2 rockets in the tunnels .
by 1960 , west germany began the 12-year project of turning it all into a nuclear bunker in compliance with nato stipulations . with all that history , locals welcome turning the bunker into a museum . jürgen reiche , head of haus der geschichte museum in bonn , leads the museum side of this project .
he says the bunker ’ s history closely parallels that of germany - and that restoring even some of the complex into a museum is vital to remembering germany ’ s past . “ it ’ s not only a bunker - it is part of german history , ” he said . provoking questions only four windows exist in the entire 19 kilometer complex .
one of them is near the planned entrance to the museum , with a view no larger than a sheet of paper .
it ’ s bombproof and can be covered by a sliding steel plate .
but in 2008 , it will be opened up - for a stark look at the nuclear age . as reiche looks over plans for the museum , he says that the experience will lead visitors to ask the right questions about the bunker ’ s significance , both then and now . “ if the earth is destroyed , you can ’ t live on it , " he said .

" this dual role comes at a very historic time in world affairs , " said gary smith , executive director of the american academy think tank in berlin .
" germany and especially chancellor merkel have a great opportunity to exert leadership and reach concrete goals . " mighty germany europe 's biggest economy has increasingly been flexing its business , diplomatic and even , for peaceful purposes , military muscle since winning back full sovereignty following german reunification in 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank in frankfurt germany is at the core of the euro single-currency zone and the european central bank is building a huge new headquarters in frankfurt . major german corporations have adeptly ridden the wave of globalization and exports have continued to soar during 2006 , with the euro hitting near-record highs against the dollar . even the sometimes euro-skeptical wall street journal was full of praise in a recent commentary . " the competition brought on by globalization and the eu 's expansion to include 10 new states in 2004 forced a serious restructuring of the corporate sector , " the paper said . " … germany inc. was at the forefront of this mini-revolution . " diplomacy matters diplomatically , germany began talking about " national interests " and a " german path " under former chancellor gerhard schröder , who provoked the worst post-war crisis in german-american relations by using his iraq war opposition to help win his re-election in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier presents the german eu presidency program at a press conference this sort of talk - unthinkable during the cold war - has been toned down by current chancellor merkel , who nevertheless is sticking to schröder 's calls for germany to get a permanent seat on the united nations security council . as the eu 's biggest power , germany already has an upgraded un status under what is known as " p5 + germany " : the five permanent un security council members plus germany , who are dealing with issues such as the iranian nuclear crisis . military transitions germany 's military transition is one of the biggest ongoing shifts in the country 's global positioning since unification . the bundeswehr , or federal armed forces , will in coming years be forged into a 35,000-member rapid-reaction force for global operations , backed by a 70,000-member stabilization force for peacekeeping . during the transition , berlin is acquiring heavy airlift planes capable of taking troops anywhere in the world , while at the same time scrapping hundreds of the formidable leopard ii main battle tanks which once faced off against warsaw pact forces . reforms , however , are slow moving and , at present , germany still can not deploy more than 10,000 soldiers for combat or peacekeeping operations - despite a total troop strength of over 250,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is scrapping tanks for planes " the german armed forces are still structured for the cold war , " said karl-heinz kamp , security policy coordinator for the konrad adenauer foundation , which has close links to merkel 's christian democratic union party . germany 's military was dissolved in 1945 after the nazi defeat and only recreated in 1955 .

many were forced to take part in sadistic medical experiments which have left their mark six decades later .
still others saw family members killed in front of them , surviving by chance . it was these victims of the nazis forced labor program that a special fund set up six years ago tried to help .
and six years and 1.7 million victims later , the fund sent out its last checks on dec .
31 . " this is n't just about money , " günter saathoff , director of the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation that administers the fund , told the associated press .
" it 's much more about morality : these payments are one way that germany recognizes the wrongs inflicted on its victims . " profiting from slave labor the fund was created by legislation passed by the german government in 2000 after years of debate .
it started processing claims the following year .
the fund was endowed with 5.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- , with the money coming equally from both the german government and companies such as volkswagen , daimlerchrysler , bayer and deutsche bank , who profited from forced labor during the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the holocaust memorial in berlin the fund also compensated victims who currently live around europe including the former soviet union , israel and the us .
the largest group of recipients are non-jews in poland and the ukraine , who survived the war as most jews did not . saathoff said that 1.7 million victims or their descendants had received a total of 4.4 billion euros in the past six years.the remaining money will go to helping other victims or other humanitarian projects , he added . atonement although the money was intended to atone for nazi cruelty and help its victims , recipients often said that while they were grateful for the funds , they were n't enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial to nazi victims in the former nazi concentration camp of sachsenhausen polish victim , jerzy kowalewski , 83 , was given 15,000 euros to compensate for his treatment at the hands of the nazis : he was brutally beaten , forced to work at auschwitz and the subject of medical experiments . kowalewski uses the money to help pay for medical treatments for his adult son who has illnesses he attributes to the medical experiments done on himself at auschwitz .
and he says that the money is insufficient . " i am thankful for what i got , " kowalewski told the associated press .
" but germany is rich - richer than us - and i think people who underwent pseudo-medical experiments should be getting payments until the end of their lives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 02.01.2007 historic cold war bunker to become a museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entrance to the new cold war bunker museum during the cold war , a secret underground bunker for the west german government was constructed to protect a chosen few in case of an atomic attack .
the site was initially to be sealed up , but is now planned as a museum . ron lerke calls out a greeting and his voice echoes into the darkness - 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of it , to be exact .
he is underground , in what used to be the west german government 's ultra-secret atomic bunker , located deep in western germany near the french border .
and it ’ s here , in a tunnel stretching into a black abyss , that a restored section of the bunker will be used for the first time . lerke is head engineer of the project to turn the bunker into a tourist site .
he walks slowly with a flashlight through the bunker , 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- underground , as danger warnings line the walls on the way to decontamination showers , sleeping quarters , a hospital , even a room set up for cutting hair . most of the rooms are empty and unlit , with dirt floors .
in the first 100 meters , at least five massive steel doors are set into the wall , ready to slide shut in case of emergency . this area is a tiny sliver in the 19 kilometers of subterranean passageways , but when it ’ s opened up as a museum in early 2008 , it will offer the public what they never would have seen - an area where a chosen 3,000 people would have holed up for 30 days after a nuclear attack . “ we call it the fortress of the nuclear age , " said florian mausbach , president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning who leads the project . secrecy spurred public interest in the end , mausbach says the bunker was never actually used to house government officials , who would have left west germany ’ s nearby capital of bonn to find refuge there .
by the late 1990 ’ s , after the capital had moved to berlin , lawmakers decided to close down the structure , and started in 2001 to seal it up and bury it forever . but the public wanted a peek inside , said mausbach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tunnels stretch for 18 kilometers “ there 's a lot of interest by the people around that area and beyond to look around in the tunnel , because it was always a secret , " he said .
" so i thought we should keep part of the tunnel . " its location typifies the cold war balance between life and destruction , added mausbach . after the government toyed with the idea of selling the tunnel - some ideas were to convert it into a disco or an area to cultivate mushrooms - mausbach said the finance ministry agreed on the idea of a small museum , which was actually cheaper than sealing the area up forever . not really a secret the museum entrance is nestled into a hill , amidst a backdrop of dense forest and vineyards overlooking the town of ahrweiler .
down a dirt path , through a gate lined with barbed wire , is one of 38 entrances to this network of bunkers . markus heibel of the federal office for building and regional planning said that , though the existence of the bunker was meant to be a well-kept secret during the cold war and afterward , it required almost 200 local employees . " it was not really a secret , " he said .
" they also knew about it in east germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker was a well-known secret in fact , the underground labyrinth dates back to the late 19th century , when tunnels meant for moving supplies by train were built all the way into france .
during world war ii , concentration camp prisoners slaved away building v2 rockets in the tunnels .
by 1960 , west germany began the 12-year project of turning it all into a nuclear bunker in compliance with nato stipulations . with all that history , locals welcome turning the bunker into a museum . jürgen reiche , head of haus der geschichte museum in bonn , leads the museum side of this project .
he says the bunker ’ s history closely parallels that of germany - and that restoring even some of the complex into a museum is vital to remembering germany ’ s past . “ it ’ s not only a bunker - it is part of german history , ” he said . provoking questions only four windows exist in the entire 19 kilometer complex .
one of them is near the planned entrance to the museum , with a view no larger than a sheet of paper .
it ’ s bombproof and can be covered by a sliding steel plate .
but in 2008 , it will be opened up - for a stark look at the nuclear age . as reiche looks over plans for the museum , he says that the experience will lead visitors to ask the right questions about the bunker ’ s significance , both then and now . “ if the earth is destroyed , you can ’ t live on it , " he said .

1 , might be one of the few additions to the euro zone until after 2010 because of eu members ' inability or reluctance to adopt the euro . five years after 12 eu members switched to the single european currency , hopes for a rapid expansion of the euro zone have been dashed by delays in eastern europe and a lack of interest from west european holdouts . in 2002 , 304 million european citizens in countries including france , germany , ireland and spain waved goodbye to their francs , marks , punts and pesetas , and expectations were high that they would be joined by millions more by the end of the decade . with the exception of britain and denmark , which have special euro zone opt-outs , all european union members are supposed eventually to make the euro their official currency . economists at the time predicted that the 10 countries which joined the eu in 2004 , mostly former members of the communist bloc , would adopt the euro no later than 2010 . a first wave of three or four countries was expected to be ready by january 2007 . but the forecasters failed to take into account that there would be governments that were able but unwilling to adopt the euro , others that were willing but unable , and some that were neither willing nor able .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia is the first post communist country to have the euro in the end , the club will gain just one new member on january 1 , when slovenia 's two million inhabitants give up their tolars . spectacular growth cyprus ' population of 750,000 and the 400,000 maltese are expected to swap their pounds and liras the following year . slovakia , with a population of 5.4 million , is also on course to switch from the koruna in january 2009 , despite the formation earlier this year of a coalition government including euro-sceptic populists and the far right . but things are looking more complicated for the six other countries that joined the eu two years ago , taking the bloc 's membership to 25 . the baltic nations of lithuania and estonia had hoped to join the euro zone in 2007 .
in theory , nothing could have been easier . the lithuanian lita and the estonian kroon are tied to the euro and the health of their public finances , a key measure for euro zone membership , causes envy in countries like france or germany . but both are experiencing spectacular growth - in estonia the rate was 12 percent in the third quarter alone - and consumer prices are rising slightly faster than in the rest of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland happily joined the eu but not the euro zone the maastricht treaty which laid the foundations of the eurozone sets inflation caps for members , and the baltic states have been just above the target . indulgence to founders lithuania was annoyed that it did not get a green light earlier this year .
in march , its average inflation rate was just 0.06 percent above the limit . the stern stance of the 12 euro zone members towards potential members was a surprise for economists , who say the inflation criteria are irrelevant for countries that are catching up with western europe and have already pegged their currencies to the euro . in order to achieve the living standards of the eu 's western members , the former communist countries have little choice but to let salaries and prices increase , which inevitably fuels inflation . the current intransigence contrasts with the indulgence towards euro zone founders such as belgium and italy .
bildunterschrift : slovenia 's new currency has national symbols on it both were allowed to adopt the single currency even though their public debt represented more than 100 percent of their gross domestic product .
under euro zone rules , the maximum is supposed to be 60 percent . poland seemingly uninterested while they are solid supporters of the euro , the baltic states have bitterly resigned themselves to having to wait - but are making their discontent known . " it would not be very good if the otherwise good performing countries are left out of the euro area for an extended period , just because of the inflation criterion , " estonian finance minister aivar soerd told afp . apart from slovakia , other new eu members in central europe have put the euro on the back burner . poland , where euro-sceptic conservatives have been in power for a year , has declined to set a timetable , simply saying that it aims to hold a referendum in 2010 on whether to give up the zloty - even though joining the single currency was one of the planks of the eu membership treaty already approved by polish voters in 2003 . warsaw points to the example of sweden , which joined the eu in 1995 and decided to keep the krona after a referendum in 2003 . hungary , which faces a widening public deficit , has pushed its euro zone target back to 2013 , while the czech republic is planning to join in 2012 . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de excitement and hope as slovenia adopts the euro slovenia on new year 's day will become the first former communist state to adopt the european union 's common currency as it exchanges its tolar for the euro .

" " a place of worship - be it a mosque , church or synagogue - should be at the heart of a community , " joachim swietlik , head of the campaign against the mosque , told news agency reuters . police evicted three left-wing demonstrators after a scuffle over a placard in support of the mosque . sect considered peaceful residents of pankow-heinersdorf have been protesting for months against the planned mosque , arguing that the sect had no members living anywhere near the site .
some of those protests have been attended by members of the far right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- . berlin authorities gave permission to build the mosque just before christmas after a months-long battle with opponents . the muslim group said it had been looking to build a new mosque because it had outgrown its present community center in the west berlin suburb of reinickendorf . the ahmadiyya community was founded at the end of the 19th century in what was then british india .
it claims to represent the latter day renaissance of islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the ahmaddiya community pray at the planned mosque 's site the sect , which is classed as peaceful by the german domestic intelligence service , has some 30,000 members and operates more than a dozen mosques in germany .
at the ceremony , members held up placards reading , " islam means peace , love for all . " abdul basit tariq , chairman of the sect 's berlin chapter , said the mosque was being financed by the sect 's women 's organization and would bear the name khadidja , after the first wife of the prophet mohammed . abdullah uwe wagishauer , head of germany 's ahmdaiyya 's , said he hoped for good ties between his community and opponents of the mosque . " there are no difficulties with neighbors of ahmadiyya mosques built elsewhere , " he told reuters .
" our mosques help interreligious dialogue and mutual understanding . " mosques not new in germany mosques are by no means a new development in germany .
as far back as the 16th century , prussian king frederick william i had the first mosque built in potsdam for his turkish soldiers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sehitlik mosque in west berlin 's neukölln neighborhood in berlin , the first mosque was constructed in 1924 . now there are some 30 muslim places of worship in the german capital .
but most of them are in neukölln and kreuzberg , in the western part of the city . these are the neighborhoods in which guest workers , mainly from turkey , moved to when they first arrived in germany in the 1960s and 1970s .
today the multi-ethnic districts are still home to berlin 's largest turkish community as well as to large numbers of arab and east european immigrants . in the former communist and , at the time , internationally insular east berlin , there were no mosques which might explain the protests , tariq says . " these are unfounded fears , " tariq says .
" people listen to the news , see scenes on television and that 's why they 're scared of muslims .
they think muslims are terrorists and suicide bombers .
their heads are full of these things . " opposition to the planned mosque has underlined germany 's problems in integrating its 3.2-million strong muslim community .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 02.01.2007 many germans with less in their pockets in 2007 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not quite as bad yet , but germans will have to count their cents for ordinary germans , the new year will primarily mean just one thing : they 'll have to tighten their belts even further .
premiums for statutory unemployment insurance will go down , but that 's where the good news ends . a wide range of consumer goods in germany has become more expensive , thanks to a special new year 's present from the government in berlin .
it 's imposed a 3 percent valued added tax increase on clothes , cars , furniture , electrical appliances and other goods , bringing vat up to 19 percent . this is expected to reduce the shopping activities of ordinary citizens after many a shopping spree in 2006 .
opposition leaders such as guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's free-market , liberal free democratic party , protested loudly against the tax hike which the government says is needed to consolidate the budget and reduce state debt . " how is , say , a family of four supposed to save money when faced with spiraling energy costs and a state policy that 's reaching even deeper into their pockets ? "
westerwelle asked .
" politicians from the grand coalition government are calling on citizens to put more money aside for old age insurance , but they 're not willing to ease people 's financial situation on the tax front .
this is really absurd ! " no drastic price hikes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will extended shopping hours make up for any losses ?
however economic pundits believe that in many cases prices for consumer goods will not really go up tangibly . retailers will have to decrease their profit margins , and some of them already increased prices in the old year . " retailers are not in a position to pass on the value-added tax hike to consumers just like that , " said hubertus pellengahr , who heads germany 's association of retailers .
" this applies in particular to january - a traditional month of discount sales here in germany . " but once again , it 's drivers who are expected to suffer most from the vat hike which also applies to fuel .
johannes hübner from germany 's avd motoring club said drivers should brace for higher prices at fueling stations across the country . gas goes up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices will climb even further " we expect fuel prices to increase by another three to four cent per liter , " he said .
" we 'll have to see whether oil companies will keep prices that high throughout the year .
much will depend on developments on the global energy market .
but i think that consumers will have to put up with a two-cent-per-liter hike on average in 2007 . " driving may also become more expensive for haulers using inter-city road connections .
the road toll system for heavy trucks no longer applies to the autobahn motorway network only , but has been extended to three heavily frequented overland roads leading through several german states . more money for pension funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers will have to pay more for their pensions germans will also have to fork out more this year for their contributions to the statutory pension system .
premiums have increased by almost half a percent to total 19.9 percent of people 's incomes .
taxes on capital gains will be levied at a much lower ceiling . and a special wealth tax goes up by 3 percent for individuals making more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 330,000 -rrb- a year .
also , special benefits for commuters are cut completely if the distance between their homes and workplaces is under 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- . checking welfare recipients bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials will check unemployment recipients more carefully in addition , agencies are now taking a closer look at who 's entitled to state benefits . " whoever turns down an acceptable job offer will see their unemployment benefit payments reduced , " said john-philip hammersen , a spokesman for the central employment agency in nuremberg . he added that the abuse of the welfare system has to be curbed dramatically . " regulations to this effect will be applied more stringently from now on , " he said .
" those who opt to turn down a reasonable offer for the second or third time will risk losing up to 100 percent of all benefits . " nevertheless experts do n't expect a new round of public moaning and groaning over this year 's financial challenges .
after all , most people here do seem to appreciate that the good times are over and unlikely to return any time soon . harry graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : good news for germany 's economy although sales tax increases at the beginning of 2007 are likely to temporarily dampen the german economy , the economic outlook for next year is extremely positive , says dw-radio 's karl zawadzky .
-lrb- 30.12.2006 -rrb- euro rises on positive german business confidence american vacationers at germany 's christmas markets did n't have much to smile about when they exchanged their travelers cheques as the european currency benefited from robust german business confidence figures .

many were forced to take part in sadistic medical experiments which have left their mark six decades later .
still others saw family members killed in front of them , surviving by chance . it was these victims of the nazis forced labor program that a special fund set up six years ago tried to help .
and six years and 1.7 million victims later , the fund sent out its last checks on dec .
31 . " this is n't just about money , " günter saathoff , director of the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation that administers the fund , told the associated press .

both sites formerly belonged to siemens , which sold them to taiwan-based benq in august 2005 because of disappointing sales figures and rising costs . a spokeswoman for the munich court said it was still possible that an investor could take over part of the operation during the insolvency proceedings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich benq employees protested planned lay-offs in november chairman of the works council , michael leucker told news agency ap he believed an unnamed german-american investor would step in tuesday at the last minute to buy out the flailing mobile phone company , which could mean several hundred benq employees would get to keep their jobs . according to reports , some 500 employees have already found positions elsewhere .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 02.01.2007 major euro zone expansion now on hold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia became the 13th member of the euro zone slovenia , adopting the euro on jan .
1 , might be one of the few additions to the euro zone until after 2010 because of eu members ' inability or reluctance to adopt the euro . five years after 12 eu members switched to the single european currency , hopes for a rapid expansion of the euro zone have been dashed by delays in eastern europe and a lack of interest from west european holdouts . in 2002 , 304 million european citizens in countries including france , germany , ireland and spain waved goodbye to their francs , marks , punts and pesetas , and expectations were high that they would be joined by millions more by the end of the decade . with the exception of britain and denmark , which have special euro zone opt-outs , all european union members are supposed eventually to make the euro their official currency . economists at the time predicted that the 10 countries which joined the eu in 2004 , mostly former members of the communist bloc , would adopt the euro no later than 2010 . a first wave of three or four countries was expected to be ready by january 2007 . but the forecasters failed to take into account that there would be governments that were able but unwilling to adopt the euro , others that were willing but unable , and some that were neither willing nor able .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia is the first post communist country to have the euro in the end , the club will gain just one new member on january 1 , when slovenia 's two million inhabitants give up their tolars . spectacular growth cyprus ' population of 750,000 and the 400,000 maltese are expected to swap their pounds and liras the following year . slovakia , with a population of 5.4 million , is also on course to switch from the koruna in january 2009 , despite the formation earlier this year of a coalition government including euro-sceptic populists and the far right . but things are looking more complicated for the six other countries that joined the eu two years ago , taking the bloc 's membership to 25 . the baltic nations of lithuania and estonia had hoped to join the euro zone in 2007 .
in theory , nothing could have been easier . the lithuanian lita and the estonian kroon are tied to the euro and the health of their public finances , a key measure for euro zone membership , causes envy in countries like france or germany . but both are experiencing spectacular growth - in estonia the rate was 12 percent in the third quarter alone - and consumer prices are rising slightly faster than in the rest of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland happily joined the eu but not the euro zone the maastricht treaty which laid the foundations of the eurozone sets inflation caps for members , and the baltic states have been just above the target . indulgence to founders lithuania was annoyed that it did not get a green light earlier this year .
in march , its average inflation rate was just 0.06 percent above the limit . the stern stance of the 12 euro zone members towards potential members was a surprise for economists , who say the inflation criteria are irrelevant for countries that are catching up with western europe and have already pegged their currencies to the euro . in order to achieve the living standards of the eu 's western members , the former communist countries have little choice but to let salaries and prices increase , which inevitably fuels inflation . the current intransigence contrasts with the indulgence towards euro zone founders such as belgium and italy .

he walks slowly with a flashlight through the bunker , 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- underground , as danger warnings line the walls on the way to decontamination showers , sleeping quarters , a hospital , even a room set up for cutting hair . most of the rooms are empty and unlit , with dirt floors .
in the first 100 meters , at least five massive steel doors are set into the wall , ready to slide shut in case of emergency . this area is a tiny sliver in the 19 kilometers of subterranean passageways , but when it ’ s opened up as a museum in early 2008 , it will offer the public what they never would have seen - an area where a chosen 3,000 people would have holed up for 30 days after a nuclear attack . “ we call it the fortress of the nuclear age , " said florian mausbach , president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning who leads the project . secrecy spurred public interest in the end , mausbach says the bunker was never actually used to house government officials , who would have left west germany ’ s nearby capital of bonn to find refuge there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 02.01.2007 drumming up support for the eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has much on her agenda as she kicks off the eu presidency .
her biggest challenge , however , will be breathing new life into a nearly dead eu constitution , says dw 's bernd riegert . germans are capable of enthusiasm .
they clearly displayed that when they hosted the soccer world cup in the summer of 2006 .
if only a tad of such enthusiasm flows into germany 's approach to the eu presidency , much can be achieved . merkel can succeed greatly if she manages to handle european politics not with scepticism and doubt , but with a positive , extroverted approach .
she should motivate her european team in a manner akin to former german soccer coach jürgen klinsmann , who took his players all the way to the 2006 world cup semi-final . the stalled eu constitution desperately needs someone with that kind of enthusiasm to get it back on track .
with the 50th anniversary of european unification coincidentally occurring during germany 's eu presidency tenure , merkel and her team have a major chance to rally support for the eu treaty , and thus , for europe 's future . clear results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel looked toward the future of the eu during her new year 's address hopefully , the chancellor will do more than merely give nice speeches and organize multi-cultural events near the brandenburg gate in berlin . the european political " fan " is going to have to see clear results in the eu constitution debate in order to get enthused about the treaty .
in keeping with the soccer metaphor , what is needed is scored goals rather than artful dribbling . europeans want to know what the constitution is to be composed of , what rules it should contain , and how it can be adopted .
two years following france and the netherland 's rejection of the constitution should be enough time to have redefined where things should go . little leeway to be fair , one does have to admit that " coach merkel " does not have much leeway in establishing the framework . france will elect a new president this year ; britain will gain a new prime minister this summer .
no one knows how the new leaders of these two important eu countries will behave in the debate over the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer coach jürgen klinsmann is known for his sunny attitude the eu presidency under germany must not only tackle the eu 's constitution , it must also urgently improve ties with gas-supplier russia , forge relationships with other possible gas-suppliers in central asia and take a different approach to the middle east , from which europe receives much of its energy . attitude change ? merkel can start in her own backyard in drumming up support for europe .
many of her ministers are against a pan-european collectivization of tasks . the attitude tends to be along the lines of : everything bad stems from the eu bureaucracy in brussels ; everything good will be decided by berlin .
unfortunately , this simplistic , false logic is widespread . six months is not much time to fulfil so many expectations .
germany will not have an easy time of it .
fanmeile -lrb- fan mile -rrb- was chosen as the german word of the year in 2006 .
it 's unlikely that the eu constitution will gain that honor , but people should try to work toward that goal nonetheless . dw 's brussels correspondent bernd riegert -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany faces daunting agenda for eu , g8 presidencies germany will fight to revive international efforts for middle east peace , relaunch the eu constitution and advocate a gentler form of globalization when it takes over the presidencies of the eu and the g8 monday .

the site was initially to be sealed up , but is now planned as a museum . ron lerke calls out a greeting and his voice echoes into the darkness - 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of it , to be exact .
he is underground , in what used to be the west german government 's ultra-secret atomic bunker , located deep in western germany near the french border .
and it ’ s here , in a tunnel stretching into a black abyss , that a restored section of the bunker will be used for the first time . lerke is head engineer of the project to turn the bunker into a tourist site .
he walks slowly with a flashlight through the bunker , 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- underground , as danger warnings line the walls on the way to decontamination showers , sleeping quarters , a hospital , even a room set up for cutting hair . most of the rooms are empty and unlit , with dirt floors .
in the first 100 meters , at least five massive steel doors are set into the wall , ready to slide shut in case of emergency . this area is a tiny sliver in the 19 kilometers of subterranean passageways , but when it ’ s opened up as a museum in early 2008 , it will offer the public what they never would have seen - an area where a chosen 3,000 people would have holed up for 30 days after a nuclear attack . “ we call it the fortress of the nuclear age , " said florian mausbach , president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning who leads the project . secrecy spurred public interest in the end , mausbach says the bunker was never actually used to house government officials , who would have left west germany ’ s nearby capital of bonn to find refuge there .
by the late 1990 ’ s , after the capital had moved to berlin , lawmakers decided to close down the structure , and started in 2001 to seal it up and bury it forever . but the public wanted a peek inside , said mausbach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tunnels stretch for 18 kilometers “ there 's a lot of interest by the people around that area and beyond to look around in the tunnel , because it was always a secret , " he said .
" so i thought we should keep part of the tunnel . " its location typifies the cold war balance between life and destruction , added mausbach . after the government toyed with the idea of selling the tunnel - some ideas were to convert it into a disco or an area to cultivate mushrooms - mausbach said the finance ministry agreed on the idea of a small museum , which was actually cheaper than sealing the area up forever . not really a secret the museum entrance is nestled into a hill , amidst a backdrop of dense forest and vineyards overlooking the town of ahrweiler .
down a dirt path , through a gate lined with barbed wire , is one of 38 entrances to this network of bunkers . markus heibel of the federal office for building and regional planning said that , though the existence of the bunker was meant to be a well-kept secret during the cold war and afterward , it required almost 200 local employees . " it was not really a secret , " he said .
" they also knew about it in east germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker was a well-known secret in fact , the underground labyrinth dates back to the late 19th century , when tunnels meant for moving supplies by train were built all the way into france .
during world war ii , concentration camp prisoners slaved away building v2 rockets in the tunnels .
by 1960 , west germany began the 12-year project of turning it all into a nuclear bunker in compliance with nato stipulations . with all that history , locals welcome turning the bunker into a museum . jürgen reiche , head of haus der geschichte museum in bonn , leads the museum side of this project .
he says the bunker ’ s history closely parallels that of germany - and that restoring even some of the complex into a museum is vital to remembering germany ’ s past . “ it ’ s not only a bunker - it is part of german history , ” he said . provoking questions only four windows exist in the entire 19 kilometer complex .
one of them is near the planned entrance to the museum , with a view no larger than a sheet of paper .
it ’ s bombproof and can be covered by a sliding steel plate .
but in 2008 , it will be opened up - for a stark look at the nuclear age . as reiche looks over plans for the museum , he says that the experience will lead visitors to ask the right questions about the bunker ’ s significance , both then and now . “ if the earth is destroyed , you can ’ t live on it , " he said .

premiums for statutory unemployment insurance will go down , but that 's where the good news ends . a wide range of consumer goods in germany has become more expensive , thanks to a special new year 's present from the government in berlin .
it 's imposed a 3 percent valued added tax increase on clothes , cars , furniture , electrical appliances and other goods , bringing vat up to 19 percent . this is expected to reduce the shopping activities of ordinary citizens after many a shopping spree in 2006 .
opposition leaders such as guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's free-market , liberal free democratic party , protested loudly against the tax hike which the government says is needed to consolidate the budget and reduce state debt . " how is , say , a family of four supposed to save money when faced with spiraling energy costs and a state policy that 's reaching even deeper into their pockets ? "
westerwelle asked .
" politicians from the grand coalition government are calling on citizens to put more money aside for old age insurance , but they 're not willing to ease people 's financial situation on the tax front .
this is really absurd ! " no drastic price hikes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will extended shopping hours make up for any losses ?
however economic pundits believe that in many cases prices for consumer goods will not really go up tangibly . retailers will have to decrease their profit margins , and some of them already increased prices in the old year . " retailers are not in a position to pass on the value-added tax hike to consumers just like that , " said hubertus pellengahr , who heads germany 's association of retailers .
" this applies in particular to january - a traditional month of discount sales here in germany . " but once again , it 's drivers who are expected to suffer most from the vat hike which also applies to fuel .
johannes hübner from germany 's avd motoring club said drivers should brace for higher prices at fueling stations across the country . gas goes up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices will climb even further " we expect fuel prices to increase by another three to four cent per liter , " he said .
" we 'll have to see whether oil companies will keep prices that high throughout the year .
much will depend on developments on the global energy market .
but i think that consumers will have to put up with a two-cent-per-liter hike on average in 2007 . " driving may also become more expensive for haulers using inter-city road connections .
the road toll system for heavy trucks no longer applies to the autobahn motorway network only , but has been extended to three heavily frequented overland roads leading through several german states . more money for pension funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers will have to pay more for their pensions germans will also have to fork out more this year for their contributions to the statutory pension system .
premiums have increased by almost half a percent to total 19.9 percent of people 's incomes .
taxes on capital gains will be levied at a much lower ceiling . and a special wealth tax goes up by 3 percent for individuals making more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 330,000 -rrb- a year .
also , special benefits for commuters are cut completely if the distance between their homes and workplaces is under 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- . checking welfare recipients bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials will check unemployment recipients more carefully in addition , agencies are now taking a closer look at who 's entitled to state benefits . " whoever turns down an acceptable job offer will see their unemployment benefit payments reduced , " said john-philip hammersen , a spokesman for the central employment agency in nuremberg . he added that the abuse of the welfare system has to be curbed dramatically . " regulations to this effect will be applied more stringently from now on , " he said .
" those who opt to turn down a reasonable offer for the second or third time will risk losing up to 100 percent of all benefits . " nevertheless experts do n't expect a new round of public moaning and groaning over this year 's financial challenges .
after all , most people here do seem to appreciate that the good times are over and unlikely to return any time soon . harry graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : good news for germany 's economy although sales tax increases at the beginning of 2007 are likely to temporarily dampen the german economy , the economic outlook for next year is extremely positive , says dw-radio 's karl zawadzky .

under the scheme , parents will receive up to 1,800 euros a month per child to take off work to care for newborns . mothers who gave birth before midnight on new year 's eve missed out .
the benefit only applies to births after january 1 , 2007 . " of course some parents did hope that their children would arrive a little later , " said senior doctor volker thaele of halle university hospital 's maternity department . one such mother , gabriele meyer , took magnesium and homeopathic medicine to delay the birth of her twins , she told reuters tv . " it means 20,000 euros to me , " she said . however , doctors said that 41-year-old meyer 's twin foetuses were too small and scheduled her for a caesarean section on friday , just days before the new government benefits took effect .
the twins were initially due on jan .
22 . helping families under the scheme , parents who take time off from work to take care of their babies , can receive two-thirds of their net salary - up to 18,000 euros for 12 months .
if the other parent also takes leave , the benefit can extend to 14 months . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " german family minister ursula von der leyen told the online edition of daily tagesspiegel . given the attractive financial incentives , german media has been full of stories in recent weeks about heavily-pregnant women anxiously seeking medical advice on how to delay births until the new year so that they could qualify for the aid . physicians and midwives have been saying that avoiding red wine , stress as well as physical or sexual activity are among the recommended natural methods to help prevent inducing birth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen has seven children of her own none of the advice seemed to have worked in halle , a mid-sized city in eastern germany , where no babies at all were delivered on new year 's day , whereas six had been delivered in the preceding 48 hours . a bit disappointed the complexities of the new tax and welfare rules mean that the main beneficiaries are high-earning professional women in the top tax bracket who received no subsidies in the past .
non-working wives were better off under the old rules . susanne gürtler , 28 , was among the last mothers to give birth in 2006 .
son flynn , was born at 5 a.m.
sunday .
but gürtler does not work " so it 's great for us , " she said . halle 's last baby came at 6.20 p.m. on sunday . " that mother would have done very well out of the new rules , and i think she was a bit disappointed , " said thale . some even called for the government to adopt a bit more of the holiday spirit . " it would be an act in the spirit of christmas to move the date from jan .
1 to dec .

" " a place of worship - be it a mosque , church or synagogue - should be at the heart of a community , " joachim swietlik , head of the campaign against the mosque , told news agency reuters . police evicted three left-wing demonstrators after a scuffle over a placard in support of the mosque . sect considered peaceful residents of pankow-heinersdorf have been protesting for months against the planned mosque , arguing that the sect had no members living anywhere near the site .
some of those protests have been attended by members of the far right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- . berlin authorities gave permission to build the mosque just before christmas after a months-long battle with opponents . the muslim group said it had been looking to build a new mosque because it had outgrown its present community center in the west berlin suburb of reinickendorf . the ahmadiyya community was founded at the end of the 19th century in what was then british india .
it claims to represent the latter day renaissance of islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the ahmaddiya community pray at the planned mosque 's site the sect , which is classed as peaceful by the german domestic intelligence service , has some 30,000 members and operates more than a dozen mosques in germany .
at the ceremony , members held up placards reading , " islam means peace , love for all . " abdul basit tariq , chairman of the sect 's berlin chapter , said the mosque was being financed by the sect 's women 's organization and would bear the name khadidja , after the first wife of the prophet mohammed . abdullah uwe wagishauer , head of germany 's ahmdaiyya 's , said he hoped for good ties between his community and opponents of the mosque . " there are no difficulties with neighbors of ahmadiyya mosques built elsewhere , " he told reuters .
" our mosques help interreligious dialogue and mutual understanding . " mosques not new in germany mosques are by no means a new development in germany .
as far back as the 16th century , prussian king frederick william i had the first mosque built in potsdam for his turkish soldiers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sehitlik mosque in west berlin 's neukölln neighborhood in berlin , the first mosque was constructed in 1924 . now there are some 30 muslim places of worship in the german capital .
but most of them are in neukölln and kreuzberg , in the western part of the city . these are the neighborhoods in which guest workers , mainly from turkey , moved to when they first arrived in germany in the 1960s and 1970s .
today the multi-ethnic districts are still home to berlin 's largest turkish community as well as to large numbers of arab and east european immigrants . in the former communist and , at the time , internationally insular east berlin , there were no mosques which might explain the protests , tariq says . " these are unfounded fears , " tariq says .
" people listen to the news , see scenes on television and that 's why they 're scared of muslims .
they think muslims are terrorists and suicide bombers .
their heads are full of these things . " opposition to the planned mosque has underlined germany 's problems in integrating its 3.2-million strong muslim community .

" " a place of worship - be it a mosque , church or synagogue - should be at the heart of a community , " joachim swietlik , head of the campaign against the mosque , told news agency reuters . police evicted three left-wing demonstrators after a scuffle over a placard in support of the mosque . sect considered peaceful residents of pankow-heinersdorf have been protesting for months against the planned mosque , arguing that the sect had no members living anywhere near the site .
some of those protests have been attended by members of the far right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- . berlin authorities gave permission to build the mosque just before christmas after a months-long battle with opponents . the muslim group said it had been looking to build a new mosque because it had outgrown its present community center in the west berlin suburb of reinickendorf . the ahmadiyya community was founded at the end of the 19th century in what was then british india .
it claims to represent the latter day renaissance of islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the ahmaddiya community pray at the planned mosque 's site the sect , which is classed as peaceful by the german domestic intelligence service , has some 30,000 members and operates more than a dozen mosques in germany .
at the ceremony , members held up placards reading , " islam means peace , love for all . " abdul basit tariq , chairman of the sect 's berlin chapter , said the mosque was being financed by the sect 's women 's organization and would bear the name khadidja , after the first wife of the prophet mohammed . abdullah uwe wagishauer , head of germany 's ahmdaiyya 's , said he hoped for good ties between his community and opponents of the mosque . " there are no difficulties with neighbors of ahmadiyya mosques built elsewhere , " he told reuters .
" our mosques help interreligious dialogue and mutual understanding . " mosques not new in germany mosques are by no means a new development in germany .
as far back as the 16th century , prussian king frederick william i had the first mosque built in potsdam for his turkish soldiers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sehitlik mosque in west berlin 's neukölln neighborhood in berlin , the first mosque was constructed in 1924 . now there are some 30 muslim places of worship in the german capital .
but most of them are in neukölln and kreuzberg , in the western part of the city . these are the neighborhoods in which guest workers , mainly from turkey , moved to when they first arrived in germany in the 1960s and 1970s .
today the multi-ethnic districts are still home to berlin 's largest turkish community as well as to large numbers of arab and east european immigrants . in the former communist and , at the time , internationally insular east berlin , there were no mosques which might explain the protests , tariq says . " these are unfounded fears , " tariq says .
" people listen to the news , see scenes on television and that 's why they 're scared of muslims .
they think muslims are terrorists and suicide bombers .
their heads are full of these things . " opposition to the planned mosque has underlined germany 's problems in integrating its 3.2-million strong muslim community .
the problem is especially acute in formerly communist-ruled east germany where few muslims and other immigrants have settled . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de female imams in german mosques get a mixed reception turkey 's religious council has already sent 13 women to germany to serve in mosques .
there have been requests for more , even if some reject teaching from a woman .

they hope their ' ' rolling mosque " will help change german public opinion , which often associates islam and muslims with terror and fanaticism .

her biggest challenge , however , will be breathing new life into a nearly dead eu constitution , says dw 's bernd riegert . germans are capable of enthusiasm .
they clearly displayed that when they hosted the soccer world cup in the summer of 2006 .
if only a tad of such enthusiasm flows into germany 's approach to the eu presidency , much can be achieved . merkel can succeed greatly if she manages to handle european politics not with scepticism and doubt , but with a positive , extroverted approach .
she should motivate her european team in a manner akin to former german soccer coach jürgen klinsmann , who took his players all the way to the 2006 world cup semi-final . the stalled eu constitution desperately needs someone with that kind of enthusiasm to get it back on track .
with the 50th anniversary of european unification coincidentally occurring during germany 's eu presidency tenure , merkel and her team have a major chance to rally support for the eu treaty , and thus , for europe 's future . clear results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel looked toward the future of the eu during her new year 's address hopefully , the chancellor will do more than merely give nice speeches and organize multi-cultural events near the brandenburg gate in berlin . the european political " fan " is going to have to see clear results in the eu constitution debate in order to get enthused about the treaty .
in keeping with the soccer metaphor , what is needed is scored goals rather than artful dribbling . europeans want to know what the constitution is to be composed of , what rules it should contain , and how it can be adopted .
two years following france and the netherland 's rejection of the constitution should be enough time to have redefined where things should go . little leeway to be fair , one does have to admit that " coach merkel " does not have much leeway in establishing the framework . france will elect a new president this year ; britain will gain a new prime minister this summer .
no one knows how the new leaders of these two important eu countries will behave in the debate over the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer coach jürgen klinsmann is known for his sunny attitude the eu presidency under germany must not only tackle the eu 's constitution , it must also urgently improve ties with gas-supplier russia , forge relationships with other possible gas-suppliers in central asia and take a different approach to the middle east , from which europe receives much of its energy . attitude change ? merkel can start in her own backyard in drumming up support for europe .
many of her ministers are against a pan-european collectivization of tasks . the attitude tends to be along the lines of : everything bad stems from the eu bureaucracy in brussels ; everything good will be decided by berlin .
unfortunately , this simplistic , false logic is widespread . six months is not much time to fulfil so many expectations .
germany will not have an easy time of it .
fanmeile -lrb- fan mile -rrb- was chosen as the german word of the year in 2006 .

her biggest challenge , however , will be breathing new life into a nearly dead eu constitution , says dw 's bernd riegert . germans are capable of enthusiasm .
they clearly displayed that when they hosted the soccer world cup in the summer of 2006 .
if only a tad of such enthusiasm flows into germany 's approach to the eu presidency , much can be achieved . merkel can succeed greatly if she manages to handle european politics not with scepticism and doubt , but with a positive , extroverted approach .
she should motivate her european team in a manner akin to former german soccer coach jürgen klinsmann , who took his players all the way to the 2006 world cup semi-final . the stalled eu constitution desperately needs someone with that kind of enthusiasm to get it back on track .
with the 50th anniversary of european unification coincidentally occurring during germany 's eu presidency tenure , merkel and her team have a major chance to rally support for the eu treaty , and thus , for europe 's future . clear results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel looked toward the future of the eu during her new year 's address hopefully , the chancellor will do more than merely give nice speeches and organize multi-cultural events near the brandenburg gate in berlin . the european political " fan " is going to have to see clear results in the eu constitution debate in order to get enthused about the treaty .
in keeping with the soccer metaphor , what is needed is scored goals rather than artful dribbling . europeans want to know what the constitution is to be composed of , what rules it should contain , and how it can be adopted .
two years following france and the netherland 's rejection of the constitution should be enough time to have redefined where things should go . little leeway to be fair , one does have to admit that " coach merkel " does not have much leeway in establishing the framework . france will elect a new president this year ; britain will gain a new prime minister this summer .
no one knows how the new leaders of these two important eu countries will behave in the debate over the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer coach jürgen klinsmann is known for his sunny attitude the eu presidency under germany must not only tackle the eu 's constitution , it must also urgently improve ties with gas-supplier russia , forge relationships with other possible gas-suppliers in central asia and take a different approach to the middle east , from which europe receives much of its energy . attitude change ? merkel can start in her own backyard in drumming up support for europe .
many of her ministers are against a pan-european collectivization of tasks . the attitude tends to be along the lines of : everything bad stems from the eu bureaucracy in brussels ; everything good will be decided by berlin .
unfortunately , this simplistic , false logic is widespread . six months is not much time to fulfil so many expectations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 02.01.2007 historic cold war bunker to become a museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entrance to the new cold war bunker museum during the cold war , a secret underground bunker for the west german government was constructed to protect a chosen few in case of an atomic attack .
the site was initially to be sealed up , but is now planned as a museum . ron lerke calls out a greeting and his voice echoes into the darkness - 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of it , to be exact .
he is underground , in what used to be the west german government 's ultra-secret atomic bunker , located deep in western germany near the french border .
and it ’ s here , in a tunnel stretching into a black abyss , that a restored section of the bunker will be used for the first time . lerke is head engineer of the project to turn the bunker into a tourist site .
he walks slowly with a flashlight through the bunker , 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- underground , as danger warnings line the walls on the way to decontamination showers , sleeping quarters , a hospital , even a room set up for cutting hair . most of the rooms are empty and unlit , with dirt floors .
in the first 100 meters , at least five massive steel doors are set into the wall , ready to slide shut in case of emergency . this area is a tiny sliver in the 19 kilometers of subterranean passageways , but when it ’ s opened up as a museum in early 2008 , it will offer the public what they never would have seen - an area where a chosen 3,000 people would have holed up for 30 days after a nuclear attack . “ we call it the fortress of the nuclear age , " said florian mausbach , president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning who leads the project . secrecy spurred public interest in the end , mausbach says the bunker was never actually used to house government officials , who would have left west germany ’ s nearby capital of bonn to find refuge there .
by the late 1990 ’ s , after the capital had moved to berlin , lawmakers decided to close down the structure , and started in 2001 to seal it up and bury it forever . but the public wanted a peek inside , said mausbach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tunnels stretch for 18 kilometers “ there 's a lot of interest by the people around that area and beyond to look around in the tunnel , because it was always a secret , " he said .
" so i thought we should keep part of the tunnel . " its location typifies the cold war balance between life and destruction , added mausbach . after the government toyed with the idea of selling the tunnel - some ideas were to convert it into a disco or an area to cultivate mushrooms - mausbach said the finance ministry agreed on the idea of a small museum , which was actually cheaper than sealing the area up forever . not really a secret the museum entrance is nestled into a hill , amidst a backdrop of dense forest and vineyards overlooking the town of ahrweiler .
down a dirt path , through a gate lined with barbed wire , is one of 38 entrances to this network of bunkers . markus heibel of the federal office for building and regional planning said that , though the existence of the bunker was meant to be a well-kept secret during the cold war and afterward , it required almost 200 local employees . " it was not really a secret , " he said .
" they also knew about it in east germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker was a well-known secret in fact , the underground labyrinth dates back to the late 19th century , when tunnels meant for moving supplies by train were built all the way into france .
during world war ii , concentration camp prisoners slaved away building v2 rockets in the tunnels .
by 1960 , west germany began the 12-year project of turning it all into a nuclear bunker in compliance with nato stipulations . with all that history , locals welcome turning the bunker into a museum . jürgen reiche , head of haus der geschichte museum in bonn , leads the museum side of this project .
he says the bunker ’ s history closely parallels that of germany - and that restoring even some of the complex into a museum is vital to remembering germany ’ s past . “ it ’ s not only a bunker - it is part of german history , ” he said . provoking questions only four windows exist in the entire 19 kilometer complex .
one of them is near the planned entrance to the museum , with a view no larger than a sheet of paper .
it ’ s bombproof and can be covered by a sliding steel plate .
but in 2008 , it will be opened up - for a stark look at the nuclear age . as reiche looks over plans for the museum , he says that the experience will lead visitors to ask the right questions about the bunker ’ s significance , both then and now . “ if the earth is destroyed , you can ’ t live on it , " he said .
" so do we need such bunkers , do we need bombs , do we need war ? ” nick mcgurk -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de marking the spot of hitler 's bunker few know that hitler 's infamous bunker is tucked away below a berlin car park , surrounded by high-rises built in the gdr .

under the scheme , parents will receive up to 1,800 euros a month per child to take off work to care for newborns . mothers who gave birth before midnight on new year 's eve missed out .
the benefit only applies to births after january 1 , 2007 . " of course some parents did hope that their children would arrive a little later , " said senior doctor volker thaele of halle university hospital 's maternity department . one such mother , gabriele meyer , took magnesium and homeopathic medicine to delay the birth of her twins , she told reuters tv . " it means 20,000 euros to me , " she said . however , doctors said that 41-year-old meyer 's twin foetuses were too small and scheduled her for a caesarean section on friday , just days before the new government benefits took effect .
the twins were initially due on jan .
22 . helping families under the scheme , parents who take time off from work to take care of their babies , can receive two-thirds of their net salary - up to 18,000 euros for 12 months .
if the other parent also takes leave , the benefit can extend to 14 months . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " german family minister ursula von der leyen told the online edition of daily tagesspiegel . given the attractive financial incentives , german media has been full of stories in recent weeks about heavily-pregnant women anxiously seeking medical advice on how to delay births until the new year so that they could qualify for the aid . physicians and midwives have been saying that avoiding red wine , stress as well as physical or sexual activity are among the recommended natural methods to help prevent inducing birth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen has seven children of her own none of the advice seemed to have worked in halle , a mid-sized city in eastern germany , where no babies at all were delivered on new year 's day , whereas six had been delivered in the preceding 48 hours . a bit disappointed the complexities of the new tax and welfare rules mean that the main beneficiaries are high-earning professional women in the top tax bracket who received no subsidies in the past .
non-working wives were better off under the old rules . susanne gürtler , 28 , was among the last mothers to give birth in 2006 .
son flynn , was born at 5 a.m.
sunday .
but gürtler does not work " so it 's great for us , " she said . halle 's last baby came at 6.20 p.m. on sunday . " that mother would have done very well out of the new rules , and i think she was a bit disappointed , " said thale . some even called for the government to adopt a bit more of the holiday spirit . " it would be an act in the spirit of christmas to move the date from jan .

the site was initially to be sealed up , but is now planned as a museum . ron lerke calls out a greeting and his voice echoes into the darkness - 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of it , to be exact .
he is underground , in what used to be the west german government 's ultra-secret atomic bunker , located deep in western germany near the french border .
and it ’ s here , in a tunnel stretching into a black abyss , that a restored section of the bunker will be used for the first time . lerke is head engineer of the project to turn the bunker into a tourist site .
he walks slowly with a flashlight through the bunker , 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- underground , as danger warnings line the walls on the way to decontamination showers , sleeping quarters , a hospital , even a room set up for cutting hair . most of the rooms are empty and unlit , with dirt floors .
in the first 100 meters , at least five massive steel doors are set into the wall , ready to slide shut in case of emergency . this area is a tiny sliver in the 19 kilometers of subterranean passageways , but when it ’ s opened up as a museum in early 2008 , it will offer the public what they never would have seen - an area where a chosen 3,000 people would have holed up for 30 days after a nuclear attack . “ we call it the fortress of the nuclear age , " said florian mausbach , president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning who leads the project . secrecy spurred public interest in the end , mausbach says the bunker was never actually used to house government officials , who would have left west germany ’ s nearby capital of bonn to find refuge there .
by the late 1990 ’ s , after the capital had moved to berlin , lawmakers decided to close down the structure , and started in 2001 to seal it up and bury it forever . but the public wanted a peek inside , said mausbach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tunnels stretch for 18 kilometers “ there 's a lot of interest by the people around that area and beyond to look around in the tunnel , because it was always a secret , " he said .
" so i thought we should keep part of the tunnel . " its location typifies the cold war balance between life and destruction , added mausbach . after the government toyed with the idea of selling the tunnel - some ideas were to convert it into a disco or an area to cultivate mushrooms - mausbach said the finance ministry agreed on the idea of a small museum , which was actually cheaper than sealing the area up forever . not really a secret the museum entrance is nestled into a hill , amidst a backdrop of dense forest and vineyards overlooking the town of ahrweiler .
down a dirt path , through a gate lined with barbed wire , is one of 38 entrances to this network of bunkers . markus heibel of the federal office for building and regional planning said that , though the existence of the bunker was meant to be a well-kept secret during the cold war and afterward , it required almost 200 local employees . " it was not really a secret , " he said .
" they also knew about it in east germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker was a well-known secret in fact , the underground labyrinth dates back to the late 19th century , when tunnels meant for moving supplies by train were built all the way into france .
during world war ii , concentration camp prisoners slaved away building v2 rockets in the tunnels .
by 1960 , west germany began the 12-year project of turning it all into a nuclear bunker in compliance with nato stipulations . with all that history , locals welcome turning the bunker into a museum . jürgen reiche , head of haus der geschichte museum in bonn , leads the museum side of this project .
he says the bunker ’ s history closely parallels that of germany - and that restoring even some of the complex into a museum is vital to remembering germany ’ s past . “ it ’ s not only a bunker - it is part of german history , ” he said . provoking questions only four windows exist in the entire 19 kilometer complex .
one of them is near the planned entrance to the museum , with a view no larger than a sheet of paper .
it ’ s bombproof and can be covered by a sliding steel plate .
but in 2008 , it will be opened up - for a stark look at the nuclear age . as reiche looks over plans for the museum , he says that the experience will lead visitors to ask the right questions about the bunker ’ s significance , both then and now . “ if the earth is destroyed , you can ’ t live on it , " he said .

premiums for statutory unemployment insurance will go down , but that 's where the good news ends . a wide range of consumer goods in germany has become more expensive , thanks to a special new year 's present from the government in berlin .
it 's imposed a 3 percent valued added tax increase on clothes , cars , furniture , electrical appliances and other goods , bringing vat up to 19 percent . this is expected to reduce the shopping activities of ordinary citizens after many a shopping spree in 2006 .
opposition leaders such as guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's free-market , liberal free democratic party , protested loudly against the tax hike which the government says is needed to consolidate the budget and reduce state debt . " how is , say , a family of four supposed to save money when faced with spiraling energy costs and a state policy that 's reaching even deeper into their pockets ? "
westerwelle asked .
" politicians from the grand coalition government are calling on citizens to put more money aside for old age insurance , but they 're not willing to ease people 's financial situation on the tax front .
this is really absurd ! " no drastic price hikes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will extended shopping hours make up for any losses ?
however economic pundits believe that in many cases prices for consumer goods will not really go up tangibly . retailers will have to decrease their profit margins , and some of them already increased prices in the old year . " retailers are not in a position to pass on the value-added tax hike to consumers just like that , " said hubertus pellengahr , who heads germany 's association of retailers .
" this applies in particular to january - a traditional month of discount sales here in germany . " but once again , it 's drivers who are expected to suffer most from the vat hike which also applies to fuel .
johannes hübner from germany 's avd motoring club said drivers should brace for higher prices at fueling stations across the country . gas goes up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices will climb even further " we expect fuel prices to increase by another three to four cent per liter , " he said .
" we 'll have to see whether oil companies will keep prices that high throughout the year .
much will depend on developments on the global energy market .
but i think that consumers will have to put up with a two-cent-per-liter hike on average in 2007 . " driving may also become more expensive for haulers using inter-city road connections .
the road toll system for heavy trucks no longer applies to the autobahn motorway network only , but has been extended to three heavily frequented overland roads leading through several german states . more money for pension funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers will have to pay more for their pensions germans will also have to fork out more this year for their contributions to the statutory pension system .
premiums have increased by almost half a percent to total 19.9 percent of people 's incomes .
taxes on capital gains will be levied at a much lower ceiling . and a special wealth tax goes up by 3 percent for individuals making more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 330,000 -rrb- a year .
also , special benefits for commuters are cut completely if the distance between their homes and workplaces is under 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- . checking welfare recipients bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials will check unemployment recipients more carefully in addition , agencies are now taking a closer look at who 's entitled to state benefits . " whoever turns down an acceptable job offer will see their unemployment benefit payments reduced , " said john-philip hammersen , a spokesman for the central employment agency in nuremberg . he added that the abuse of the welfare system has to be curbed dramatically . " regulations to this effect will be applied more stringently from now on , " he said .
" those who opt to turn down a reasonable offer for the second or third time will risk losing up to 100 percent of all benefits . " nevertheless experts do n't expect a new round of public moaning and groaning over this year 's financial challenges .
after all , most people here do seem to appreciate that the good times are over and unlikely to return any time soon . harry graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : good news for germany 's economy although sales tax increases at the beginning of 2007 are likely to temporarily dampen the german economy , the economic outlook for next year is extremely positive , says dw-radio 's karl zawadzky .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 02.01.2007 major euro zone expansion now on hold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia became the 13th member of the euro zone slovenia , adopting the euro on jan .
1 , might be one of the few additions to the euro zone until after 2010 because of eu members ' inability or reluctance to adopt the euro . five years after 12 eu members switched to the single european currency , hopes for a rapid expansion of the euro zone have been dashed by delays in eastern europe and a lack of interest from west european holdouts . in 2002 , 304 million european citizens in countries including france , germany , ireland and spain waved goodbye to their francs , marks , punts and pesetas , and expectations were high that they would be joined by millions more by the end of the decade . with the exception of britain and denmark , which have special euro zone opt-outs , all european union members are supposed eventually to make the euro their official currency . economists at the time predicted that the 10 countries which joined the eu in 2004 , mostly former members of the communist bloc , would adopt the euro no later than 2010 . a first wave of three or four countries was expected to be ready by january 2007 . but the forecasters failed to take into account that there would be governments that were able but unwilling to adopt the euro , others that were willing but unable , and some that were neither willing nor able .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia is the first post communist country to have the euro in the end , the club will gain just one new member on january 1 , when slovenia 's two million inhabitants give up their tolars . spectacular growth cyprus ' population of 750,000 and the 400,000 maltese are expected to swap their pounds and liras the following year . slovakia , with a population of 5.4 million , is also on course to switch from the koruna in january 2009 , despite the formation earlier this year of a coalition government including euro-sceptic populists and the far right . but things are looking more complicated for the six other countries that joined the eu two years ago , taking the bloc 's membership to 25 . the baltic nations of lithuania and estonia had hoped to join the euro zone in 2007 .
in theory , nothing could have been easier . the lithuanian lita and the estonian kroon are tied to the euro and the health of their public finances , a key measure for euro zone membership , causes envy in countries like france or germany . but both are experiencing spectacular growth - in estonia the rate was 12 percent in the third quarter alone - and consumer prices are rising slightly faster than in the rest of the eu .

in march , its average inflation rate was just 0.06 percent above the limit . the stern stance of the 12 euro zone members towards potential members was a surprise for economists , who say the inflation criteria are irrelevant for countries that are catching up with western europe and have already pegged their currencies to the euro . in order to achieve the living standards of the eu 's western members , the former communist countries have little choice but to let salaries and prices increase , which inevitably fuels inflation . the current intransigence contrasts with the indulgence towards euro zone founders such as belgium and italy .

under euro zone rules , the maximum is supposed to be 60 percent . poland seemingly uninterested while they are solid supporters of the euro , the baltic states have bitterly resigned themselves to having to wait - but are making their discontent known . " it would not be very good if the otherwise good performing countries are left out of the euro area for an extended period , just because of the inflation criterion , " estonian finance minister aivar soerd told afp . apart from slovakia , other new eu members in central europe have put the euro on the back burner . poland , where euro-sceptic conservatives have been in power for a year , has declined to set a timetable , simply saying that it aims to hold a referendum in 2010 on whether to give up the zloty - even though joining the single currency was one of the planks of the eu membership treaty already approved by polish voters in 2003 . warsaw points to the example of sweden , which joined the eu in 1995 and decided to keep the krona after a referendum in 2003 . hungary , which faces a widening public deficit , has pushed its euro zone target back to 2013 , while the czech republic is planning to join in 2012 . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de excitement and hope as slovenia adopts the euro slovenia on new year 's day will become the first former communist state to adopt the european union 's common currency as it exchanges its tolar for the euro .

under the scheme , parents will receive up to 1,800 euros a month per child to take off work to care for newborns . mothers who gave birth before midnight on new year 's eve missed out .
the benefit only applies to births after january 1 , 2007 . " of course some parents did hope that their children would arrive a little later , " said senior doctor volker thaele of halle university hospital 's maternity department . one such mother , gabriele meyer , took magnesium and homeopathic medicine to delay the birth of her twins , she told reuters tv . " it means 20,000 euros to me , " she said . however , doctors said that 41-year-old meyer 's twin foetuses were too small and scheduled her for a caesarean section on friday , just days before the new government benefits took effect .
the twins were initially due on jan .
22 . helping families under the scheme , parents who take time off from work to take care of their babies , can receive two-thirds of their net salary - up to 18,000 euros for 12 months .
if the other parent also takes leave , the benefit can extend to 14 months . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " german family minister ursula von der leyen told the online edition of daily tagesspiegel . given the attractive financial incentives , german media has been full of stories in recent weeks about heavily-pregnant women anxiously seeking medical advice on how to delay births until the new year so that they could qualify for the aid . physicians and midwives have been saying that avoiding red wine , stress as well as physical or sexual activity are among the recommended natural methods to help prevent inducing birth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen has seven children of her own none of the advice seemed to have worked in halle , a mid-sized city in eastern germany , where no babies at all were delivered on new year 's day , whereas six had been delivered in the preceding 48 hours . a bit disappointed the complexities of the new tax and welfare rules mean that the main beneficiaries are high-earning professional women in the top tax bracket who received no subsidies in the past .
non-working wives were better off under the old rules . susanne gürtler , 28 , was among the last mothers to give birth in 2006 .
son flynn , was born at 5 a.m.
sunday .
but gürtler does not work " so it 's great for us , " she said . halle 's last baby came at 6.20 p.m. on sunday . " that mother would have done very well out of the new rules , and i think she was a bit disappointed , " said thale . some even called for the government to adopt a bit more of the holiday spirit . " it would be an act in the spirit of christmas to move the date from jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 02.01.2007 drumming up support for the eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has much on her agenda as she kicks off the eu presidency .
her biggest challenge , however , will be breathing new life into a nearly dead eu constitution , says dw 's bernd riegert . germans are capable of enthusiasm .
they clearly displayed that when they hosted the soccer world cup in the summer of 2006 .
if only a tad of such enthusiasm flows into germany 's approach to the eu presidency , much can be achieved . merkel can succeed greatly if she manages to handle european politics not with scepticism and doubt , but with a positive , extroverted approach .
she should motivate her european team in a manner akin to former german soccer coach jürgen klinsmann , who took his players all the way to the 2006 world cup semi-final . the stalled eu constitution desperately needs someone with that kind of enthusiasm to get it back on track .

" " a place of worship - be it a mosque , church or synagogue - should be at the heart of a community , " joachim swietlik , head of the campaign against the mosque , told news agency reuters . police evicted three left-wing demonstrators after a scuffle over a placard in support of the mosque . sect considered peaceful residents of pankow-heinersdorf have been protesting for months against the planned mosque , arguing that the sect had no members living anywhere near the site .
some of those protests have been attended by members of the far right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- . berlin authorities gave permission to build the mosque just before christmas after a months-long battle with opponents . the muslim group said it had been looking to build a new mosque because it had outgrown its present community center in the west berlin suburb of reinickendorf . the ahmadiyya community was founded at the end of the 19th century in what was then british india .
it claims to represent the latter day renaissance of islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the ahmaddiya community pray at the planned mosque 's site the sect , which is classed as peaceful by the german domestic intelligence service , has some 30,000 members and operates more than a dozen mosques in germany .
at the ceremony , members held up placards reading , " islam means peace , love for all . " abdul basit tariq , chairman of the sect 's berlin chapter , said the mosque was being financed by the sect 's women 's organization and would bear the name khadidja , after the first wife of the prophet mohammed . abdullah uwe wagishauer , head of germany 's ahmdaiyya 's , said he hoped for good ties between his community and opponents of the mosque . " there are no difficulties with neighbors of ahmadiyya mosques built elsewhere , " he told reuters .
" our mosques help interreligious dialogue and mutual understanding . " mosques not new in germany mosques are by no means a new development in germany .
as far back as the 16th century , prussian king frederick william i had the first mosque built in potsdam for his turkish soldiers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sehitlik mosque in west berlin 's neukölln neighborhood in berlin , the first mosque was constructed in 1924 . now there are some 30 muslim places of worship in the german capital .
but most of them are in neukölln and kreuzberg , in the western part of the city . these are the neighborhoods in which guest workers , mainly from turkey , moved to when they first arrived in germany in the 1960s and 1970s .
today the multi-ethnic districts are still home to berlin 's largest turkish community as well as to large numbers of arab and east european immigrants . in the former communist and , at the time , internationally insular east berlin , there were no mosques which might explain the protests , tariq says . " these are unfounded fears , " tariq says .
" people listen to the news , see scenes on television and that 's why they 're scared of muslims .
they think muslims are terrorists and suicide bombers .
their heads are full of these things . " opposition to the planned mosque has underlined germany 's problems in integrating its 3.2-million strong muslim community .
the problem is especially acute in formerly communist-ruled east germany where few muslims and other immigrants have settled . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de female imams in german mosques get a mixed reception turkey 's religious council has already sent 13 women to germany to serve in mosques .

premiums for statutory unemployment insurance will go down , but that 's where the good news ends . a wide range of consumer goods in germany has become more expensive , thanks to a special new year 's present from the government in berlin .
it 's imposed a 3 percent valued added tax increase on clothes , cars , furniture , electrical appliances and other goods , bringing vat up to 19 percent . this is expected to reduce the shopping activities of ordinary citizens after many a shopping spree in 2006 .
opposition leaders such as guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's free-market , liberal free democratic party , protested loudly against the tax hike which the government says is needed to consolidate the budget and reduce state debt . " how is , say , a family of four supposed to save money when faced with spiraling energy costs and a state policy that 's reaching even deeper into their pockets ? "
westerwelle asked .
" politicians from the grand coalition government are calling on citizens to put more money aside for old age insurance , but they 're not willing to ease people 's financial situation on the tax front .
this is really absurd ! " no drastic price hikes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will extended shopping hours make up for any losses ?
however economic pundits believe that in many cases prices for consumer goods will not really go up tangibly . retailers will have to decrease their profit margins , and some of them already increased prices in the old year . " retailers are not in a position to pass on the value-added tax hike to consumers just like that , " said hubertus pellengahr , who heads germany 's association of retailers .
" this applies in particular to january - a traditional month of discount sales here in germany . " but once again , it 's drivers who are expected to suffer most from the vat hike which also applies to fuel .
johannes hübner from germany 's avd motoring club said drivers should brace for higher prices at fueling stations across the country . gas goes up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices will climb even further " we expect fuel prices to increase by another three to four cent per liter , " he said .
" we 'll have to see whether oil companies will keep prices that high throughout the year .
much will depend on developments on the global energy market .
but i think that consumers will have to put up with a two-cent-per-liter hike on average in 2007 . " driving may also become more expensive for haulers using inter-city road connections .
the road toll system for heavy trucks no longer applies to the autobahn motorway network only , but has been extended to three heavily frequented overland roads leading through several german states . more money for pension funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers will have to pay more for their pensions germans will also have to fork out more this year for their contributions to the statutory pension system .
premiums have increased by almost half a percent to total 19.9 percent of people 's incomes .
taxes on capital gains will be levied at a much lower ceiling . and a special wealth tax goes up by 3 percent for individuals making more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 330,000 -rrb- a year .
also , special benefits for commuters are cut completely if the distance between their homes and workplaces is under 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- . checking welfare recipients bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials will check unemployment recipients more carefully in addition , agencies are now taking a closer look at who 's entitled to state benefits . " whoever turns down an acceptable job offer will see their unemployment benefit payments reduced , " said john-philip hammersen , a spokesman for the central employment agency in nuremberg . he added that the abuse of the welfare system has to be curbed dramatically . " regulations to this effect will be applied more stringently from now on , " he said .
" those who opt to turn down a reasonable offer for the second or third time will risk losing up to 100 percent of all benefits . " nevertheless experts do n't expect a new round of public moaning and groaning over this year 's financial challenges .
after all , most people here do seem to appreciate that the good times are over and unlikely to return any time soon . harry graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : good news for germany 's economy although sales tax increases at the beginning of 2007 are likely to temporarily dampen the german economy , the economic outlook for next year is extremely positive , says dw-radio 's karl zawadzky .

both sites formerly belonged to siemens , which sold them to taiwan-based benq in august 2005 because of disappointing sales figures and rising costs . a spokeswoman for the munich court said it was still possible that an investor could take over part of the operation during the insolvency proceedings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich benq employees protested planned lay-offs in november chairman of the works council , michael leucker told news agency ap he believed an unnamed german-american investor would step in tuesday at the last minute to buy out the flailing mobile phone company , which could mean several hundred benq employees would get to keep their jobs . according to reports , some 500 employees have already found positions elsewhere .

but 12 children and three women were killed by the tons of falling rubble . " we saw casualties on the street and in the hall , " said florian halter from the federal chamber of architects , who was at the scene .

the site was initially to be sealed up , but is now planned as a museum . ron lerke calls out a greeting and his voice echoes into the darkness - 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of it , to be exact .
he is underground , in what used to be the west german government 's ultra-secret atomic bunker , located deep in western germany near the french border .
and it ’ s here , in a tunnel stretching into a black abyss , that a restored section of the bunker will be used for the first time . lerke is head engineer of the project to turn the bunker into a tourist site .
he walks slowly with a flashlight through the bunker , 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- underground , as danger warnings line the walls on the way to decontamination showers , sleeping quarters , a hospital , even a room set up for cutting hair . most of the rooms are empty and unlit , with dirt floors .
in the first 100 meters , at least five massive steel doors are set into the wall , ready to slide shut in case of emergency . this area is a tiny sliver in the 19 kilometers of subterranean passageways , but when it ’ s opened up as a museum in early 2008 , it will offer the public what they never would have seen - an area where a chosen 3,000 people would have holed up for 30 days after a nuclear attack . “ we call it the fortress of the nuclear age , " said florian mausbach , president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning who leads the project . secrecy spurred public interest in the end , mausbach says the bunker was never actually used to house government officials , who would have left west germany ’ s nearby capital of bonn to find refuge there .
by the late 1990 ’ s , after the capital had moved to berlin , lawmakers decided to close down the structure , and started in 2001 to seal it up and bury it forever . but the public wanted a peek inside , said mausbach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tunnels stretch for 18 kilometers “ there 's a lot of interest by the people around that area and beyond to look around in the tunnel , because it was always a secret , " he said .
" so i thought we should keep part of the tunnel . " its location typifies the cold war balance between life and destruction , added mausbach . after the government toyed with the idea of selling the tunnel - some ideas were to convert it into a disco or an area to cultivate mushrooms - mausbach said the finance ministry agreed on the idea of a small museum , which was actually cheaper than sealing the area up forever . not really a secret the museum entrance is nestled into a hill , amidst a backdrop of dense forest and vineyards overlooking the town of ahrweiler .
down a dirt path , through a gate lined with barbed wire , is one of 38 entrances to this network of bunkers . markus heibel of the federal office for building and regional planning said that , though the existence of the bunker was meant to be a well-kept secret during the cold war and afterward , it required almost 200 local employees . " it was not really a secret , " he said .
" they also knew about it in east germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker was a well-known secret in fact , the underground labyrinth dates back to the late 19th century , when tunnels meant for moving supplies by train were built all the way into france .
during world war ii , concentration camp prisoners slaved away building v2 rockets in the tunnels .
by 1960 , west germany began the 12-year project of turning it all into a nuclear bunker in compliance with nato stipulations . with all that history , locals welcome turning the bunker into a museum . jürgen reiche , head of haus der geschichte museum in bonn , leads the museum side of this project .
he says the bunker ’ s history closely parallels that of germany - and that restoring even some of the complex into a museum is vital to remembering germany ’ s past . “ it ’ s not only a bunker - it is part of german history , ” he said . provoking questions only four windows exist in the entire 19 kilometer complex .
one of them is near the planned entrance to the museum , with a view no larger than a sheet of paper .
it ’ s bombproof and can be covered by a sliding steel plate .
but in 2008 , it will be opened up - for a stark look at the nuclear age . as reiche looks over plans for the museum , he says that the experience will lead visitors to ask the right questions about the bunker ’ s significance , both then and now . “ if the earth is destroyed , you can ’ t live on it , " he said .

the site was initially to be sealed up , but is now planned as a museum . ron lerke calls out a greeting and his voice echoes into the darkness - 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of it , to be exact .
he is underground , in what used to be the west german government 's ultra-secret atomic bunker , located deep in western germany near the french border .
and it ’ s here , in a tunnel stretching into a black abyss , that a restored section of the bunker will be used for the first time . lerke is head engineer of the project to turn the bunker into a tourist site .
he walks slowly with a flashlight through the bunker , 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- underground , as danger warnings line the walls on the way to decontamination showers , sleeping quarters , a hospital , even a room set up for cutting hair . most of the rooms are empty and unlit , with dirt floors .
in the first 100 meters , at least five massive steel doors are set into the wall , ready to slide shut in case of emergency . this area is a tiny sliver in the 19 kilometers of subterranean passageways , but when it ’ s opened up as a museum in early 2008 , it will offer the public what they never would have seen - an area where a chosen 3,000 people would have holed up for 30 days after a nuclear attack . “ we call it the fortress of the nuclear age , " said florian mausbach , president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning who leads the project . secrecy spurred public interest in the end , mausbach says the bunker was never actually used to house government officials , who would have left west germany ’ s nearby capital of bonn to find refuge there .
by the late 1990 ’ s , after the capital had moved to berlin , lawmakers decided to close down the structure , and started in 2001 to seal it up and bury it forever . but the public wanted a peek inside , said mausbach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tunnels stretch for 18 kilometers “ there 's a lot of interest by the people around that area and beyond to look around in the tunnel , because it was always a secret , " he said .
" so i thought we should keep part of the tunnel . " its location typifies the cold war balance between life and destruction , added mausbach . after the government toyed with the idea of selling the tunnel - some ideas were to convert it into a disco or an area to cultivate mushrooms - mausbach said the finance ministry agreed on the idea of a small museum , which was actually cheaper than sealing the area up forever . not really a secret the museum entrance is nestled into a hill , amidst a backdrop of dense forest and vineyards overlooking the town of ahrweiler .
down a dirt path , through a gate lined with barbed wire , is one of 38 entrances to this network of bunkers . markus heibel of the federal office for building and regional planning said that , though the existence of the bunker was meant to be a well-kept secret during the cold war and afterward , it required almost 200 local employees . " it was not really a secret , " he said .
" they also knew about it in east germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker was a well-known secret in fact , the underground labyrinth dates back to the late 19th century , when tunnels meant for moving supplies by train were built all the way into france .
during world war ii , concentration camp prisoners slaved away building v2 rockets in the tunnels .
by 1960 , west germany began the 12-year project of turning it all into a nuclear bunker in compliance with nato stipulations . with all that history , locals welcome turning the bunker into a museum . jürgen reiche , head of haus der geschichte museum in bonn , leads the museum side of this project .
he says the bunker ’ s history closely parallels that of germany - and that restoring even some of the complex into a museum is vital to remembering germany ’ s past . “ it ’ s not only a bunker - it is part of german history , ” he said . provoking questions only four windows exist in the entire 19 kilometer complex .
one of them is near the planned entrance to the museum , with a view no larger than a sheet of paper .
it ’ s bombproof and can be covered by a sliding steel plate .
but in 2008 , it will be opened up - for a stark look at the nuclear age . as reiche looks over plans for the museum , he says that the experience will lead visitors to ask the right questions about the bunker ’ s significance , both then and now . “ if the earth is destroyed , you can ’ t live on it , " he said .

" its location typifies the cold war balance between life and destruction , added mausbach . after the government toyed with the idea of selling the tunnel - some ideas were to convert it into a disco or an area to cultivate mushrooms - mausbach said the finance ministry agreed on the idea of a small museum , which was actually cheaper than sealing the area up forever . not really a secret the museum entrance is nestled into a hill , amidst a backdrop of dense forest and vineyards overlooking the town of ahrweiler .
down a dirt path , through a gate lined with barbed wire , is one of 38 entrances to this network of bunkers . markus heibel of the federal office for building and regional planning said that , though the existence of the bunker was meant to be a well-kept secret during the cold war and afterward , it required almost 200 local employees . " it was not really a secret , " he said .
" they also knew about it in east germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker was a well-known secret in fact , the underground labyrinth dates back to the late 19th century , when tunnels meant for moving supplies by train were built all the way into france .
during world war ii , concentration camp prisoners slaved away building v2 rockets in the tunnels .
by 1960 , west germany began the 12-year project of turning it all into a nuclear bunker in compliance with nato stipulations . with all that history , locals welcome turning the bunker into a museum . jürgen reiche , head of haus der geschichte museum in bonn , leads the museum side of this project .
he says the bunker ’ s history closely parallels that of germany - and that restoring even some of the complex into a museum is vital to remembering germany ’ s past . “ it ’ s not only a bunker - it is part of german history , ” he said . provoking questions only four windows exist in the entire 19 kilometer complex .
one of them is near the planned entrance to the museum , with a view no larger than a sheet of paper .
it ’ s bombproof and can be covered by a sliding steel plate .
but in 2008 , it will be opened up - for a stark look at the nuclear age . as reiche looks over plans for the museum , he says that the experience will lead visitors to ask the right questions about the bunker ’ s significance , both then and now . “ if the earth is destroyed , you can ’ t live on it , " he said .

" the competition brought on by globalization and the eu 's expansion to include 10 new states in 2004 forced a serious restructuring of the corporate sector , " the paper said . " … germany inc. was at the forefront of this mini-revolution . " diplomacy matters diplomatically , germany began talking about " national interests " and a " german path " under former chancellor gerhard schröder , who provoked the worst post-war crisis in german-american relations by using his iraq war opposition to help win his re-election in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier presents the german eu presidency program at a press conference this sort of talk - unthinkable during the cold war - has been toned down by current chancellor merkel , who nevertheless is sticking to schröder 's calls for germany to get a permanent seat on the united nations security council . as the eu 's biggest power , germany already has an upgraded un status under what is known as " p5 + germany " : the five permanent un security council members plus germany , who are dealing with issues such as the iranian nuclear crisis . military transitions germany 's military transition is one of the biggest ongoing shifts in the country 's global positioning since unification . the bundeswehr , or federal armed forces , will in coming years be forged into a 35,000-member rapid-reaction force for global operations , backed by a 70,000-member stabilization force for peacekeeping . during the transition , berlin is acquiring heavy airlift planes capable of taking troops anywhere in the world , while at the same time scrapping hundreds of the formidable leopard ii main battle tanks which once faced off against warsaw pact forces . reforms , however , are slow moving and , at present , germany still can not deploy more than 10,000 soldiers for combat or peacekeeping operations - despite a total troop strength of over 250,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is scrapping tanks for planes " the german armed forces are still structured for the cold war , " said karl-heinz kamp , security policy coordinator for the konrad adenauer foundation , which has close links to merkel 's christian democratic union party . germany 's military was dissolved in 1945 after the nazi defeat and only recreated in 1955 .
throughout the cold war , german troops were strictly limited to defensive missions within the nato area . modern missions it was only in 1994 that german troops were given a green light by the country 's highest court to take part in combat missions outside the nato alliance . since then , there has been a steady growth in the number of german military deployments abroad with bigger and bigger missions . luftwaffe jets took part in the first german combat operations since 1945 during the 1999 nato-led war with serbia to halt ethnic cleansing in kosovo . " never again auschwitz ! " was how greens foreign minister joschka fischer convinced members of his own pacifist party to back the historic deployment . today about 9,000 german troops are serving on international missions , including with nato forces in afghanistan and in the balkans . the latest german military mission , deploying forces as part of a beefed-up united nations unifil force in lebanon , also breaks new ground as berlin 's first mideast deployment since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany took the global stage when it hosted the world cup this summer but germany still seeks to keep its troops out of combat zones . soldiers in afghanistan are based in the mainly peaceful north and are barred from taking part in fighting in southern afghanistan with us , british and canadian forces . in lebanon , the germans refused to send ground troops and instead deployed naval forces based off the coast . military spending another area where german aspirations for a bigger global role clash with reality is financing .
berlin spends less than 1.5 percent of its gdp on the military - far less than the us , which devotes 3.7 percent of its budget to the armed forces . a far higher proportion of the german military budget goes for personnel costs - and not for equipment . " the bundeswehr spends 60 percent of its money on personnel - something 's wrong with that , " kamp said . kamp also worries that the three german ministries responsible for global relations - defense , foreign and development aid - have felt the brunt of federal budget cuts . " this means that at a time when germany 's foreign responsibility has grown , we cut foreign spending by 50 percent , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german chancellor angela merkel announces us visit german chancellor angela merkel is to visit us president george w. bush early next year to brief the us leader on germany 's priorities as the president of both the eu and the g8 .

" this dual role comes at a very historic time in world affairs , " said gary smith , executive director of the american academy think tank in berlin .
" germany and especially chancellor merkel have a great opportunity to exert leadership and reach concrete goals . " mighty germany europe 's biggest economy has increasingly been flexing its business , diplomatic and even , for peaceful purposes , military muscle since winning back full sovereignty following german reunification in 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank in frankfurt germany is at the core of the euro single-currency zone and the european central bank is building a huge new headquarters in frankfurt . major german corporations have adeptly ridden the wave of globalization and exports have continued to soar during 2006 , with the euro hitting near-record highs against the dollar . even the sometimes euro-skeptical wall street journal was full of praise in a recent commentary . " the competition brought on by globalization and the eu 's expansion to include 10 new states in 2004 forced a serious restructuring of the corporate sector , " the paper said . " … germany inc. was at the forefront of this mini-revolution . " diplomacy matters diplomatically , germany began talking about " national interests " and a " german path " under former chancellor gerhard schröder , who provoked the worst post-war crisis in german-american relations by using his iraq war opposition to help win his re-election in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier presents the german eu presidency program at a press conference this sort of talk - unthinkable during the cold war - has been toned down by current chancellor merkel , who nevertheless is sticking to schröder 's calls for germany to get a permanent seat on the united nations security council . as the eu 's biggest power , germany already has an upgraded un status under what is known as " p5 + germany " : the five permanent un security council members plus germany , who are dealing with issues such as the iranian nuclear crisis . military transitions germany 's military transition is one of the biggest ongoing shifts in the country 's global positioning since unification . the bundeswehr , or federal armed forces , will in coming years be forged into a 35,000-member rapid-reaction force for global operations , backed by a 70,000-member stabilization force for peacekeeping . during the transition , berlin is acquiring heavy airlift planes capable of taking troops anywhere in the world , while at the same time scrapping hundreds of the formidable leopard ii main battle tanks which once faced off against warsaw pact forces . reforms , however , are slow moving and , at present , germany still can not deploy more than 10,000 soldiers for combat or peacekeeping operations - despite a total troop strength of over 250,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is scrapping tanks for planes " the german armed forces are still structured for the cold war , " said karl-heinz kamp , security policy coordinator for the konrad adenauer foundation , which has close links to merkel 's christian democratic union party . germany 's military was dissolved in 1945 after the nazi defeat and only recreated in 1955 .
throughout the cold war , german troops were strictly limited to defensive missions within the nato area . modern missions it was only in 1994 that german troops were given a green light by the country 's highest court to take part in combat missions outside the nato alliance . since then , there has been a steady growth in the number of german military deployments abroad with bigger and bigger missions . luftwaffe jets took part in the first german combat operations since 1945 during the 1999 nato-led war with serbia to halt ethnic cleansing in kosovo .

under the scheme , parents will receive up to 1,800 euros a month per child to take off work to care for newborns . mothers who gave birth before midnight on new year 's eve missed out .
the benefit only applies to births after january 1 , 2007 . " of course some parents did hope that their children would arrive a little later , " said senior doctor volker thaele of halle university hospital 's maternity department . one such mother , gabriele meyer , took magnesium and homeopathic medicine to delay the birth of her twins , she told reuters tv . " it means 20,000 euros to me , " she said . however , doctors said that 41-year-old meyer 's twin foetuses were too small and scheduled her for a caesarean section on friday , just days before the new government benefits took effect .
the twins were initially due on jan .
22 . helping families under the scheme , parents who take time off from work to take care of their babies , can receive two-thirds of their net salary - up to 18,000 euros for 12 months .
if the other parent also takes leave , the benefit can extend to 14 months . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " german family minister ursula von der leyen told the online edition of daily tagesspiegel . given the attractive financial incentives , german media has been full of stories in recent weeks about heavily-pregnant women anxiously seeking medical advice on how to delay births until the new year so that they could qualify for the aid . physicians and midwives have been saying that avoiding red wine , stress as well as physical or sexual activity are among the recommended natural methods to help prevent inducing birth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen has seven children of her own none of the advice seemed to have worked in halle , a mid-sized city in eastern germany , where no babies at all were delivered on new year 's day , whereas six had been delivered in the preceding 48 hours . a bit disappointed the complexities of the new tax and welfare rules mean that the main beneficiaries are high-earning professional women in the top tax bracket who received no subsidies in the past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 02.01.2007 many germans with less in their pockets in 2007 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not quite as bad yet , but germans will have to count their cents for ordinary germans , the new year will primarily mean just one thing : they 'll have to tighten their belts even further .
premiums for statutory unemployment insurance will go down , but that 's where the good news ends . a wide range of consumer goods in germany has become more expensive , thanks to a special new year 's present from the government in berlin .
it 's imposed a 3 percent valued added tax increase on clothes , cars , furniture , electrical appliances and other goods , bringing vat up to 19 percent . this is expected to reduce the shopping activities of ordinary citizens after many a shopping spree in 2006 .
opposition leaders such as guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's free-market , liberal free democratic party , protested loudly against the tax hike which the government says is needed to consolidate the budget and reduce state debt . " how is , say , a family of four supposed to save money when faced with spiraling energy costs and a state policy that 's reaching even deeper into their pockets ? "
westerwelle asked .
" politicians from the grand coalition government are calling on citizens to put more money aside for old age insurance , but they 're not willing to ease people 's financial situation on the tax front .
this is really absurd ! " no drastic price hikes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will extended shopping hours make up for any losses ?
however economic pundits believe that in many cases prices for consumer goods will not really go up tangibly . retailers will have to decrease their profit margins , and some of them already increased prices in the old year . " retailers are not in a position to pass on the value-added tax hike to consumers just like that , " said hubertus pellengahr , who heads germany 's association of retailers .
" this applies in particular to january - a traditional month of discount sales here in germany . " but once again , it 's drivers who are expected to suffer most from the vat hike which also applies to fuel .
johannes hübner from germany 's avd motoring club said drivers should brace for higher prices at fueling stations across the country . gas goes up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices will climb even further " we expect fuel prices to increase by another three to four cent per liter , " he said .
" we 'll have to see whether oil companies will keep prices that high throughout the year .
much will depend on developments on the global energy market .
but i think that consumers will have to put up with a two-cent-per-liter hike on average in 2007 . " driving may also become more expensive for haulers using inter-city road connections .
the road toll system for heavy trucks no longer applies to the autobahn motorway network only , but has been extended to three heavily frequented overland roads leading through several german states . more money for pension funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers will have to pay more for their pensions germans will also have to fork out more this year for their contributions to the statutory pension system .
premiums have increased by almost half a percent to total 19.9 percent of people 's incomes .
taxes on capital gains will be levied at a much lower ceiling . and a special wealth tax goes up by 3 percent for individuals making more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 330,000 -rrb- a year .
also , special benefits for commuters are cut completely if the distance between their homes and workplaces is under 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- . checking welfare recipients bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials will check unemployment recipients more carefully in addition , agencies are now taking a closer look at who 's entitled to state benefits . " whoever turns down an acceptable job offer will see their unemployment benefit payments reduced , " said john-philip hammersen , a spokesman for the central employment agency in nuremberg . he added that the abuse of the welfare system has to be curbed dramatically .

premiums for statutory unemployment insurance will go down , but that 's where the good news ends . a wide range of consumer goods in germany has become more expensive , thanks to a special new year 's present from the government in berlin .
it 's imposed a 3 percent valued added tax increase on clothes , cars , furniture , electrical appliances and other goods , bringing vat up to 19 percent . this is expected to reduce the shopping activities of ordinary citizens after many a shopping spree in 2006 .
opposition leaders such as guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's free-market , liberal free democratic party , protested loudly against the tax hike which the government says is needed to consolidate the budget and reduce state debt . " how is , say , a family of four supposed to save money when faced with spiraling energy costs and a state policy that 's reaching even deeper into their pockets ? "
westerwelle asked .

" retailers are not in a position to pass on the value-added tax hike to consumers just like that , " said hubertus pellengahr , who heads germany 's association of retailers .
" this applies in particular to january - a traditional month of discount sales here in germany . " but once again , it 's drivers who are expected to suffer most from the vat hike which also applies to fuel .

taxes on capital gains will be levied at a much lower ceiling . and a special wealth tax goes up by 3 percent for individuals making more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 330,000 -rrb- a year .

her biggest challenge , however , will be breathing new life into a nearly dead eu constitution , says dw 's bernd riegert . germans are capable of enthusiasm .
they clearly displayed that when they hosted the soccer world cup in the summer of 2006 .
if only a tad of such enthusiasm flows into germany 's approach to the eu presidency , much can be achieved . merkel can succeed greatly if she manages to handle european politics not with scepticism and doubt , but with a positive , extroverted approach .
she should motivate her european team in a manner akin to former german soccer coach jürgen klinsmann , who took his players all the way to the 2006 world cup semi-final . the stalled eu constitution desperately needs someone with that kind of enthusiasm to get it back on track .

in keeping with the soccer metaphor , what is needed is scored goals rather than artful dribbling . europeans want to know what the constitution is to be composed of , what rules it should contain , and how it can be adopted .
two years following france and the netherland 's rejection of the constitution should be enough time to have redefined where things should go . little leeway to be fair , one does have to admit that " coach merkel " does not have much leeway in establishing the framework . france will elect a new president this year ; britain will gain a new prime minister this summer .

many of her ministers are against a pan-european collectivization of tasks . the attitude tends to be along the lines of : everything bad stems from the eu bureaucracy in brussels ; everything good will be decided by berlin .
unfortunately , this simplistic , false logic is widespread . six months is not much time to fulfil so many expectations .

no one knows how the new leaders of these two important eu countries will behave in the debate over the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer coach jürgen klinsmann is known for his sunny attitude the eu presidency under germany must not only tackle the eu 's constitution , it must also urgently improve ties with gas-supplier russia , forge relationships with other possible gas-suppliers in central asia and take a different approach to the middle east , from which europe receives much of its energy . attitude change ? merkel can start in her own backyard in drumming up support for europe .
many of her ministers are against a pan-european collectivization of tasks . the attitude tends to be along the lines of : everything bad stems from the eu bureaucracy in brussels ; everything good will be decided by berlin .
unfortunately , this simplistic , false logic is widespread . six months is not much time to fulfil so many expectations .
germany will not have an easy time of it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 02.01.2007 historic cold war bunker to become a museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entrance to the new cold war bunker museum during the cold war , a secret underground bunker for the west german government was constructed to protect a chosen few in case of an atomic attack .
the site was initially to be sealed up , but is now planned as a museum . ron lerke calls out a greeting and his voice echoes into the darkness - 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of it , to be exact .
he is underground , in what used to be the west german government 's ultra-secret atomic bunker , located deep in western germany near the french border .
and it ’ s here , in a tunnel stretching into a black abyss , that a restored section of the bunker will be used for the first time . lerke is head engineer of the project to turn the bunker into a tourist site .
he walks slowly with a flashlight through the bunker , 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- underground , as danger warnings line the walls on the way to decontamination showers , sleeping quarters , a hospital , even a room set up for cutting hair . most of the rooms are empty and unlit , with dirt floors .
in the first 100 meters , at least five massive steel doors are set into the wall , ready to slide shut in case of emergency . this area is a tiny sliver in the 19 kilometers of subterranean passageways , but when it ’ s opened up as a museum in early 2008 , it will offer the public what they never would have seen - an area where a chosen 3,000 people would have holed up for 30 days after a nuclear attack . “ we call it the fortress of the nuclear age , " said florian mausbach , president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning who leads the project . secrecy spurred public interest in the end , mausbach says the bunker was never actually used to house government officials , who would have left west germany ’ s nearby capital of bonn to find refuge there .
by the late 1990 ’ s , after the capital had moved to berlin , lawmakers decided to close down the structure , and started in 2001 to seal it up and bury it forever . but the public wanted a peek inside , said mausbach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tunnels stretch for 18 kilometers “ there 's a lot of interest by the people around that area and beyond to look around in the tunnel , because it was always a secret , " he said .
" so i thought we should keep part of the tunnel . " its location typifies the cold war balance between life and destruction , added mausbach . after the government toyed with the idea of selling the tunnel - some ideas were to convert it into a disco or an area to cultivate mushrooms - mausbach said the finance ministry agreed on the idea of a small museum , which was actually cheaper than sealing the area up forever . not really a secret the museum entrance is nestled into a hill , amidst a backdrop of dense forest and vineyards overlooking the town of ahrweiler .
down a dirt path , through a gate lined with barbed wire , is one of 38 entrances to this network of bunkers . markus heibel of the federal office for building and regional planning said that , though the existence of the bunker was meant to be a well-kept secret during the cold war and afterward , it required almost 200 local employees . " it was not really a secret , " he said .
" they also knew about it in east germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker was a well-known secret in fact , the underground labyrinth dates back to the late 19th century , when tunnels meant for moving supplies by train were built all the way into france .
during world war ii , concentration camp prisoners slaved away building v2 rockets in the tunnels .
by 1960 , west germany began the 12-year project of turning it all into a nuclear bunker in compliance with nato stipulations . with all that history , locals welcome turning the bunker into a museum . jürgen reiche , head of haus der geschichte museum in bonn , leads the museum side of this project .
he says the bunker ’ s history closely parallels that of germany - and that restoring even some of the complex into a museum is vital to remembering germany ’ s past . “ it ’ s not only a bunker - it is part of german history , ” he said . provoking questions only four windows exist in the entire 19 kilometer complex .
one of them is near the planned entrance to the museum , with a view no larger than a sheet of paper .
it ’ s bombproof and can be covered by a sliding steel plate .
but in 2008 , it will be opened up - for a stark look at the nuclear age . as reiche looks over plans for the museum , he says that the experience will lead visitors to ask the right questions about the bunker ’ s significance , both then and now . “ if the earth is destroyed , you can ’ t live on it , " he said .

the site was initially to be sealed up , but is now planned as a museum . ron lerke calls out a greeting and his voice echoes into the darkness - 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of it , to be exact .
he is underground , in what used to be the west german government 's ultra-secret atomic bunker , located deep in western germany near the french border .
and it ’ s here , in a tunnel stretching into a black abyss , that a restored section of the bunker will be used for the first time . lerke is head engineer of the project to turn the bunker into a tourist site .
he walks slowly with a flashlight through the bunker , 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- underground , as danger warnings line the walls on the way to decontamination showers , sleeping quarters , a hospital , even a room set up for cutting hair . most of the rooms are empty and unlit , with dirt floors .
in the first 100 meters , at least five massive steel doors are set into the wall , ready to slide shut in case of emergency . this area is a tiny sliver in the 19 kilometers of subterranean passageways , but when it ’ s opened up as a museum in early 2008 , it will offer the public what they never would have seen - an area where a chosen 3,000 people would have holed up for 30 days after a nuclear attack . “ we call it the fortress of the nuclear age , " said florian mausbach , president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning who leads the project . secrecy spurred public interest in the end , mausbach says the bunker was never actually used to house government officials , who would have left west germany ’ s nearby capital of bonn to find refuge there .
by the late 1990 ’ s , after the capital had moved to berlin , lawmakers decided to close down the structure , and started in 2001 to seal it up and bury it forever . but the public wanted a peek inside , said mausbach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tunnels stretch for 18 kilometers “ there 's a lot of interest by the people around that area and beyond to look around in the tunnel , because it was always a secret , " he said .
" so i thought we should keep part of the tunnel . " its location typifies the cold war balance between life and destruction , added mausbach . after the government toyed with the idea of selling the tunnel - some ideas were to convert it into a disco or an area to cultivate mushrooms - mausbach said the finance ministry agreed on the idea of a small museum , which was actually cheaper than sealing the area up forever . not really a secret the museum entrance is nestled into a hill , amidst a backdrop of dense forest and vineyards overlooking the town of ahrweiler .
down a dirt path , through a gate lined with barbed wire , is one of 38 entrances to this network of bunkers . markus heibel of the federal office for building and regional planning said that , though the existence of the bunker was meant to be a well-kept secret during the cold war and afterward , it required almost 200 local employees . " it was not really a secret , " he said .
" they also knew about it in east germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker was a well-known secret in fact , the underground labyrinth dates back to the late 19th century , when tunnels meant for moving supplies by train were built all the way into france .
during world war ii , concentration camp prisoners slaved away building v2 rockets in the tunnels .
by 1960 , west germany began the 12-year project of turning it all into a nuclear bunker in compliance with nato stipulations . with all that history , locals welcome turning the bunker into a museum . jürgen reiche , head of haus der geschichte museum in bonn , leads the museum side of this project .
he says the bunker ’ s history closely parallels that of germany - and that restoring even some of the complex into a museum is vital to remembering germany ’ s past . “ it ’ s not only a bunker - it is part of german history , ” he said . provoking questions only four windows exist in the entire 19 kilometer complex .
one of them is near the planned entrance to the museum , with a view no larger than a sheet of paper .
it ’ s bombproof and can be covered by a sliding steel plate .
but in 2008 , it will be opened up - for a stark look at the nuclear age . as reiche looks over plans for the museum , he says that the experience will lead visitors to ask the right questions about the bunker ’ s significance , both then and now . “ if the earth is destroyed , you can ’ t live on it , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 02.01.2007 major euro zone expansion now on hold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia became the 13th member of the euro zone slovenia , adopting the euro on jan .
1 , might be one of the few additions to the euro zone until after 2010 because of eu members ' inability or reluctance to adopt the euro . five years after 12 eu members switched to the single european currency , hopes for a rapid expansion of the euro zone have been dashed by delays in eastern europe and a lack of interest from west european holdouts . in 2002 , 304 million european citizens in countries including france , germany , ireland and spain waved goodbye to their francs , marks , punts and pesetas , and expectations were high that they would be joined by millions more by the end of the decade . with the exception of britain and denmark , which have special euro zone opt-outs , all european union members are supposed eventually to make the euro their official currency . economists at the time predicted that the 10 countries which joined the eu in 2004 , mostly former members of the communist bloc , would adopt the euro no later than 2010 . a first wave of three or four countries was expected to be ready by january 2007 . but the forecasters failed to take into account that there would be governments that were able but unwilling to adopt the euro , others that were willing but unable , and some that were neither willing nor able .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia is the first post communist country to have the euro in the end , the club will gain just one new member on january 1 , when slovenia 's two million inhabitants give up their tolars . spectacular growth cyprus ' population of 750,000 and the 400,000 maltese are expected to swap their pounds and liras the following year . slovakia , with a population of 5.4 million , is also on course to switch from the koruna in january 2009 , despite the formation earlier this year of a coalition government including euro-sceptic populists and the far right . but things are looking more complicated for the six other countries that joined the eu two years ago , taking the bloc 's membership to 25 . the baltic nations of lithuania and estonia had hoped to join the euro zone in 2007 .
in theory , nothing could have been easier . the lithuanian lita and the estonian kroon are tied to the euro and the health of their public finances , a key measure for euro zone membership , causes envy in countries like france or germany . but both are experiencing spectacular growth - in estonia the rate was 12 percent in the third quarter alone - and consumer prices are rising slightly faster than in the rest of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland happily joined the eu but not the euro zone the maastricht treaty which laid the foundations of the eurozone sets inflation caps for members , and the baltic states have been just above the target . indulgence to founders lithuania was annoyed that it did not get a green light earlier this year .
in march , its average inflation rate was just 0.06 percent above the limit . the stern stance of the 12 euro zone members towards potential members was a surprise for economists , who say the inflation criteria are irrelevant for countries that are catching up with western europe and have already pegged their currencies to the euro . in order to achieve the living standards of the eu 's western members , the former communist countries have little choice but to let salaries and prices increase , which inevitably fuels inflation . the current intransigence contrasts with the indulgence towards euro zone founders such as belgium and italy .
bildunterschrift : slovenia 's new currency has national symbols on it both were allowed to adopt the single currency even though their public debt represented more than 100 percent of their gross domestic product .
under euro zone rules , the maximum is supposed to be 60 percent . poland seemingly uninterested while they are solid supporters of the euro , the baltic states have bitterly resigned themselves to having to wait - but are making their discontent known . " it would not be very good if the otherwise good performing countries are left out of the euro area for an extended period , just because of the inflation criterion , " estonian finance minister aivar soerd told afp . apart from slovakia , other new eu members in central europe have put the euro on the back burner . poland , where euro-sceptic conservatives have been in power for a year , has declined to set a timetable , simply saying that it aims to hold a referendum in 2010 on whether to give up the zloty - even though joining the single currency was one of the planks of the eu membership treaty already approved by polish voters in 2003 . warsaw points to the example of sweden , which joined the eu in 1995 and decided to keep the krona after a referendum in 2003 . hungary , which faces a widening public deficit , has pushed its euro zone target back to 2013 , while the czech republic is planning to join in 2012 . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de excitement and hope as slovenia adopts the euro slovenia on new year 's day will become the first former communist state to adopt the european union 's common currency as it exchanges its tolar for the euro .

despite the euro 's strength , european citizens remain skeptical , blaming it for making things more expensive .

" " a place of worship - be it a mosque , church or synagogue - should be at the heart of a community , " joachim swietlik , head of the campaign against the mosque , told news agency reuters . police evicted three left-wing demonstrators after a scuffle over a placard in support of the mosque . sect considered peaceful residents of pankow-heinersdorf have been protesting for months against the planned mosque , arguing that the sect had no members living anywhere near the site .
some of those protests have been attended by members of the far right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- . berlin authorities gave permission to build the mosque just before christmas after a months-long battle with opponents . the muslim group said it had been looking to build a new mosque because it had outgrown its present community center in the west berlin suburb of reinickendorf . the ahmadiyya community was founded at the end of the 19th century in what was then british india .
it claims to represent the latter day renaissance of islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the ahmaddiya community pray at the planned mosque 's site the sect , which is classed as peaceful by the german domestic intelligence service , has some 30,000 members and operates more than a dozen mosques in germany .
at the ceremony , members held up placards reading , " islam means peace , love for all . " abdul basit tariq , chairman of the sect 's berlin chapter , said the mosque was being financed by the sect 's women 's organization and would bear the name khadidja , after the first wife of the prophet mohammed . abdullah uwe wagishauer , head of germany 's ahmdaiyya 's , said he hoped for good ties between his community and opponents of the mosque . " there are no difficulties with neighbors of ahmadiyya mosques built elsewhere , " he told reuters .
" our mosques help interreligious dialogue and mutual understanding . " mosques not new in germany mosques are by no means a new development in germany .
as far back as the 16th century , prussian king frederick william i had the first mosque built in potsdam for his turkish soldiers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sehitlik mosque in west berlin 's neukölln neighborhood in berlin , the first mosque was constructed in 1924 . now there are some 30 muslim places of worship in the german capital .
but most of them are in neukölln and kreuzberg , in the western part of the city . these are the neighborhoods in which guest workers , mainly from turkey , moved to when they first arrived in germany in the 1960s and 1970s .
today the multi-ethnic districts are still home to berlin 's largest turkish community as well as to large numbers of arab and east european immigrants . in the former communist and , at the time , internationally insular east berlin , there were no mosques which might explain the protests , tariq says . " these are unfounded fears , " tariq says .
" people listen to the news , see scenes on television and that 's why they 're scared of muslims .
they think muslims are terrorists and suicide bombers .
their heads are full of these things . " opposition to the planned mosque has underlined germany 's problems in integrating its 3.2-million strong muslim community .
the problem is especially acute in formerly communist-ruled east germany where few muslims and other immigrants have settled . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de female imams in german mosques get a mixed reception turkey 's religious council has already sent 13 women to germany to serve in mosques .

at the ceremony , members held up placards reading , " islam means peace , love for all . " abdul basit tariq , chairman of the sect 's berlin chapter , said the mosque was being financed by the sect 's women 's organization and would bear the name khadidja , after the first wife of the prophet mohammed . abdullah uwe wagishauer , head of germany 's ahmdaiyya 's , said he hoped for good ties between his community and opponents of the mosque . " there are no difficulties with neighbors of ahmadiyya mosques built elsewhere , " he told reuters .
" our mosques help interreligious dialogue and mutual understanding . " mosques not new in germany mosques are by no means a new development in germany .
as far back as the 16th century , prussian king frederick william i had the first mosque built in potsdam for his turkish soldiers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sehitlik mosque in west berlin 's neukölln neighborhood in berlin , the first mosque was constructed in 1924 . now there are some 30 muslim places of worship in the german capital .
but most of them are in neukölln and kreuzberg , in the western part of the city . these are the neighborhoods in which guest workers , mainly from turkey , moved to when they first arrived in germany in the 1960s and 1970s .
today the multi-ethnic districts are still home to berlin 's largest turkish community as well as to large numbers of arab and east european immigrants . in the former communist and , at the time , internationally insular east berlin , there were no mosques which might explain the protests , tariq says . " these are unfounded fears , " tariq says .
" people listen to the news , see scenes on television and that 's why they 're scared of muslims .
they think muslims are terrorists and suicide bombers .
their heads are full of these things . " opposition to the planned mosque has underlined germany 's problems in integrating its 3.2-million strong muslim community .
the problem is especially acute in formerly communist-ruled east germany where few muslims and other immigrants have settled . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de female imams in german mosques get a mixed reception turkey 's religious council has already sent 13 women to germany to serve in mosques .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 02.01.2007 drumming up support for the eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel has much on her agenda as she kicks off the eu presidency .
her biggest challenge , however , will be breathing new life into a nearly dead eu constitution , says dw 's bernd riegert . germans are capable of enthusiasm .
they clearly displayed that when they hosted the soccer world cup in the summer of 2006 .
if only a tad of such enthusiasm flows into germany 's approach to the eu presidency , much can be achieved . merkel can succeed greatly if she manages to handle european politics not with scepticism and doubt , but with a positive , extroverted approach .
she should motivate her european team in a manner akin to former german soccer coach jürgen klinsmann , who took his players all the way to the 2006 world cup semi-final . the stalled eu constitution desperately needs someone with that kind of enthusiasm to get it back on track .
with the 50th anniversary of european unification coincidentally occurring during germany 's eu presidency tenure , merkel and her team have a major chance to rally support for the eu treaty , and thus , for europe 's future . clear results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel looked toward the future of the eu during her new year 's address hopefully , the chancellor will do more than merely give nice speeches and organize multi-cultural events near the brandenburg gate in berlin . the european political " fan " is going to have to see clear results in the eu constitution debate in order to get enthused about the treaty .
in keeping with the soccer metaphor , what is needed is scored goals rather than artful dribbling . europeans want to know what the constitution is to be composed of , what rules it should contain , and how it can be adopted .
two years following france and the netherland 's rejection of the constitution should be enough time to have redefined where things should go . little leeway to be fair , one does have to admit that " coach merkel " does not have much leeway in establishing the framework . france will elect a new president this year ; britain will gain a new prime minister this summer .
no one knows how the new leaders of these two important eu countries will behave in the debate over the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer coach jürgen klinsmann is known for his sunny attitude the eu presidency under germany must not only tackle the eu 's constitution , it must also urgently improve ties with gas-supplier russia , forge relationships with other possible gas-suppliers in central asia and take a different approach to the middle east , from which europe receives much of its energy . attitude change ? merkel can start in her own backyard in drumming up support for europe .
many of her ministers are against a pan-european collectivization of tasks . the attitude tends to be along the lines of : everything bad stems from the eu bureaucracy in brussels ; everything good will be decided by berlin .
unfortunately , this simplistic , false logic is widespread . six months is not much time to fulfil so many expectations .
germany will not have an easy time of it .
fanmeile -lrb- fan mile -rrb- was chosen as the german word of the year in 2006 .
it 's unlikely that the eu constitution will gain that honor , but people should try to work toward that goal nonetheless . dw 's brussels correspondent bernd riegert -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany faces daunting agenda for eu , g8 presidencies germany will fight to revive international efforts for middle east peace , relaunch the eu constitution and advocate a gentler form of globalization when it takes over the presidencies of the eu and the g8 monday .

" " a place of worship - be it a mosque , church or synagogue - should be at the heart of a community , " joachim swietlik , head of the campaign against the mosque , told news agency reuters . police evicted three left-wing demonstrators after a scuffle over a placard in support of the mosque . sect considered peaceful residents of pankow-heinersdorf have been protesting for months against the planned mosque , arguing that the sect had no members living anywhere near the site .

1 , might be one of the few additions to the euro zone until after 2010 because of eu members ' inability or reluctance to adopt the euro . five years after 12 eu members switched to the single european currency , hopes for a rapid expansion of the euro zone have been dashed by delays in eastern europe and a lack of interest from west european holdouts . in 2002 , 304 million european citizens in countries including france , germany , ireland and spain waved goodbye to their francs , marks , punts and pesetas , and expectations were high that they would be joined by millions more by the end of the decade . with the exception of britain and denmark , which have special euro zone opt-outs , all european union members are supposed eventually to make the euro their official currency . economists at the time predicted that the 10 countries which joined the eu in 2004 , mostly former members of the communist bloc , would adopt the euro no later than 2010 . a first wave of three or four countries was expected to be ready by january 2007 . but the forecasters failed to take into account that there would be governments that were able but unwilling to adopt the euro , others that were willing but unable , and some that were neither willing nor able .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia is the first post communist country to have the euro in the end , the club will gain just one new member on january 1 , when slovenia 's two million inhabitants give up their tolars . spectacular growth cyprus ' population of 750,000 and the 400,000 maltese are expected to swap their pounds and liras the following year . slovakia , with a population of 5.4 million , is also on course to switch from the koruna in january 2009 , despite the formation earlier this year of a coalition government including euro-sceptic populists and the far right . but things are looking more complicated for the six other countries that joined the eu two years ago , taking the bloc 's membership to 25 . the baltic nations of lithuania and estonia had hoped to join the euro zone in 2007 .
in theory , nothing could have been easier . the lithuanian lita and the estonian kroon are tied to the euro and the health of their public finances , a key measure for euro zone membership , causes envy in countries like france or germany . but both are experiencing spectacular growth - in estonia the rate was 12 percent in the third quarter alone - and consumer prices are rising slightly faster than in the rest of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland happily joined the eu but not the euro zone the maastricht treaty which laid the foundations of the eurozone sets inflation caps for members , and the baltic states have been just above the target . indulgence to founders lithuania was annoyed that it did not get a green light earlier this year .
in march , its average inflation rate was just 0.06 percent above the limit . the stern stance of the 12 euro zone members towards potential members was a surprise for economists , who say the inflation criteria are irrelevant for countries that are catching up with western europe and have already pegged their currencies to the euro . in order to achieve the living standards of the eu 's western members , the former communist countries have little choice but to let salaries and prices increase , which inevitably fuels inflation . the current intransigence contrasts with the indulgence towards euro zone founders such as belgium and italy .

many were forced to take part in sadistic medical experiments which have left their mark six decades later .
still others saw family members killed in front of them , surviving by chance . it was these victims of the nazis forced labor program that a special fund set up six years ago tried to help .
and six years and 1.7 million victims later , the fund sent out its last checks on dec .
31 . " this is n't just about money , " günter saathoff , director of the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation that administers the fund , told the associated press .
" it 's much more about morality : these payments are one way that germany recognizes the wrongs inflicted on its victims . " profiting from slave labor the fund was created by legislation passed by the german government in 2000 after years of debate .
it started processing claims the following year .
the fund was endowed with 5.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- , with the money coming equally from both the german government and companies such as volkswagen , daimlerchrysler , bayer and deutsche bank , who profited from forced labor during the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the holocaust memorial in berlin the fund also compensated victims who currently live around europe including the former soviet union , israel and the us .
the largest group of recipients are non-jews in poland and the ukraine , who survived the war as most jews did not . saathoff said that 1.7 million victims or their descendants had received a total of 4.4 billion euros in the past six years.the remaining money will go to helping other victims or other humanitarian projects , he added . atonement although the money was intended to atone for nazi cruelty and help its victims , recipients often said that while they were grateful for the funds , they were n't enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial to nazi victims in the former nazi concentration camp of sachsenhausen polish victim , jerzy kowalewski , 83 , was given 15,000 euros to compensate for his treatment at the hands of the nazis : he was brutally beaten , forced to work at auschwitz and the subject of medical experiments . kowalewski uses the money to help pay for medical treatments for his adult son who has illnesses he attributes to the medical experiments done on himself at auschwitz .
and he says that the money is insufficient . " i am thankful for what i got , " kowalewski told the associated press .
" but germany is rich - richer than us - and i think people who underwent pseudo-medical experiments should be getting payments until the end of their lives .

if only a tad of such enthusiasm flows into germany 's approach to the eu presidency , much can be achieved . merkel can succeed greatly if she manages to handle european politics not with scepticism and doubt , but with a positive , extroverted approach .
she should motivate her european team in a manner akin to former german soccer coach jürgen klinsmann , who took his players all the way to the 2006 world cup semi-final . the stalled eu constitution desperately needs someone with that kind of enthusiasm to get it back on track .
with the 50th anniversary of european unification coincidentally occurring during germany 's eu presidency tenure , merkel and her team have a major chance to rally support for the eu treaty , and thus , for europe 's future . clear results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel looked toward the future of the eu during her new year 's address hopefully , the chancellor will do more than merely give nice speeches and organize multi-cultural events near the brandenburg gate in berlin . the european political " fan " is going to have to see clear results in the eu constitution debate in order to get enthused about the treaty .
in keeping with the soccer metaphor , what is needed is scored goals rather than artful dribbling . europeans want to know what the constitution is to be composed of , what rules it should contain , and how it can be adopted .
two years following france and the netherland 's rejection of the constitution should be enough time to have redefined where things should go . little leeway to be fair , one does have to admit that " coach merkel " does not have much leeway in establishing the framework . france will elect a new president this year ; britain will gain a new prime minister this summer .
no one knows how the new leaders of these two important eu countries will behave in the debate over the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer coach jürgen klinsmann is known for his sunny attitude the eu presidency under germany must not only tackle the eu 's constitution , it must also urgently improve ties with gas-supplier russia , forge relationships with other possible gas-suppliers in central asia and take a different approach to the middle east , from which europe receives much of its energy . attitude change ? merkel can start in her own backyard in drumming up support for europe .
many of her ministers are against a pan-european collectivization of tasks . the attitude tends to be along the lines of : everything bad stems from the eu bureaucracy in brussels ; everything good will be decided by berlin .
unfortunately , this simplistic , false logic is widespread . six months is not much time to fulfil so many expectations .
germany will not have an easy time of it .
fanmeile -lrb- fan mile -rrb- was chosen as the german word of the year in 2006 .
it 's unlikely that the eu constitution will gain that honor , but people should try to work toward that goal nonetheless . dw 's brussels correspondent bernd riegert -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany faces daunting agenda for eu , g8 presidencies germany will fight to revive international efforts for middle east peace , relaunch the eu constitution and advocate a gentler form of globalization when it takes over the presidencies of the eu and the g8 monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 02.01.2007 many germans with less in their pockets in 2007 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not quite as bad yet , but germans will have to count their cents for ordinary germans , the new year will primarily mean just one thing : they 'll have to tighten their belts even further .
premiums for statutory unemployment insurance will go down , but that 's where the good news ends . a wide range of consumer goods in germany has become more expensive , thanks to a special new year 's present from the government in berlin .
it 's imposed a 3 percent valued added tax increase on clothes , cars , furniture , electrical appliances and other goods , bringing vat up to 19 percent . this is expected to reduce the shopping activities of ordinary citizens after many a shopping spree in 2006 .
opposition leaders such as guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's free-market , liberal free democratic party , protested loudly against the tax hike which the government says is needed to consolidate the budget and reduce state debt . " how is , say , a family of four supposed to save money when faced with spiraling energy costs and a state policy that 's reaching even deeper into their pockets ? "
westerwelle asked .
" politicians from the grand coalition government are calling on citizens to put more money aside for old age insurance , but they 're not willing to ease people 's financial situation on the tax front .
this is really absurd ! " no drastic price hikes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will extended shopping hours make up for any losses ?
however economic pundits believe that in many cases prices for consumer goods will not really go up tangibly . retailers will have to decrease their profit margins , and some of them already increased prices in the old year . " retailers are not in a position to pass on the value-added tax hike to consumers just like that , " said hubertus pellengahr , who heads germany 's association of retailers .
" this applies in particular to january - a traditional month of discount sales here in germany . " but once again , it 's drivers who are expected to suffer most from the vat hike which also applies to fuel .
johannes hübner from germany 's avd motoring club said drivers should brace for higher prices at fueling stations across the country . gas goes up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices will climb even further " we expect fuel prices to increase by another three to four cent per liter , " he said .
" we 'll have to see whether oil companies will keep prices that high throughout the year .
much will depend on developments on the global energy market .
but i think that consumers will have to put up with a two-cent-per-liter hike on average in 2007 . " driving may also become more expensive for haulers using inter-city road connections .
the road toll system for heavy trucks no longer applies to the autobahn motorway network only , but has been extended to three heavily frequented overland roads leading through several german states . more money for pension funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers will have to pay more for their pensions germans will also have to fork out more this year for their contributions to the statutory pension system .
premiums have increased by almost half a percent to total 19.9 percent of people 's incomes .
taxes on capital gains will be levied at a much lower ceiling . and a special wealth tax goes up by 3 percent for individuals making more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 330,000 -rrb- a year .
also , special benefits for commuters are cut completely if the distance between their homes and workplaces is under 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- . checking welfare recipients bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials will check unemployment recipients more carefully in addition , agencies are now taking a closer look at who 's entitled to state benefits . " whoever turns down an acceptable job offer will see their unemployment benefit payments reduced , " said john-philip hammersen , a spokesman for the central employment agency in nuremberg . he added that the abuse of the welfare system has to be curbed dramatically . " regulations to this effect will be applied more stringently from now on , " he said .
" those who opt to turn down a reasonable offer for the second or third time will risk losing up to 100 percent of all benefits . " nevertheless experts do n't expect a new round of public moaning and groaning over this year 's financial challenges .
after all , most people here do seem to appreciate that the good times are over and unlikely to return any time soon . harry graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : good news for germany 's economy although sales tax increases at the beginning of 2007 are likely to temporarily dampen the german economy , the economic outlook for next year is extremely positive , says dw-radio 's karl zawadzky .
-lrb- 30.12.2006 -rrb- euro rises on positive german business confidence american vacationers at germany 's christmas markets did n't have much to smile about when they exchanged their travelers cheques as the european currency benefited from robust german business confidence figures .
-lrb- 20.12.2006 -rrb- germany pushes euro zone forward in 2006 germany 's bundesbank said it expects the economy to grow by around 2.75 percent this year , providing " substantial impulses " for the 12-country euro zone as a whole , according to the central bank 's president .

some of those protests have been attended by members of the far right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- . berlin authorities gave permission to build the mosque just before christmas after a months-long battle with opponents . the muslim group said it had been looking to build a new mosque because it had outgrown its present community center in the west berlin suburb of reinickendorf . the ahmadiyya community was founded at the end of the 19th century in what was then british india .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 02.01.2007 many germans with less in their pockets in 2007 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not quite as bad yet , but germans will have to count their cents for ordinary germans , the new year will primarily mean just one thing : they 'll have to tighten their belts even further .
premiums for statutory unemployment insurance will go down , but that 's where the good news ends . a wide range of consumer goods in germany has become more expensive , thanks to a special new year 's present from the government in berlin .
it 's imposed a 3 percent valued added tax increase on clothes , cars , furniture , electrical appliances and other goods , bringing vat up to 19 percent . this is expected to reduce the shopping activities of ordinary citizens after many a shopping spree in 2006 .
opposition leaders such as guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's free-market , liberal free democratic party , protested loudly against the tax hike which the government says is needed to consolidate the budget and reduce state debt . " how is , say , a family of four supposed to save money when faced with spiraling energy costs and a state policy that 's reaching even deeper into their pockets ? "
westerwelle asked .
" politicians from the grand coalition government are calling on citizens to put more money aside for old age insurance , but they 're not willing to ease people 's financial situation on the tax front .
this is really absurd ! " no drastic price hikes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will extended shopping hours make up for any losses ?
however economic pundits believe that in many cases prices for consumer goods will not really go up tangibly . retailers will have to decrease their profit margins , and some of them already increased prices in the old year . " retailers are not in a position to pass on the value-added tax hike to consumers just like that , " said hubertus pellengahr , who heads germany 's association of retailers .
" this applies in particular to january - a traditional month of discount sales here in germany . " but once again , it 's drivers who are expected to suffer most from the vat hike which also applies to fuel .
johannes hübner from germany 's avd motoring club said drivers should brace for higher prices at fueling stations across the country . gas goes up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices will climb even further " we expect fuel prices to increase by another three to four cent per liter , " he said .
" we 'll have to see whether oil companies will keep prices that high throughout the year .
much will depend on developments on the global energy market .
but i think that consumers will have to put up with a two-cent-per-liter hike on average in 2007 . " driving may also become more expensive for haulers using inter-city road connections .
the road toll system for heavy trucks no longer applies to the autobahn motorway network only , but has been extended to three heavily frequented overland roads leading through several german states . more money for pension funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers will have to pay more for their pensions germans will also have to fork out more this year for their contributions to the statutory pension system .
premiums have increased by almost half a percent to total 19.9 percent of people 's incomes .
taxes on capital gains will be levied at a much lower ceiling . and a special wealth tax goes up by 3 percent for individuals making more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 330,000 -rrb- a year .
also , special benefits for commuters are cut completely if the distance between their homes and workplaces is under 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- . checking welfare recipients bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials will check unemployment recipients more carefully in addition , agencies are now taking a closer look at who 's entitled to state benefits . " whoever turns down an acceptable job offer will see their unemployment benefit payments reduced , " said john-philip hammersen , a spokesman for the central employment agency in nuremberg . he added that the abuse of the welfare system has to be curbed dramatically . " regulations to this effect will be applied more stringently from now on , " he said .
" those who opt to turn down a reasonable offer for the second or third time will risk losing up to 100 percent of all benefits . " nevertheless experts do n't expect a new round of public moaning and groaning over this year 's financial challenges .
after all , most people here do seem to appreciate that the good times are over and unlikely to return any time soon . harry graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : good news for germany 's economy although sales tax increases at the beginning of 2007 are likely to temporarily dampen the german economy , the economic outlook for next year is extremely positive , says dw-radio 's karl zawadzky .
-lrb- 30.12.2006 -rrb- euro rises on positive german business confidence american vacationers at germany 's christmas markets did n't have much to smile about when they exchanged their travelers cheques as the european currency benefited from robust german business confidence figures .
-lrb- 20.12.2006 -rrb- germany pushes euro zone forward in 2006 germany 's bundesbank said it expects the economy to grow by around 2.75 percent this year , providing " substantial impulses " for the 12-country euro zone as a whole , according to the central bank 's president .

premiums for statutory unemployment insurance will go down , but that 's where the good news ends . a wide range of consumer goods in germany has become more expensive , thanks to a special new year 's present from the government in berlin .
it 's imposed a 3 percent valued added tax increase on clothes , cars , furniture , electrical appliances and other goods , bringing vat up to 19 percent . this is expected to reduce the shopping activities of ordinary citizens after many a shopping spree in 2006 .
opposition leaders such as guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's free-market , liberal free democratic party , protested loudly against the tax hike which the government says is needed to consolidate the budget and reduce state debt . " how is , say , a family of four supposed to save money when faced with spiraling energy costs and a state policy that 's reaching even deeper into their pockets ? "
westerwelle asked .
" politicians from the grand coalition government are calling on citizens to put more money aside for old age insurance , but they 're not willing to ease people 's financial situation on the tax front .
this is really absurd ! " no drastic price hikes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will extended shopping hours make up for any losses ?
however economic pundits believe that in many cases prices for consumer goods will not really go up tangibly . retailers will have to decrease their profit margins , and some of them already increased prices in the old year . " retailers are not in a position to pass on the value-added tax hike to consumers just like that , " said hubertus pellengahr , who heads germany 's association of retailers .
" this applies in particular to january - a traditional month of discount sales here in germany . " but once again , it 's drivers who are expected to suffer most from the vat hike which also applies to fuel .
johannes hübner from germany 's avd motoring club said drivers should brace for higher prices at fueling stations across the country . gas goes up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices will climb even further " we expect fuel prices to increase by another three to four cent per liter , " he said .
" we 'll have to see whether oil companies will keep prices that high throughout the year .
much will depend on developments on the global energy market .
but i think that consumers will have to put up with a two-cent-per-liter hike on average in 2007 . " driving may also become more expensive for haulers using inter-city road connections .
the road toll system for heavy trucks no longer applies to the autobahn motorway network only , but has been extended to three heavily frequented overland roads leading through several german states . more money for pension funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers will have to pay more for their pensions germans will also have to fork out more this year for their contributions to the statutory pension system .
premiums have increased by almost half a percent to total 19.9 percent of people 's incomes .
taxes on capital gains will be levied at a much lower ceiling . and a special wealth tax goes up by 3 percent for individuals making more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 330,000 -rrb- a year .
also , special benefits for commuters are cut completely if the distance between their homes and workplaces is under 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- . checking welfare recipients bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials will check unemployment recipients more carefully in addition , agencies are now taking a closer look at who 's entitled to state benefits . " whoever turns down an acceptable job offer will see their unemployment benefit payments reduced , " said john-philip hammersen , a spokesman for the central employment agency in nuremberg . he added that the abuse of the welfare system has to be curbed dramatically . " regulations to this effect will be applied more stringently from now on , " he said .
" those who opt to turn down a reasonable offer for the second or third time will risk losing up to 100 percent of all benefits . " nevertheless experts do n't expect a new round of public moaning and groaning over this year 's financial challenges .
after all , most people here do seem to appreciate that the good times are over and unlikely to return any time soon . harry graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : good news for germany 's economy although sales tax increases at the beginning of 2007 are likely to temporarily dampen the german economy , the economic outlook for next year is extremely positive , says dw-radio 's karl zawadzky .

some of those protests have been attended by members of the far right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- . berlin authorities gave permission to build the mosque just before christmas after a months-long battle with opponents . the muslim group said it had been looking to build a new mosque because it had outgrown its present community center in the west berlin suburb of reinickendorf . the ahmadiyya community was founded at the end of the 19th century in what was then british india .
it claims to represent the latter day renaissance of islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the ahmaddiya community pray at the planned mosque 's site the sect , which is classed as peaceful by the german domestic intelligence service , has some 30,000 members and operates more than a dozen mosques in germany .
at the ceremony , members held up placards reading , " islam means peace , love for all . " abdul basit tariq , chairman of the sect 's berlin chapter , said the mosque was being financed by the sect 's women 's organization and would bear the name khadidja , after the first wife of the prophet mohammed . abdullah uwe wagishauer , head of germany 's ahmdaiyya 's , said he hoped for good ties between his community and opponents of the mosque . " there are no difficulties with neighbors of ahmadiyya mosques built elsewhere , " he told reuters .
" our mosques help interreligious dialogue and mutual understanding . " mosques not new in germany mosques are by no means a new development in germany .
as far back as the 16th century , prussian king frederick william i had the first mosque built in potsdam for his turkish soldiers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sehitlik mosque in west berlin 's neukölln neighborhood in berlin , the first mosque was constructed in 1924 . now there are some 30 muslim places of worship in the german capital .
but most of them are in neukölln and kreuzberg , in the western part of the city . these are the neighborhoods in which guest workers , mainly from turkey , moved to when they first arrived in germany in the 1960s and 1970s .
today the multi-ethnic districts are still home to berlin 's largest turkish community as well as to large numbers of arab and east european immigrants . in the former communist and , at the time , internationally insular east berlin , there were no mosques which might explain the protests , tariq says . " these are unfounded fears , " tariq says .
" people listen to the news , see scenes on television and that 's why they 're scared of muslims .
they think muslims are terrorists and suicide bombers .
their heads are full of these things . " opposition to the planned mosque has underlined germany 's problems in integrating its 3.2-million strong muslim community .
the problem is especially acute in formerly communist-ruled east germany where few muslims and other immigrants have settled . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de female imams in german mosques get a mixed reception turkey 's religious council has already sent 13 women to germany to serve in mosques .

under the scheme , parents will receive up to 1,800 euros a month per child to take off work to care for newborns . mothers who gave birth before midnight on new year 's eve missed out .
the benefit only applies to births after january 1 , 2007 . " of course some parents did hope that their children would arrive a little later , " said senior doctor volker thaele of halle university hospital 's maternity department . one such mother , gabriele meyer , took magnesium and homeopathic medicine to delay the birth of her twins , she told reuters tv . " it means 20,000 euros to me , " she said . however , doctors said that 41-year-old meyer 's twin foetuses were too small and scheduled her for a caesarean section on friday , just days before the new government benefits took effect .
the twins were initially due on jan .
22 . helping families under the scheme , parents who take time off from work to take care of their babies , can receive two-thirds of their net salary - up to 18,000 euros for 12 months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 02.01.2007 many germans with less in their pockets in 2007 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not quite as bad yet , but germans will have to count their cents for ordinary germans , the new year will primarily mean just one thing : they 'll have to tighten their belts even further .
premiums for statutory unemployment insurance will go down , but that 's where the good news ends . a wide range of consumer goods in germany has become more expensive , thanks to a special new year 's present from the government in berlin .
it 's imposed a 3 percent valued added tax increase on clothes , cars , furniture , electrical appliances and other goods , bringing vat up to 19 percent . this is expected to reduce the shopping activities of ordinary citizens after many a shopping spree in 2006 .
opposition leaders such as guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's free-market , liberal free democratic party , protested loudly against the tax hike which the government says is needed to consolidate the budget and reduce state debt . " how is , say , a family of four supposed to save money when faced with spiraling energy costs and a state policy that 's reaching even deeper into their pockets ? "
westerwelle asked .
" politicians from the grand coalition government are calling on citizens to put more money aside for old age insurance , but they 're not willing to ease people 's financial situation on the tax front .
this is really absurd ! " no drastic price hikes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will extended shopping hours make up for any losses ?
however economic pundits believe that in many cases prices for consumer goods will not really go up tangibly . retailers will have to decrease their profit margins , and some of them already increased prices in the old year . " retailers are not in a position to pass on the value-added tax hike to consumers just like that , " said hubertus pellengahr , who heads germany 's association of retailers .
" this applies in particular to january - a traditional month of discount sales here in germany . " but once again , it 's drivers who are expected to suffer most from the vat hike which also applies to fuel .
johannes hübner from germany 's avd motoring club said drivers should brace for higher prices at fueling stations across the country . gas goes up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas prices will climb even further " we expect fuel prices to increase by another three to four cent per liter , " he said .
" we 'll have to see whether oil companies will keep prices that high throughout the year .
much will depend on developments on the global energy market .
but i think that consumers will have to put up with a two-cent-per-liter hike on average in 2007 . " driving may also become more expensive for haulers using inter-city road connections .
the road toll system for heavy trucks no longer applies to the autobahn motorway network only , but has been extended to three heavily frequented overland roads leading through several german states . more money for pension funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers will have to pay more for their pensions germans will also have to fork out more this year for their contributions to the statutory pension system .
premiums have increased by almost half a percent to total 19.9 percent of people 's incomes .
taxes on capital gains will be levied at a much lower ceiling . and a special wealth tax goes up by 3 percent for individuals making more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 330,000 -rrb- a year .
also , special benefits for commuters are cut completely if the distance between their homes and workplaces is under 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.4 miles -rrb- . checking welfare recipients bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials will check unemployment recipients more carefully in addition , agencies are now taking a closer look at who 's entitled to state benefits . " whoever turns down an acceptable job offer will see their unemployment benefit payments reduced , " said john-philip hammersen , a spokesman for the central employment agency in nuremberg . he added that the abuse of the welfare system has to be curbed dramatically . " regulations to this effect will be applied more stringently from now on , " he said .
" those who opt to turn down a reasonable offer for the second or third time will risk losing up to 100 percent of all benefits . " nevertheless experts do n't expect a new round of public moaning and groaning over this year 's financial challenges .
after all , most people here do seem to appreciate that the good times are over and unlikely to return any time soon . harry graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : good news for germany 's economy although sales tax increases at the beginning of 2007 are likely to temporarily dampen the german economy , the economic outlook for next year is extremely positive , says dw-radio 's karl zawadzky .
-lrb- 30.12.2006 -rrb- euro rises on positive german business confidence american vacationers at germany 's christmas markets did n't have much to smile about when they exchanged their travelers cheques as the european currency benefited from robust german business confidence figures .
-lrb- 20.12.2006 -rrb- germany pushes euro zone forward in 2006 germany 's bundesbank said it expects the economy to grow by around 2.75 percent this year , providing " substantial impulses " for the 12-country euro zone as a whole , according to the central bank 's president .

" this dual role comes at a very historic time in world affairs , " said gary smith , executive director of the american academy think tank in berlin .
" germany and especially chancellor merkel have a great opportunity to exert leadership and reach concrete goals . " mighty germany europe 's biggest economy has increasingly been flexing its business , diplomatic and even , for peaceful purposes , military muscle since winning back full sovereignty following german reunification in 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank in frankfurt germany is at the core of the euro single-currency zone and the european central bank is building a huge new headquarters in frankfurt . major german corporations have adeptly ridden the wave of globalization and exports have continued to soar during 2006 , with the euro hitting near-record highs against the dollar . even the sometimes euro-skeptical wall street journal was full of praise in a recent commentary . " the competition brought on by globalization and the eu 's expansion to include 10 new states in 2004 forced a serious restructuring of the corporate sector , " the paper said . " … germany inc. was at the forefront of this mini-revolution . " diplomacy matters diplomatically , germany began talking about " national interests " and a " german path " under former chancellor gerhard schröder , who provoked the worst post-war crisis in german-american relations by using his iraq war opposition to help win his re-election in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier presents the german eu presidency program at a press conference this sort of talk - unthinkable during the cold war - has been toned down by current chancellor merkel , who nevertheless is sticking to schröder 's calls for germany to get a permanent seat on the united nations security council . as the eu 's biggest power , germany already has an upgraded un status under what is known as " p5 + germany " : the five permanent un security council members plus germany , who are dealing with issues such as the iranian nuclear crisis . military transitions germany 's military transition is one of the biggest ongoing shifts in the country 's global positioning since unification . the bundeswehr , or federal armed forces , will in coming years be forged into a 35,000-member rapid-reaction force for global operations , backed by a 70,000-member stabilization force for peacekeeping . during the transition , berlin is acquiring heavy airlift planes capable of taking troops anywhere in the world , while at the same time scrapping hundreds of the formidable leopard ii main battle tanks which once faced off against warsaw pact forces . reforms , however , are slow moving and , at present , germany still can not deploy more than 10,000 soldiers for combat or peacekeeping operations - despite a total troop strength of over 250,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is scrapping tanks for planes " the german armed forces are still structured for the cold war , " said karl-heinz kamp , security policy coordinator for the konrad adenauer foundation , which has close links to merkel 's christian democratic union party . germany 's military was dissolved in 1945 after the nazi defeat and only recreated in 1955 .
throughout the cold war , german troops were strictly limited to defensive missions within the nato area . modern missions it was only in 1994 that german troops were given a green light by the country 's highest court to take part in combat missions outside the nato alliance . since then , there has been a steady growth in the number of german military deployments abroad with bigger and bigger missions . luftwaffe jets took part in the first german combat operations since 1945 during the 1999 nato-led war with serbia to halt ethnic cleansing in kosovo . " never again auschwitz ! " was how greens foreign minister joschka fischer convinced members of his own pacifist party to back the historic deployment . today about 9,000 german troops are serving on international missions , including with nato forces in afghanistan and in the balkans . the latest german military mission , deploying forces as part of a beefed-up united nations unifil force in lebanon , also breaks new ground as berlin 's first mideast deployment since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany took the global stage when it hosted the world cup this summer but germany still seeks to keep its troops out of combat zones . soldiers in afghanistan are based in the mainly peaceful north and are barred from taking part in fighting in southern afghanistan with us , british and canadian forces . in lebanon , the germans refused to send ground troops and instead deployed naval forces based off the coast . military spending another area where german aspirations for a bigger global role clash with reality is financing .
berlin spends less than 1.5 percent of its gdp on the military - far less than the us , which devotes 3.7 percent of its budget to the armed forces . a far higher proportion of the german military budget goes for personnel costs - and not for equipment . " the bundeswehr spends 60 percent of its money on personnel - something 's wrong with that , " kamp said . kamp also worries that the three german ministries responsible for global relations - defense , foreign and development aid - have felt the brunt of federal budget cuts . " this means that at a time when germany 's foreign responsibility has grown , we cut foreign spending by 50 percent , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german chancellor angela merkel announces us visit german chancellor angela merkel is to visit us president george w. bush early next year to brief the us leader on germany 's priorities as the president of both the eu and the g8 .

the site was initially to be sealed up , but is now planned as a museum . ron lerke calls out a greeting and his voice echoes into the darkness - 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of it , to be exact .
he is underground , in what used to be the west german government 's ultra-secret atomic bunker , located deep in western germany near the french border .
and it ’ s here , in a tunnel stretching into a black abyss , that a restored section of the bunker will be used for the first time . lerke is head engineer of the project to turn the bunker into a tourist site .
he walks slowly with a flashlight through the bunker , 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- underground , as danger warnings line the walls on the way to decontamination showers , sleeping quarters , a hospital , even a room set up for cutting hair . most of the rooms are empty and unlit , with dirt floors .
in the first 100 meters , at least five massive steel doors are set into the wall , ready to slide shut in case of emergency . this area is a tiny sliver in the 19 kilometers of subterranean passageways , but when it ’ s opened up as a museum in early 2008 , it will offer the public what they never would have seen - an area where a chosen 3,000 people would have holed up for 30 days after a nuclear attack . “ we call it the fortress of the nuclear age , " said florian mausbach , president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning who leads the project . secrecy spurred public interest in the end , mausbach says the bunker was never actually used to house government officials , who would have left west germany ’ s nearby capital of bonn to find refuge there .
by the late 1990 ’ s , after the capital had moved to berlin , lawmakers decided to close down the structure , and started in 2001 to seal it up and bury it forever . but the public wanted a peek inside , said mausbach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tunnels stretch for 18 kilometers “ there 's a lot of interest by the people around that area and beyond to look around in the tunnel , because it was always a secret , " he said .
" so i thought we should keep part of the tunnel . " its location typifies the cold war balance between life and destruction , added mausbach . after the government toyed with the idea of selling the tunnel - some ideas were to convert it into a disco or an area to cultivate mushrooms - mausbach said the finance ministry agreed on the idea of a small museum , which was actually cheaper than sealing the area up forever . not really a secret the museum entrance is nestled into a hill , amidst a backdrop of dense forest and vineyards overlooking the town of ahrweiler .
down a dirt path , through a gate lined with barbed wire , is one of 38 entrances to this network of bunkers . markus heibel of the federal office for building and regional planning said that , though the existence of the bunker was meant to be a well-kept secret during the cold war and afterward , it required almost 200 local employees . " it was not really a secret , " he said .
" they also knew about it in east germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker was a well-known secret in fact , the underground labyrinth dates back to the late 19th century , when tunnels meant for moving supplies by train were built all the way into france .
during world war ii , concentration camp prisoners slaved away building v2 rockets in the tunnels .
by 1960 , west germany began the 12-year project of turning it all into a nuclear bunker in compliance with nato stipulations . with all that history , locals welcome turning the bunker into a museum . jürgen reiche , head of haus der geschichte museum in bonn , leads the museum side of this project .
he says the bunker ’ s history closely parallels that of germany - and that restoring even some of the complex into a museum is vital to remembering germany ’ s past . “ it ’ s not only a bunker - it is part of german history , ” he said . provoking questions only four windows exist in the entire 19 kilometer complex .
one of them is near the planned entrance to the museum , with a view no larger than a sheet of paper .
it ’ s bombproof and can be covered by a sliding steel plate .
but in 2008 , it will be opened up - for a stark look at the nuclear age . as reiche looks over plans for the museum , he says that the experience will lead visitors to ask the right questions about the bunker ’ s significance , both then and now . “ if the earth is destroyed , you can ’ t live on it , " he said .

" this dual role comes at a very historic time in world affairs , " said gary smith , executive director of the american academy think tank in berlin .
" germany and especially chancellor merkel have a great opportunity to exert leadership and reach concrete goals .

" the competition brought on by globalization and the eu 's expansion to include 10 new states in 2004 forced a serious restructuring of the corporate sector , " the paper said . " … germany inc. was at the forefront of this mini-revolution . " diplomacy matters diplomatically , germany began talking about " national interests " and a " german path " under former chancellor gerhard schröder , who provoked the worst post-war crisis in german-american relations by using his iraq war opposition to help win his re-election in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier presents the german eu presidency program at a press conference this sort of talk - unthinkable during the cold war - has been toned down by current chancellor merkel , who nevertheless is sticking to schröder 's calls for germany to get a permanent seat on the united nations security council . as the eu 's biggest power , germany already has an upgraded un status under what is known as " p5 + germany " : the five permanent un security council members plus germany , who are dealing with issues such as the iranian nuclear crisis . military transitions germany 's military transition is one of the biggest ongoing shifts in the country 's global positioning since unification . the bundeswehr , or federal armed forces , will in coming years be forged into a 35,000-member rapid-reaction force for global operations , backed by a 70,000-member stabilization force for peacekeeping . during the transition , berlin is acquiring heavy airlift planes capable of taking troops anywhere in the world , while at the same time scrapping hundreds of the formidable leopard ii main battle tanks which once faced off against warsaw pact forces . reforms , however , are slow moving and , at present , germany still can not deploy more than 10,000 soldiers for combat or peacekeeping operations - despite a total troop strength of over 250,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is scrapping tanks for planes " the german armed forces are still structured for the cold war , " said karl-heinz kamp , security policy coordinator for the konrad adenauer foundation , which has close links to merkel 's christian democratic union party . germany 's military was dissolved in 1945 after the nazi defeat and only recreated in 1955 .
throughout the cold war , german troops were strictly limited to defensive missions within the nato area . modern missions it was only in 1994 that german troops were given a green light by the country 's highest court to take part in combat missions outside the nato alliance . since then , there has been a steady growth in the number of german military deployments abroad with bigger and bigger missions . luftwaffe jets took part in the first german combat operations since 1945 during the 1999 nato-led war with serbia to halt ethnic cleansing in kosovo . " never again auschwitz ! " was how greens foreign minister joschka fischer convinced members of his own pacifist party to back the historic deployment . today about 9,000 german troops are serving on international missions , including with nato forces in afghanistan and in the balkans . the latest german military mission , deploying forces as part of a beefed-up united nations unifil force in lebanon , also breaks new ground as berlin 's first mideast deployment since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany took the global stage when it hosted the world cup this summer but germany still seeks to keep its troops out of combat zones . soldiers in afghanistan are based in the mainly peaceful north and are barred from taking part in fighting in southern afghanistan with us , british and canadian forces . in lebanon , the germans refused to send ground troops and instead deployed naval forces based off the coast . military spending another area where german aspirations for a bigger global role clash with reality is financing .
berlin spends less than 1.5 percent of its gdp on the military - far less than the us , which devotes 3.7 percent of its budget to the armed forces . a far higher proportion of the german military budget goes for personnel costs - and not for equipment . " the bundeswehr spends 60 percent of its money on personnel - something 's wrong with that , " kamp said . kamp also worries that the three german ministries responsible for global relations - defense , foreign and development aid - have felt the brunt of federal budget cuts .

" this dual role comes at a very historic time in world affairs , " said gary smith , executive director of the american academy think tank in berlin .
" germany and especially chancellor merkel have a great opportunity to exert leadership and reach concrete goals . " mighty germany europe 's biggest economy has increasingly been flexing its business , diplomatic and even , for peaceful purposes , military muscle since winning back full sovereignty following german reunification in 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank in frankfurt germany is at the core of the euro single-currency zone and the european central bank is building a huge new headquarters in frankfurt . major german corporations have adeptly ridden the wave of globalization and exports have continued to soar during 2006 , with the euro hitting near-record highs against the dollar . even the sometimes euro-skeptical wall street journal was full of praise in a recent commentary . " the competition brought on by globalization and the eu 's expansion to include 10 new states in 2004 forced a serious restructuring of the corporate sector , " the paper said . " … germany inc. was at the forefront of this mini-revolution . " diplomacy matters diplomatically , germany began talking about " national interests " and a " german path " under former chancellor gerhard schröder , who provoked the worst post-war crisis in german-american relations by using his iraq war opposition to help win his re-election in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier presents the german eu presidency program at a press conference this sort of talk - unthinkable during the cold war - has been toned down by current chancellor merkel , who nevertheless is sticking to schröder 's calls for germany to get a permanent seat on the united nations security council . as the eu 's biggest power , germany already has an upgraded un status under what is known as " p5 + germany " : the five permanent un security council members plus germany , who are dealing with issues such as the iranian nuclear crisis . military transitions germany 's military transition is one of the biggest ongoing shifts in the country 's global positioning since unification . the bundeswehr , or federal armed forces , will in coming years be forged into a 35,000-member rapid-reaction force for global operations , backed by a 70,000-member stabilization force for peacekeeping . during the transition , berlin is acquiring heavy airlift planes capable of taking troops anywhere in the world , while at the same time scrapping hundreds of the formidable leopard ii main battle tanks which once faced off against warsaw pact forces . reforms , however , are slow moving and , at present , germany still can not deploy more than 10,000 soldiers for combat or peacekeeping operations - despite a total troop strength of over 250,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is scrapping tanks for planes " the german armed forces are still structured for the cold war , " said karl-heinz kamp , security policy coordinator for the konrad adenauer foundation , which has close links to merkel 's christian democratic union party . germany 's military was dissolved in 1945 after the nazi defeat and only recreated in 1955 .
throughout the cold war , german troops were strictly limited to defensive missions within the nato area . modern missions it was only in 1994 that german troops were given a green light by the country 's highest court to take part in combat missions outside the nato alliance . since then , there has been a steady growth in the number of german military deployments abroad with bigger and bigger missions . luftwaffe jets took part in the first german combat operations since 1945 during the 1999 nato-led war with serbia to halt ethnic cleansing in kosovo . " never again auschwitz ! " was how greens foreign minister joschka fischer convinced members of his own pacifist party to back the historic deployment . today about 9,000 german troops are serving on international missions , including with nato forces in afghanistan and in the balkans . the latest german military mission , deploying forces as part of a beefed-up united nations unifil force in lebanon , also breaks new ground as berlin 's first mideast deployment since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany took the global stage when it hosted the world cup this summer but germany still seeks to keep its troops out of combat zones . soldiers in afghanistan are based in the mainly peaceful north and are barred from taking part in fighting in southern afghanistan with us , british and canadian forces . in lebanon , the germans refused to send ground troops and instead deployed naval forces based off the coast . military spending another area where german aspirations for a bigger global role clash with reality is financing .
berlin spends less than 1.5 percent of its gdp on the military - far less than the us , which devotes 3.7 percent of its budget to the armed forces . a far higher proportion of the german military budget goes for personnel costs - and not for equipment . " the bundeswehr spends 60 percent of its money on personnel - something 's wrong with that , " kamp said . kamp also worries that the three german ministries responsible for global relations - defense , foreign and development aid - have felt the brunt of federal budget cuts . " this means that at a time when germany 's foreign responsibility has grown , we cut foreign spending by 50 percent , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german chancellor angela merkel announces us visit german chancellor angela merkel is to visit us president george w. bush early next year to brief the us leader on germany 's priorities as the president of both the eu and the g8 .

the site was initially to be sealed up , but is now planned as a museum . ron lerke calls out a greeting and his voice echoes into the darkness - 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of it , to be exact .
he is underground , in what used to be the west german government 's ultra-secret atomic bunker , located deep in western germany near the french border .
and it ’ s here , in a tunnel stretching into a black abyss , that a restored section of the bunker will be used for the first time . lerke is head engineer of the project to turn the bunker into a tourist site .
he walks slowly with a flashlight through the bunker , 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- underground , as danger warnings line the walls on the way to decontamination showers , sleeping quarters , a hospital , even a room set up for cutting hair . most of the rooms are empty and unlit , with dirt floors .
in the first 100 meters , at least five massive steel doors are set into the wall , ready to slide shut in case of emergency . this area is a tiny sliver in the 19 kilometers of subterranean passageways , but when it ’ s opened up as a museum in early 2008 , it will offer the public what they never would have seen - an area where a chosen 3,000 people would have holed up for 30 days after a nuclear attack . “ we call it the fortress of the nuclear age , " said florian mausbach , president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning who leads the project . secrecy spurred public interest in the end , mausbach says the bunker was never actually used to house government officials , who would have left west germany ’ s nearby capital of bonn to find refuge there .
by the late 1990 ’ s , after the capital had moved to berlin , lawmakers decided to close down the structure , and started in 2001 to seal it up and bury it forever . but the public wanted a peek inside , said mausbach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tunnels stretch for 18 kilometers “ there 's a lot of interest by the people around that area and beyond to look around in the tunnel , because it was always a secret , " he said .
" so i thought we should keep part of the tunnel . " its location typifies the cold war balance between life and destruction , added mausbach . after the government toyed with the idea of selling the tunnel - some ideas were to convert it into a disco or an area to cultivate mushrooms - mausbach said the finance ministry agreed on the idea of a small museum , which was actually cheaper than sealing the area up forever . not really a secret the museum entrance is nestled into a hill , amidst a backdrop of dense forest and vineyards overlooking the town of ahrweiler .
down a dirt path , through a gate lined with barbed wire , is one of 38 entrances to this network of bunkers . markus heibel of the federal office for building and regional planning said that , though the existence of the bunker was meant to be a well-kept secret during the cold war and afterward , it required almost 200 local employees . " it was not really a secret , " he said .
" they also knew about it in east germany . "

by 1960 , west germany began the 12-year project of turning it all into a nuclear bunker in compliance with nato stipulations . with all that history , locals welcome turning the bunker into a museum . jürgen reiche , head of haus der geschichte museum in bonn , leads the museum side of this project .
he says the bunker ’ s history closely parallels that of germany - and that restoring even some of the complex into a museum is vital to remembering germany ’ s past . “ it ’ s not only a bunker - it is part of german history , ” he said . provoking questions only four windows exist in the entire 19 kilometer complex .
one of them is near the planned entrance to the museum , with a view no larger than a sheet of paper .
it ’ s bombproof and can be covered by a sliding steel plate .
but in 2008 , it will be opened up - for a stark look at the nuclear age . as reiche looks over plans for the museum , he says that the experience will lead visitors to ask the right questions about the bunker ’ s significance , both then and now . “ if the earth is destroyed , you can ’ t live on it , " he said .

he is underground , in what used to be the west german government 's ultra-secret atomic bunker , located deep in western germany near the french border .
and it ’ s here , in a tunnel stretching into a black abyss , that a restored section of the bunker will be used for the first time . lerke is head engineer of the project to turn the bunker into a tourist site .
he walks slowly with a flashlight through the bunker , 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- underground , as danger warnings line the walls on the way to decontamination showers , sleeping quarters , a hospital , even a room set up for cutting hair . most of the rooms are empty and unlit , with dirt floors .
in the first 100 meters , at least five massive steel doors are set into the wall , ready to slide shut in case of emergency . this area is a tiny sliver in the 19 kilometers of subterranean passageways , but when it ’ s opened up as a museum in early 2008 , it will offer the public what they never would have seen - an area where a chosen 3,000 people would have holed up for 30 days after a nuclear attack . “ we call it the fortress of the nuclear age , " said florian mausbach , president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning who leads the project . secrecy spurred public interest in the end , mausbach says the bunker was never actually used to house government officials , who would have left west germany ’ s nearby capital of bonn to find refuge there .
by the late 1990 ’ s , after the capital had moved to berlin , lawmakers decided to close down the structure , and started in 2001 to seal it up and bury it forever . but the public wanted a peek inside , said mausbach .

under the scheme , parents will receive up to 1,800 euros a month per child to take off work to care for newborns . mothers who gave birth before midnight on new year 's eve missed out .
the benefit only applies to births after january 1 , 2007 . " of course some parents did hope that their children would arrive a little later , " said senior doctor volker thaele of halle university hospital 's maternity department . one such mother , gabriele meyer , took magnesium and homeopathic medicine to delay the birth of her twins , she told reuters tv . " it means 20,000 euros to me , " she said . however , doctors said that 41-year-old meyer 's twin foetuses were too small and scheduled her for a caesarean section on friday , just days before the new government benefits took effect .

if the other parent also takes leave , the benefit can extend to 14 months . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " german family minister ursula von der leyen told the online edition of daily tagesspiegel . given the attractive financial incentives , german media has been full of stories in recent weeks about heavily-pregnant women anxiously seeking medical advice on how to delay births until the new year so that they could qualify for the aid . physicians and midwives have been saying that avoiding red wine , stress as well as physical or sexual activity are among the recommended natural methods to help prevent inducing birth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen has seven children of her own none of the advice seemed to have worked in halle , a mid-sized city in eastern germany , where no babies at all were delivered on new year 's day , whereas six had been delivered in the preceding 48 hours . a bit disappointed the complexities of the new tax and welfare rules mean that the main beneficiaries are high-earning professional women in the top tax bracket who received no subsidies in the past .

son flynn , was born at 5 a.m.
sunday .
but gürtler does not work " so it 's great for us , " she said . halle 's last baby came at 6.20 p.m. on sunday . " that mother would have done very well out of the new rules , and i think she was a bit disappointed , " said thale . some even called for the government to adopt a bit more of the holiday spirit .

" though progress has been made in fighting organized crime , the mafia in both of these balkan states is still very powerful , " the paper wrote . " that is why bulgaria and romania will have to be taken by the hand for at least the next three years and account to the eu for every move it makes , " de morgen commented . with 27 nations and 480 million people , the european union stretches from the atlantic ocean to the black sea . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pumping up the volume of europe 's multilingualism the european union has a new year 's challenge : to assimilate three new languages in 2007 .

her biggest challenge , however , will be breathing new life into a nearly dead eu constitution , says dw 's bernd riegert . germans are capable of enthusiasm .
they clearly displayed that when they hosted the soccer world cup in the summer of 2006 .
if only a tad of such enthusiasm flows into germany 's approach to the eu presidency , much can be achieved . merkel can succeed greatly if she manages to handle european politics not with scepticism and doubt , but with a positive , extroverted approach .
she should motivate her european team in a manner akin to former german soccer coach jürgen klinsmann , who took his players all the way to the 2006 world cup semi-final . the stalled eu constitution desperately needs someone with that kind of enthusiasm to get it back on track .
with the 50th anniversary of european unification coincidentally occurring during germany 's eu presidency tenure , merkel and her team have a major chance to rally support for the eu treaty , and thus , for europe 's future . clear results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel looked toward the future of the eu during her new year 's address hopefully , the chancellor will do more than merely give nice speeches and organize multi-cultural events near the brandenburg gate in berlin . the european political " fan " is going to have to see clear results in the eu constitution debate in order to get enthused about the treaty .
in keeping with the soccer metaphor , what is needed is scored goals rather than artful dribbling . europeans want to know what the constitution is to be composed of , what rules it should contain , and how it can be adopted .
two years following france and the netherland 's rejection of the constitution should be enough time to have redefined where things should go . little leeway to be fair , one does have to admit that " coach merkel " does not have much leeway in establishing the framework . france will elect a new president this year ; britain will gain a new prime minister this summer .
no one knows how the new leaders of these two important eu countries will behave in the debate over the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer coach jürgen klinsmann is known for his sunny attitude the eu presidency under germany must not only tackle the eu 's constitution , it must also urgently improve ties with gas-supplier russia , forge relationships with other possible gas-suppliers in central asia and take a different approach to the middle east , from which europe receives much of its energy . attitude change ? merkel can start in her own backyard in drumming up support for europe .
many of her ministers are against a pan-european collectivization of tasks . the attitude tends to be along the lines of : everything bad stems from the eu bureaucracy in brussels ; everything good will be decided by berlin .
unfortunately , this simplistic , false logic is widespread . six months is not much time to fulfil so many expectations .

her biggest challenge , however , will be breathing new life into a nearly dead eu constitution , says dw 's bernd riegert . germans are capable of enthusiasm .
they clearly displayed that when they hosted the soccer world cup in the summer of 2006 .
if only a tad of such enthusiasm flows into germany 's approach to the eu presidency , much can be achieved . merkel can succeed greatly if she manages to handle european politics not with scepticism and doubt , but with a positive , extroverted approach .
she should motivate her european team in a manner akin to former german soccer coach jürgen klinsmann , who took his players all the way to the 2006 world cup semi-final . the stalled eu constitution desperately needs someone with that kind of enthusiasm to get it back on track .

in keeping with the soccer metaphor , what is needed is scored goals rather than artful dribbling . europeans want to know what the constitution is to be composed of , what rules it should contain , and how it can be adopted .
two years following france and the netherland 's rejection of the constitution should be enough time to have redefined where things should go . little leeway to be fair , one does have to admit that " coach merkel " does not have much leeway in establishing the framework . france will elect a new president this year ; britain will gain a new prime minister this summer .

many of her ministers are against a pan-european collectivization of tasks . the attitude tends to be along the lines of : everything bad stems from the eu bureaucracy in brussels ; everything good will be decided by berlin .

many were forced to take part in sadistic medical experiments which have left their mark six decades later .
still others saw family members killed in front of them , surviving by chance . it was these victims of the nazis forced labor program that a special fund set up six years ago tried to help .
and six years and 1.7 million victims later , the fund sent out its last checks on dec .
31 . " this is n't just about money , " günter saathoff , director of the remembrance , responsibility and future foundation that administers the fund , told the associated press .
" it 's much more about morality : these payments are one way that germany recognizes the wrongs inflicted on its victims . " profiting from slave labor the fund was created by legislation passed by the german government in 2000 after years of debate .
it started processing claims the following year .
the fund was endowed with 5.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- , with the money coming equally from both the german government and companies such as volkswagen , daimlerchrysler , bayer and deutsche bank , who profited from forced labor during the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the holocaust memorial in berlin the fund also compensated victims who currently live around europe including the former soviet union , israel and the us .
the largest group of recipients are non-jews in poland and the ukraine , who survived the war as most jews did not . saathoff said that 1.7 million victims or their descendants had received a total of 4.4 billion euros in the past six years.the remaining money will go to helping other victims or other humanitarian projects , he added . atonement although the money was intended to atone for nazi cruelty and help its victims , recipients often said that while they were grateful for the funds , they were n't enough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial to nazi victims in the former nazi concentration camp of sachsenhausen polish victim , jerzy kowalewski , 83 , was given 15,000 euros to compensate for his treatment at the hands of the nazis : he was brutally beaten , forced to work at auschwitz and the subject of medical experiments . kowalewski uses the money to help pay for medical treatments for his adult son who has illnesses he attributes to the medical experiments done on himself at auschwitz .
and he says that the money is insufficient . " i am thankful for what i got , " kowalewski told the associated press .
" but germany is rich - richer than us - and i think people who underwent pseudo-medical experiments should be getting payments until the end of their lives .

under the scheme , parents will receive up to 1,800 euros a month per child to take off work to care for newborns . mothers who gave birth before midnight on new year 's eve missed out .
the benefit only applies to births after january 1 , 2007 . " of course some parents did hope that their children would arrive a little later , " said senior doctor volker thaele of halle university hospital 's maternity department . one such mother , gabriele meyer , took magnesium and homeopathic medicine to delay the birth of her twins , she told reuters tv . " it means 20,000 euros to me , " she said . however , doctors said that 41-year-old meyer 's twin foetuses were too small and scheduled her for a caesarean section on friday , just days before the new government benefits took effect .
the twins were initially due on jan .
22 . helping families under the scheme , parents who take time off from work to take care of their babies , can receive two-thirds of their net salary - up to 18,000 euros for 12 months .
if the other parent also takes leave , the benefit can extend to 14 months . " it should send a clear signal that our society wants to try to compensate for some of the financial loss young parents face , " german family minister ursula von der leyen told the online edition of daily tagesspiegel . given the attractive financial incentives , german media has been full of stories in recent weeks about heavily-pregnant women anxiously seeking medical advice on how to delay births until the new year so that they could qualify for the aid . physicians and midwives have been saying that avoiding red wine , stress as well as physical or sexual activity are among the recommended natural methods to help prevent inducing birth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen has seven children of her own none of the advice seemed to have worked in halle , a mid-sized city in eastern germany , where no babies at all were delivered on new year 's day , whereas six had been delivered in the preceding 48 hours . a bit disappointed the complexities of the new tax and welfare rules mean that the main beneficiaries are high-earning professional women in the top tax bracket who received no subsidies in the past .
non-working wives were better off under the old rules . susanne gürtler , 28 , was among the last mothers to give birth in 2006 .
son flynn , was born at 5 a.m.
sunday .
but gürtler does not work " so it 's great for us , " she said . halle 's last baby came at 6.20 p.m. on sunday . " that mother would have done very well out of the new rules , and i think she was a bit disappointed , " said thale . some even called for the government to adopt a bit more of the holiday spirit .

the site was initially to be sealed up , but is now planned as a museum . ron lerke calls out a greeting and his voice echoes into the darkness - 1.3 kilometers -lrb- 0.8 miles -rrb- of it , to be exact .
he is underground , in what used to be the west german government 's ultra-secret atomic bunker , located deep in western germany near the french border .
and it ’ s here , in a tunnel stretching into a black abyss , that a restored section of the bunker will be used for the first time . lerke is head engineer of the project to turn the bunker into a tourist site .
he walks slowly with a flashlight through the bunker , 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- underground , as danger warnings line the walls on the way to decontamination showers , sleeping quarters , a hospital , even a room set up for cutting hair . most of the rooms are empty and unlit , with dirt floors .
in the first 100 meters , at least five massive steel doors are set into the wall , ready to slide shut in case of emergency . this area is a tiny sliver in the 19 kilometers of subterranean passageways , but when it ’ s opened up as a museum in early 2008 , it will offer the public what they never would have seen - an area where a chosen 3,000 people would have holed up for 30 days after a nuclear attack . “ we call it the fortress of the nuclear age , " said florian mausbach , president of the federal authority for construction and urban planning who leads the project . secrecy spurred public interest in the end , mausbach says the bunker was never actually used to house government officials , who would have left west germany ’ s nearby capital of bonn to find refuge there .
by the late 1990 ’ s , after the capital had moved to berlin , lawmakers decided to close down the structure , and started in 2001 to seal it up and bury it forever . but the public wanted a peek inside , said mausbach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tunnels stretch for 18 kilometers “ there 's a lot of interest by the people around that area and beyond to look around in the tunnel , because it was always a secret , " he said .
" so i thought we should keep part of the tunnel . " its location typifies the cold war balance between life and destruction , added mausbach . after the government toyed with the idea of selling the tunnel - some ideas were to convert it into a disco or an area to cultivate mushrooms - mausbach said the finance ministry agreed on the idea of a small museum , which was actually cheaper than sealing the area up forever . not really a secret the museum entrance is nestled into a hill , amidst a backdrop of dense forest and vineyards overlooking the town of ahrweiler .
down a dirt path , through a gate lined with barbed wire , is one of 38 entrances to this network of bunkers . markus heibel of the federal office for building and regional planning said that , though the existence of the bunker was meant to be a well-kept secret during the cold war and afterward , it required almost 200 local employees . " it was not really a secret , " he said .
" they also knew about it in east germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bunker was a well-known secret in fact , the underground labyrinth dates back to the late 19th century , when tunnels meant for moving supplies by train were built all the way into france .
during world war ii , concentration camp prisoners slaved away building v2 rockets in the tunnels .
by 1960 , west germany began the 12-year project of turning it all into a nuclear bunker in compliance with nato stipulations . with all that history , locals welcome turning the bunker into a museum . jürgen reiche , head of haus der geschichte museum in bonn , leads the museum side of this project .
he says the bunker ’ s history closely parallels that of germany - and that restoring even some of the complex into a museum is vital to remembering germany ’ s past . “ it ’ s not only a bunker - it is part of german history , ” he said . provoking questions only four windows exist in the entire 19 kilometer complex .
one of them is near the planned entrance to the museum , with a view no larger than a sheet of paper .
it ’ s bombproof and can be covered by a sliding steel plate .
but in 2008 , it will be opened up - for a stark look at the nuclear age . as reiche looks over plans for the museum , he says that the experience will lead visitors to ask the right questions about the bunker ’ s significance , both then and now . “ if the earth is destroyed , you can ’ t live on it , " he said .

anna mcmorrin , from cardiff , left green bags in a nearby street as recycled rubbish is not collected in her road .
but cardiff council , which is bottom of the wales recycling league , said recycling bags had been left at a place where there was no collection point .
welsh councils are expected to recycle or compost at least 25 % of their waste by april 2007 .
councils face millions of pounds in fines if they go over limits on how much they can send to landfill sites .
ms mcmorrin , a friends of the earth communications officer , was among 24 people who have been told by cardiff council to use a recycling centre rather than leave their rubbish on the street .
she said she had been shocked to receive a " notice to obtain information " after putting her waste for recycling in a street where collection had been due that day .
worst recycling authorities cardiff 8.19 % conwy 9.83 % wrexham 10.34 % torfaen 11.10 % anglesey 11.33 % source : welsh assembly government 2005-6 the council had gone through her rubbish to find out where she lived and sent her questions to answer under legal caution asking if it was her rubbish and if she had put it out .
ms mcmorrin said : " i was horrified and frankly , they could go about it in a much better fashion . "
a council spokesman said a large amount of green recycling bags were continually being put out incorrectly on a road junction in the whitchurch area of the city - where there is no collection point - and it was concerned about litter .
the spokesman said 24 requests for information had been sent to residents to clarify who put the waste there so it could advise people they should take rubbish to a recycling centre until they had kerbside collections .
the spokesman said : " we are committed to an extensive educational campaign to ensure that all residents understand and use the -lsb- kerbside -rsb- service when it is brought into their area . "
cardiff council came bottom of the league in a table for recycling published two months ago by the welsh assembly government .

ceredigion council came top of the recycling league , re-using 30 % of waste .
council manager bleddyn jones said the success was due to starting in the 1990s and paying contractors for waste they reprocessed .
in england , some householders face being charged extra for rubbish they throw away rather than recycle , but welsh environment minister carwyn jones said there was no need to consider that in wales at the moment .
he said : " the targets that we 've set for recycling are being reached , so the carrot is working . "
but he warned there might be point in the future where " some kind of financial incentive or penalty " for householders who fail to recycle enough might be looked at .

anna mcmorrin , from cardiff , left green bags in a nearby street as recycled rubbish is not collected in her road .
but cardiff council , which is bottom of the wales recycling league , said recycling bags had been left at a place where there was no collection point .
welsh councils are expected to recycle or compost at least 25 % of their waste by april 2007 .
councils face millions of pounds in fines if they go over limits on how much they can send to landfill sites .
ms mcmorrin , a friends of the earth communications officer , was among 24 people who have been told by cardiff council to use a recycling centre rather than leave their rubbish on the street .
she said she had been shocked to receive a " notice to obtain information " after putting her waste for recycling in a street where collection had been due that day .
worst recycling authorities cardiff 8.19 % conwy 9.83 % wrexham 10.34 % torfaen 11.10 % anglesey 11.33 % source : welsh assembly government 2005-6 the council had gone through her rubbish to find out where she lived and sent her questions to answer under legal caution asking if it was her rubbish and if she had put it out .
ms mcmorrin said : " i was horrified and frankly , they could go about it in a much better fashion . "
a council spokesman said a large amount of green recycling bags were continually being put out incorrectly on a road junction in the whitchurch area of the city - where there is no collection point - and it was concerned about litter .
the spokesman said 24 requests for information had been sent to residents to clarify who put the waste there so it could advise people they should take rubbish to a recycling centre until they had kerbside collections .
the spokesman said : " we are committed to an extensive educational campaign to ensure that all residents understand and use the -lsb- kerbside -rsb- service when it is brought into their area . "
cardiff council came bottom of the league in a table for recycling published two months ago by the welsh assembly government .

ceredigion council came top of the recycling league , re-using 30 % of waste .
council manager bleddyn jones said the success was due to starting in the 1990s and paying contractors for waste they reprocessed .
in england , some householders face being charged extra for rubbish they throw away rather than recycle , but welsh environment minister carwyn jones said there was no need to consider that in wales at the moment .
he said : " the targets that we 've set for recycling are being reached , so the carrot is working . "
but he warned there might be point in the future where " some kind of financial incentive or penalty " for householders who fail to recycle enough might be looked at .

as well as refusing to run a car , powering her home on " good energy " and only buying fair-trade and organic food , the 53-year-old mother is very keen on recycling .
here she shares some of her tips on how to keep your domestic waste to a minimum . "
i 've always been into a bit of recycling which started from not having very much money being a single parent .
but i 'm doing more and more of it now and so should everyone else as the planet 's resources become more scarce .
i recycle ordinary things like tins and cans , glass bottles and jars .
these are easy as the council picks them up as part of its kerbside recycling scheme .
if it 's paper that ca n't go into the recycle bags then i use it for making notes and lists rather than notepads .
you can re-use envelopes again and again by putting new labels on them with christmas cards i use the front to make labels for presents for next year .
just cut round them with pinking shears .
you can still put the backs in the christmas card saving boxes they have in many shops where they then shred them . "
some cooked food such as pasta and things like that can go on the bird table " loppy garrard wrapping paper i use again but quite often i 'll use those bags you can buy now as you can re-use them again and again .
with stamps i take them to oxfam - i think they sell them to collectors but they have taken them for as long as i can remember .
with old clothes then if they ca n't go to the charity shop , then i just rip them up and use them for rags - they make good dusters .
as for batteries i try to use ones that are rechargeable but some stores - including argos and tesco in swansea - have started recycling them .
but the ones i use are rechargeable using a solar powered recharger .
composting scheme i try and use margarine tubs and yoghurt tubs either for planting seeds in or for freezing things .
if you have too much chilli or curry then save it for another day rather than throwing it away .
parts of swansea have a composting scheme and if i could , i would put food waste in that , but it has not started here yet .
i 've got compost bins down the bottom of the garden but i do n't put cooked food on it as it attracts rats and vermin .
some cooked food such as pasta and things like that can go on the bird table because robins and blackbirds particularly like pasta .
it 's not hard to recycle and there are so many things that we just throw away that can be used again and again . "

it said residents who were keen to recycle had helped it meet targets .
in 2005-6 , the vale recycled nearly 19 % of waste and was closely followed by bridgend , re-using 18 % , and merthyr tydfil , recycling 15.5 % .
cardiff was bottom of the table , recycling 8.19 % and torfaen , on 11.1 % .
cardiff says it is now recycling 13.71 % of waste and expanding kerbside collection to all its areas this year .

however , unlike neighbouring cardiff , the vale council already collected rubbish for recycling in all its areas .
second place bridgend said its latest figures showed it now recycled 20 % of waste , collecting paper , bottles and textiles from every household in the county .
it has also developed a centre to produce energy from waste by working with neighbouring neath port talbot council .
despite its lowly position in the league table , cardiff appears to be improving its performance and has introduced a wide range of methods of encouraging people in the welsh capital to recycle .
it is extending kerbside collections to the whole of the city and said 40 % of waste was being recycled or composted in areas which already have the service .
the council has a dedicated recycling team to inform people about the scheme , and runs an educational awareness programme in all cardiff 's primary schools which is being adjusted so it can be expanded to secondary schools .
kitchen waste but the labour opposition group on the council has accused the liberal democrat-led authority of " dragging its feet " on kerbside collection " for far too long " .
in torfaen , the council said the it had faced " significant challenges " getting recycling schemes up and running with many residents living in flats and terraced houses .
but it is now collecting plastic bottles , textiles , glass , tin cans and newspapers each week from every household and rolling out collection of green and kitchen waste .
torfaen said it was now recycling nearly 17 % of rubbish and was confident that would meet recycling targets set by the assembly government .
in common with other parts of wales , there have also been concerns about what will happen when land currently used for landfill runs out .
people in the west of cardiff , for example , are fighting proposals for two new sites proposed in countryside in the rhydlafar area .

swansea made national headlines last year when it successfully prosecuted a man for mixing paper and bottles in the same green recycling bag .
despite claims legal enforcement would put people off recycling , the council said the publicity had not affected its figures - the second best in wales .
it said court action was a last resort .
pembrokeshire is the worst performing of the four according to the welsh assembly government , but it believes a conciliatory approach is needed .
it lists a willingness by members of the public to recycle as a key issue in meeting government targets .
a council spokes woman said : " the majority of households are keen to recycle , but there is a need to educate the minority to participate fully .

" the council feels that this approach is more likely to win residents ' support rather than charging or imposing penalties . "
it said its most recent recycling figures - 21.14 % compared with the 13.24 % listed by wag , showed it was improving and it was confident of hitting the 25 % target set for 2006/07 .
for each authority meeting that target will need more investment and may lead to opposition to local development .
in swansea there are plans for a new £ 1.2m composting plant at the former alcoa site at waunarlwydd that will process around 7,000 tonnes of garden and kitchen waste annually .
michael reeves ' court case in swansea attracted national attention but it has already caused opposition in the community .
plans for a different type of composting plant - one that will turn human waste into organic fertiliser - at the former cynheidre colliery are due before carmarthenshire planners later this year and are again opposed by locals .
one of the main issues in neath port talbot is the future of the controversial incinerator and recycling centre at crymlyn burrows .
the council is hoping to settle a legal dispute to pave the way for a new private investor to run the site .
according to pembrokeshire - it is funding that is the biggest issue in the recycling debate .
" finance is a real concern , " said a spokeswoman .
she said wag had provided some grants to local authorities .
" but this does not cover the huge additional financial burden on local authorities to introduce and maintain the schemes necessary , " she added .

swansea made national headlines last year when it successfully prosecuted a man for mixing paper and bottles in the same green recycling bag .
despite claims legal enforcement would put people off recycling , the council said the publicity had not affected its figures - the second best in wales .
it said court action was a last resort .
pembrokeshire is the worst performing of the four according to the welsh assembly government , but it believes a conciliatory approach is needed .
it lists a willingness by members of the public to recycle as a key issue in meeting government targets .
a council spokes woman said : " the majority of households are keen to recycle , but there is a need to educate the minority to participate fully .

" the council feels that this approach is more likely to win residents ' support rather than charging or imposing penalties . "
it said its most recent recycling figures - 21.14 % compared with the 13.24 % listed by wag , showed it was improving and it was confident of hitting the 25 % target set for 2006/07 .
for each authority meeting that target will need more investment and may lead to opposition to local development .
in swansea there are plans for a new £ 1.2m composting plant at the former alcoa site at waunarlwydd that will process around 7,000 tonnes of garden and kitchen waste annually .
michael reeves ' court case in swansea attracted national attention but it has already caused opposition in the community .
plans for a different type of composting plant - one that will turn human waste into organic fertiliser - at the former cynheidre colliery are due before carmarthenshire planners later this year and are again opposed by locals .
one of the main issues in neath port talbot is the future of the controversial incinerator and recycling centre at crymlyn burrows .
the council is hoping to settle a legal dispute to pave the way for a new private investor to run the site .
according to pembrokeshire - it is funding that is the biggest issue in the recycling debate .
" finance is a real concern , " said a spokeswoman .
she said wag had provided some grants to local authorities .
" but this does not cover the huge additional financial burden on local authorities to introduce and maintain the schemes necessary , " she added .

ceredigion council has recycled and composted 35.6 % of its waste in 2005-06 , putting it top of the league in wales .
powys is in second place overall recycling 35.3 % , an increase of more than 1 % on 2004-05 .
both have now exceeded wag 's target of recycling 25 % of waste by 2006-07 .
the local authorities have stepped up their recycling efforts over the last few years and have devised innovative recycling projects .
for instance , powys has compost experts who carry out home visits , and garden waste has even been targeted in order to avoid a £ 200-a-tonne fine imposed by the assembly government .
meanwhile , the council 's kerbside recycling project , already operating in its larger towns , has recently been expanded to include villages in the north-east of the county .
a new website has been launched in conjunction with the scheme so people can keep tabs on how much waste they recycle each week .
recycling league table ceredigion : 30.39 % powys : 19.62 % source - welsh assembly government 2005-06 up to 4,500 homes received bins with barcodes last month which are weighed and then scanned to gauge recycling rates .
when the scheme was launched last month , powys council said individuals and communities who recycled the most could win prizes such as computer equipment for their local schools .
joy shearer , board member with responsibility for waste management , said : " the amount of waste we produce in powys continues to grow , so to achieve such a significant rise in recycling and composting is a major achievement . "
in the neighbouring county of ceredigion , the council said it had re-used and / or recycled 12,401 tonnes of municipal waste 2005-06 , the average across wales being 11,487 tonnes .
composted waste powys : 15.68 % ceredigion : 5.19 % source - welsh assembly government 2005-06 as with powys , ceredigion has a kerbside collection programme and a " real nappy " project , which encourages the recycling of disposable nappies .
the council also has a recycling newsletter which offers tips to residents about how to stay green .
meanwhile , all of the waste collected by both powys and ceredigion councils that is not recycled , composted or reused , goes to bryn posteg landfill site near llanidloes .
this is the only operational landfill site in powys , and is operated by evans logistics .
there are over 100 closed landfill sites in powys , which are monitored by powys council .

ceredigion council has recycled and composted 35.6 % of its waste in 2005-06 , putting it top of the league in wales .
powys is in second place overall recycling 35.3 % , an increase of more than 1 % on 2004-05 .
both have now exceeded wag 's target of recycling 25 % of waste by 2006-07 .
the local authorities have stepped up their recycling efforts over the last few years and have devised innovative recycling projects .
for instance , powys has compost experts who carry out home visits , and garden waste has even been targeted in order to avoid a £ 200-a-tonne fine imposed by the assembly government .
meanwhile , the council 's kerbside recycling project , already operating in its larger towns , has recently been expanded to include villages in the north-east of the county .
a new website has been launched in conjunction with the scheme so people can keep tabs on how much waste they recycle each week .
recycling league table ceredigion : 30.39 % powys : 19.62 % source - welsh assembly government 2005-06 up to 4,500 homes received bins with barcodes last month which are weighed and then scanned to gauge recycling rates .
when the scheme was launched last month , powys council said individuals and communities who recycled the most could win prizes such as computer equipment for their local schools .
joy shearer , board member with responsibility for waste management , said : " the amount of waste we produce in powys continues to grow , so to achieve such a significant rise in recycling and composting is a major achievement . "
in the neighbouring county of ceredigion , the council said it had re-used and / or recycled 12,401 tonnes of municipal waste 2005-06 , the average across wales being 11,487 tonnes .

since november they are allowed only one wheelie bin full - or three black bin bags - of rubbish per home .
new doorstep collection rules are being rolled out across gwynedd before the main waste tip at cilgwyn near caernarfon closes in 2008 .
recycling league table conwy 9.83 % gwynedd 12.70 % isle of anglesey 11.33 % source - welsh assembly government 2005-6 councillor steve churchman from garndolbenmaen said : " i 'm hoping the council will be a little bit more lenient over the holidays , but if need be i 'm quite lucky that i have enough room to store any extra waste to put out at a later date . "
before the introduction of the new rule councillor churchman said he was worried it might result in more fly-tipping .
but he said that the council had started doorstep collections of plastic in the area at the same time , which had dramatically reduced the waste being put out each week .
gwynedd councillors voted in favour in june of developing a composting facility on the site of an old tip at clynnog fawr between pwllheli and caernarfon , despite vociferous protest by local residents .
composted waste conwy 14.05 % gwynedd 11.30 % isle of anglesey 8.47 % source - welsh assembly government 2005-6 local councillor swain williams said after the decision : " the fear is that building a compost unit will open the door to future land filling in the area . "
a gwynedd council spokesman said : " if we are to meet the 40 % target set for 2009/10 we need to encourage even more of our residents to make the best possible use of all recycling facilities in their area . "
on anglesey , people fear a development of a composting plant could lead to an incinerator or facility to generate power from gas created by a landfill site , although the council said it had no further plans at present .

councils ' recycling figures denbighshire - 27.7 % flintshire - 26.92 % wrexham - 32 % meanwhile , flintshire council said its kerbside recycling scheme for cans , glass , plastic , newspapers and magazines now covered 96 % of all households and it had expanded its collections of garden waste .
and wrexham council 's lead member of waste , councillor mark pritchard , put its improvement in recycling down to the commitment by households taking part in its recycle with michael kerbside collection scheme .
however , the council 's green waste collections have stopped for six weeks including christmas and new year , starting again at the end of january .
but as twelfth night approaches - the traditional date for removing all festive decorations - mr pritchard urged people who had opted for a real christmas tree to take it to a household waste recycling centre .

the list was compiled using tips from more than 130 music critics and broadcasters .
one artist from the top five will be revealed every day , climaxing with the winner on friday .
at 19 , sadie ama has an innocent excitement about her impending pop career , despite being no stranger to the music scene .
ten years ago , when her sister was riding high in the uk top 10 , sadie would present her autograph book to her idols during top of the pops .
" i was so young , i did n't even understand about the whole music industry , " she says .
" i did n't even realise how big my sister actually was until now and i look back at it .
i think wow , she won mobo awards , brit awards .
it 's just amazing . "
indeed , it is some act to follow .
shola was named best british female at the 1998 brits after hits including you might need somebody and you 're the one i love .
at the same time , sadie - already a successful child model - was popping up in music videos herself .
she played the mini mel b in the spice girls ' video for mama .
" oh , do n't , " she squeals .
" that is very embarrassing .
" it was great at the time .
it was really , really exciting because i was such a big fan of the spice girls .
" so when i got that i was so excited .
but when i look back , i 'm cringing . "
more recently , she has been seen alongside lemar in his 50:50 video and so solid crew in broken silence .
but by the time she made those appearances , her own music was also causing waves on the urban scene .
after singing down the phone to her friend 's cousin - producer terror danjah - she lent vocals to his track so sure .
the song also featured kano , on his way to urban success , and soon became an underground smash . "
she 's really supportive of me so i 'm really lucky to have her - my sister always gives me the best advice " sadie on shola " the minute i recorded so sure , we got such good feedback and i was only 15 so i was really shocked , " sadie says .
" my manager was dragging me to meetings and this and that .
i was just like : ' oh my god . '
i was having a panic attack .
" i did n't really understand it .
it just got to a point where it was too much for me and i was just like : ' i do n't even know if i even want to do this . " '
so she put the music on hold and went to college to enjoy her youth and decide her direction . "
i would n't describe my music , there is n't a word or anything i can say - just fresh " sadie ama but music remained her first love and she has now picked up where she left off , with new single fallin ' gaining huge momentum on the internet and on radio .
her debut album is in the pipeline - but it is still too early to pin down her sound , she says .
" at the moment i would n't describe my music because i 'm still progressing , so i 'm still trying to develop my sound .
" i 'm trying out a whole heap of different things , trying to get that one sound .
at the moment , there is n't actually a word or anything i can say .
just fresh . "
but she is hoping to break out of the underground grime scene , she says .
soul sister " i started out in the underground scene and i love that type of music .
but i love loads of different music - i love soul , i love hip-hop , i love ragga , i love everything .
" so i would n't class myself as just being the underground thing . "
meanwhile , her big sister is helping write songs and do vocal arrangements for the album , and is also on hand to help sadie avoid any pitfalls .
" she 's been a big input in my career because there 's a lot of things that she teaches me , " explains ama jr .
" she 's really supportive of me so i 'm really lucky to have her .
" my sister always gives me the best advice and tells me : ' keep your head focussed , stay strong , believe in yourself and do what you have to do to get where you want to be . " '
more than 130 impartial uk-based music writers , editors and broadcasters took part in to the sound of 2007 poll by naming their three favourite new acts .
these tips were weighted to take account of each pundit 's stature , genre and record in previous polls , as well as the order in which they ranked their tips , with the results compiled into a top 10 .
