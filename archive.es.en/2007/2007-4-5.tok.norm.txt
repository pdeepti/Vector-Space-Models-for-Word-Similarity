" i do not think there is a moderate and ' non-moderate ' taliban .
this distinction was invented by somebody who knows nothing about afghanistan , " spanta told germany 's regional ndr radio .
he compared the proposal by social democrat leader kurt beck to forming a coalition with the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in beck 's home state of rhineland-palatinate in western germany . " it is like saying one can form a coalition with the npd in rhineland-palatinate , or with the moderate npd . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanta said beck knew nothing about afghanistan beck , whose party rules germany in coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives , suggested after a visit to german troops in afghanistan last weekend that military force alone would not put the country on the path to peace . " we have exhausted our possibilities ...
it is time to explore the possibility of a national reconciliation with the taliban , " beck said . he suggested holding a meeting on afghanistan along the lines of the un-sponsored conference on the country 's future that took place in bonn in late 2001 as the taliban were being overthrown . but spanta said : " at the moment i see no point in organizing and holding such a conference . "
beck misguided ?
he also said he was surprised by beck 's proposal , adding that the afghan government had been trying for some time to locate moderate taliban .
" if western politicians have such a thing they could give us the address and contact people , " spanta said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck recently visited german troops in afghanistan beck 's comments drew muted support from foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is a member of the social democrats , but was strongly criticized by merkel 's christian democrats . observers saw it as a misguided attempt by beck to broaden his foreign policy profile and boost his party 's ratings . nato-led forces are battling the strongest taliban insurgency yet since the hard-line islamist movement was toppled for harboring osama bin laden . germany has some 2,750 troops serving in the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in northern afghanistan and this week sent six tornado jets to carry out surveillance missions to help their nato allies . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " these people are ready to kill " gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesperson for the social democratic party , told dw-world.de that germany is not ready to give in to the terrorists ’ 10-day ultimatum to withdraw troops from afghanistan .
-lrb- 04.04.2007 -rrb- senior social democrats suggest talking to the taliban the leader of germany 's social democrats has proposed staging a new peace conference on afghanistan that would include representatives of the taliban .
it 's a controversial idea that has met a mixed reception so far .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.04.2007 eu 's environmental policy flounders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has a long way to go to reach its co2 emissions targets as experts in brussels wrangle over the wording of a un report on the impact of global warming , the eu 's own climate policy is stagnating .
even the emissions trade , once held up as a model to be emulated , is floundering . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas focused his ire on australia at the start of a meeting of the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- this week .
he called on the world 's second-biggest producer of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- to finally ratify the kyoto protocol , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are primarily responsible for global warming . australian prime minister john howard 's response was brusque : " you 've got the spokesman for a group of countries lecturing us about not having signed kyoto , yet the great bulk of the countries on whose behalf he speaks are falling well behind their kyoto targets and are doing less well than australia in meeting them , " he told australian broadcasting corporation radio . " our answer to the spokesman for the european union is look to your own affairs , get your countries complying with the targets you 've proclaimed , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas ' house could be in better shape , too dimas ' spokeswoman , barbara helfferich , was keen to rebuff the criticism .
" we said what needed to be said .
and the eu will in any case comply with its kyoto targets , " she told dw-world.de. but howard had a point .
the eu is far from attaining the targets it agreed to by ratifying the kyoto protocol .
the 15 older eu states are obliged to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions by eight percent by 2012 in comparison to 1990 levels , while the newer members of the bloc agreed to different targets .
but it was recently revealed that the eu had only achieved 1.6 percent by 2005 .
in 2006 , the countries carbon dioxide emissions actually increased by 1.5 percent above the previous year 's level .
flawed emissions trade critics lay some of the blame on the eu 's emissions trade , which allows companies to pollute as long as they have the necessary certificates , which can be traded .
the idea was that businesses would invest in environmentally friendly technologies to cut emissions if their only other option was to pay for a limited number of expensive licenses to pollute . but the emissions trade has so far failed to bring about a decrease in co2 pollution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is cheap at european energy exchanges the eu issued too many certificates , according to hans-jürgen nantke , head of the emissions trade office at germany 's federal environmental agency .
" that 's why the prices hit rock bottom , " he said . a ton of co2 cost nearly 30 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- in spring 2006 at the european energy exchange in leipzig .
today the price stands at less than one euro .
buying the right to pollute has become so cheap because the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , made mistakes when it estimated co2 emissions .
in 2006 , europe 's industries were able to emit 50 million tons more co2 than they ought to have . since the prices for certificates were so cheap , businesses did n't necessarily see the need to invest in new technologies that would produce fewer emissions . " when prices were higher , that happened , " said verena graichen , an expert on environmental protection at the institute for applied ecology , a german think tank . german power companies , for example , had shut down old lignite coal power plants in favor of more environmentally friendly anthracite coal plants although the latter were more expensive to run , she said .
better the second time around ?
" unfortunately the emissions trade does n't work very well , but we ca n't change anything anymore , " conceded dimas ' spokeswoman helfferich .
instead , she suggested looking to the future .
in 2008 , the second phase of the emissions trade , which continues until 2012 , is set to begin .
in order to meet the kyoto targets , the european commission has mandated a much lower number of emission certificates be issued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry needs more encouragement to cut emissions " from 2008 to 2012 , we will fulfill four kyoto percent , " helfferich predicted and referred to dozens of eu projects concerning climate protection as well as the emissions trade , which she said would then work " significantly better . " current prices for emissions certificates wo n't have an effect on their cost in the future , since the price will be recalculated in 2008 .
however , their greatly reduced number has already had an influence on today 's market : " futures , " that is , options on certificates that will be traded in the future , already cost between 16 and 17 euros per ton . but critics say the eu should alter the plans for the second phase of the emissions trade .
instead of issuing the licenses to pollute largely for free in 2008 , industry should have to buy them from the start . " companies do n't receive machines for free , " pointed out nantke of germany 's environmental agency . torsten schäfer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite climate concerns , germany plans coal power plants european union states agreed earlier this month on a binding 20 percent cut in co2 emissions by 2020 .

-lrb- 21.03.2007 -rrb- eu clinches climate deal , but hard work yet to come european union leaders clinched a wide-ranging climate change accord on friday but postponed the thorny task of setting mandatory renewable energy goals for each member country to meet .

even the emissions trade , once held up as a model to be emulated , is floundering . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas focused his ire on australia at the start of a meeting of the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- this week .
he called on the world 's second-biggest producer of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- to finally ratify the kyoto protocol , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are primarily responsible for global warming . australian prime minister john howard 's response was brusque : " you 've got the spokesman for a group of countries lecturing us about not having signed kyoto , yet the great bulk of the countries on whose behalf he speaks are falling well behind their kyoto targets and are doing less well than australia in meeting them , " he told australian broadcasting corporation radio . " our answer to the spokesman for the european union is look to your own affairs , get your countries complying with the targets you 've proclaimed , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas ' house could be in better shape , too dimas ' spokeswoman , barbara helfferich , was keen to rebuff the criticism .
" we said what needed to be said .
and the eu will in any case comply with its kyoto targets , " she told dw-world.de. but howard had a point .
the eu is far from attaining the targets it agreed to by ratifying the kyoto protocol .
the 15 older eu states are obliged to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions by eight percent by 2012 in comparison to 1990 levels , while the newer members of the bloc agreed to different targets .
but it was recently revealed that the eu had only achieved 1.6 percent by 2005 .
in 2006 , the countries carbon dioxide emissions actually increased by 1.5 percent above the previous year 's level .
flawed emissions trade critics lay some of the blame on the eu 's emissions trade , which allows companies to pollute as long as they have the necessary certificates , which can be traded .
the idea was that businesses would invest in environmentally friendly technologies to cut emissions if their only other option was to pay for a limited number of expensive licenses to pollute . but the emissions trade has so far failed to bring about a decrease in co2 pollution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is cheap at european energy exchanges the eu issued too many certificates , according to hans-jürgen nantke , head of the emissions trade office at germany 's federal environmental agency .
" that 's why the prices hit rock bottom , " he said . a ton of co2 cost nearly 30 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- in spring 2006 at the european energy exchange in leipzig .
today the price stands at less than one euro .
buying the right to pollute has become so cheap because the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , made mistakes when it estimated co2 emissions .
in 2006 , europe 's industries were able to emit 50 million tons more co2 than they ought to have . since the prices for certificates were so cheap , businesses did n't necessarily see the need to invest in new technologies that would produce fewer emissions . " when prices were higher , that happened , " said verena graichen , an expert on environmental protection at the institute for applied ecology , a german think tank . german power companies , for example , had shut down old lignite coal power plants in favor of more environmentally friendly anthracite coal plants although the latter were more expensive to run , she said .
better the second time around ?
" unfortunately the emissions trade does n't work very well , but we ca n't change anything anymore , " conceded dimas ' spokeswoman helfferich .
instead , she suggested looking to the future .
in 2008 , the second phase of the emissions trade , which continues until 2012 , is set to begin .
in order to meet the kyoto targets , the european commission has mandated a much lower number of emission certificates be issued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry needs more encouragement to cut emissions " from 2008 to 2012 , we will fulfill four kyoto percent , " helfferich predicted and referred to dozens of eu projects concerning climate protection as well as the emissions trade , which she said would then work " significantly better . " current prices for emissions certificates wo n't have an effect on their cost in the future , since the price will be recalculated in 2008 .
however , their greatly reduced number has already had an influence on today 's market : " futures , " that is , options on certificates that will be traded in the future , already cost between 16 and 17 euros per ton . but critics say the eu should alter the plans for the second phase of the emissions trade .
instead of issuing the licenses to pollute largely for free in 2008 , industry should have to buy them from the start .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.04.2007 eu 's environmental policy flounders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has a long way to go to reach its co2 emissions targets as experts in brussels wrangle over the wording of a un report on the impact of global warming , the eu 's own climate policy is stagnating .
even the emissions trade , once held up as a model to be emulated , is floundering . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas focused his ire on australia at the start of a meeting of the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- this week .
he called on the world 's second-biggest producer of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- to finally ratify the kyoto protocol , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are primarily responsible for global warming . australian prime minister john howard 's response was brusque : " you 've got the spokesman for a group of countries lecturing us about not having signed kyoto , yet the great bulk of the countries on whose behalf he speaks are falling well behind their kyoto targets and are doing less well than australia in meeting them , " he told australian broadcasting corporation radio . " our answer to the spokesman for the european union is look to your own affairs , get your countries complying with the targets you 've proclaimed , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas ' house could be in better shape , too dimas ' spokeswoman , barbara helfferich , was keen to rebuff the criticism .
" we said what needed to be said .
and the eu will in any case comply with its kyoto targets , " she told dw-world.de. but howard had a point .
the eu is far from attaining the targets it agreed to by ratifying the kyoto protocol .
the 15 older eu states are obliged to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions by eight percent by 2012 in comparison to 1990 levels , while the newer members of the bloc agreed to different targets .
but it was recently revealed that the eu had only achieved 1.6 percent by 2005 .
in 2006 , the countries carbon dioxide emissions actually increased by 1.5 percent above the previous year 's level .
flawed emissions trade critics lay some of the blame on the eu 's emissions trade , which allows companies to pollute as long as they have the necessary certificates , which can be traded .
the idea was that businesses would invest in environmentally friendly technologies to cut emissions if their only other option was to pay for a limited number of expensive licenses to pollute . but the emissions trade has so far failed to bring about a decrease in co2 pollution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is cheap at european energy exchanges the eu issued too many certificates , according to hans-jürgen nantke , head of the emissions trade office at germany 's federal environmental agency .
" that 's why the prices hit rock bottom , " he said . a ton of co2 cost nearly 30 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- in spring 2006 at the european energy exchange in leipzig .
today the price stands at less than one euro .
buying the right to pollute has become so cheap because the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , made mistakes when it estimated co2 emissions .
in 2006 , europe 's industries were able to emit 50 million tons more co2 than they ought to have . since the prices for certificates were so cheap , businesses did n't necessarily see the need to invest in new technologies that would produce fewer emissions . " when prices were higher , that happened , " said verena graichen , an expert on environmental protection at the institute for applied ecology , a german think tank . german power companies , for example , had shut down old lignite coal power plants in favor of more environmentally friendly anthracite coal plants although the latter were more expensive to run , she said .
better the second time around ?
" unfortunately the emissions trade does n't work very well , but we ca n't change anything anymore , " conceded dimas ' spokeswoman helfferich .
instead , she suggested looking to the future .
in 2008 , the second phase of the emissions trade , which continues until 2012 , is set to begin .
in order to meet the kyoto targets , the european commission has mandated a much lower number of emission certificates be issued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry needs more encouragement to cut emissions " from 2008 to 2012 , we will fulfill four kyoto percent , " helfferich predicted and referred to dozens of eu projects concerning climate protection as well as the emissions trade , which she said would then work " significantly better . " current prices for emissions certificates wo n't have an effect on their cost in the future , since the price will be recalculated in 2008 .
however , their greatly reduced number has already had an influence on today 's market : " futures , " that is , options on certificates that will be traded in the future , already cost between 16 and 17 euros per ton . but critics say the eu should alter the plans for the second phase of the emissions trade .
instead of issuing the licenses to pollute largely for free in 2008 , industry should have to buy them from the start . " companies do n't receive machines for free , " pointed out nantke of germany 's environmental agency . torsten schäfer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite climate concerns , germany plans coal power plants european union states agreed earlier this month on a binding 20 percent cut in co2 emissions by 2020 .
yet over 20 coal-fired power plants - major producers of greenhouse gases - are planned for germany .
-lrb- 21.03.2007 -rrb- eu clinches climate deal , but hard work yet to come european union leaders clinched a wide-ranging climate change accord on friday but postponed the thorny task of setting mandatory renewable energy goals for each member country to meet .
-lrb- 09.03.2007 -rrb- carbon dioxide goes underground in germany scientists in potsdam have embarked on a unique european project to store unwanted greenhouse gases under the ground .
it is the latest effort in combating climate change , but critics question the project 's aims .
-lrb- 28.02.2007 -rrb- feedback should the eu do more to encourage industry to invest in environmentally friendly technologies ?

" sophisticated political theater , " " perfect british diplomacy , " - or both ?
the international press reacted to the release , after 13 days ' captivity , of 15 british sailors held hostage in iran . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad ’ s move to call the hostage release a “ gift ” to the british people was nothing less than a “ sophisticated piece of political theatre , in which the president turned what had become a diplomatic disaster for iran into something of a personal victory , ” uk daily the guardian wrote . but just how effective was the “ pardon ” in the end ? “ ultimately , the larger issue is the effect of all this on the wider stage , ” the paper mused .
“ surely the real lesson to draw from yesterday ’ s theatre is that quiet diplomacy does work and that it can work in the future . ” summing up , the paper argued : “ there is no substitute for direct negotiation , especially with a revolutionary islamic regime in iran , for whom the popularly held grievance about past american and british interference in the gulf is as important as the issue in hand . ” “ iran ’ s president is the uncrowned king of tragicomic political theater , ” agreed the basler zeitung of basel , switzerland .
“ the way he announced the freeing of the 15 captive british sailors was as grotesque as it was masterful . … so , did iran cave in to the angry reactions of the international community ?
were they scared of a threatening liberation action by the british and americans ?
not a chance .

and it wouldn ’ t be surprising if there were a prisoner exchange .
but that would only happen at such time when london and washington could claim they are sticking to their stated principle of not accepting a quid pro quo , ” the paper wrote . “ in any case , there is no reason to be shocked : there have always been prisoner exchanges , whether of soldiers or of journalists . ” dutch newspaper de volkskrant also mulled what , exactly , went on behind the scenes of negotiations . “ in the coming days we will doubtless find out the basics of what went on between london and tehran when it came to arranging for the release of the british hostages , ” de volkskrant wrote .
“ but it is already clear that the affair can not be seen without making a connection to the kidnapping of an iranian diplomat and the arrest of five iranian fighters in iraq .
on tuesday , it was announced that the diplomat will be released , and an iranian consul can visit the fighters .
it is clear that the whole affair was not simply about iran ’ s territorial integrity , or of pardons or shows of might .
it was an exchange . ” bulgaria ’ s monitor newspaper saw the dealings as a major coup for the uk on the world political stage .
“ there is no doubt the sailors have perfect british diplomacy to thank ” for their release , the paper wrote .
“ it was no secret that london started backstage negotiations two or three days ago .
clearly , the brits could give all of humanity a break if they could quickly negotiate between tehran and washinton , like they did in the case of the sailors . ” finally , austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten said the risk of escalation was too big in the situation - and everyone involved knew it . “ a new ahmadinedschad ; the heavily embattled iranian president can celebrate an urgently needed victory .

" sophisticated political theater , " " perfect british diplomacy , " - or both ?
the international press reacted to the release , after 13 days ' captivity , of 15 british sailors held hostage in iran . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad ’ s move to call the hostage release a “ gift ” to the british people was nothing less than a “ sophisticated piece of political theatre , in which the president turned what had become a diplomatic disaster for iran into something of a personal victory , ” uk daily the guardian wrote . but just how effective was the “ pardon ” in the end ? “ ultimately , the larger issue is the effect of all this on the wider stage , ” the paper mused .
“ surely the real lesson to draw from yesterday ’ s theatre is that quiet diplomacy does work and that it can work in the future . ” summing up , the paper argued : “ there is no substitute for direct negotiation , especially with a revolutionary islamic regime in iran , for whom the popularly held grievance about past american and british interference in the gulf is as important as the issue in hand . ” “ iran ’ s president is the uncrowned king of tragicomic political theater , ” agreed the basler zeitung of basel , switzerland .
“ the way he announced the freeing of the 15 captive british sailors was as grotesque as it was masterful . … so , did iran cave in to the angry reactions of the international community ?
were they scared of a threatening liberation action by the british and americans ?

and it wouldn ’ t be surprising if there were a prisoner exchange .
but that would only happen at such time when london and washington could claim they are sticking to their stated principle of not accepting a quid pro quo , ” the paper wrote . “ in any case , there is no reason to be shocked : there have always been prisoner exchanges , whether of soldiers or of journalists . ” dutch newspaper de volkskrant also mulled what , exactly , went on behind the scenes of negotiations . “ in the coming days we will doubtless find out the basics of what went on between london and tehran when it came to arranging for the release of the british hostages , ” de volkskrant wrote .
“ but it is already clear that the affair can not be seen without making a connection to the kidnapping of an iranian diplomat and the arrest of five iranian fighters in iraq .
on tuesday , it was announced that the diplomat will be released , and an iranian consul can visit the fighters .
it is clear that the whole affair was not simply about iran ’ s territorial integrity , or of pardons or shows of might .
it was an exchange . ” bulgaria ’ s monitor newspaper saw the dealings as a major coup for the uk on the world political stage .
“ there is no doubt the sailors have perfect british diplomacy to thank ” for their release , the paper wrote .
“ it was no secret that london started backstage negotiations two or three days ago .
clearly , the brits could give all of humanity a break if they could quickly negotiate between tehran and washinton , like they did in the case of the sailors . ” finally , austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten said the risk of escalation was too big in the situation - and everyone involved knew it . “ a new ahmadinedschad ; the heavily embattled iranian president can celebrate an urgently needed victory .

other baltic sea states , including finland , denmark and estonia , also worry that the construction work could stir up toxic material on the seabed and even disturb unexploded chemical weapons left over from world war two . nord stream , the russian-german consortium building the pipeline , seeks to alleviate these concerns and " has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " according to a statement . rerouting the pipeline nord stream first proposed building the pipeline across the gulf of finland and down the middle of the baltic sea , passing just below the swedish island of gotland .
but following lengthy consultations with affected baltic sea states , the consortium is now looking into three alternate routes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , is on nord stream 's board " further optimization " of the route might be necessary in the gulf of finland , nord stream said , where the pipeline could be built along a more southern route near of estonia .
other options include laying the pipeline 10 kilometers further south of gotland , bypassing swedish wildlife reserves , or running it along a route north of the danish island of bornholm . nord stream , which appointed former german chancellor gerhard schröder to its executive board shortly after he left office , says it is " determined to make sure that the new pipeline meets high environmental standards . " the controversial pipeline has been a hard sell for nord stream , and the success of this five-billion-euro project hinges on the approval of finland , sweden and denmark . a hard sell with high stakes in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected . nord stream is expected to submit an extensive eia in the early autumn of 2007 , and hopes to begin construction of the pipeline by 2008 , following final approval of the impact assessment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 27.5 billion cubic meters of russian gas could be flowing into gemany in 2010 the consortium has also submitted reports to poland , latvia , lithuania and estonia .
polish officials have expressed fears that the project could threaten poland ’ s energy security , as the new pipeline would allow russia to sell natural gas to western europe without the need for polish transit lines . in april last year , polish defense minister radoslaw sikorski even went so far as to compare the project to the hitler-stalin pact of 1939 , which divided poland among russia and germany .
but poland has no veto power over the project . sweden has also cited security concerns : officials there have expressed fears that an offshore platform near the swedish coast could be used as a venue for russian intelligence gathering . baltic sea states are also uneasy about russia ’ s plans to increase its military presence in the baltic sea , ostensibly to protect the project and assist in the removal of unexploded ordnance from the seabed . satisfying european energy needs nord stream is a russian-german joint venture created solely for the construction of the baltic sea pipeline .
russian energy giant gazprom own a majority stake in the consortium , and germany ’ s e.on ruhrgas and wintershall hold 24.5 percent shares each . if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .
in a second phase , a parallel pipeline would double that transport capacity , and nord stream estimates that will meet about 25 percent of the additional gas needs of the european union . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic pipeline creates waves in scandinavian countries finland is the latest country to express its displeasure at the planned route for the russian-german pipeline through the baltic sea .

other baltic sea states , including finland , denmark and estonia , also worry that the construction work could stir up toxic material on the seabed and even disturb unexploded chemical weapons left over from world war two . nord stream , the russian-german consortium building the pipeline , seeks to alleviate these concerns and " has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " according to a statement . rerouting the pipeline nord stream first proposed building the pipeline across the gulf of finland and down the middle of the baltic sea , passing just below the swedish island of gotland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.04.2007 " it 's a bit like modern surgery " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this statue of egyptian god hapi is part of the bonn exhibition dw-world.de spoke to french marine archeologist franck goddio , who brought lost parts of the legendary port of alexandria and the ancient cities of heracleion and canopus back to light . " egypt 's sunken treasures , " an exhibition of artifacts unearthed during goddio 's excavations , went on show in bonn on thursday . dw-world.de : after thousands of excursions to sunken cities and shipwrecks around the world , your living room must look like an adventurous place . franck goddio : well , it 's not an adventure .
i would say it 's a job , and we are doing this job very professionally .
we plan each mission carefully and train our staff for that , and before starting , there is a lot of paperwork that has to be done . before you started to search for sunken treasures , you studied mathematics and worked as a financial consultant .
how does that fit with archaeology ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goddio devoted himself to marine archeology in the 1980s as a matter of fact , it does help .
after 10 years in finance , i decided to take a one-year break .
i looked at what at the time has been done in underwater archaeology , and i realized that there was a need for a privately funded independent institute that could work for governments and other institutions . you opened such an institute for underwater archaeology in paris in 1985 .
were you always sure that it would become a success story ? maybe i was a little naive at the beginning .
when i started to search for the sunken parts of alexandria in 1984 the geophysical instruments that you need for missions like that did n't exist . but you did find ancient alexandria in the end . but for alexandria , it took years and years because we had to perform a four-year geophysical survey before we even had a detailed map that showed that there was something under the sediment .
it 's a bit like modern surgery .
you use the scanner , and then afterwards , when you know where to search , you do the operation at the right place . are you still thrilled by your work ? it 's very hard work because for months and months you only sail along straight lines in the harbor , towing instruments and registering data in order to create an electronic map .
when you start to see the map , you get this feeling that there is something down there .
and only then does it become thrilling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of artifacts are on show in bonn it seems that your work has little in common with an indiana jones adventure . not at all , on the contrary i would say .
my job is to prevent adventure . when you take artifacts from the ancient port of alexandria , you put them in different colored baskets .
does the color mean something ? the color is in fact no criteria , but you need these baskets in order to desalinate the artifacts .
when you raise it from the sea , where the object has been for some 2,000 years , you have to remove the salt .
for a small artifact , this can take a few days .
for a very big artefact , like the statue of hapi -lrb- editor 's note : a more than five-meter or 16-feet high statue -rrb- , we needed 18 months to remove the salt . what happens if you do n't do that ? the stone will disintegrate .
chemical reactions will make the stone weaker , until it finally disintegrates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this stele of the ptolemy is also part of the exhibition the exhibition in bonn is showing 500 artifacts , most of them from alexandria .
what kind of feeling should the exhibition evoke in visitors ? we found all the artifacts right next to each other .
they were on the same place for thousands of years and supplemented each other , they were literally living together .
in the exhibition you can see that they speak to each other . who owns the artifacts ? they belong to egypt of course .
all artifacts that you see in the exhibit in bonn will one day end up in a museum which will be built for them - in alexandria . " egypt 's sunken treasures " runs until jan .

but the proposal has been met with scorn . the european commission and the 78-nation so-called acp group - mostly former european colonies - are struggling to make progress to conclude new trade agreements by the end of the year when a current preferential market access accord is due to expire . under the european union 's new offer , all quotas and tariffs on acp goods would be lifted immediately once a deal was signed , with the exception of rice and sugar .
97 percent of eu imports from acp nations are already tariff-free or are taxed only at very low levels while 40 of the poorest countries already enjoy free access to eu markets . acp nations include nigeria , kenya , cuba and east timor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union trade commissioner peter mandelson " trade and development for acp countries is about much more than just access to the european market , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said .
" but by removing all remaining tariffs and quotas for all african , caribbean and pacific countries we will create the best possible opportunities for these economies , " he added . offer slammed as " derisory " in reaction , the negotiator for the caribbean acp countries slammed the offer owing to the exceptions on rice and sugar , describing it as " derisory " and warning it could cause more harm than good . " the european commission offer threatens to poison the negotiating climate , especially at a time when both sides are making strides -lrb- on -rrb- flexibilities , " said junior lodge .
" we therefore hope that good sense will prevail and the european commission will offer all acp regions a more constructive and attractive market access offer , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sugar exports from acp nations are n't included in the eu offer levies on sugar would be phased out by 2015 while a reform in subsidies for eu sugar farmers is carried out and a firm date has not yet been set for rice , the commission said . the offer did not cover south africa , which has a bilateral trade agreement with the eu and which the commission said produces " a number of globally competitive products . " the acp group , made up mostly of former european colonies , has benefited from preferential access to eu markets since the signing of the lome accord in 1975 . but other equally poor countries , mostly in latin america , have contested the acp 's preferential treatment and have won backing from the world trade organisation . in 2001 , the world trade referee gave the eu until the end of this year to come up with a new framework that would be more compatible with international rules of commerce . deadline for talks nears after their wto defeat , the europeans and the acp opened talks in 2002 to reach new so-called economic partnership agreements which are being conducted by regions - eastern , central and southern africa , the caribbean and the pacific . but little progress has been made , and pressure is building as the year-end deadline approaches .
a number of development pressure groups , including oxfam and action aid , consider the deadline to be unrealistic and have called for it to be pushed back . the european commission had promised that it would offer greater market access as part of the negotiations , which some development pressure groups have accused the eu of using to gain greater access to acp markets . brussels said the new offer was not conditional on acp countries matching the eu in tearing down tariff and quota barriers and that any greater market access they would have to provide to meet wto rules could be phased in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the eu is trying to gain greater access to markets in the developing world british pro-development pressure group oxfam said the offer was the minimum the commission could do and that it should not be used to strong-arm acp countries into an agreement by the end of the year . " developing countries look set to be asked to open their markets dramatically , which could have seriously negative implications for poor peoples ' livelihoods and future economic development , " said oxfam 's brussels head luis morago . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants new deal with african , caribbean , pacific partners the european union said it wants to complete new trade agreements with 78 african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- countries by the end of the year despite opposition from developing countries .

" egypt 's sunken treasures , " an exhibition of artifacts unearthed during goddio 's excavations , went on show in bonn on thursday . dw-world.de : after thousands of excursions to sunken cities and shipwrecks around the world , your living room must look like an adventurous place . franck goddio : well , it 's not an adventure .
i would say it 's a job , and we are doing this job very professionally .
we plan each mission carefully and train our staff for that , and before starting , there is a lot of paperwork that has to be done . before you started to search for sunken treasures , you studied mathematics and worked as a financial consultant .
how does that fit with archaeology ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goddio devoted himself to marine archeology in the 1980s as a matter of fact , it does help .
after 10 years in finance , i decided to take a one-year break .
i looked at what at the time has been done in underwater archaeology , and i realized that there was a need for a privately funded independent institute that could work for governments and other institutions . you opened such an institute for underwater archaeology in paris in 1985 .
were you always sure that it would become a success story ? maybe i was a little naive at the beginning .
when i started to search for the sunken parts of alexandria in 1984 the geophysical instruments that you need for missions like that did n't exist . but you did find ancient alexandria in the end . but for alexandria , it took years and years because we had to perform a four-year geophysical survey before we even had a detailed map that showed that there was something under the sediment .
it 's a bit like modern surgery .
you use the scanner , and then afterwards , when you know where to search , you do the operation at the right place . are you still thrilled by your work ? it 's very hard work because for months and months you only sail along straight lines in the harbor , towing instruments and registering data in order to create an electronic map .
when you start to see the map , you get this feeling that there is something down there .
and only then does it become thrilling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of artifacts are on show in bonn it seems that your work has little in common with an indiana jones adventure . not at all , on the contrary i would say .
my job is to prevent adventure . when you take artifacts from the ancient port of alexandria , you put them in different colored baskets .
does the color mean something ? the color is in fact no criteria , but you need these baskets in order to desalinate the artifacts .
when you raise it from the sea , where the object has been for some 2,000 years , you have to remove the salt .
for a small artifact , this can take a few days .
for a very big artefact , like the statue of hapi -lrb- editor 's note : a more than five-meter or 16-feet high statue -rrb- , we needed 18 months to remove the salt . what happens if you do n't do that ? the stone will disintegrate .

what kind of feeling should the exhibition evoke in visitors ? we found all the artifacts right next to each other .
they were on the same place for thousands of years and supplemented each other , they were literally living together .

we plan each mission carefully and train our staff for that , and before starting , there is a lot of paperwork that has to be done . before you started to search for sunken treasures , you studied mathematics and worked as a financial consultant .
how does that fit with archaeology ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goddio devoted himself to marine archeology in the 1980s as a matter of fact , it does help .
after 10 years in finance , i decided to take a one-year break .
i looked at what at the time has been done in underwater archaeology , and i realized that there was a need for a privately funded independent institute that could work for governments and other institutions . you opened such an institute for underwater archaeology in paris in 1985 .
were you always sure that it would become a success story ? maybe i was a little naive at the beginning .
when i started to search for the sunken parts of alexandria in 1984 the geophysical instruments that you need for missions like that did n't exist . but you did find ancient alexandria in the end . but for alexandria , it took years and years because we had to perform a four-year geophysical survey before we even had a detailed map that showed that there was something under the sediment .
it 's a bit like modern surgery .
you use the scanner , and then afterwards , when you know where to search , you do the operation at the right place . are you still thrilled by your work ? it 's very hard work because for months and months you only sail along straight lines in the harbor , towing instruments and registering data in order to create an electronic map .
when you start to see the map , you get this feeling that there is something down there .
and only then does it become thrilling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of artifacts are on show in bonn it seems that your work has little in common with an indiana jones adventure . not at all , on the contrary i would say .
my job is to prevent adventure . when you take artifacts from the ancient port of alexandria , you put them in different colored baskets .
does the color mean something ? the color is in fact no criteria , but you need these baskets in order to desalinate the artifacts .
when you raise it from the sea , where the object has been for some 2,000 years , you have to remove the salt .
for a small artifact , this can take a few days .
for a very big artefact , like the statue of hapi -lrb- editor 's note : a more than five-meter or 16-feet high statue -rrb- , we needed 18 months to remove the salt . what happens if you do n't do that ? the stone will disintegrate .
chemical reactions will make the stone weaker , until it finally disintegrates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this stele of the ptolemy is also part of the exhibition the exhibition in bonn is showing 500 artifacts , most of them from alexandria .
what kind of feeling should the exhibition evoke in visitors ? we found all the artifacts right next to each other .
they were on the same place for thousands of years and supplemented each other , they were literally living together .
in the exhibition you can see that they speak to each other . who owns the artifacts ? they belong to egypt of course .
all artifacts that you see in the exhibit in bonn will one day end up in a museum which will be built for them - in alexandria . " egypt 's sunken treasures " runs until jan .

but the proposal has been met with scorn . the european commission and the 78-nation so-called acp group - mostly former european colonies - are struggling to make progress to conclude new trade agreements by the end of the year when a current preferential market access accord is due to expire . under the european union 's new offer , all quotas and tariffs on acp goods would be lifted immediately once a deal was signed , with the exception of rice and sugar .
97 percent of eu imports from acp nations are already tariff-free or are taxed only at very low levels while 40 of the poorest countries already enjoy free access to eu markets . acp nations include nigeria , kenya , cuba and east timor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union trade commissioner peter mandelson " trade and development for acp countries is about much more than just access to the european market , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said .
" but by removing all remaining tariffs and quotas for all african , caribbean and pacific countries we will create the best possible opportunities for these economies , " he added . offer slammed as " derisory " in reaction , the negotiator for the caribbean acp countries slammed the offer owing to the exceptions on rice and sugar , describing it as " derisory " and warning it could cause more harm than good . " the european commission offer threatens to poison the negotiating climate , especially at a time when both sides are making strides -lrb- on -rrb- flexibilities , " said junior lodge .
" we therefore hope that good sense will prevail and the european commission will offer all acp regions a more constructive and attractive market access offer , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sugar exports from acp nations are n't included in the eu offer levies on sugar would be phased out by 2015 while a reform in subsidies for eu sugar farmers is carried out and a firm date has not yet been set for rice , the commission said . the offer did not cover south africa , which has a bilateral trade agreement with the eu and which the commission said produces " a number of globally competitive products . " the acp group , made up mostly of former european colonies , has benefited from preferential access to eu markets since the signing of the lome accord in 1975 . but other equally poor countries , mostly in latin america , have contested the acp 's preferential treatment and have won backing from the world trade organisation . in 2001 , the world trade referee gave the eu until the end of this year to come up with a new framework that would be more compatible with international rules of commerce . deadline for talks nears after their wto defeat , the europeans and the acp opened talks in 2002 to reach new so-called economic partnership agreements which are being conducted by regions - eastern , central and southern africa , the caribbean and the pacific . but little progress has been made , and pressure is building as the year-end deadline approaches .
a number of development pressure groups , including oxfam and action aid , consider the deadline to be unrealistic and have called for it to be pushed back . the european commission had promised that it would offer greater market access as part of the negotiations , which some development pressure groups have accused the eu of using to gain greater access to acp markets . brussels said the new offer was not conditional on acp countries matching the eu in tearing down tariff and quota barriers and that any greater market access they would have to provide to meet wto rules could be phased in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the eu is trying to gain greater access to markets in the developing world british pro-development pressure group oxfam said the offer was the minimum the commission could do and that it should not be used to strong-arm acp countries into an agreement by the end of the year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : british prisoner crisis in iran germany hopes iran move also a signal on nuclear issue in iran-britain standoff , nuclear issue still lurks in background iran 's ahmadinejad says british sailors to be freed britain and iran keep diplomacy option open for sailors europe -pipe- 05.04.2007 european press review : " sophisticated political theater " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british prisoner crisis is over , but what really happened behind the scenes ?
" sophisticated political theater , " " perfect british diplomacy , " - or both ?
the international press reacted to the release , after 13 days ' captivity , of 15 british sailors held hostage in iran . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad ’ s move to call the hostage release a “ gift ” to the british people was nothing less than a “ sophisticated piece of political theatre , in which the president turned what had become a diplomatic disaster for iran into something of a personal victory , ” uk daily the guardian wrote . but just how effective was the “ pardon ” in the end ? “ ultimately , the larger issue is the effect of all this on the wider stage , ” the paper mused .
“ surely the real lesson to draw from yesterday ’ s theatre is that quiet diplomacy does work and that it can work in the future . ” summing up , the paper argued : “ there is no substitute for direct negotiation , especially with a revolutionary islamic regime in iran , for whom the popularly held grievance about past american and british interference in the gulf is as important as the issue in hand . ” “ iran ’ s president is the uncrowned king of tragicomic political theater , ” agreed the basler zeitung of basel , switzerland .
“ the way he announced the freeing of the 15 captive british sailors was as grotesque as it was masterful . … so , did iran cave in to the angry reactions of the international community ?
were they scared of a threatening liberation action by the british and americans ?
not a chance .
from outside , at least , it looks like iran once again played a perfect hand , and made its political point . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad announced the release at a press conference in tehran but in rome , the daily il messaggero wondered what london had to agree to in order to negotiation the sailors ’ release : “ the release of the the british sailors will no doubt relax relations between britain and tehran . … we don ’ t know yet what quid pro quo the government in london accepted , but it is sure that there was one .
and it wouldn ’ t be surprising if there were a prisoner exchange .
but that would only happen at such time when london and washington could claim they are sticking to their stated principle of not accepting a quid pro quo , ” the paper wrote . “ in any case , there is no reason to be shocked : there have always been prisoner exchanges , whether of soldiers or of journalists . ” dutch newspaper de volkskrant also mulled what , exactly , went on behind the scenes of negotiations . “ in the coming days we will doubtless find out the basics of what went on between london and tehran when it came to arranging for the release of the british hostages , ” de volkskrant wrote .
“ but it is already clear that the affair can not be seen without making a connection to the kidnapping of an iranian diplomat and the arrest of five iranian fighters in iraq .
on tuesday , it was announced that the diplomat will be released , and an iranian consul can visit the fighters .
it is clear that the whole affair was not simply about iran ’ s territorial integrity , or of pardons or shows of might .
it was an exchange . ” bulgaria ’ s monitor newspaper saw the dealings as a major coup for the uk on the world political stage .
“ there is no doubt the sailors have perfect british diplomacy to thank ” for their release , the paper wrote .
“ it was no secret that london started backstage negotiations two or three days ago .
clearly , the brits could give all of humanity a break if they could quickly negotiate between tehran and washinton , like they did in the case of the sailors . ” finally , austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten said the risk of escalation was too big in the situation - and everyone involved knew it . “ a new ahmadinedschad ; the heavily embattled iranian president can celebrate an urgently needed victory .
both sides managed to reach their goals , including the release of iranian hardliners captured by the british , without any loss of face .
uk premier tony blair did not need to apologize for supposed border violations , nor did the regime in tehran need to tone down its loud threats .
for both parties , the risk of escalation appeared too great .
it has been a very calming experience for the rest of the world , ” the paper wrote . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes iran move also a signal on nuclear issue german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday he hoped tehran 's decision to free 15 british sailors was a signal iran was ready to compromise on other matters such as its nuclear program .

but by distancing itself from some anti-globalization activists , the party risks losing its left-wing adherents , some say . when it comes to the g8 summit , to be held this summer in the german resort of heiligendamm , the green party ’ s curse may be the far-left ’ s blessing . the ecology-based greens are not players in the negotiations , but with their increasingly mainstream status - they were part of the ruling coalition in germany between 1998 and 2005 - they appear to be shying away from the noisy and disruptive anti-globalization movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new party theleft -lrb- dielinke . -rrb- aims to profit from the greens ' slide to center according to an article in germany ’ s welt online , some 300 groups have plans to stage opposition demonstrations to the june 5 summit under the motto “ a different world is possible . ”
these range from the appd -lrb- anarchic pogo party of germany -rrb- to the better-known groups like attac and greenpeace .
an initiative called “ paula ” has promised a “ well aimed violent demonstration ” in a town nearby heiligendamm .
for the greens , however , the overtly anti-capitalist actions pose a problem , leaving them to walk a fine line between being part of the policymaking establishment and alienating their left-wing membership .
signature denied when the greens were in a coalition government with gerhard schröder ’ s spd , a lot of the party ’ s left-leaning adherents felt obligated to make uncomfortable compromises .
now , the party risks losing these voters – peace activists , anti-nuclear activists , members of the women ’ s movement , for example – to an increasingly active german far left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roth , right , with anti-globalism protester , refused to sign the document meanwhile , greens chairwoman claudia roth recently refused to sign a letter calling for demonstrations against the summit , written by opponents of the group of eight industrialized nations .
she cited “ a serious difference of opinion on key sections ” of the letter , welt online said . roth said the letter ’ s call to demonstrate was not as harmless as depicted .
she especially opposed the part where it said the g8 was a “ precursor to a world-order based on war . ” attac , possibly the best known of the opposition groups expected to demonstrate against the g8 , said it had roth ’ s stance was " disappointing . " ' one leg in the government ' frauke distelrath , a speaker for the group , told the süddeutsche zeitung that the greens apparently " still had one leg in the government , " and said she could not otherwise think of a reason why they would refuse to sign the call-to-demonstrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin claims there is no split between greens and other protesters " on the one hand the greens are looking to get back in touch with the social movement .
on the other hand , they are sticking to their identity as a ruling party .
they won ’ t even sign on to our harmless letter , ” she said . she noted that the fact that the green party 's youth organization and green parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele had , indeed , signed the plea , made it clear that the green party was internally at odds . trittin denies break roth ’ s party colleague jürgen trittin , germany 's former environment minister , told welt online that he saw no serious break between the greens and other g8 opponents . “ there is 90 percent agreement between us and most other activists , ” he said . the greens plan to use the g8 summit as a forum to demand action on climate protection , ending poverty , and dismantling trade barriers – just like other activists , trittin said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security measures are being made for the g8 summit in heiligendamm he denied that the greens are worried about advances from the far left , which he characterized as being " too internally at odds to pose a danger to us . " meanwhile , the new far-left party , theleft , a grouping of the former communist party of east germany and many disaffected left-wing social democrats , does appear eager to take advantage of the dispute between the greens and the anti-globalization forces .
their parliamentary party chiefs , gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , signed the document - despite their own misgivings about certain passages . since getting seats in the german parliament at the end of 2005 , theleft has established a " contact point for extra-parliamentary movements , " aimed at trying to create more dialog with groups like attac . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 to offer micro-credit help , step up aids funding for africa development ministers from the g8 undertook in berlin on tuesday to set up micro-credit facilities for african nations with the help of the world bank and increase funds for the fight against aids .

the money would be used to fund environmental development . tanja gönner , the conservative environment minister in the southern german state of baden-württemberg , told german daily berliner zeitung on thursday that the measure “ would enable us to finance climate protection activities at home or in developing countries . ” the fee should not exceed “ the high single-digit or low double-digit bracket , ” gönner told the paper . the proposal is part of an ongoing debate on how to call the flight industry to account for its contribution to global warming . boom in discount airlines last month german economics minster michael glos said aircraft were responsible for 1.5 percent of climate-damaging emissions worldwide .
the european union said aviation makes up 3 percent of direct greenhouse gas emissions , though the estimates do not factor in indirect warming effects . previously , politicians had suggested raising a europe-wide tax on kerosene , the high-powered fuel used in aircraft engines .
but under pressure from industry leaders , that proposal has made little headway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boom in budget airlines has hugely increased air traffic february , baden-württemberg ’ s general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , thomas strobl , suggested an alternative .
he joined calls from his social democratic and green counterparts to levy a flat fee on the price of airline tickets . strobl said that “ flying is much too cheap compared to taking the train , ” and that an additional ten euros is within any traveller ’ s budget .
a boom in low-fare airlines has greatly increased the amount of air traffic in europe in recent years .
the rail industry is heavily subsidized in most european countries , while air travel is not . airlines resist proposal but the flat-tax proposal is bound to encounter resistance from the airline industry .
the european regions airline association represents over 220 flight-related companies in europe , and spokeswoman lesley shepherd responded with a “ clear ‘ no ’ ” to the idea . “ we are not in favour of environmental taxes - they do not benefit the environment , ” she said .
she called strobl ’ s proposal a “ misconception . ” lesley suggested that government revenues from environmental taxes are not always used for environmental research .
she said “ the real reason -lrb- for the fee -rrb- is to stop people from flying . ” indeed , the debate began late last year when politicians called on germans to avoid jetting off to far-flung destinations and holiday at home instead .
the latest proposal was timed to coincide with the publication of the second united nations report on climate change , due to appear on friday . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany seeks emerging economies ' support on climate deal germany is to ask for the support of emerging economies for greater climate protection and push for a long-term anti-global warming agreement at a meeting of leading industrial nations ' environment ministers .

but by distancing itself from some anti-globalization activists , the party risks losing its left-wing adherents , some say . when it comes to the g8 summit , to be held this summer in the german resort of heiligendamm , the green party ’ s curse may be the far-left ’ s blessing . the ecology-based greens are not players in the negotiations , but with their increasingly mainstream status - they were part of the ruling coalition in germany between 1998 and 2005 - they appear to be shying away from the noisy and disruptive anti-globalization movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new party theleft -lrb- dielinke . -rrb- aims to profit from the greens ' slide to center according to an article in germany ’ s welt online , some 300 groups have plans to stage opposition demonstrations to the june 5 summit under the motto “ a different world is possible . ”
these range from the appd -lrb- anarchic pogo party of germany -rrb- to the better-known groups like attac and greenpeace .
an initiative called “ paula ” has promised a “ well aimed violent demonstration ” in a town nearby heiligendamm .
for the greens , however , the overtly anti-capitalist actions pose a problem , leaving them to walk a fine line between being part of the policymaking establishment and alienating their left-wing membership .
signature denied when the greens were in a coalition government with gerhard schröder ’ s spd , a lot of the party ’ s left-leaning adherents felt obligated to make uncomfortable compromises .
now , the party risks losing these voters – peace activists , anti-nuclear activists , members of the women ’ s movement , for example – to an increasingly active german far left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roth , right , with anti-globalism protester , refused to sign the document meanwhile , greens chairwoman claudia roth recently refused to sign a letter calling for demonstrations against the summit , written by opponents of the group of eight industrialized nations .
she cited “ a serious difference of opinion on key sections ” of the letter , welt online said . roth said the letter ’ s call to demonstrate was not as harmless as depicted .

" i do not think there is a moderate and ' non-moderate ' taliban .
this distinction was invented by somebody who knows nothing about afghanistan , " spanta told germany 's regional ndr radio .
he compared the proposal by social democrat leader kurt beck to forming a coalition with the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in beck 's home state of rhineland-palatinate in western germany . " it is like saying one can form a coalition with the npd in rhineland-palatinate , or with the moderate npd . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanta said beck knew nothing about afghanistan beck , whose party rules germany in coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives , suggested after a visit to german troops in afghanistan last weekend that military force alone would not put the country on the path to peace . " we have exhausted our possibilities ...
it is time to explore the possibility of a national reconciliation with the taliban , " beck said . he suggested holding a meeting on afghanistan along the lines of the un-sponsored conference on the country 's future that took place in bonn in late 2001 as the taliban were being overthrown . but spanta said : " at the moment i see no point in organizing and holding such a conference . "
beck misguided ?
he also said he was surprised by beck 's proposal , adding that the afghan government had been trying for some time to locate moderate taliban .
" if western politicians have such a thing they could give us the address and contact people , " spanta said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck recently visited german troops in afghanistan beck 's comments drew muted support from foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is a member of the social democrats , but was strongly criticized by merkel 's christian democrats . observers saw it as a misguided attempt by beck to broaden his foreign policy profile and boost his party 's ratings . nato-led forces are battling the strongest taliban insurgency yet since the hard-line islamist movement was toppled for harboring osama bin laden . germany has some 2,750 troops serving in the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in northern afghanistan and this week sent six tornado jets to carry out surveillance missions to help their nato allies . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " these people are ready to kill " gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesperson for the social democratic party , told dw-world.de that germany is not ready to give in to the terrorists ’ 10-day ultimatum to withdraw troops from afghanistan .
-lrb- 04.04.2007 -rrb- senior social democrats suggest talking to the taliban the leader of germany 's social democrats has proposed staging a new peace conference on afghanistan that would include representatives of the taliban .
it 's a controversial idea that has met a mixed reception so far .

other baltic sea states , including finland , denmark and estonia , also worry that the construction work could stir up toxic material on the seabed and even disturb unexploded chemical weapons left over from world war two . nord stream , the russian-german consortium building the pipeline , seeks to alleviate these concerns and " has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " according to a statement . rerouting the pipeline nord stream first proposed building the pipeline across the gulf of finland and down the middle of the baltic sea , passing just below the swedish island of gotland .

polish officials have expressed fears that the project could threaten poland ’ s energy security , as the new pipeline would allow russia to sell natural gas to western europe without the need for polish transit lines . in april last year , polish defense minister radoslaw sikorski even went so far as to compare the project to the hitler-stalin pact of 1939 , which divided poland among russia and germany .

russian energy giant gazprom own a majority stake in the consortium , and germany ’ s e.on ruhrgas and wintershall hold 24.5 percent shares each . if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .

other options include laying the pipeline 10 kilometers further south of gotland , bypassing swedish wildlife reserves , or running it along a route north of the danish island of bornholm . nord stream , which appointed former german chancellor gerhard schröder to its executive board shortly after he left office , says it is " determined to make sure that the new pipeline meets high environmental standards .

polish officials have expressed fears that the project could threaten poland ’ s energy security , as the new pipeline would allow russia to sell natural gas to western europe without the need for polish transit lines . in april last year , polish defense minister radoslaw sikorski even went so far as to compare the project to the hitler-stalin pact of 1939 , which divided poland among russia and germany .

" egypt 's sunken treasures , " an exhibition of artifacts unearthed during goddio 's excavations , went on show in bonn on thursday . dw-world.de : after thousands of excursions to sunken cities and shipwrecks around the world , your living room must look like an adventurous place . franck goddio : well , it 's not an adventure .
i would say it 's a job , and we are doing this job very professionally .
we plan each mission carefully and train our staff for that , and before starting , there is a lot of paperwork that has to be done . before you started to search for sunken treasures , you studied mathematics and worked as a financial consultant .
how does that fit with archaeology ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goddio devoted himself to marine archeology in the 1980s as a matter of fact , it does help .
after 10 years in finance , i decided to take a one-year break .
i looked at what at the time has been done in underwater archaeology , and i realized that there was a need for a privately funded independent institute that could work for governments and other institutions . you opened such an institute for underwater archaeology in paris in 1985 .
were you always sure that it would become a success story ? maybe i was a little naive at the beginning .
when i started to search for the sunken parts of alexandria in 1984 the geophysical instruments that you need for missions like that did n't exist . but you did find ancient alexandria in the end . but for alexandria , it took years and years because we had to perform a four-year geophysical survey before we even had a detailed map that showed that there was something under the sediment .
it 's a bit like modern surgery .
you use the scanner , and then afterwards , when you know where to search , you do the operation at the right place . are you still thrilled by your work ? it 's very hard work because for months and months you only sail along straight lines in the harbor , towing instruments and registering data in order to create an electronic map .
when you start to see the map , you get this feeling that there is something down there .
and only then does it become thrilling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of artifacts are on show in bonn it seems that your work has little in common with an indiana jones adventure . not at all , on the contrary i would say .
my job is to prevent adventure . when you take artifacts from the ancient port of alexandria , you put them in different colored baskets .
does the color mean something ? the color is in fact no criteria , but you need these baskets in order to desalinate the artifacts .
when you raise it from the sea , where the object has been for some 2,000 years , you have to remove the salt .
for a small artifact , this can take a few days .
for a very big artefact , like the statue of hapi -lrb- editor 's note : a more than five-meter or 16-feet high statue -rrb- , we needed 18 months to remove the salt . what happens if you do n't do that ? the stone will disintegrate .
chemical reactions will make the stone weaker , until it finally disintegrates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this stele of the ptolemy is also part of the exhibition the exhibition in bonn is showing 500 artifacts , most of them from alexandria .
what kind of feeling should the exhibition evoke in visitors ? we found all the artifacts right next to each other .
they were on the same place for thousands of years and supplemented each other , they were literally living together .
in the exhibition you can see that they speak to each other . who owns the artifacts ? they belong to egypt of course .
all artifacts that you see in the exhibit in bonn will one day end up in a museum which will be built for them - in alexandria . " egypt 's sunken treasures " runs until jan .

" egypt 's sunken treasures , " an exhibition of artifacts unearthed during goddio 's excavations , went on show in bonn on thursday . dw-world.de : after thousands of excursions to sunken cities and shipwrecks around the world , your living room must look like an adventurous place . franck goddio : well , it 's not an adventure .
i would say it 's a job , and we are doing this job very professionally .
we plan each mission carefully and train our staff for that , and before starting , there is a lot of paperwork that has to be done . before you started to search for sunken treasures , you studied mathematics and worked as a financial consultant .
how does that fit with archaeology ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goddio devoted himself to marine archeology in the 1980s as a matter of fact , it does help .
after 10 years in finance , i decided to take a one-year break .
i looked at what at the time has been done in underwater archaeology , and i realized that there was a need for a privately funded independent institute that could work for governments and other institutions . you opened such an institute for underwater archaeology in paris in 1985 .
were you always sure that it would become a success story ? maybe i was a little naive at the beginning .
when i started to search for the sunken parts of alexandria in 1984 the geophysical instruments that you need for missions like that did n't exist . but you did find ancient alexandria in the end . but for alexandria , it took years and years because we had to perform a four-year geophysical survey before we even had a detailed map that showed that there was something under the sediment .
it 's a bit like modern surgery .
you use the scanner , and then afterwards , when you know where to search , you do the operation at the right place . are you still thrilled by your work ? it 's very hard work because for months and months you only sail along straight lines in the harbor , towing instruments and registering data in order to create an electronic map .
when you start to see the map , you get this feeling that there is something down there .
and only then does it become thrilling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of artifacts are on show in bonn it seems that your work has little in common with an indiana jones adventure . not at all , on the contrary i would say .
my job is to prevent adventure . when you take artifacts from the ancient port of alexandria , you put them in different colored baskets .
does the color mean something ? the color is in fact no criteria , but you need these baskets in order to desalinate the artifacts .
when you raise it from the sea , where the object has been for some 2,000 years , you have to remove the salt .
for a small artifact , this can take a few days .
for a very big artefact , like the statue of hapi -lrb- editor 's note : a more than five-meter or 16-feet high statue -rrb- , we needed 18 months to remove the salt . what happens if you do n't do that ? the stone will disintegrate .
chemical reactions will make the stone weaker , until it finally disintegrates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this stele of the ptolemy is also part of the exhibition the exhibition in bonn is showing 500 artifacts , most of them from alexandria .
what kind of feeling should the exhibition evoke in visitors ? we found all the artifacts right next to each other .
they were on the same place for thousands of years and supplemented each other , they were literally living together .
in the exhibition you can see that they speak to each other . who owns the artifacts ? they belong to egypt of course .

" egypt 's sunken treasures , " an exhibition of artifacts unearthed during goddio 's excavations , went on show in bonn on thursday . dw-world.de : after thousands of excursions to sunken cities and shipwrecks around the world , your living room must look like an adventurous place . franck goddio : well , it 's not an adventure .
i would say it 's a job , and we are doing this job very professionally .
we plan each mission carefully and train our staff for that , and before starting , there is a lot of paperwork that has to be done . before you started to search for sunken treasures , you studied mathematics and worked as a financial consultant .
how does that fit with archaeology ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goddio devoted himself to marine archeology in the 1980s as a matter of fact , it does help .
after 10 years in finance , i decided to take a one-year break .
i looked at what at the time has been done in underwater archaeology , and i realized that there was a need for a privately funded independent institute that could work for governments and other institutions . you opened such an institute for underwater archaeology in paris in 1985 .
were you always sure that it would become a success story ? maybe i was a little naive at the beginning .
when i started to search for the sunken parts of alexandria in 1984 the geophysical instruments that you need for missions like that did n't exist . but you did find ancient alexandria in the end . but for alexandria , it took years and years because we had to perform a four-year geophysical survey before we even had a detailed map that showed that there was something under the sediment .
it 's a bit like modern surgery .
you use the scanner , and then afterwards , when you know where to search , you do the operation at the right place . are you still thrilled by your work ? it 's very hard work because for months and months you only sail along straight lines in the harbor , towing instruments and registering data in order to create an electronic map .
when you start to see the map , you get this feeling that there is something down there .
and only then does it become thrilling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of artifacts are on show in bonn it seems that your work has little in common with an indiana jones adventure . not at all , on the contrary i would say .
my job is to prevent adventure . when you take artifacts from the ancient port of alexandria , you put them in different colored baskets .
does the color mean something ? the color is in fact no criteria , but you need these baskets in order to desalinate the artifacts .
when you raise it from the sea , where the object has been for some 2,000 years , you have to remove the salt .
for a small artifact , this can take a few days .
for a very big artefact , like the statue of hapi -lrb- editor 's note : a more than five-meter or 16-feet high statue -rrb- , we needed 18 months to remove the salt . what happens if you do n't do that ? the stone will disintegrate .
chemical reactions will make the stone weaker , until it finally disintegrates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this stele of the ptolemy is also part of the exhibition the exhibition in bonn is showing 500 artifacts , most of them from alexandria .
what kind of feeling should the exhibition evoke in visitors ? we found all the artifacts right next to each other .
they were on the same place for thousands of years and supplemented each other , they were literally living together .
in the exhibition you can see that they speak to each other . who owns the artifacts ? they belong to egypt of course .
all artifacts that you see in the exhibit in bonn will one day end up in a museum which will be built for them - in alexandria . " egypt 's sunken treasures " runs until jan .

the money would be used to fund environmental development . tanja gönner , the conservative environment minister in the southern german state of baden-württemberg , told german daily berliner zeitung on thursday that the measure “ would enable us to finance climate protection activities at home or in developing countries . ” the fee should not exceed “ the high single-digit or low double-digit bracket , ” gönner told the paper . the proposal is part of an ongoing debate on how to call the flight industry to account for its contribution to global warming . boom in discount airlines last month german economics minster michael glos said aircraft were responsible for 1.5 percent of climate-damaging emissions worldwide .
the european union said aviation makes up 3 percent of direct greenhouse gas emissions , though the estimates do not factor in indirect warming effects . previously , politicians had suggested raising a europe-wide tax on kerosene , the high-powered fuel used in aircraft engines .
but under pressure from industry leaders , that proposal has made little headway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boom in budget airlines has hugely increased air traffic february , baden-württemberg ’ s general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , thomas strobl , suggested an alternative .
he joined calls from his social democratic and green counterparts to levy a flat fee on the price of airline tickets . strobl said that “ flying is much too cheap compared to taking the train , ” and that an additional ten euros is within any traveller ’ s budget .
a boom in low-fare airlines has greatly increased the amount of air traffic in europe in recent years .
the rail industry is heavily subsidized in most european countries , while air travel is not . airlines resist proposal but the flat-tax proposal is bound to encounter resistance from the airline industry .
the european regions airline association represents over 220 flight-related companies in europe , and spokeswoman lesley shepherd responded with a “ clear ‘ no ’ ” to the idea . “ we are not in favour of environmental taxes - they do not benefit the environment , ” she said .
she called strobl ’ s proposal a “ misconception . ” lesley suggested that government revenues from environmental taxes are not always used for environmental research .

even the emissions trade , once held up as a model to be emulated , is floundering . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas focused his ire on australia at the start of a meeting of the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- this week .
he called on the world 's second-biggest producer of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- to finally ratify the kyoto protocol , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are primarily responsible for global warming . australian prime minister john howard 's response was brusque : " you 've got the spokesman for a group of countries lecturing us about not having signed kyoto , yet the great bulk of the countries on whose behalf he speaks are falling well behind their kyoto targets and are doing less well than australia in meeting them , " he told australian broadcasting corporation radio . " our answer to the spokesman for the european union is look to your own affairs , get your countries complying with the targets you 've proclaimed , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas ' house could be in better shape , too dimas ' spokeswoman , barbara helfferich , was keen to rebuff the criticism .
" we said what needed to be said .
and the eu will in any case comply with its kyoto targets , " she told dw-world.de. but howard had a point .
the eu is far from attaining the targets it agreed to by ratifying the kyoto protocol .
the 15 older eu states are obliged to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions by eight percent by 2012 in comparison to 1990 levels , while the newer members of the bloc agreed to different targets .
but it was recently revealed that the eu had only achieved 1.6 percent by 2005 .
in 2006 , the countries carbon dioxide emissions actually increased by 1.5 percent above the previous year 's level .
flawed emissions trade critics lay some of the blame on the eu 's emissions trade , which allows companies to pollute as long as they have the necessary certificates , which can be traded .
the idea was that businesses would invest in environmentally friendly technologies to cut emissions if their only other option was to pay for a limited number of expensive licenses to pollute . but the emissions trade has so far failed to bring about a decrease in co2 pollution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is cheap at european energy exchanges the eu issued too many certificates , according to hans-jürgen nantke , head of the emissions trade office at germany 's federal environmental agency .
" that 's why the prices hit rock bottom , " he said . a ton of co2 cost nearly 30 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- in spring 2006 at the european energy exchange in leipzig .
today the price stands at less than one euro .
buying the right to pollute has become so cheap because the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , made mistakes when it estimated co2 emissions .
in 2006 , europe 's industries were able to emit 50 million tons more co2 than they ought to have . since the prices for certificates were so cheap , businesses did n't necessarily see the need to invest in new technologies that would produce fewer emissions . " when prices were higher , that happened , " said verena graichen , an expert on environmental protection at the institute for applied ecology , a german think tank . german power companies , for example , had shut down old lignite coal power plants in favor of more environmentally friendly anthracite coal plants although the latter were more expensive to run , she said .
better the second time around ?
" unfortunately the emissions trade does n't work very well , but we ca n't change anything anymore , " conceded dimas ' spokeswoman helfferich .
instead , she suggested looking to the future .
in 2008 , the second phase of the emissions trade , which continues until 2012 , is set to begin .
in order to meet the kyoto targets , the european commission has mandated a much lower number of emission certificates be issued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry needs more encouragement to cut emissions " from 2008 to 2012 , we will fulfill four kyoto percent , " helfferich predicted and referred to dozens of eu projects concerning climate protection as well as the emissions trade , which she said would then work " significantly better . " current prices for emissions certificates wo n't have an effect on their cost in the future , since the price will be recalculated in 2008 .
however , their greatly reduced number has already had an influence on today 's market : " futures , " that is , options on certificates that will be traded in the future , already cost between 16 and 17 euros per ton . but critics say the eu should alter the plans for the second phase of the emissions trade .
instead of issuing the licenses to pollute largely for free in 2008 , industry should have to buy them from the start . " companies do n't receive machines for free , " pointed out nantke of germany 's environmental agency . torsten schäfer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite climate concerns , germany plans coal power plants european union states agreed earlier this month on a binding 20 percent cut in co2 emissions by 2020 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.04.2007 eu 's environmental policy flounders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has a long way to go to reach its co2 emissions targets as experts in brussels wrangle over the wording of a un report on the impact of global warming , the eu 's own climate policy is stagnating .
even the emissions trade , once held up as a model to be emulated , is floundering . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas focused his ire on australia at the start of a meeting of the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- this week .
he called on the world 's second-biggest producer of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- to finally ratify the kyoto protocol , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are primarily responsible for global warming . australian prime minister john howard 's response was brusque : " you 've got the spokesman for a group of countries lecturing us about not having signed kyoto , yet the great bulk of the countries on whose behalf he speaks are falling well behind their kyoto targets and are doing less well than australia in meeting them , " he told australian broadcasting corporation radio . " our answer to the spokesman for the european union is look to your own affairs , get your countries complying with the targets you 've proclaimed , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas ' house could be in better shape , too dimas ' spokeswoman , barbara helfferich , was keen to rebuff the criticism .
" we said what needed to be said .
and the eu will in any case comply with its kyoto targets , " she told dw-world.de. but howard had a point .
the eu is far from attaining the targets it agreed to by ratifying the kyoto protocol .
the 15 older eu states are obliged to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions by eight percent by 2012 in comparison to 1990 levels , while the newer members of the bloc agreed to different targets .
but it was recently revealed that the eu had only achieved 1.6 percent by 2005 .
in 2006 , the countries carbon dioxide emissions actually increased by 1.5 percent above the previous year 's level .
flawed emissions trade critics lay some of the blame on the eu 's emissions trade , which allows companies to pollute as long as they have the necessary certificates , which can be traded .
the idea was that businesses would invest in environmentally friendly technologies to cut emissions if their only other option was to pay for a limited number of expensive licenses to pollute . but the emissions trade has so far failed to bring about a decrease in co2 pollution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is cheap at european energy exchanges the eu issued too many certificates , according to hans-jürgen nantke , head of the emissions trade office at germany 's federal environmental agency .
" that 's why the prices hit rock bottom , " he said . a ton of co2 cost nearly 30 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- in spring 2006 at the european energy exchange in leipzig .
today the price stands at less than one euro .
buying the right to pollute has become so cheap because the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , made mistakes when it estimated co2 emissions .
in 2006 , europe 's industries were able to emit 50 million tons more co2 than they ought to have . since the prices for certificates were so cheap , businesses did n't necessarily see the need to invest in new technologies that would produce fewer emissions . " when prices were higher , that happened , " said verena graichen , an expert on environmental protection at the institute for applied ecology , a german think tank . german power companies , for example , had shut down old lignite coal power plants in favor of more environmentally friendly anthracite coal plants although the latter were more expensive to run , she said .
better the second time around ?
" unfortunately the emissions trade does n't work very well , but we ca n't change anything anymore , " conceded dimas ' spokeswoman helfferich .
instead , she suggested looking to the future .

the money would be used to fund environmental development . tanja gönner , the conservative environment minister in the southern german state of baden-württemberg , told german daily berliner zeitung on thursday that the measure “ would enable us to finance climate protection activities at home or in developing countries . ” the fee should not exceed “ the high single-digit or low double-digit bracket , ” gönner told the paper . the proposal is part of an ongoing debate on how to call the flight industry to account for its contribution to global warming . boom in discount airlines last month german economics minster michael glos said aircraft were responsible for 1.5 percent of climate-damaging emissions worldwide .
the european union said aviation makes up 3 percent of direct greenhouse gas emissions , though the estimates do not factor in indirect warming effects . previously , politicians had suggested raising a europe-wide tax on kerosene , the high-powered fuel used in aircraft engines .

" i do not think there is a moderate and ' non-moderate ' taliban .
this distinction was invented by somebody who knows nothing about afghanistan , " spanta told germany 's regional ndr radio .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.04.2007 eu offers full market access to former colonies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the acp nations are mostly former european colonies the eu has offered to scrap most tariffs and quotas it still imposes on exports from african , caribbean and pacific nations to boost talks on new trade pacts .
but the proposal has been met with scorn . the european commission and the 78-nation so-called acp group - mostly former european colonies - are struggling to make progress to conclude new trade agreements by the end of the year when a current preferential market access accord is due to expire . under the european union 's new offer , all quotas and tariffs on acp goods would be lifted immediately once a deal was signed , with the exception of rice and sugar .
97 percent of eu imports from acp nations are already tariff-free or are taxed only at very low levels while 40 of the poorest countries already enjoy free access to eu markets . acp nations include nigeria , kenya , cuba and east timor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union trade commissioner peter mandelson " trade and development for acp countries is about much more than just access to the european market , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said .
" but by removing all remaining tariffs and quotas for all african , caribbean and pacific countries we will create the best possible opportunities for these economies , " he added . offer slammed as " derisory " in reaction , the negotiator for the caribbean acp countries slammed the offer owing to the exceptions on rice and sugar , describing it as " derisory " and warning it could cause more harm than good . " the european commission offer threatens to poison the negotiating climate , especially at a time when both sides are making strides -lrb- on -rrb- flexibilities , " said junior lodge .
" we therefore hope that good sense will prevail and the european commission will offer all acp regions a more constructive and attractive market access offer , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sugar exports from acp nations are n't included in the eu offer levies on sugar would be phased out by 2015 while a reform in subsidies for eu sugar farmers is carried out and a firm date has not yet been set for rice , the commission said . the offer did not cover south africa , which has a bilateral trade agreement with the eu and which the commission said produces " a number of globally competitive products . " the acp group , made up mostly of former european colonies , has benefited from preferential access to eu markets since the signing of the lome accord in 1975 . but other equally poor countries , mostly in latin america , have contested the acp 's preferential treatment and have won backing from the world trade organisation . in 2001 , the world trade referee gave the eu until the end of this year to come up with a new framework that would be more compatible with international rules of commerce . deadline for talks nears after their wto defeat , the europeans and the acp opened talks in 2002 to reach new so-called economic partnership agreements which are being conducted by regions - eastern , central and southern africa , the caribbean and the pacific . but little progress has been made , and pressure is building as the year-end deadline approaches .
a number of development pressure groups , including oxfam and action aid , consider the deadline to be unrealistic and have called for it to be pushed back . the european commission had promised that it would offer greater market access as part of the negotiations , which some development pressure groups have accused the eu of using to gain greater access to acp markets . brussels said the new offer was not conditional on acp countries matching the eu in tearing down tariff and quota barriers and that any greater market access they would have to provide to meet wto rules could be phased in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the eu is trying to gain greater access to markets in the developing world british pro-development pressure group oxfam said the offer was the minimum the commission could do and that it should not be used to strong-arm acp countries into an agreement by the end of the year . " developing countries look set to be asked to open their markets dramatically , which could have seriously negative implications for poor peoples ' livelihoods and future economic development , " said oxfam 's brussels head luis morago . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants new deal with african , caribbean , pacific partners the european union said it wants to complete new trade agreements with 78 african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- countries by the end of the year despite opposition from developing countries .

but the proposal has been met with scorn . the european commission and the 78-nation so-called acp group - mostly former european colonies - are struggling to make progress to conclude new trade agreements by the end of the year when a current preferential market access accord is due to expire . under the european union 's new offer , all quotas and tariffs on acp goods would be lifted immediately once a deal was signed , with the exception of rice and sugar .
97 percent of eu imports from acp nations are already tariff-free or are taxed only at very low levels while 40 of the poorest countries already enjoy free access to eu markets . acp nations include nigeria , kenya , cuba and east timor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union trade commissioner peter mandelson " trade and development for acp countries is about much more than just access to the european market , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said .
" but by removing all remaining tariffs and quotas for all african , caribbean and pacific countries we will create the best possible opportunities for these economies , " he added . offer slammed as " derisory " in reaction , the negotiator for the caribbean acp countries slammed the offer owing to the exceptions on rice and sugar , describing it as " derisory " and warning it could cause more harm than good . " the european commission offer threatens to poison the negotiating climate , especially at a time when both sides are making strides -lrb- on -rrb- flexibilities , " said junior lodge .

" the acp group , made up mostly of former european colonies , has benefited from preferential access to eu markets since the signing of the lome accord in 1975 . but other equally poor countries , mostly in latin america , have contested the acp 's preferential treatment and have won backing from the world trade organisation . in 2001 , the world trade referee gave the eu until the end of this year to come up with a new framework that would be more compatible with international rules of commerce . deadline for talks nears after their wto defeat , the europeans and the acp opened talks in 2002 to reach new so-called economic partnership agreements which are being conducted by regions - eastern , central and southern africa , the caribbean and the pacific . but little progress has been made , and pressure is building as the year-end deadline approaches .
a number of development pressure groups , including oxfam and action aid , consider the deadline to be unrealistic and have called for it to be pushed back . the european commission had promised that it would offer greater market access as part of the negotiations , which some development pressure groups have accused the eu of using to gain greater access to acp markets . brussels said the new offer was not conditional on acp countries matching the eu in tearing down tariff and quota barriers and that any greater market access they would have to provide to meet wto rules could be phased in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the eu is trying to gain greater access to markets in the developing world british pro-development pressure group oxfam said the offer was the minimum the commission could do and that it should not be used to strong-arm acp countries into an agreement by the end of the year .

but the proposal has been met with scorn . the european commission and the 78-nation so-called acp group - mostly former european colonies - are struggling to make progress to conclude new trade agreements by the end of the year when a current preferential market access accord is due to expire . under the european union 's new offer , all quotas and tariffs on acp goods would be lifted immediately once a deal was signed , with the exception of rice and sugar .
97 percent of eu imports from acp nations are already tariff-free or are taxed only at very low levels while 40 of the poorest countries already enjoy free access to eu markets . acp nations include nigeria , kenya , cuba and east timor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union trade commissioner peter mandelson " trade and development for acp countries is about much more than just access to the european market , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said .
" but by removing all remaining tariffs and quotas for all african , caribbean and pacific countries we will create the best possible opportunities for these economies , " he added . offer slammed as " derisory " in reaction , the negotiator for the caribbean acp countries slammed the offer owing to the exceptions on rice and sugar , describing it as " derisory " and warning it could cause more harm than good . " the european commission offer threatens to poison the negotiating climate , especially at a time when both sides are making strides -lrb- on -rrb- flexibilities , " said junior lodge .
" we therefore hope that good sense will prevail and the european commission will offer all acp regions a more constructive and attractive market access offer , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sugar exports from acp nations are n't included in the eu offer levies on sugar would be phased out by 2015 while a reform in subsidies for eu sugar farmers is carried out and a firm date has not yet been set for rice , the commission said . the offer did not cover south africa , which has a bilateral trade agreement with the eu and which the commission said produces " a number of globally competitive products . " the acp group , made up mostly of former european colonies , has benefited from preferential access to eu markets since the signing of the lome accord in 1975 . but other equally poor countries , mostly in latin america , have contested the acp 's preferential treatment and have won backing from the world trade organisation . in 2001 , the world trade referee gave the eu until the end of this year to come up with a new framework that would be more compatible with international rules of commerce . deadline for talks nears after their wto defeat , the europeans and the acp opened talks in 2002 to reach new so-called economic partnership agreements which are being conducted by regions - eastern , central and southern africa , the caribbean and the pacific . but little progress has been made , and pressure is building as the year-end deadline approaches .
a number of development pressure groups , including oxfam and action aid , consider the deadline to be unrealistic and have called for it to be pushed back . the european commission had promised that it would offer greater market access as part of the negotiations , which some development pressure groups have accused the eu of using to gain greater access to acp markets . brussels said the new offer was not conditional on acp countries matching the eu in tearing down tariff and quota barriers and that any greater market access they would have to provide to meet wto rules could be phased in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the eu is trying to gain greater access to markets in the developing world british pro-development pressure group oxfam said the offer was the minimum the commission could do and that it should not be used to strong-arm acp countries into an agreement by the end of the year .

" sophisticated political theater , " " perfect british diplomacy , " - or both ?
the international press reacted to the release , after 13 days ' captivity , of 15 british sailors held hostage in iran . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad ’ s move to call the hostage release a “ gift ” to the british people was nothing less than a “ sophisticated piece of political theatre , in which the president turned what had become a diplomatic disaster for iran into something of a personal victory , ” uk daily the guardian wrote . but just how effective was the “ pardon ” in the end ? “ ultimately , the larger issue is the effect of all this on the wider stage , ” the paper mused .
“ surely the real lesson to draw from yesterday ’ s theatre is that quiet diplomacy does work and that it can work in the future . ” summing up , the paper argued : “ there is no substitute for direct negotiation , especially with a revolutionary islamic regime in iran , for whom the popularly held grievance about past american and british interference in the gulf is as important as the issue in hand . ” “ iran ’ s president is the uncrowned king of tragicomic political theater , ” agreed the basler zeitung of basel , switzerland .
“ the way he announced the freeing of the 15 captive british sailors was as grotesque as it was masterful . … so , did iran cave in to the angry reactions of the international community ?
were they scared of a threatening liberation action by the british and americans ?
not a chance .
from outside , at least , it looks like iran once again played a perfect hand , and made its political point . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad announced the release at a press conference in tehran but in rome , the daily il messaggero wondered what london had to agree to in order to negotiation the sailors ’ release : “ the release of the the british sailors will no doubt relax relations between britain and tehran . … we don ’ t know yet what quid pro quo the government in london accepted , but it is sure that there was one .
and it wouldn ’ t be surprising if there were a prisoner exchange .
but that would only happen at such time when london and washington could claim they are sticking to their stated principle of not accepting a quid pro quo , ” the paper wrote . “ in any case , there is no reason to be shocked : there have always been prisoner exchanges , whether of soldiers or of journalists . ” dutch newspaper de volkskrant also mulled what , exactly , went on behind the scenes of negotiations . “ in the coming days we will doubtless find out the basics of what went on between london and tehran when it came to arranging for the release of the british hostages , ” de volkskrant wrote .
“ but it is already clear that the affair can not be seen without making a connection to the kidnapping of an iranian diplomat and the arrest of five iranian fighters in iraq .
on tuesday , it was announced that the diplomat will be released , and an iranian consul can visit the fighters .
it is clear that the whole affair was not simply about iran ’ s territorial integrity , or of pardons or shows of might .
it was an exchange . ” bulgaria ’ s monitor newspaper saw the dealings as a major coup for the uk on the world political stage .
“ there is no doubt the sailors have perfect british diplomacy to thank ” for their release , the paper wrote .
“ it was no secret that london started backstage negotiations two or three days ago .
clearly , the brits could give all of humanity a break if they could quickly negotiate between tehran and washinton , like they did in the case of the sailors . ” finally , austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten said the risk of escalation was too big in the situation - and everyone involved knew it . “ a new ahmadinedschad ; the heavily embattled iranian president can celebrate an urgently needed victory .

" sophisticated political theater , " " perfect british diplomacy , " - or both ?
the international press reacted to the release , after 13 days ' captivity , of 15 british sailors held hostage in iran . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad ’ s move to call the hostage release a “ gift ” to the british people was nothing less than a “ sophisticated piece of political theatre , in which the president turned what had become a diplomatic disaster for iran into something of a personal victory , ” uk daily the guardian wrote . but just how effective was the “ pardon ” in the end ? “ ultimately , the larger issue is the effect of all this on the wider stage , ” the paper mused .
“ surely the real lesson to draw from yesterday ’ s theatre is that quiet diplomacy does work and that it can work in the future . ” summing up , the paper argued : “ there is no substitute for direct negotiation , especially with a revolutionary islamic regime in iran , for whom the popularly held grievance about past american and british interference in the gulf is as important as the issue in hand . ” “ iran ’ s president is the uncrowned king of tragicomic political theater , ” agreed the basler zeitung of basel , switzerland .
“ the way he announced the freeing of the 15 captive british sailors was as grotesque as it was masterful . … so , did iran cave in to the angry reactions of the international community ?
were they scared of a threatening liberation action by the british and americans ?
not a chance .
from outside , at least , it looks like iran once again played a perfect hand , and made its political point . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad announced the release at a press conference in tehran but in rome , the daily il messaggero wondered what london had to agree to in order to negotiation the sailors ’ release : “ the release of the the british sailors will no doubt relax relations between britain and tehran . … we don ’ t know yet what quid pro quo the government in london accepted , but it is sure that there was one .
and it wouldn ’ t be surprising if there were a prisoner exchange .
but that would only happen at such time when london and washington could claim they are sticking to their stated principle of not accepting a quid pro quo , ” the paper wrote . “ in any case , there is no reason to be shocked : there have always been prisoner exchanges , whether of soldiers or of journalists . ” dutch newspaper de volkskrant also mulled what , exactly , went on behind the scenes of negotiations . “ in the coming days we will doubtless find out the basics of what went on between london and tehran when it came to arranging for the release of the british hostages , ” de volkskrant wrote .
“ but it is already clear that the affair can not be seen without making a connection to the kidnapping of an iranian diplomat and the arrest of five iranian fighters in iraq .
on tuesday , it was announced that the diplomat will be released , and an iranian consul can visit the fighters .
it is clear that the whole affair was not simply about iran ’ s territorial integrity , or of pardons or shows of might .
it was an exchange . ” bulgaria ’ s monitor newspaper saw the dealings as a major coup for the uk on the world political stage .
“ there is no doubt the sailors have perfect british diplomacy to thank ” for their release , the paper wrote .
“ it was no secret that london started backstage negotiations two or three days ago .

" i do not think there is a moderate and ' non-moderate ' taliban .
this distinction was invented by somebody who knows nothing about afghanistan , " spanta told germany 's regional ndr radio .
he compared the proposal by social democrat leader kurt beck to forming a coalition with the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in beck 's home state of rhineland-palatinate in western germany . " it is like saying one can form a coalition with the npd in rhineland-palatinate , or with the moderate npd . "

it is time to explore the possibility of a national reconciliation with the taliban , " beck said . he suggested holding a meeting on afghanistan along the lines of the un-sponsored conference on the country 's future that took place in bonn in late 2001 as the taliban were being overthrown . but spanta said : " at the moment i see no point in organizing and holding such a conference . "

tehran says its nuclear program is purely for electricity production . european union foreign policy chief javier solana discussed prospects for negotiations on iran 's nuclear program with iranian negotiator ali larijani in a telephone call shortly before iran freed the 15 british navy personnel , an eu official said on thursday .

" we view this as a goodwill gesture on the part of the iranian leadership , " deputy foreign minister alexander losyukov was quoted by interfax news agency as saying . " certain actions , appeals to the iranians by us , also had an effect , " he said .
" we proceeded mainly from humanitarian considerations and also from the fact that such incidents serve to increase tensions , which is highly undesirable under the circumstances .

even the emissions trade , once held up as a model to be emulated , is floundering . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas focused his ire on australia at the start of a meeting of the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- this week .
he called on the world 's second-biggest producer of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- to finally ratify the kyoto protocol , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are primarily responsible for global warming . australian prime minister john howard 's response was brusque : " you 've got the spokesman for a group of countries lecturing us about not having signed kyoto , yet the great bulk of the countries on whose behalf he speaks are falling well behind their kyoto targets and are doing less well than australia in meeting them , " he told australian broadcasting corporation radio . " our answer to the spokesman for the european union is look to your own affairs , get your countries complying with the targets you 've proclaimed , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas ' house could be in better shape , too dimas ' spokeswoman , barbara helfferich , was keen to rebuff the criticism .
" we said what needed to be said .
and the eu will in any case comply with its kyoto targets , " she told dw-world.de. but howard had a point .
the eu is far from attaining the targets it agreed to by ratifying the kyoto protocol .
the 15 older eu states are obliged to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions by eight percent by 2012 in comparison to 1990 levels , while the newer members of the bloc agreed to different targets .
but it was recently revealed that the eu had only achieved 1.6 percent by 2005 .
in 2006 , the countries carbon dioxide emissions actually increased by 1.5 percent above the previous year 's level .
flawed emissions trade critics lay some of the blame on the eu 's emissions trade , which allows companies to pollute as long as they have the necessary certificates , which can be traded .
the idea was that businesses would invest in environmentally friendly technologies to cut emissions if their only other option was to pay for a limited number of expensive licenses to pollute . but the emissions trade has so far failed to bring about a decrease in co2 pollution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is cheap at european energy exchanges the eu issued too many certificates , according to hans-jürgen nantke , head of the emissions trade office at germany 's federal environmental agency .
" that 's why the prices hit rock bottom , " he said . a ton of co2 cost nearly 30 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- in spring 2006 at the european energy exchange in leipzig .
today the price stands at less than one euro .
buying the right to pollute has become so cheap because the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , made mistakes when it estimated co2 emissions .
in 2006 , europe 's industries were able to emit 50 million tons more co2 than they ought to have . since the prices for certificates were so cheap , businesses did n't necessarily see the need to invest in new technologies that would produce fewer emissions . " when prices were higher , that happened , " said verena graichen , an expert on environmental protection at the institute for applied ecology , a german think tank . german power companies , for example , had shut down old lignite coal power plants in favor of more environmentally friendly anthracite coal plants although the latter were more expensive to run , she said .
better the second time around ?
" unfortunately the emissions trade does n't work very well , but we ca n't change anything anymore , " conceded dimas ' spokeswoman helfferich .
instead , she suggested looking to the future .
in 2008 , the second phase of the emissions trade , which continues until 2012 , is set to begin .
in order to meet the kyoto targets , the european commission has mandated a much lower number of emission certificates be issued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry needs more encouragement to cut emissions " from 2008 to 2012 , we will fulfill four kyoto percent , " helfferich predicted and referred to dozens of eu projects concerning climate protection as well as the emissions trade , which she said would then work " significantly better . " current prices for emissions certificates wo n't have an effect on their cost in the future , since the price will be recalculated in 2008 .
however , their greatly reduced number has already had an influence on today 's market : " futures , " that is , options on certificates that will be traded in the future , already cost between 16 and 17 euros per ton . but critics say the eu should alter the plans for the second phase of the emissions trade .
instead of issuing the licenses to pollute largely for free in 2008 , industry should have to buy them from the start . " companies do n't receive machines for free , " pointed out nantke of germany 's environmental agency . torsten schäfer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite climate concerns , germany plans coal power plants european union states agreed earlier this month on a binding 20 percent cut in co2 emissions by 2020 .

even the emissions trade , once held up as a model to be emulated , is floundering . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas focused his ire on australia at the start of a meeting of the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- this week .
he called on the world 's second-biggest producer of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- to finally ratify the kyoto protocol , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are primarily responsible for global warming . australian prime minister john howard 's response was brusque : " you 've got the spokesman for a group of countries lecturing us about not having signed kyoto , yet the great bulk of the countries on whose behalf he speaks are falling well behind their kyoto targets and are doing less well than australia in meeting them , " he told australian broadcasting corporation radio . " our answer to the spokesman for the european union is look to your own affairs , get your countries complying with the targets you 've proclaimed , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas ' house could be in better shape , too dimas ' spokeswoman , barbara helfferich , was keen to rebuff the criticism .
" we said what needed to be said .
and the eu will in any case comply with its kyoto targets , " she told dw-world.de. but howard had a point .
the eu is far from attaining the targets it agreed to by ratifying the kyoto protocol .
the 15 older eu states are obliged to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions by eight percent by 2012 in comparison to 1990 levels , while the newer members of the bloc agreed to different targets .
but it was recently revealed that the eu had only achieved 1.6 percent by 2005 .
in 2006 , the countries carbon dioxide emissions actually increased by 1.5 percent above the previous year 's level .
flawed emissions trade critics lay some of the blame on the eu 's emissions trade , which allows companies to pollute as long as they have the necessary certificates , which can be traded .
the idea was that businesses would invest in environmentally friendly technologies to cut emissions if their only other option was to pay for a limited number of expensive licenses to pollute . but the emissions trade has so far failed to bring about a decrease in co2 pollution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is cheap at european energy exchanges the eu issued too many certificates , according to hans-jürgen nantke , head of the emissions trade office at germany 's federal environmental agency .
" that 's why the prices hit rock bottom , " he said . a ton of co2 cost nearly 30 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- in spring 2006 at the european energy exchange in leipzig .
today the price stands at less than one euro .
buying the right to pollute has become so cheap because the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , made mistakes when it estimated co2 emissions .
in 2006 , europe 's industries were able to emit 50 million tons more co2 than they ought to have . since the prices for certificates were so cheap , businesses did n't necessarily see the need to invest in new technologies that would produce fewer emissions . " when prices were higher , that happened , " said verena graichen , an expert on environmental protection at the institute for applied ecology , a german think tank . german power companies , for example , had shut down old lignite coal power plants in favor of more environmentally friendly anthracite coal plants although the latter were more expensive to run , she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.04.2007 greens tread fine line with stance on g8 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac protesters are usually at hand where powerful agencies meet the greens long ago shed their outsider status in german politics .
but by distancing itself from some anti-globalization activists , the party risks losing its left-wing adherents , some say . when it comes to the g8 summit , to be held this summer in the german resort of heiligendamm , the green party ’ s curse may be the far-left ’ s blessing . the ecology-based greens are not players in the negotiations , but with their increasingly mainstream status - they were part of the ruling coalition in germany between 1998 and 2005 - they appear to be shying away from the noisy and disruptive anti-globalization movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new party theleft -lrb- dielinke . -rrb- aims to profit from the greens ' slide to center according to an article in germany ’ s welt online , some 300 groups have plans to stage opposition demonstrations to the june 5 summit under the motto “ a different world is possible . ”
these range from the appd -lrb- anarchic pogo party of germany -rrb- to the better-known groups like attac and greenpeace .
an initiative called “ paula ” has promised a “ well aimed violent demonstration ” in a town nearby heiligendamm .
for the greens , however , the overtly anti-capitalist actions pose a problem , leaving them to walk a fine line between being part of the policymaking establishment and alienating their left-wing membership .
signature denied when the greens were in a coalition government with gerhard schröder ’ s spd , a lot of the party ’ s left-leaning adherents felt obligated to make uncomfortable compromises .
now , the party risks losing these voters – peace activists , anti-nuclear activists , members of the women ’ s movement , for example – to an increasingly active german far left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roth , right , with anti-globalism protester , refused to sign the document meanwhile , greens chairwoman claudia roth recently refused to sign a letter calling for demonstrations against the summit , written by opponents of the group of eight industrialized nations .
she cited “ a serious difference of opinion on key sections ” of the letter , welt online said . roth said the letter ’ s call to demonstrate was not as harmless as depicted .
she especially opposed the part where it said the g8 was a “ precursor to a world-order based on war . ” attac , possibly the best known of the opposition groups expected to demonstrate against the g8 , said it had roth ’ s stance was " disappointing .

" egypt 's sunken treasures , " an exhibition of artifacts unearthed during goddio 's excavations , went on show in bonn on thursday . dw-world.de : after thousands of excursions to sunken cities and shipwrecks around the world , your living room must look like an adventurous place . franck goddio : well , it 's not an adventure .
i would say it 's a job , and we are doing this job very professionally .
we plan each mission carefully and train our staff for that , and before starting , there is a lot of paperwork that has to be done . before you started to search for sunken treasures , you studied mathematics and worked as a financial consultant .
how does that fit with archaeology ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goddio devoted himself to marine archeology in the 1980s as a matter of fact , it does help .
after 10 years in finance , i decided to take a one-year break .
i looked at what at the time has been done in underwater archaeology , and i realized that there was a need for a privately funded independent institute that could work for governments and other institutions . you opened such an institute for underwater archaeology in paris in 1985 .
were you always sure that it would become a success story ? maybe i was a little naive at the beginning .
when i started to search for the sunken parts of alexandria in 1984 the geophysical instruments that you need for missions like that did n't exist . but you did find ancient alexandria in the end . but for alexandria , it took years and years because we had to perform a four-year geophysical survey before we even had a detailed map that showed that there was something under the sediment .
it 's a bit like modern surgery .
you use the scanner , and then afterwards , when you know where to search , you do the operation at the right place . are you still thrilled by your work ? it 's very hard work because for months and months you only sail along straight lines in the harbor , towing instruments and registering data in order to create an electronic map .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of artifacts are on show in bonn it seems that your work has little in common with an indiana jones adventure . not at all , on the contrary i would say .
my job is to prevent adventure . when you take artifacts from the ancient port of alexandria , you put them in different colored baskets .
does the color mean something ? the color is in fact no criteria , but you need these baskets in order to desalinate the artifacts .
when you raise it from the sea , where the object has been for some 2,000 years , you have to remove the salt .
for a small artifact , this can take a few days .
for a very big artefact , like the statue of hapi -lrb- editor 's note : a more than five-meter or 16-feet high statue -rrb- , we needed 18 months to remove the salt . what happens if you do n't do that ? the stone will disintegrate .

what kind of feeling should the exhibition evoke in visitors ? we found all the artifacts right next to each other .
they were on the same place for thousands of years and supplemented each other , they were literally living together .

other baltic sea states , including finland , denmark and estonia , also worry that the construction work could stir up toxic material on the seabed and even disturb unexploded chemical weapons left over from world war two . nord stream , the russian-german consortium building the pipeline , seeks to alleviate these concerns and " has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " according to a statement . rerouting the pipeline nord stream first proposed building the pipeline across the gulf of finland and down the middle of the baltic sea , passing just below the swedish island of gotland .
but following lengthy consultations with affected baltic sea states , the consortium is now looking into three alternate routes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , is on nord stream 's board " further optimization " of the route might be necessary in the gulf of finland , nord stream said , where the pipeline could be built along a more southern route near of estonia .
other options include laying the pipeline 10 kilometers further south of gotland , bypassing swedish wildlife reserves , or running it along a route north of the danish island of bornholm . nord stream , which appointed former german chancellor gerhard schröder to its executive board shortly after he left office , says it is " determined to make sure that the new pipeline meets high environmental standards . " the controversial pipeline has been a hard sell for nord stream , and the success of this five-billion-euro project hinges on the approval of finland , sweden and denmark . a hard sell with high stakes in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected . nord stream is expected to submit an extensive eia in the early autumn of 2007 , and hopes to begin construction of the pipeline by 2008 , following final approval of the impact assessment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 27.5 billion cubic meters of russian gas could be flowing into gemany in 2010 the consortium has also submitted reports to poland , latvia , lithuania and estonia .
polish officials have expressed fears that the project could threaten poland ’ s energy security , as the new pipeline would allow russia to sell natural gas to western europe without the need for polish transit lines . in april last year , polish defense minister radoslaw sikorski even went so far as to compare the project to the hitler-stalin pact of 1939 , which divided poland among russia and germany .
but poland has no veto power over the project . sweden has also cited security concerns : officials there have expressed fears that an offshore platform near the swedish coast could be used as a venue for russian intelligence gathering . baltic sea states are also uneasy about russia ’ s plans to increase its military presence in the baltic sea , ostensibly to protect the project and assist in the removal of unexploded ordnance from the seabed . satisfying european energy needs nord stream is a russian-german joint venture created solely for the construction of the baltic sea pipeline .
russian energy giant gazprom own a majority stake in the consortium , and germany ’ s e.on ruhrgas and wintershall hold 24.5 percent shares each . if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .

the money would be used to fund environmental development . tanja gönner , the conservative environment minister in the southern german state of baden-württemberg , told german daily berliner zeitung on thursday that the measure “ would enable us to finance climate protection activities at home or in developing countries . ” the fee should not exceed “ the high single-digit or low double-digit bracket , ” gönner told the paper . the proposal is part of an ongoing debate on how to call the flight industry to account for its contribution to global warming . boom in discount airlines last month german economics minster michael glos said aircraft were responsible for 1.5 percent of climate-damaging emissions worldwide .

" sophisticated political theater , " " perfect british diplomacy , " - or both ?
the international press reacted to the release , after 13 days ' captivity , of 15 british sailors held hostage in iran . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad ’ s move to call the hostage release a “ gift ” to the british people was nothing less than a “ sophisticated piece of political theatre , in which the president turned what had become a diplomatic disaster for iran into something of a personal victory , ” uk daily the guardian wrote . but just how effective was the “ pardon ” in the end ? “ ultimately , the larger issue is the effect of all this on the wider stage , ” the paper mused .
“ surely the real lesson to draw from yesterday ’ s theatre is that quiet diplomacy does work and that it can work in the future . ” summing up , the paper argued : “ there is no substitute for direct negotiation , especially with a revolutionary islamic regime in iran , for whom the popularly held grievance about past american and british interference in the gulf is as important as the issue in hand . ” “ iran ’ s president is the uncrowned king of tragicomic political theater , ” agreed the basler zeitung of basel , switzerland .
“ the way he announced the freeing of the 15 captive british sailors was as grotesque as it was masterful . … so , did iran cave in to the angry reactions of the international community ?
were they scared of a threatening liberation action by the british and americans ?
not a chance .
from outside , at least , it looks like iran once again played a perfect hand , and made its political point . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad announced the release at a press conference in tehran but in rome , the daily il messaggero wondered what london had to agree to in order to negotiation the sailors ’ release : “ the release of the the british sailors will no doubt relax relations between britain and tehran . … we don ’ t know yet what quid pro quo the government in london accepted , but it is sure that there was one .
and it wouldn ’ t be surprising if there were a prisoner exchange .
but that would only happen at such time when london and washington could claim they are sticking to their stated principle of not accepting a quid pro quo , ” the paper wrote . “ in any case , there is no reason to be shocked : there have always been prisoner exchanges , whether of soldiers or of journalists . ” dutch newspaper de volkskrant also mulled what , exactly , went on behind the scenes of negotiations . “ in the coming days we will doubtless find out the basics of what went on between london and tehran when it came to arranging for the release of the british hostages , ” de volkskrant wrote .
“ but it is already clear that the affair can not be seen without making a connection to the kidnapping of an iranian diplomat and the arrest of five iranian fighters in iraq .
on tuesday , it was announced that the diplomat will be released , and an iranian consul can visit the fighters .
it is clear that the whole affair was not simply about iran ’ s territorial integrity , or of pardons or shows of might .
it was an exchange . ” bulgaria ’ s monitor newspaper saw the dealings as a major coup for the uk on the world political stage .
“ there is no doubt the sailors have perfect british diplomacy to thank ” for their release , the paper wrote .
“ it was no secret that london started backstage negotiations two or three days ago .
clearly , the brits could give all of humanity a break if they could quickly negotiate between tehran and washinton , like they did in the case of the sailors . ” finally , austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten said the risk of escalation was too big in the situation - and everyone involved knew it . “ a new ahmadinedschad ; the heavily embattled iranian president can celebrate an urgently needed victory .

the international press reacted to the release , after 13 days ' captivity , of 15 british sailors held hostage in iran . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad ’ s move to call the hostage release a “ gift ” to the british people was nothing less than a “ sophisticated piece of political theatre , in which the president turned what had become a diplomatic disaster for iran into something of a personal victory , ” uk daily the guardian wrote . but just how effective was the “ pardon ” in the end ? “ ultimately , the larger issue is the effect of all this on the wider stage , ” the paper mused .
“ surely the real lesson to draw from yesterday ’ s theatre is that quiet diplomacy does work and that it can work in the future . ” summing up , the paper argued : “ there is no substitute for direct negotiation , especially with a revolutionary islamic regime in iran , for whom the popularly held grievance about past american and british interference in the gulf is as important as the issue in hand . ” “ iran ’ s president is the uncrowned king of tragicomic political theater , ” agreed the basler zeitung of basel , switzerland .
“ the way he announced the freeing of the 15 captive british sailors was as grotesque as it was masterful . … so , did iran cave in to the angry reactions of the international community ?
were they scared of a threatening liberation action by the british and americans ?
not a chance .
from outside , at least , it looks like iran once again played a perfect hand , and made its political point . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad announced the release at a press conference in tehran but in rome , the daily il messaggero wondered what london had to agree to in order to negotiation the sailors ’ release : “ the release of the the british sailors will no doubt relax relations between britain and tehran . … we don ’ t know yet what quid pro quo the government in london accepted , but it is sure that there was one .
and it wouldn ’ t be surprising if there were a prisoner exchange .
but that would only happen at such time when london and washington could claim they are sticking to their stated principle of not accepting a quid pro quo , ” the paper wrote . “ in any case , there is no reason to be shocked : there have always been prisoner exchanges , whether of soldiers or of journalists . ” dutch newspaper de volkskrant also mulled what , exactly , went on behind the scenes of negotiations . “ in the coming days we will doubtless find out the basics of what went on between london and tehran when it came to arranging for the release of the british hostages , ” de volkskrant wrote .
“ but it is already clear that the affair can not be seen without making a connection to the kidnapping of an iranian diplomat and the arrest of five iranian fighters in iraq .
on tuesday , it was announced that the diplomat will be released , and an iranian consul can visit the fighters .
it is clear that the whole affair was not simply about iran ’ s territorial integrity , or of pardons or shows of might .
it was an exchange . ” bulgaria ’ s monitor newspaper saw the dealings as a major coup for the uk on the world political stage .
“ there is no doubt the sailors have perfect british diplomacy to thank ” for their release , the paper wrote .

but the proposal has been met with scorn . the european commission and the 78-nation so-called acp group - mostly former european colonies - are struggling to make progress to conclude new trade agreements by the end of the year when a current preferential market access accord is due to expire . under the european union 's new offer , all quotas and tariffs on acp goods would be lifted immediately once a deal was signed , with the exception of rice and sugar .
97 percent of eu imports from acp nations are already tariff-free or are taxed only at very low levels while 40 of the poorest countries already enjoy free access to eu markets . acp nations include nigeria , kenya , cuba and east timor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union trade commissioner peter mandelson " trade and development for acp countries is about much more than just access to the european market , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said .
" but by removing all remaining tariffs and quotas for all african , caribbean and pacific countries we will create the best possible opportunities for these economies , " he added . offer slammed as " derisory " in reaction , the negotiator for the caribbean acp countries slammed the offer owing to the exceptions on rice and sugar , describing it as " derisory " and warning it could cause more harm than good . " the european commission offer threatens to poison the negotiating climate , especially at a time when both sides are making strides -lrb- on -rrb- flexibilities , " said junior lodge .
" we therefore hope that good sense will prevail and the european commission will offer all acp regions a more constructive and attractive market access offer , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sugar exports from acp nations are n't included in the eu offer levies on sugar would be phased out by 2015 while a reform in subsidies for eu sugar farmers is carried out and a firm date has not yet been set for rice , the commission said . the offer did not cover south africa , which has a bilateral trade agreement with the eu and which the commission said produces " a number of globally competitive products . " the acp group , made up mostly of former european colonies , has benefited from preferential access to eu markets since the signing of the lome accord in 1975 . but other equally poor countries , mostly in latin america , have contested the acp 's preferential treatment and have won backing from the world trade organisation . in 2001 , the world trade referee gave the eu until the end of this year to come up with a new framework that would be more compatible with international rules of commerce . deadline for talks nears after their wto defeat , the europeans and the acp opened talks in 2002 to reach new so-called economic partnership agreements which are being conducted by regions - eastern , central and southern africa , the caribbean and the pacific . but little progress has been made , and pressure is building as the year-end deadline approaches .
a number of development pressure groups , including oxfam and action aid , consider the deadline to be unrealistic and have called for it to be pushed back . the european commission had promised that it would offer greater market access as part of the negotiations , which some development pressure groups have accused the eu of using to gain greater access to acp markets . brussels said the new offer was not conditional on acp countries matching the eu in tearing down tariff and quota barriers and that any greater market access they would have to provide to meet wto rules could be phased in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the eu is trying to gain greater access to markets in the developing world british pro-development pressure group oxfam said the offer was the minimum the commission could do and that it should not be used to strong-arm acp countries into an agreement by the end of the year .

" egypt 's sunken treasures , " an exhibition of artifacts unearthed during goddio 's excavations , went on show in bonn on thursday . dw-world.de : after thousands of excursions to sunken cities and shipwrecks around the world , your living room must look like an adventurous place . franck goddio : well , it 's not an adventure .
i would say it 's a job , and we are doing this job very professionally .
we plan each mission carefully and train our staff for that , and before starting , there is a lot of paperwork that has to be done . before you started to search for sunken treasures , you studied mathematics and worked as a financial consultant .
how does that fit with archaeology ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goddio devoted himself to marine archeology in the 1980s as a matter of fact , it does help .
after 10 years in finance , i decided to take a one-year break .
i looked at what at the time has been done in underwater archaeology , and i realized that there was a need for a privately funded independent institute that could work for governments and other institutions . you opened such an institute for underwater archaeology in paris in 1985 .
were you always sure that it would become a success story ? maybe i was a little naive at the beginning .
when i started to search for the sunken parts of alexandria in 1984 the geophysical instruments that you need for missions like that did n't exist . but you did find ancient alexandria in the end . but for alexandria , it took years and years because we had to perform a four-year geophysical survey before we even had a detailed map that showed that there was something under the sediment .
it 's a bit like modern surgery .
you use the scanner , and then afterwards , when you know where to search , you do the operation at the right place . are you still thrilled by your work ? it 's very hard work because for months and months you only sail along straight lines in the harbor , towing instruments and registering data in order to create an electronic map .
when you start to see the map , you get this feeling that there is something down there .
and only then does it become thrilling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of artifacts are on show in bonn it seems that your work has little in common with an indiana jones adventure . not at all , on the contrary i would say .
my job is to prevent adventure . when you take artifacts from the ancient port of alexandria , you put them in different colored baskets .
does the color mean something ? the color is in fact no criteria , but you need these baskets in order to desalinate the artifacts .
when you raise it from the sea , where the object has been for some 2,000 years , you have to remove the salt .
for a small artifact , this can take a few days .
for a very big artefact , like the statue of hapi -lrb- editor 's note : a more than five-meter or 16-feet high statue -rrb- , we needed 18 months to remove the salt . what happens if you do n't do that ? the stone will disintegrate .
chemical reactions will make the stone weaker , until it finally disintegrates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this stele of the ptolemy is also part of the exhibition the exhibition in bonn is showing 500 artifacts , most of them from alexandria .
what kind of feeling should the exhibition evoke in visitors ? we found all the artifacts right next to each other .
they were on the same place for thousands of years and supplemented each other , they were literally living together .
in the exhibition you can see that they speak to each other . who owns the artifacts ? they belong to egypt of course .
all artifacts that you see in the exhibit in bonn will one day end up in a museum which will be built for them - in alexandria . " egypt 's sunken treasures " runs until jan .

but the proposal has been met with scorn . the european commission and the 78-nation so-called acp group - mostly former european colonies - are struggling to make progress to conclude new trade agreements by the end of the year when a current preferential market access accord is due to expire . under the european union 's new offer , all quotas and tariffs on acp goods would be lifted immediately once a deal was signed , with the exception of rice and sugar .
97 percent of eu imports from acp nations are already tariff-free or are taxed only at very low levels while 40 of the poorest countries already enjoy free access to eu markets . acp nations include nigeria , kenya , cuba and east timor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union trade commissioner peter mandelson " trade and development for acp countries is about much more than just access to the european market , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said .
" but by removing all remaining tariffs and quotas for all african , caribbean and pacific countries we will create the best possible opportunities for these economies , " he added . offer slammed as " derisory " in reaction , the negotiator for the caribbean acp countries slammed the offer owing to the exceptions on rice and sugar , describing it as " derisory " and warning it could cause more harm than good . " the european commission offer threatens to poison the negotiating climate , especially at a time when both sides are making strides -lrb- on -rrb- flexibilities , " said junior lodge .
" we therefore hope that good sense will prevail and the european commission will offer all acp regions a more constructive and attractive market access offer , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sugar exports from acp nations are n't included in the eu offer levies on sugar would be phased out by 2015 while a reform in subsidies for eu sugar farmers is carried out and a firm date has not yet been set for rice , the commission said . the offer did not cover south africa , which has a bilateral trade agreement with the eu and which the commission said produces " a number of globally competitive products . " the acp group , made up mostly of former european colonies , has benefited from preferential access to eu markets since the signing of the lome accord in 1975 . but other equally poor countries , mostly in latin america , have contested the acp 's preferential treatment and have won backing from the world trade organisation . in 2001 , the world trade referee gave the eu until the end of this year to come up with a new framework that would be more compatible with international rules of commerce . deadline for talks nears after their wto defeat , the europeans and the acp opened talks in 2002 to reach new so-called economic partnership agreements which are being conducted by regions - eastern , central and southern africa , the caribbean and the pacific . but little progress has been made , and pressure is building as the year-end deadline approaches .
a number of development pressure groups , including oxfam and action aid , consider the deadline to be unrealistic and have called for it to be pushed back . the european commission had promised that it would offer greater market access as part of the negotiations , which some development pressure groups have accused the eu of using to gain greater access to acp markets . brussels said the new offer was not conditional on acp countries matching the eu in tearing down tariff and quota barriers and that any greater market access they would have to provide to meet wto rules could be phased in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the eu is trying to gain greater access to markets in the developing world british pro-development pressure group oxfam said the offer was the minimum the commission could do and that it should not be used to strong-arm acp countries into an agreement by the end of the year . " developing countries look set to be asked to open their markets dramatically , which could have seriously negative implications for poor peoples ' livelihoods and future economic development , " said oxfam 's brussels head luis morago . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants new deal with african , caribbean , pacific partners the european union said it wants to complete new trade agreements with 78 african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- countries by the end of the year despite opposition from developing countries .

but by distancing itself from some anti-globalization activists , the party risks losing its left-wing adherents , some say . when it comes to the g8 summit , to be held this summer in the german resort of heiligendamm , the green party ’ s curse may be the far-left ’ s blessing . the ecology-based greens are not players in the negotiations , but with their increasingly mainstream status - they were part of the ruling coalition in germany between 1998 and 2005 - they appear to be shying away from the noisy and disruptive anti-globalization movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new party theleft -lrb- dielinke . -rrb- aims to profit from the greens ' slide to center according to an article in germany ’ s welt online , some 300 groups have plans to stage opposition demonstrations to the june 5 summit under the motto “ a different world is possible . ”
these range from the appd -lrb- anarchic pogo party of germany -rrb- to the better-known groups like attac and greenpeace .
an initiative called “ paula ” has promised a “ well aimed violent demonstration ” in a town nearby heiligendamm .
for the greens , however , the overtly anti-capitalist actions pose a problem , leaving them to walk a fine line between being part of the policymaking establishment and alienating their left-wing membership .
signature denied when the greens were in a coalition government with gerhard schröder ’ s spd , a lot of the party ’ s left-leaning adherents felt obligated to make uncomfortable compromises .
now , the party risks losing these voters – peace activists , anti-nuclear activists , members of the women ’ s movement , for example – to an increasingly active german far left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roth , right , with anti-globalism protester , refused to sign the document meanwhile , greens chairwoman claudia roth recently refused to sign a letter calling for demonstrations against the summit , written by opponents of the group of eight industrialized nations .
she cited “ a serious difference of opinion on key sections ” of the letter , welt online said . roth said the letter ’ s call to demonstrate was not as harmless as depicted .
she especially opposed the part where it said the g8 was a “ precursor to a world-order based on war . ” attac , possibly the best known of the opposition groups expected to demonstrate against the g8 , said it had roth ’ s stance was " disappointing . " ' one leg in the government ' frauke distelrath , a speaker for the group , told the süddeutsche zeitung that the greens apparently " still had one leg in the government , " and said she could not otherwise think of a reason why they would refuse to sign the call-to-demonstrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin claims there is no split between greens and other protesters " on the one hand the greens are looking to get back in touch with the social movement .
on the other hand , they are sticking to their identity as a ruling party .
they won ’ t even sign on to our harmless letter , ” she said . she noted that the fact that the green party 's youth organization and green parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele had , indeed , signed the plea , made it clear that the green party was internally at odds . trittin denies break roth ’ s party colleague jürgen trittin , germany 's former environment minister , told welt online that he saw no serious break between the greens and other g8 opponents . “ there is 90 percent agreement between us and most other activists , ” he said . the greens plan to use the g8 summit as a forum to demand action on climate protection , ending poverty , and dismantling trade barriers – just like other activists , trittin said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security measures are being made for the g8 summit in heiligendamm he denied that the greens are worried about advances from the far left , which he characterized as being " too internally at odds to pose a danger to us . " meanwhile , the new far-left party , theleft , a grouping of the former communist party of east germany and many disaffected left-wing social democrats , does appear eager to take advantage of the dispute between the greens and the anti-globalization forces .
their parliamentary party chiefs , gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , signed the document - despite their own misgivings about certain passages . since getting seats in the german parliament at the end of 2005 , theleft has established a " contact point for extra-parliamentary movements , " aimed at trying to create more dialog with groups like attac . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 to offer micro-credit help , step up aids funding for africa development ministers from the g8 undertook in berlin on tuesday to set up micro-credit facilities for african nations with the help of the world bank and increase funds for the fight against aids .

but the proposal has been met with scorn . the european commission and the 78-nation so-called acp group - mostly former european colonies - are struggling to make progress to conclude new trade agreements by the end of the year when a current preferential market access accord is due to expire . under the european union 's new offer , all quotas and tariffs on acp goods would be lifted immediately once a deal was signed , with the exception of rice and sugar .
97 percent of eu imports from acp nations are already tariff-free or are taxed only at very low levels while 40 of the poorest countries already enjoy free access to eu markets . acp nations include nigeria , kenya , cuba and east timor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union trade commissioner peter mandelson " trade and development for acp countries is about much more than just access to the european market , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said .
" but by removing all remaining tariffs and quotas for all african , caribbean and pacific countries we will create the best possible opportunities for these economies , " he added . offer slammed as " derisory " in reaction , the negotiator for the caribbean acp countries slammed the offer owing to the exceptions on rice and sugar , describing it as " derisory " and warning it could cause more harm than good .

" the acp group , made up mostly of former european colonies , has benefited from preferential access to eu markets since the signing of the lome accord in 1975 . but other equally poor countries , mostly in latin america , have contested the acp 's preferential treatment and have won backing from the world trade organisation . in 2001 , the world trade referee gave the eu until the end of this year to come up with a new framework that would be more compatible with international rules of commerce . deadline for talks nears after their wto defeat , the europeans and the acp opened talks in 2002 to reach new so-called economic partnership agreements which are being conducted by regions - eastern , central and southern africa , the caribbean and the pacific . but little progress has been made , and pressure is building as the year-end deadline approaches .
a number of development pressure groups , including oxfam and action aid , consider the deadline to be unrealistic and have called for it to be pushed back . the european commission had promised that it would offer greater market access as part of the negotiations , which some development pressure groups have accused the eu of using to gain greater access to acp markets . brussels said the new offer was not conditional on acp countries matching the eu in tearing down tariff and quota barriers and that any greater market access they would have to provide to meet wto rules could be phased in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the eu is trying to gain greater access to markets in the developing world british pro-development pressure group oxfam said the offer was the minimum the commission could do and that it should not be used to strong-arm acp countries into an agreement by the end of the year .

" sophisticated political theater , " " perfect british diplomacy , " - or both ?
the international press reacted to the release , after 13 days ' captivity , of 15 british sailors held hostage in iran . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad ’ s move to call the hostage release a “ gift ” to the british people was nothing less than a “ sophisticated piece of political theatre , in which the president turned what had become a diplomatic disaster for iran into something of a personal victory , ” uk daily the guardian wrote . but just how effective was the “ pardon ” in the end ? “ ultimately , the larger issue is the effect of all this on the wider stage , ” the paper mused .
“ surely the real lesson to draw from yesterday ’ s theatre is that quiet diplomacy does work and that it can work in the future . ” summing up , the paper argued : “ there is no substitute for direct negotiation , especially with a revolutionary islamic regime in iran , for whom the popularly held grievance about past american and british interference in the gulf is as important as the issue in hand . ” “ iran ’ s president is the uncrowned king of tragicomic political theater , ” agreed the basler zeitung of basel , switzerland .
“ the way he announced the freeing of the 15 captive british sailors was as grotesque as it was masterful . … so , did iran cave in to the angry reactions of the international community ?
were they scared of a threatening liberation action by the british and americans ?
not a chance .
from outside , at least , it looks like iran once again played a perfect hand , and made its political point . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad announced the release at a press conference in tehran but in rome , the daily il messaggero wondered what london had to agree to in order to negotiation the sailors ’ release : “ the release of the the british sailors will no doubt relax relations between britain and tehran . … we don ’ t know yet what quid pro quo the government in london accepted , but it is sure that there was one .
and it wouldn ’ t be surprising if there were a prisoner exchange .
but that would only happen at such time when london and washington could claim they are sticking to their stated principle of not accepting a quid pro quo , ” the paper wrote . “ in any case , there is no reason to be shocked : there have always been prisoner exchanges , whether of soldiers or of journalists . ” dutch newspaper de volkskrant also mulled what , exactly , went on behind the scenes of negotiations . “ in the coming days we will doubtless find out the basics of what went on between london and tehran when it came to arranging for the release of the british hostages , ” de volkskrant wrote .
“ but it is already clear that the affair can not be seen without making a connection to the kidnapping of an iranian diplomat and the arrest of five iranian fighters in iraq .
on tuesday , it was announced that the diplomat will be released , and an iranian consul can visit the fighters .
it is clear that the whole affair was not simply about iran ’ s territorial integrity , or of pardons or shows of might .
it was an exchange . ” bulgaria ’ s monitor newspaper saw the dealings as a major coup for the uk on the world political stage .
“ there is no doubt the sailors have perfect british diplomacy to thank ” for their release , the paper wrote .
“ it was no secret that london started backstage negotiations two or three days ago .
clearly , the brits could give all of humanity a break if they could quickly negotiate between tehran and washinton , like they did in the case of the sailors . ” finally , austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten said the risk of escalation was too big in the situation - and everyone involved knew it . “ a new ahmadinedschad ; the heavily embattled iranian president can celebrate an urgently needed victory .
both sides managed to reach their goals , including the release of iranian hardliners captured by the british , without any loss of face .
uk premier tony blair did not need to apologize for supposed border violations , nor did the regime in tehran need to tone down its loud threats .
for both parties , the risk of escalation appeared too great .
it has been a very calming experience for the rest of the world , ” the paper wrote . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes iran move also a signal on nuclear issue german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday he hoped tehran 's decision to free 15 british sailors was a signal iran was ready to compromise on other matters such as its nuclear program .

the money would be used to fund environmental development . tanja gönner , the conservative environment minister in the southern german state of baden-württemberg , told german daily berliner zeitung on thursday that the measure “ would enable us to finance climate protection activities at home or in developing countries . ” the fee should not exceed “ the high single-digit or low double-digit bracket , ” gönner told the paper . the proposal is part of an ongoing debate on how to call the flight industry to account for its contribution to global warming . boom in discount airlines last month german economics minster michael glos said aircraft were responsible for 1.5 percent of climate-damaging emissions worldwide .
the european union said aviation makes up 3 percent of direct greenhouse gas emissions , though the estimates do not factor in indirect warming effects . previously , politicians had suggested raising a europe-wide tax on kerosene , the high-powered fuel used in aircraft engines .
but under pressure from industry leaders , that proposal has made little headway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boom in budget airlines has hugely increased air traffic february , baden-württemberg ’ s general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , thomas strobl , suggested an alternative .
he joined calls from his social democratic and green counterparts to levy a flat fee on the price of airline tickets . strobl said that “ flying is much too cheap compared to taking the train , ” and that an additional ten euros is within any traveller ’ s budget .
a boom in low-fare airlines has greatly increased the amount of air traffic in europe in recent years .
the rail industry is heavily subsidized in most european countries , while air travel is not . airlines resist proposal but the flat-tax proposal is bound to encounter resistance from the airline industry .
the european regions airline association represents over 220 flight-related companies in europe , and spokeswoman lesley shepherd responded with a “ clear ‘ no ’ ” to the idea . “ we are not in favour of environmental taxes - they do not benefit the environment , ” she said .
she called strobl ’ s proposal a “ misconception . ” lesley suggested that government revenues from environmental taxes are not always used for environmental research .
she said “ the real reason -lrb- for the fee -rrb- is to stop people from flying . ” indeed , the debate began late last year when politicians called on germans to avoid jetting off to far-flung destinations and holiday at home instead .
the latest proposal was timed to coincide with the publication of the second united nations report on climate change , due to appear on friday . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany seeks emerging economies ' support on climate deal germany is to ask for the support of emerging economies for greater climate protection and push for a long-term anti-global warming agreement at a meeting of leading industrial nations ' environment ministers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.04.2007 eu 's environmental policy flounders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has a long way to go to reach its co2 emissions targets as experts in brussels wrangle over the wording of a un report on the impact of global warming , the eu 's own climate policy is stagnating .
even the emissions trade , once held up as a model to be emulated , is floundering . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas focused his ire on australia at the start of a meeting of the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- this week .
he called on the world 's second-biggest producer of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- to finally ratify the kyoto protocol , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are primarily responsible for global warming . australian prime minister john howard 's response was brusque : " you 've got the spokesman for a group of countries lecturing us about not having signed kyoto , yet the great bulk of the countries on whose behalf he speaks are falling well behind their kyoto targets and are doing less well than australia in meeting them , " he told australian broadcasting corporation radio . " our answer to the spokesman for the european union is look to your own affairs , get your countries complying with the targets you 've proclaimed , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas ' house could be in better shape , too dimas ' spokeswoman , barbara helfferich , was keen to rebuff the criticism .
" we said what needed to be said .
and the eu will in any case comply with its kyoto targets , " she told dw-world.de. but howard had a point .
the eu is far from attaining the targets it agreed to by ratifying the kyoto protocol .
the 15 older eu states are obliged to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions by eight percent by 2012 in comparison to 1990 levels , while the newer members of the bloc agreed to different targets .
but it was recently revealed that the eu had only achieved 1.6 percent by 2005 .
in 2006 , the countries carbon dioxide emissions actually increased by 1.5 percent above the previous year 's level .
flawed emissions trade critics lay some of the blame on the eu 's emissions trade , which allows companies to pollute as long as they have the necessary certificates , which can be traded .
the idea was that businesses would invest in environmentally friendly technologies to cut emissions if their only other option was to pay for a limited number of expensive licenses to pollute . but the emissions trade has so far failed to bring about a decrease in co2 pollution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is cheap at european energy exchanges the eu issued too many certificates , according to hans-jürgen nantke , head of the emissions trade office at germany 's federal environmental agency .
" that 's why the prices hit rock bottom , " he said . a ton of co2 cost nearly 30 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- in spring 2006 at the european energy exchange in leipzig .
today the price stands at less than one euro .
buying the right to pollute has become so cheap because the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , made mistakes when it estimated co2 emissions .
in 2006 , europe 's industries were able to emit 50 million tons more co2 than they ought to have . since the prices for certificates were so cheap , businesses did n't necessarily see the need to invest in new technologies that would produce fewer emissions . " when prices were higher , that happened , " said verena graichen , an expert on environmental protection at the institute for applied ecology , a german think tank . german power companies , for example , had shut down old lignite coal power plants in favor of more environmentally friendly anthracite coal plants although the latter were more expensive to run , she said .
better the second time around ?
" unfortunately the emissions trade does n't work very well , but we ca n't change anything anymore , " conceded dimas ' spokeswoman helfferich .
instead , she suggested looking to the future .
in 2008 , the second phase of the emissions trade , which continues until 2012 , is set to begin .
in order to meet the kyoto targets , the european commission has mandated a much lower number of emission certificates be issued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry needs more encouragement to cut emissions " from 2008 to 2012 , we will fulfill four kyoto percent , " helfferich predicted and referred to dozens of eu projects concerning climate protection as well as the emissions trade , which she said would then work " significantly better . " current prices for emissions certificates wo n't have an effect on their cost in the future , since the price will be recalculated in 2008 .
however , their greatly reduced number has already had an influence on today 's market : " futures , " that is , options on certificates that will be traded in the future , already cost between 16 and 17 euros per ton . but critics say the eu should alter the plans for the second phase of the emissions trade .
instead of issuing the licenses to pollute largely for free in 2008 , industry should have to buy them from the start . " companies do n't receive machines for free , " pointed out nantke of germany 's environmental agency . torsten schäfer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite climate concerns , germany plans coal power plants european union states agreed earlier this month on a binding 20 percent cut in co2 emissions by 2020 .
yet over 20 coal-fired power plants - major producers of greenhouse gases - are planned for germany .
-lrb- 21.03.2007 -rrb- eu clinches climate deal , but hard work yet to come european union leaders clinched a wide-ranging climate change accord on friday but postponed the thorny task of setting mandatory renewable energy goals for each member country to meet .

even the emissions trade , once held up as a model to be emulated , is floundering . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas focused his ire on australia at the start of a meeting of the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- this week .
he called on the world 's second-biggest producer of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- to finally ratify the kyoto protocol , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are primarily responsible for global warming . australian prime minister john howard 's response was brusque : " you 've got the spokesman for a group of countries lecturing us about not having signed kyoto , yet the great bulk of the countries on whose behalf he speaks are falling well behind their kyoto targets and are doing less well than australia in meeting them , " he told australian broadcasting corporation radio . " our answer to the spokesman for the european union is look to your own affairs , get your countries complying with the targets you 've proclaimed , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas ' house could be in better shape , too dimas ' spokeswoman , barbara helfferich , was keen to rebuff the criticism .
" we said what needed to be said .
and the eu will in any case comply with its kyoto targets , " she told dw-world.de. but howard had a point .
the eu is far from attaining the targets it agreed to by ratifying the kyoto protocol .
the 15 older eu states are obliged to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions by eight percent by 2012 in comparison to 1990 levels , while the newer members of the bloc agreed to different targets .
but it was recently revealed that the eu had only achieved 1.6 percent by 2005 .
in 2006 , the countries carbon dioxide emissions actually increased by 1.5 percent above the previous year 's level .
flawed emissions trade critics lay some of the blame on the eu 's emissions trade , which allows companies to pollute as long as they have the necessary certificates , which can be traded .
the idea was that businesses would invest in environmentally friendly technologies to cut emissions if their only other option was to pay for a limited number of expensive licenses to pollute . but the emissions trade has so far failed to bring about a decrease in co2 pollution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is cheap at european energy exchanges the eu issued too many certificates , according to hans-jürgen nantke , head of the emissions trade office at germany 's federal environmental agency .
" that 's why the prices hit rock bottom , " he said . a ton of co2 cost nearly 30 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- in spring 2006 at the european energy exchange in leipzig .
today the price stands at less than one euro .
buying the right to pollute has become so cheap because the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , made mistakes when it estimated co2 emissions .
in 2006 , europe 's industries were able to emit 50 million tons more co2 than they ought to have . since the prices for certificates were so cheap , businesses did n't necessarily see the need to invest in new technologies that would produce fewer emissions . " when prices were higher , that happened , " said verena graichen , an expert on environmental protection at the institute for applied ecology , a german think tank . german power companies , for example , had shut down old lignite coal power plants in favor of more environmentally friendly anthracite coal plants although the latter were more expensive to run , she said .
better the second time around ?
" unfortunately the emissions trade does n't work very well , but we ca n't change anything anymore , " conceded dimas ' spokeswoman helfferich .
instead , she suggested looking to the future .
in 2008 , the second phase of the emissions trade , which continues until 2012 , is set to begin .
in order to meet the kyoto targets , the european commission has mandated a much lower number of emission certificates be issued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry needs more encouragement to cut emissions " from 2008 to 2012 , we will fulfill four kyoto percent , " helfferich predicted and referred to dozens of eu projects concerning climate protection as well as the emissions trade , which she said would then work " significantly better .

the money would be used to fund environmental development . tanja gönner , the conservative environment minister in the southern german state of baden-württemberg , told german daily berliner zeitung on thursday that the measure “ would enable us to finance climate protection activities at home or in developing countries . ” the fee should not exceed “ the high single-digit or low double-digit bracket , ” gönner told the paper . the proposal is part of an ongoing debate on how to call the flight industry to account for its contribution to global warming . boom in discount airlines last month german economics minster michael glos said aircraft were responsible for 1.5 percent of climate-damaging emissions worldwide .
the european union said aviation makes up 3 percent of direct greenhouse gas emissions , though the estimates do not factor in indirect warming effects . previously , politicians had suggested raising a europe-wide tax on kerosene , the high-powered fuel used in aircraft engines .
but under pressure from industry leaders , that proposal has made little headway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boom in budget airlines has hugely increased air traffic february , baden-württemberg ’ s general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , thomas strobl , suggested an alternative .
he joined calls from his social democratic and green counterparts to levy a flat fee on the price of airline tickets . strobl said that “ flying is much too cheap compared to taking the train , ” and that an additional ten euros is within any traveller ’ s budget .
a boom in low-fare airlines has greatly increased the amount of air traffic in europe in recent years .
the rail industry is heavily subsidized in most european countries , while air travel is not . airlines resist proposal but the flat-tax proposal is bound to encounter resistance from the airline industry .
the european regions airline association represents over 220 flight-related companies in europe , and spokeswoman lesley shepherd responded with a “ clear ‘ no ’ ” to the idea . “ we are not in favour of environmental taxes - they do not benefit the environment , ” she said .
she called strobl ’ s proposal a “ misconception . ” lesley suggested that government revenues from environmental taxes are not always used for environmental research .
she said “ the real reason -lrb- for the fee -rrb- is to stop people from flying . ” indeed , the debate began late last year when politicians called on germans to avoid jetting off to far-flung destinations and holiday at home instead .
the latest proposal was timed to coincide with the publication of the second united nations report on climate change , due to appear on friday . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany seeks emerging economies ' support on climate deal germany is to ask for the support of emerging economies for greater climate protection and push for a long-term anti-global warming agreement at a meeting of leading industrial nations ' environment ministers .

other baltic sea states , including finland , denmark and estonia , also worry that the construction work could stir up toxic material on the seabed and even disturb unexploded chemical weapons left over from world war two . nord stream , the russian-german consortium building the pipeline , seeks to alleviate these concerns and " has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " according to a statement . rerouting the pipeline nord stream first proposed building the pipeline across the gulf of finland and down the middle of the baltic sea , passing just below the swedish island of gotland .

other options include laying the pipeline 10 kilometers further south of gotland , bypassing swedish wildlife reserves , or running it along a route north of the danish island of bornholm . nord stream , which appointed former german chancellor gerhard schröder to its executive board shortly after he left office , says it is " determined to make sure that the new pipeline meets high environmental standards . " the controversial pipeline has been a hard sell for nord stream , and the success of this five-billion-euro project hinges on the approval of finland , sweden and denmark . a hard sell with high stakes in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected . nord stream is expected to submit an extensive eia in the early autumn of 2007 , and hopes to begin construction of the pipeline by 2008 , following final approval of the impact assessment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 27.5 billion cubic meters of russian gas could be flowing into gemany in 2010 the consortium has also submitted reports to poland , latvia , lithuania and estonia .

but poland has no veto power over the project . sweden has also cited security concerns : officials there have expressed fears that an offshore platform near the swedish coast could be used as a venue for russian intelligence gathering . baltic sea states are also uneasy about russia ’ s plans to increase its military presence in the baltic sea , ostensibly to protect the project and assist in the removal of unexploded ordnance from the seabed . satisfying european energy needs nord stream is a russian-german joint venture created solely for the construction of the baltic sea pipeline .
russian energy giant gazprom own a majority stake in the consortium , and germany ’ s e.on ruhrgas and wintershall hold 24.5 percent shares each . if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .

" egypt 's sunken treasures , " an exhibition of artifacts unearthed during goddio 's excavations , went on show in bonn on thursday . dw-world.de : after thousands of excursions to sunken cities and shipwrecks around the world , your living room must look like an adventurous place . franck goddio : well , it 's not an adventure .
i would say it 's a job , and we are doing this job very professionally .
we plan each mission carefully and train our staff for that , and before starting , there is a lot of paperwork that has to be done . before you started to search for sunken treasures , you studied mathematics and worked as a financial consultant .
how does that fit with archaeology ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goddio devoted himself to marine archeology in the 1980s as a matter of fact , it does help .
after 10 years in finance , i decided to take a one-year break .
i looked at what at the time has been done in underwater archaeology , and i realized that there was a need for a privately funded independent institute that could work for governments and other institutions . you opened such an institute for underwater archaeology in paris in 1985 .
were you always sure that it would become a success story ? maybe i was a little naive at the beginning .
when i started to search for the sunken parts of alexandria in 1984 the geophysical instruments that you need for missions like that did n't exist . but you did find ancient alexandria in the end . but for alexandria , it took years and years because we had to perform a four-year geophysical survey before we even had a detailed map that showed that there was something under the sediment .
it 's a bit like modern surgery .
you use the scanner , and then afterwards , when you know where to search , you do the operation at the right place . are you still thrilled by your work ? it 's very hard work because for months and months you only sail along straight lines in the harbor , towing instruments and registering data in order to create an electronic map .
when you start to see the map , you get this feeling that there is something down there .
and only then does it become thrilling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of artifacts are on show in bonn it seems that your work has little in common with an indiana jones adventure . not at all , on the contrary i would say .
my job is to prevent adventure . when you take artifacts from the ancient port of alexandria , you put them in different colored baskets .

but by distancing itself from some anti-globalization activists , the party risks losing its left-wing adherents , some say . when it comes to the g8 summit , to be held this summer in the german resort of heiligendamm , the green party ’ s curse may be the far-left ’ s blessing . the ecology-based greens are not players in the negotiations , but with their increasingly mainstream status - they were part of the ruling coalition in germany between 1998 and 2005 - they appear to be shying away from the noisy and disruptive anti-globalization movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new party theleft -lrb- dielinke . -rrb- aims to profit from the greens ' slide to center according to an article in germany ’ s welt online , some 300 groups have plans to stage opposition demonstrations to the june 5 summit under the motto “ a different world is possible . ”
these range from the appd -lrb- anarchic pogo party of germany -rrb- to the better-known groups like attac and greenpeace .
an initiative called “ paula ” has promised a “ well aimed violent demonstration ” in a town nearby heiligendamm .
for the greens , however , the overtly anti-capitalist actions pose a problem , leaving them to walk a fine line between being part of the policymaking establishment and alienating their left-wing membership .
signature denied when the greens were in a coalition government with gerhard schröder ’ s spd , a lot of the party ’ s left-leaning adherents felt obligated to make uncomfortable compromises .
now , the party risks losing these voters – peace activists , anti-nuclear activists , members of the women ’ s movement , for example – to an increasingly active german far left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roth , right , with anti-globalism protester , refused to sign the document meanwhile , greens chairwoman claudia roth recently refused to sign a letter calling for demonstrations against the summit , written by opponents of the group of eight industrialized nations .
she cited “ a serious difference of opinion on key sections ” of the letter , welt online said . roth said the letter ’ s call to demonstrate was not as harmless as depicted .
she especially opposed the part where it said the g8 was a “ precursor to a world-order based on war . ” attac , possibly the best known of the opposition groups expected to demonstrate against the g8 , said it had roth ’ s stance was " disappointing . " ' one leg in the government ' frauke distelrath , a speaker for the group , told the süddeutsche zeitung that the greens apparently " still had one leg in the government , " and said she could not otherwise think of a reason why they would refuse to sign the call-to-demonstrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin claims there is no split between greens and other protesters " on the one hand the greens are looking to get back in touch with the social movement .
on the other hand , they are sticking to their identity as a ruling party .
they won ’ t even sign on to our harmless letter , ” she said . she noted that the fact that the green party 's youth organization and green parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele had , indeed , signed the plea , made it clear that the green party was internally at odds . trittin denies break roth ’ s party colleague jürgen trittin , germany 's former environment minister , told welt online that he saw no serious break between the greens and other g8 opponents . “ there is 90 percent agreement between us and most other activists , ” he said . the greens plan to use the g8 summit as a forum to demand action on climate protection , ending poverty , and dismantling trade barriers – just like other activists , trittin said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security measures are being made for the g8 summit in heiligendamm he denied that the greens are worried about advances from the far left , which he characterized as being " too internally at odds to pose a danger to us . " meanwhile , the new far-left party , theleft , a grouping of the former communist party of east germany and many disaffected left-wing social democrats , does appear eager to take advantage of the dispute between the greens and the anti-globalization forces .
their parliamentary party chiefs , gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , signed the document - despite their own misgivings about certain passages . since getting seats in the german parliament at the end of 2005 , theleft has established a " contact point for extra-parliamentary movements , " aimed at trying to create more dialog with groups like attac . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 to offer micro-credit help , step up aids funding for africa development ministers from the g8 undertook in berlin on tuesday to set up micro-credit facilities for african nations with the help of the world bank and increase funds for the fight against aids .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.04.2007 eu 's environmental policy flounders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has a long way to go to reach its co2 emissions targets as experts in brussels wrangle over the wording of a un report on the impact of global warming , the eu 's own climate policy is stagnating .
even the emissions trade , once held up as a model to be emulated , is floundering . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas focused his ire on australia at the start of a meeting of the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- this week .
he called on the world 's second-biggest producer of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- to finally ratify the kyoto protocol , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are primarily responsible for global warming . australian prime minister john howard 's response was brusque : " you 've got the spokesman for a group of countries lecturing us about not having signed kyoto , yet the great bulk of the countries on whose behalf he speaks are falling well behind their kyoto targets and are doing less well than australia in meeting them , " he told australian broadcasting corporation radio . " our answer to the spokesman for the european union is look to your own affairs , get your countries complying with the targets you 've proclaimed , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas ' house could be in better shape , too dimas ' spokeswoman , barbara helfferich , was keen to rebuff the criticism .
" we said what needed to be said .
and the eu will in any case comply with its kyoto targets , " she told dw-world.de. but howard had a point .
the eu is far from attaining the targets it agreed to by ratifying the kyoto protocol .
the 15 older eu states are obliged to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions by eight percent by 2012 in comparison to 1990 levels , while the newer members of the bloc agreed to different targets .
but it was recently revealed that the eu had only achieved 1.6 percent by 2005 .
in 2006 , the countries carbon dioxide emissions actually increased by 1.5 percent above the previous year 's level .
flawed emissions trade critics lay some of the blame on the eu 's emissions trade , which allows companies to pollute as long as they have the necessary certificates , which can be traded .
the idea was that businesses would invest in environmentally friendly technologies to cut emissions if their only other option was to pay for a limited number of expensive licenses to pollute . but the emissions trade has so far failed to bring about a decrease in co2 pollution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is cheap at european energy exchanges the eu issued too many certificates , according to hans-jürgen nantke , head of the emissions trade office at germany 's federal environmental agency .
" that 's why the prices hit rock bottom , " he said . a ton of co2 cost nearly 30 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- in spring 2006 at the european energy exchange in leipzig .
today the price stands at less than one euro .
buying the right to pollute has become so cheap because the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , made mistakes when it estimated co2 emissions .
in 2006 , europe 's industries were able to emit 50 million tons more co2 than they ought to have . since the prices for certificates were so cheap , businesses did n't necessarily see the need to invest in new technologies that would produce fewer emissions . " when prices were higher , that happened , " said verena graichen , an expert on environmental protection at the institute for applied ecology , a german think tank . german power companies , for example , had shut down old lignite coal power plants in favor of more environmentally friendly anthracite coal plants although the latter were more expensive to run , she said .
better the second time around ?
" unfortunately the emissions trade does n't work very well , but we ca n't change anything anymore , " conceded dimas ' spokeswoman helfferich .
instead , she suggested looking to the future .
in 2008 , the second phase of the emissions trade , which continues until 2012 , is set to begin .
in order to meet the kyoto targets , the european commission has mandated a much lower number of emission certificates be issued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry needs more encouragement to cut emissions " from 2008 to 2012 , we will fulfill four kyoto percent , " helfferich predicted and referred to dozens of eu projects concerning climate protection as well as the emissions trade , which she said would then work " significantly better . " current prices for emissions certificates wo n't have an effect on their cost in the future , since the price will be recalculated in 2008 .
however , their greatly reduced number has already had an influence on today 's market : " futures , " that is , options on certificates that will be traded in the future , already cost between 16 and 17 euros per ton . but critics say the eu should alter the plans for the second phase of the emissions trade .
instead of issuing the licenses to pollute largely for free in 2008 , industry should have to buy them from the start . " companies do n't receive machines for free , " pointed out nantke of germany 's environmental agency . torsten schäfer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite climate concerns , germany plans coal power plants european union states agreed earlier this month on a binding 20 percent cut in co2 emissions by 2020 .

he called on the world 's second-biggest producer of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- to finally ratify the kyoto protocol , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are primarily responsible for global warming . australian prime minister john howard 's response was brusque : " you 've got the spokesman for a group of countries lecturing us about not having signed kyoto , yet the great bulk of the countries on whose behalf he speaks are falling well behind their kyoto targets and are doing less well than australia in meeting them , " he told australian broadcasting corporation radio . " our answer to the spokesman for the european union is look to your own affairs , get your countries complying with the targets you 've proclaimed , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas ' house could be in better shape , too dimas ' spokeswoman , barbara helfferich , was keen to rebuff the criticism .
" we said what needed to be said .
and the eu will in any case comply with its kyoto targets , " she told dw-world.de. but howard had a point .
the eu is far from attaining the targets it agreed to by ratifying the kyoto protocol .
the 15 older eu states are obliged to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions by eight percent by 2012 in comparison to 1990 levels , while the newer members of the bloc agreed to different targets .
but it was recently revealed that the eu had only achieved 1.6 percent by 2005 .
in 2006 , the countries carbon dioxide emissions actually increased by 1.5 percent above the previous year 's level .
flawed emissions trade critics lay some of the blame on the eu 's emissions trade , which allows companies to pollute as long as they have the necessary certificates , which can be traded .
the idea was that businesses would invest in environmentally friendly technologies to cut emissions if their only other option was to pay for a limited number of expensive licenses to pollute . but the emissions trade has so far failed to bring about a decrease in co2 pollution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is cheap at european energy exchanges the eu issued too many certificates , according to hans-jürgen nantke , head of the emissions trade office at germany 's federal environmental agency .
" that 's why the prices hit rock bottom , " he said . a ton of co2 cost nearly 30 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- in spring 2006 at the european energy exchange in leipzig .
today the price stands at less than one euro .
buying the right to pollute has become so cheap because the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , made mistakes when it estimated co2 emissions .
in 2006 , europe 's industries were able to emit 50 million tons more co2 than they ought to have . since the prices for certificates were so cheap , businesses did n't necessarily see the need to invest in new technologies that would produce fewer emissions . " when prices were higher , that happened , " said verena graichen , an expert on environmental protection at the institute for applied ecology , a german think tank . german power companies , for example , had shut down old lignite coal power plants in favor of more environmentally friendly anthracite coal plants although the latter were more expensive to run , she said .
better the second time around ?
" unfortunately the emissions trade does n't work very well , but we ca n't change anything anymore , " conceded dimas ' spokeswoman helfferich .
instead , she suggested looking to the future .
in 2008 , the second phase of the emissions trade , which continues until 2012 , is set to begin .
in order to meet the kyoto targets , the european commission has mandated a much lower number of emission certificates be issued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry needs more encouragement to cut emissions " from 2008 to 2012 , we will fulfill four kyoto percent , " helfferich predicted and referred to dozens of eu projects concerning climate protection as well as the emissions trade , which she said would then work " significantly better . " current prices for emissions certificates wo n't have an effect on their cost in the future , since the price will be recalculated in 2008 .
however , their greatly reduced number has already had an influence on today 's market : " futures , " that is , options on certificates that will be traded in the future , already cost between 16 and 17 euros per ton . but critics say the eu should alter the plans for the second phase of the emissions trade .
instead of issuing the licenses to pollute largely for free in 2008 , industry should have to buy them from the start . " companies do n't receive machines for free , " pointed out nantke of germany 's environmental agency . torsten schäfer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite climate concerns , germany plans coal power plants european union states agreed earlier this month on a binding 20 percent cut in co2 emissions by 2020 .
yet over 20 coal-fired power plants - major producers of greenhouse gases - are planned for germany .
-lrb- 21.03.2007 -rrb- eu clinches climate deal , but hard work yet to come european union leaders clinched a wide-ranging climate change accord on friday but postponed the thorny task of setting mandatory renewable energy goals for each member country to meet .

it is the latest effort in combating climate change , but critics question the project 's aims .

signature denied when the greens were in a coalition government with gerhard schröder ’ s spd , a lot of the party ’ s left-leaning adherents felt obligated to make uncomfortable compromises .
now , the party risks losing these voters – peace activists , anti-nuclear activists , members of the women ’ s movement , for example – to an increasingly active german far left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roth , right , with anti-globalism protester , refused to sign the document meanwhile , greens chairwoman claudia roth recently refused to sign a letter calling for demonstrations against the summit , written by opponents of the group of eight industrialized nations .
she cited “ a serious difference of opinion on key sections ” of the letter , welt online said . roth said the letter ’ s call to demonstrate was not as harmless as depicted .
she especially opposed the part where it said the g8 was a “ precursor to a world-order based on war . ” attac , possibly the best known of the opposition groups expected to demonstrate against the g8 , said it had roth ’ s stance was " disappointing . " ' one leg in the government ' frauke distelrath , a speaker for the group , told the süddeutsche zeitung that the greens apparently " still had one leg in the government , " and said she could not otherwise think of a reason why they would refuse to sign the call-to-demonstrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin claims there is no split between greens and other protesters " on the one hand the greens are looking to get back in touch with the social movement .
on the other hand , they are sticking to their identity as a ruling party .
they won ’ t even sign on to our harmless letter , ” she said . she noted that the fact that the green party 's youth organization and green parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele had , indeed , signed the plea , made it clear that the green party was internally at odds . trittin denies break roth ’ s party colleague jürgen trittin , germany 's former environment minister , told welt online that he saw no serious break between the greens and other g8 opponents . “ there is 90 percent agreement between us and most other activists , ” he said . the greens plan to use the g8 summit as a forum to demand action on climate protection , ending poverty , and dismantling trade barriers – just like other activists , trittin said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security measures are being made for the g8 summit in heiligendamm he denied that the greens are worried about advances from the far left , which he characterized as being " too internally at odds to pose a danger to us . " meanwhile , the new far-left party , theleft , a grouping of the former communist party of east germany and many disaffected left-wing social democrats , does appear eager to take advantage of the dispute between the greens and the anti-globalization forces .
their parliamentary party chiefs , gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , signed the document - despite their own misgivings about certain passages . since getting seats in the german parliament at the end of 2005 , theleft has established a " contact point for extra-parliamentary movements , " aimed at trying to create more dialog with groups like attac . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 to offer micro-credit help , step up aids funding for africa development ministers from the g8 undertook in berlin on tuesday to set up micro-credit facilities for african nations with the help of the world bank and increase funds for the fight against aids .

other baltic sea states , including finland , denmark and estonia , also worry that the construction work could stir up toxic material on the seabed and even disturb unexploded chemical weapons left over from world war two . nord stream , the russian-german consortium building the pipeline , seeks to alleviate these concerns and " has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " according to a statement . rerouting the pipeline nord stream first proposed building the pipeline across the gulf of finland and down the middle of the baltic sea , passing just below the swedish island of gotland .
but following lengthy consultations with affected baltic sea states , the consortium is now looking into three alternate routes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , is on nord stream 's board " further optimization " of the route might be necessary in the gulf of finland , nord stream said , where the pipeline could be built along a more southern route near of estonia .
other options include laying the pipeline 10 kilometers further south of gotland , bypassing swedish wildlife reserves , or running it along a route north of the danish island of bornholm . nord stream , which appointed former german chancellor gerhard schröder to its executive board shortly after he left office , says it is " determined to make sure that the new pipeline meets high environmental standards . " the controversial pipeline has been a hard sell for nord stream , and the success of this five-billion-euro project hinges on the approval of finland , sweden and denmark . a hard sell with high stakes in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected . nord stream is expected to submit an extensive eia in the early autumn of 2007 , and hopes to begin construction of the pipeline by 2008 , following final approval of the impact assessment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 27.5 billion cubic meters of russian gas could be flowing into gemany in 2010 the consortium has also submitted reports to poland , latvia , lithuania and estonia .
polish officials have expressed fears that the project could threaten poland ’ s energy security , as the new pipeline would allow russia to sell natural gas to western europe without the need for polish transit lines . in april last year , polish defense minister radoslaw sikorski even went so far as to compare the project to the hitler-stalin pact of 1939 , which divided poland among russia and germany .
but poland has no veto power over the project . sweden has also cited security concerns : officials there have expressed fears that an offshore platform near the swedish coast could be used as a venue for russian intelligence gathering . baltic sea states are also uneasy about russia ’ s plans to increase its military presence in the baltic sea , ostensibly to protect the project and assist in the removal of unexploded ordnance from the seabed . satisfying european energy needs nord stream is a russian-german joint venture created solely for the construction of the baltic sea pipeline .
russian energy giant gazprom own a majority stake in the consortium , and germany ’ s e.on ruhrgas and wintershall hold 24.5 percent shares each . if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .
in a second phase , a parallel pipeline would double that transport capacity , and nord stream estimates that will meet about 25 percent of the additional gas needs of the european union . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic pipeline creates waves in scandinavian countries finland is the latest country to express its displeasure at the planned route for the russian-german pipeline through the baltic sea .

even the emissions trade , once held up as a model to be emulated , is floundering . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas focused his ire on australia at the start of a meeting of the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- this week .
he called on the world 's second-biggest producer of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- to finally ratify the kyoto protocol , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are primarily responsible for global warming . australian prime minister john howard 's response was brusque : " you 've got the spokesman for a group of countries lecturing us about not having signed kyoto , yet the great bulk of the countries on whose behalf he speaks are falling well behind their kyoto targets and are doing less well than australia in meeting them , " he told australian broadcasting corporation radio . " our answer to the spokesman for the european union is look to your own affairs , get your countries complying with the targets you 've proclaimed , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas ' house could be in better shape , too dimas ' spokeswoman , barbara helfferich , was keen to rebuff the criticism .
" we said what needed to be said .
and the eu will in any case comply with its kyoto targets , " she told dw-world.de. but howard had a point .
the eu is far from attaining the targets it agreed to by ratifying the kyoto protocol .
the 15 older eu states are obliged to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions by eight percent by 2012 in comparison to 1990 levels , while the newer members of the bloc agreed to different targets .
but it was recently revealed that the eu had only achieved 1.6 percent by 2005 .
in 2006 , the countries carbon dioxide emissions actually increased by 1.5 percent above the previous year 's level .
flawed emissions trade critics lay some of the blame on the eu 's emissions trade , which allows companies to pollute as long as they have the necessary certificates , which can be traded .
the idea was that businesses would invest in environmentally friendly technologies to cut emissions if their only other option was to pay for a limited number of expensive licenses to pollute . but the emissions trade has so far failed to bring about a decrease in co2 pollution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is cheap at european energy exchanges the eu issued too many certificates , according to hans-jürgen nantke , head of the emissions trade office at germany 's federal environmental agency .
" that 's why the prices hit rock bottom , " he said . a ton of co2 cost nearly 30 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- in spring 2006 at the european energy exchange in leipzig .
today the price stands at less than one euro .
buying the right to pollute has become so cheap because the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , made mistakes when it estimated co2 emissions .
in 2006 , europe 's industries were able to emit 50 million tons more co2 than they ought to have . since the prices for certificates were so cheap , businesses did n't necessarily see the need to invest in new technologies that would produce fewer emissions . " when prices were higher , that happened , " said verena graichen , an expert on environmental protection at the institute for applied ecology , a german think tank . german power companies , for example , had shut down old lignite coal power plants in favor of more environmentally friendly anthracite coal plants although the latter were more expensive to run , she said .
better the second time around ?
" unfortunately the emissions trade does n't work very well , but we ca n't change anything anymore , " conceded dimas ' spokeswoman helfferich .
instead , she suggested looking to the future .
in 2008 , the second phase of the emissions trade , which continues until 2012 , is set to begin .
in order to meet the kyoto targets , the european commission has mandated a much lower number of emission certificates be issued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry needs more encouragement to cut emissions " from 2008 to 2012 , we will fulfill four kyoto percent , " helfferich predicted and referred to dozens of eu projects concerning climate protection as well as the emissions trade , which she said would then work " significantly better . " current prices for emissions certificates wo n't have an effect on their cost in the future , since the price will be recalculated in 2008 .
however , their greatly reduced number has already had an influence on today 's market : " futures , " that is , options on certificates that will be traded in the future , already cost between 16 and 17 euros per ton . but critics say the eu should alter the plans for the second phase of the emissions trade .
instead of issuing the licenses to pollute largely for free in 2008 , industry should have to buy them from the start . " companies do n't receive machines for free , " pointed out nantke of germany 's environmental agency . torsten schäfer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite climate concerns , germany plans coal power plants european union states agreed earlier this month on a binding 20 percent cut in co2 emissions by 2020 .

in 2006 , europe 's industries were able to emit 50 million tons more co2 than they ought to have . since the prices for certificates were so cheap , businesses did n't necessarily see the need to invest in new technologies that would produce fewer emissions . " when prices were higher , that happened , " said verena graichen , an expert on environmental protection at the institute for applied ecology , a german think tank . german power companies , for example , had shut down old lignite coal power plants in favor of more environmentally friendly anthracite coal plants although the latter were more expensive to run , she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.04.2007 eu 's environmental policy flounders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has a long way to go to reach its co2 emissions targets as experts in brussels wrangle over the wording of a un report on the impact of global warming , the eu 's own climate policy is stagnating .
even the emissions trade , once held up as a model to be emulated , is floundering . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas focused his ire on australia at the start of a meeting of the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- this week .
he called on the world 's second-biggest producer of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- to finally ratify the kyoto protocol , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are primarily responsible for global warming . australian prime minister john howard 's response was brusque : " you 've got the spokesman for a group of countries lecturing us about not having signed kyoto , yet the great bulk of the countries on whose behalf he speaks are falling well behind their kyoto targets and are doing less well than australia in meeting them , " he told australian broadcasting corporation radio . " our answer to the spokesman for the european union is look to your own affairs , get your countries complying with the targets you 've proclaimed , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas ' house could be in better shape , too dimas ' spokeswoman , barbara helfferich , was keen to rebuff the criticism .
" we said what needed to be said .
and the eu will in any case comply with its kyoto targets , " she told dw-world.de. but howard had a point .
the eu is far from attaining the targets it agreed to by ratifying the kyoto protocol .
the 15 older eu states are obliged to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions by eight percent by 2012 in comparison to 1990 levels , while the newer members of the bloc agreed to different targets .
but it was recently revealed that the eu had only achieved 1.6 percent by 2005 .
in 2006 , the countries carbon dioxide emissions actually increased by 1.5 percent above the previous year 's level .
flawed emissions trade critics lay some of the blame on the eu 's emissions trade , which allows companies to pollute as long as they have the necessary certificates , which can be traded .
the idea was that businesses would invest in environmentally friendly technologies to cut emissions if their only other option was to pay for a limited number of expensive licenses to pollute . but the emissions trade has so far failed to bring about a decrease in co2 pollution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is cheap at european energy exchanges the eu issued too many certificates , according to hans-jürgen nantke , head of the emissions trade office at germany 's federal environmental agency .
" that 's why the prices hit rock bottom , " he said . a ton of co2 cost nearly 30 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- in spring 2006 at the european energy exchange in leipzig .
today the price stands at less than one euro .
buying the right to pollute has become so cheap because the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , made mistakes when it estimated co2 emissions .
in 2006 , europe 's industries were able to emit 50 million tons more co2 than they ought to have . since the prices for certificates were so cheap , businesses did n't necessarily see the need to invest in new technologies that would produce fewer emissions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 05.04.2007 baltic sea pipeline consortium considers alternate routes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord stream wants to begin building the controversial gas pipeline in 2008 the german-russian consortium planning a major gas pipeline in the baltic sea said it would investigate alternate routes for the project amid concerns that construction could disrupt the environment . sweden in particular has complained that the pipeline could disrupt the baltic sea ’ s sensitive flora and fauna .
other baltic sea states , including finland , denmark and estonia , also worry that the construction work could stir up toxic material on the seabed and even disturb unexploded chemical weapons left over from world war two . nord stream , the russian-german consortium building the pipeline , seeks to alleviate these concerns and " has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " according to a statement . rerouting the pipeline nord stream first proposed building the pipeline across the gulf of finland and down the middle of the baltic sea , passing just below the swedish island of gotland .
but following lengthy consultations with affected baltic sea states , the consortium is now looking into three alternate routes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , is on nord stream 's board " further optimization " of the route might be necessary in the gulf of finland , nord stream said , where the pipeline could be built along a more southern route near of estonia .
other options include laying the pipeline 10 kilometers further south of gotland , bypassing swedish wildlife reserves , or running it along a route north of the danish island of bornholm . nord stream , which appointed former german chancellor gerhard schröder to its executive board shortly after he left office , says it is " determined to make sure that the new pipeline meets high environmental standards . " the controversial pipeline has been a hard sell for nord stream , and the success of this five-billion-euro project hinges on the approval of finland , sweden and denmark . a hard sell with high stakes in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected . nord stream is expected to submit an extensive eia in the early autumn of 2007 , and hopes to begin construction of the pipeline by 2008 , following final approval of the impact assessment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 27.5 billion cubic meters of russian gas could be flowing into gemany in 2010 the consortium has also submitted reports to poland , latvia , lithuania and estonia .
polish officials have expressed fears that the project could threaten poland ’ s energy security , as the new pipeline would allow russia to sell natural gas to western europe without the need for polish transit lines . in april last year , polish defense minister radoslaw sikorski even went so far as to compare the project to the hitler-stalin pact of 1939 , which divided poland among russia and germany .
but poland has no veto power over the project . sweden has also cited security concerns : officials there have expressed fears that an offshore platform near the swedish coast could be used as a venue for russian intelligence gathering . baltic sea states are also uneasy about russia ’ s plans to increase its military presence in the baltic sea , ostensibly to protect the project and assist in the removal of unexploded ordnance from the seabed . satisfying european energy needs nord stream is a russian-german joint venture created solely for the construction of the baltic sea pipeline .
russian energy giant gazprom own a majority stake in the consortium , and germany ’ s e.on ruhrgas and wintershall hold 24.5 percent shares each . if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .
in a second phase , a parallel pipeline would double that transport capacity , and nord stream estimates that will meet about 25 percent of the additional gas needs of the european union . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic pipeline creates waves in scandinavian countries finland is the latest country to express its displeasure at the planned route for the russian-german pipeline through the baltic sea .

i would say it 's a job , and we are doing this job very professionally .
we plan each mission carefully and train our staff for that , and before starting , there is a lot of paperwork that has to be done . before you started to search for sunken treasures , you studied mathematics and worked as a financial consultant .

" i do not think there is a moderate and ' non-moderate ' taliban .
this distinction was invented by somebody who knows nothing about afghanistan , " spanta told germany 's regional ndr radio .
he compared the proposal by social democrat leader kurt beck to forming a coalition with the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in beck 's home state of rhineland-palatinate in western germany . " it is like saying one can form a coalition with the npd in rhineland-palatinate , or with the moderate npd . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanta said beck knew nothing about afghanistan beck , whose party rules germany in coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives , suggested after a visit to german troops in afghanistan last weekend that military force alone would not put the country on the path to peace . " we have exhausted our possibilities ...
it is time to explore the possibility of a national reconciliation with the taliban , " beck said . he suggested holding a meeting on afghanistan along the lines of the un-sponsored conference on the country 's future that took place in bonn in late 2001 as the taliban were being overthrown . but spanta said : " at the moment i see no point in organizing and holding such a conference . "
beck misguided ?
he also said he was surprised by beck 's proposal , adding that the afghan government had been trying for some time to locate moderate taliban .
" if western politicians have such a thing they could give us the address and contact people , " spanta said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck recently visited german troops in afghanistan beck 's comments drew muted support from foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is a member of the social democrats , but was strongly criticized by merkel 's christian democrats . observers saw it as a misguided attempt by beck to broaden his foreign policy profile and boost his party 's ratings . nato-led forces are battling the strongest taliban insurgency yet since the hard-line islamist movement was toppled for harboring osama bin laden . germany has some 2,750 troops serving in the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in northern afghanistan and this week sent six tornado jets to carry out surveillance missions to help their nato allies . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " these people are ready to kill " gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesperson for the social democratic party , told dw-world.de that germany is not ready to give in to the terrorists ’ 10-day ultimatum to withdraw troops from afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.04.2007 baltic sea pipeline consortium considers alternate routes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord stream wants to begin building the controversial gas pipeline in 2008 the german-russian consortium planning a major gas pipeline in the baltic sea said it would investigate alternate routes for the project amid concerns that construction could disrupt the environment . sweden in particular has complained that the pipeline could disrupt the baltic sea ’ s sensitive flora and fauna .
other baltic sea states , including finland , denmark and estonia , also worry that the construction work could stir up toxic material on the seabed and even disturb unexploded chemical weapons left over from world war two . nord stream , the russian-german consortium building the pipeline , seeks to alleviate these concerns and " has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " according to a statement . rerouting the pipeline nord stream first proposed building the pipeline across the gulf of finland and down the middle of the baltic sea , passing just below the swedish island of gotland .
but following lengthy consultations with affected baltic sea states , the consortium is now looking into three alternate routes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , is on nord stream 's board " further optimization " of the route might be necessary in the gulf of finland , nord stream said , where the pipeline could be built along a more southern route near of estonia .
other options include laying the pipeline 10 kilometers further south of gotland , bypassing swedish wildlife reserves , or running it along a route north of the danish island of bornholm . nord stream , which appointed former german chancellor gerhard schröder to its executive board shortly after he left office , says it is " determined to make sure that the new pipeline meets high environmental standards . " the controversial pipeline has been a hard sell for nord stream , and the success of this five-billion-euro project hinges on the approval of finland , sweden and denmark . a hard sell with high stakes in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected . nord stream is expected to submit an extensive eia in the early autumn of 2007 , and hopes to begin construction of the pipeline by 2008 , following final approval of the impact assessment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 27.5 billion cubic meters of russian gas could be flowing into gemany in 2010 the consortium has also submitted reports to poland , latvia , lithuania and estonia .
polish officials have expressed fears that the project could threaten poland ’ s energy security , as the new pipeline would allow russia to sell natural gas to western europe without the need for polish transit lines . in april last year , polish defense minister radoslaw sikorski even went so far as to compare the project to the hitler-stalin pact of 1939 , which divided poland among russia and germany .
but poland has no veto power over the project . sweden has also cited security concerns : officials there have expressed fears that an offshore platform near the swedish coast could be used as a venue for russian intelligence gathering . baltic sea states are also uneasy about russia ’ s plans to increase its military presence in the baltic sea , ostensibly to protect the project and assist in the removal of unexploded ordnance from the seabed . satisfying european energy needs nord stream is a russian-german joint venture created solely for the construction of the baltic sea pipeline .
russian energy giant gazprom own a majority stake in the consortium , and germany ’ s e.on ruhrgas and wintershall hold 24.5 percent shares each . if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .
in a second phase , a parallel pipeline would double that transport capacity , and nord stream estimates that will meet about 25 percent of the additional gas needs of the european union . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic pipeline creates waves in scandinavian countries finland is the latest country to express its displeasure at the planned route for the russian-german pipeline through the baltic sea .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 05.04.2007 eu 's environmental policy flounders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has a long way to go to reach its co2 emissions targets as experts in brussels wrangle over the wording of a un report on the impact of global warming , the eu 's own climate policy is stagnating .
even the emissions trade , once held up as a model to be emulated , is floundering . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas focused his ire on australia at the start of a meeting of the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- this week .
he called on the world 's second-biggest producer of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- to finally ratify the kyoto protocol , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are primarily responsible for global warming . australian prime minister john howard 's response was brusque : " you 've got the spokesman for a group of countries lecturing us about not having signed kyoto , yet the great bulk of the countries on whose behalf he speaks are falling well behind their kyoto targets and are doing less well than australia in meeting them , " he told australian broadcasting corporation radio . " our answer to the spokesman for the european union is look to your own affairs , get your countries complying with the targets you 've proclaimed , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas ' house could be in better shape , too dimas ' spokeswoman , barbara helfferich , was keen to rebuff the criticism .
" we said what needed to be said .
and the eu will in any case comply with its kyoto targets , " she told dw-world.de. but howard had a point .
the eu is far from attaining the targets it agreed to by ratifying the kyoto protocol .
the 15 older eu states are obliged to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions by eight percent by 2012 in comparison to 1990 levels , while the newer members of the bloc agreed to different targets .
but it was recently revealed that the eu had only achieved 1.6 percent by 2005 .
in 2006 , the countries carbon dioxide emissions actually increased by 1.5 percent above the previous year 's level .
flawed emissions trade critics lay some of the blame on the eu 's emissions trade , which allows companies to pollute as long as they have the necessary certificates , which can be traded .
the idea was that businesses would invest in environmentally friendly technologies to cut emissions if their only other option was to pay for a limited number of expensive licenses to pollute . but the emissions trade has so far failed to bring about a decrease in co2 pollution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is cheap at european energy exchanges the eu issued too many certificates , according to hans-jürgen nantke , head of the emissions trade office at germany 's federal environmental agency .
" that 's why the prices hit rock bottom , " he said . a ton of co2 cost nearly 30 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- in spring 2006 at the european energy exchange in leipzig .
today the price stands at less than one euro .
buying the right to pollute has become so cheap because the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , made mistakes when it estimated co2 emissions .
in 2006 , europe 's industries were able to emit 50 million tons more co2 than they ought to have . since the prices for certificates were so cheap , businesses did n't necessarily see the need to invest in new technologies that would produce fewer emissions . " when prices were higher , that happened , " said verena graichen , an expert on environmental protection at the institute for applied ecology , a german think tank . german power companies , for example , had shut down old lignite coal power plants in favor of more environmentally friendly anthracite coal plants although the latter were more expensive to run , she said .
better the second time around ?
" unfortunately the emissions trade does n't work very well , but we ca n't change anything anymore , " conceded dimas ' spokeswoman helfferich .
instead , she suggested looking to the future .
in 2008 , the second phase of the emissions trade , which continues until 2012 , is set to begin .
in order to meet the kyoto targets , the european commission has mandated a much lower number of emission certificates be issued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry needs more encouragement to cut emissions " from 2008 to 2012 , we will fulfill four kyoto percent , " helfferich predicted and referred to dozens of eu projects concerning climate protection as well as the emissions trade , which she said would then work " significantly better . " current prices for emissions certificates wo n't have an effect on their cost in the future , since the price will be recalculated in 2008 .
however , their greatly reduced number has already had an influence on today 's market : " futures , " that is , options on certificates that will be traded in the future , already cost between 16 and 17 euros per ton . but critics say the eu should alter the plans for the second phase of the emissions trade .
instead of issuing the licenses to pollute largely for free in 2008 , industry should have to buy them from the start . " companies do n't receive machines for free , " pointed out nantke of germany 's environmental agency . torsten schäfer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite climate concerns , germany plans coal power plants european union states agreed earlier this month on a binding 20 percent cut in co2 emissions by 2020 .
yet over 20 coal-fired power plants - major producers of greenhouse gases - are planned for germany .
-lrb- 21.03.2007 -rrb- eu clinches climate deal , but hard work yet to come european union leaders clinched a wide-ranging climate change accord on friday but postponed the thorny task of setting mandatory renewable energy goals for each member country to meet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 05.04.2007 baltic sea pipeline consortium considers alternate routes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord stream wants to begin building the controversial gas pipeline in 2008 the german-russian consortium planning a major gas pipeline in the baltic sea said it would investigate alternate routes for the project amid concerns that construction could disrupt the environment . sweden in particular has complained that the pipeline could disrupt the baltic sea ’ s sensitive flora and fauna .
other baltic sea states , including finland , denmark and estonia , also worry that the construction work could stir up toxic material on the seabed and even disturb unexploded chemical weapons left over from world war two . nord stream , the russian-german consortium building the pipeline , seeks to alleviate these concerns and " has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " according to a statement . rerouting the pipeline nord stream first proposed building the pipeline across the gulf of finland and down the middle of the baltic sea , passing just below the swedish island of gotland .
but following lengthy consultations with affected baltic sea states , the consortium is now looking into three alternate routes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , is on nord stream 's board " further optimization " of the route might be necessary in the gulf of finland , nord stream said , where the pipeline could be built along a more southern route near of estonia .
other options include laying the pipeline 10 kilometers further south of gotland , bypassing swedish wildlife reserves , or running it along a route north of the danish island of bornholm . nord stream , which appointed former german chancellor gerhard schröder to its executive board shortly after he left office , says it is " determined to make sure that the new pipeline meets high environmental standards . " the controversial pipeline has been a hard sell for nord stream , and the success of this five-billion-euro project hinges on the approval of finland , sweden and denmark . a hard sell with high stakes in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected . nord stream is expected to submit an extensive eia in the early autumn of 2007 , and hopes to begin construction of the pipeline by 2008 , following final approval of the impact assessment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 27.5 billion cubic meters of russian gas could be flowing into gemany in 2010 the consortium has also submitted reports to poland , latvia , lithuania and estonia .
polish officials have expressed fears that the project could threaten poland ’ s energy security , as the new pipeline would allow russia to sell natural gas to western europe without the need for polish transit lines . in april last year , polish defense minister radoslaw sikorski even went so far as to compare the project to the hitler-stalin pact of 1939 , which divided poland among russia and germany .
but poland has no veto power over the project . sweden has also cited security concerns : officials there have expressed fears that an offshore platform near the swedish coast could be used as a venue for russian intelligence gathering . baltic sea states are also uneasy about russia ’ s plans to increase its military presence in the baltic sea , ostensibly to protect the project and assist in the removal of unexploded ordnance from the seabed . satisfying european energy needs nord stream is a russian-german joint venture created solely for the construction of the baltic sea pipeline .
russian energy giant gazprom own a majority stake in the consortium , and germany ’ s e.on ruhrgas and wintershall hold 24.5 percent shares each . if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .
in a second phase , a parallel pipeline would double that transport capacity , and nord stream estimates that will meet about 25 percent of the additional gas needs of the european union . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic pipeline creates waves in scandinavian countries finland is the latest country to express its displeasure at the planned route for the russian-german pipeline through the baltic sea .

sweden is especially uneasy about the project .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.04.2007 eu 's environmental policy flounders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has a long way to go to reach its co2 emissions targets as experts in brussels wrangle over the wording of a un report on the impact of global warming , the eu 's own climate policy is stagnating .
even the emissions trade , once held up as a model to be emulated , is floundering . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas focused his ire on australia at the start of a meeting of the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- this week .
he called on the world 's second-biggest producer of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- to finally ratify the kyoto protocol , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are primarily responsible for global warming . australian prime minister john howard 's response was brusque : " you 've got the spokesman for a group of countries lecturing us about not having signed kyoto , yet the great bulk of the countries on whose behalf he speaks are falling well behind their kyoto targets and are doing less well than australia in meeting them , " he told australian broadcasting corporation radio . " our answer to the spokesman for the european union is look to your own affairs , get your countries complying with the targets you 've proclaimed , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas ' house could be in better shape , too dimas ' spokeswoman , barbara helfferich , was keen to rebuff the criticism .
" we said what needed to be said .
and the eu will in any case comply with its kyoto targets , " she told dw-world.de. but howard had a point .
the eu is far from attaining the targets it agreed to by ratifying the kyoto protocol .
the 15 older eu states are obliged to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions by eight percent by 2012 in comparison to 1990 levels , while the newer members of the bloc agreed to different targets .
but it was recently revealed that the eu had only achieved 1.6 percent by 2005 .
in 2006 , the countries carbon dioxide emissions actually increased by 1.5 percent above the previous year 's level .
flawed emissions trade critics lay some of the blame on the eu 's emissions trade , which allows companies to pollute as long as they have the necessary certificates , which can be traded .
the idea was that businesses would invest in environmentally friendly technologies to cut emissions if their only other option was to pay for a limited number of expensive licenses to pollute . but the emissions trade has so far failed to bring about a decrease in co2 pollution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is cheap at european energy exchanges the eu issued too many certificates , according to hans-jürgen nantke , head of the emissions trade office at germany 's federal environmental agency .
" that 's why the prices hit rock bottom , " he said . a ton of co2 cost nearly 30 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- in spring 2006 at the european energy exchange in leipzig .
today the price stands at less than one euro .
buying the right to pollute has become so cheap because the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , made mistakes when it estimated co2 emissions .
in 2006 , europe 's industries were able to emit 50 million tons more co2 than they ought to have . since the prices for certificates were so cheap , businesses did n't necessarily see the need to invest in new technologies that would produce fewer emissions . " when prices were higher , that happened , " said verena graichen , an expert on environmental protection at the institute for applied ecology , a german think tank . german power companies , for example , had shut down old lignite coal power plants in favor of more environmentally friendly anthracite coal plants although the latter were more expensive to run , she said .
better the second time around ?
" unfortunately the emissions trade does n't work very well , but we ca n't change anything anymore , " conceded dimas ' spokeswoman helfferich .
instead , she suggested looking to the future .
in 2008 , the second phase of the emissions trade , which continues until 2012 , is set to begin .
in order to meet the kyoto targets , the european commission has mandated a much lower number of emission certificates be issued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry needs more encouragement to cut emissions " from 2008 to 2012 , we will fulfill four kyoto percent , " helfferich predicted and referred to dozens of eu projects concerning climate protection as well as the emissions trade , which she said would then work " significantly better . " current prices for emissions certificates wo n't have an effect on their cost in the future , since the price will be recalculated in 2008 .
however , their greatly reduced number has already had an influence on today 's market : " futures , " that is , options on certificates that will be traded in the future , already cost between 16 and 17 euros per ton . but critics say the eu should alter the plans for the second phase of the emissions trade .
instead of issuing the licenses to pollute largely for free in 2008 , industry should have to buy them from the start . " companies do n't receive machines for free , " pointed out nantke of germany 's environmental agency . torsten schäfer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite climate concerns , germany plans coal power plants european union states agreed earlier this month on a binding 20 percent cut in co2 emissions by 2020 .

-lrb- 21.03.2007 -rrb- eu clinches climate deal , but hard work yet to come european union leaders clinched a wide-ranging climate change accord on friday but postponed the thorny task of setting mandatory renewable energy goals for each member country to meet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.04.2007 eu 's environmental policy flounders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has a long way to go to reach its co2 emissions targets as experts in brussels wrangle over the wording of a un report on the impact of global warming , the eu 's own climate policy is stagnating .
even the emissions trade , once held up as a model to be emulated , is floundering . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas focused his ire on australia at the start of a meeting of the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- this week .
he called on the world 's second-biggest producer of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- to finally ratify the kyoto protocol , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are primarily responsible for global warming . australian prime minister john howard 's response was brusque : " you 've got the spokesman for a group of countries lecturing us about not having signed kyoto , yet the great bulk of the countries on whose behalf he speaks are falling well behind their kyoto targets and are doing less well than australia in meeting them , " he told australian broadcasting corporation radio . " our answer to the spokesman for the european union is look to your own affairs , get your countries complying with the targets you 've proclaimed , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas ' house could be in better shape , too dimas ' spokeswoman , barbara helfferich , was keen to rebuff the criticism .
" we said what needed to be said .
and the eu will in any case comply with its kyoto targets , " she told dw-world.de. but howard had a point .
the eu is far from attaining the targets it agreed to by ratifying the kyoto protocol .
the 15 older eu states are obliged to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions by eight percent by 2012 in comparison to 1990 levels , while the newer members of the bloc agreed to different targets .
but it was recently revealed that the eu had only achieved 1.6 percent by 2005 .
in 2006 , the countries carbon dioxide emissions actually increased by 1.5 percent above the previous year 's level .
flawed emissions trade critics lay some of the blame on the eu 's emissions trade , which allows companies to pollute as long as they have the necessary certificates , which can be traded .
the idea was that businesses would invest in environmentally friendly technologies to cut emissions if their only other option was to pay for a limited number of expensive licenses to pollute . but the emissions trade has so far failed to bring about a decrease in co2 pollution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is cheap at european energy exchanges the eu issued too many certificates , according to hans-jürgen nantke , head of the emissions trade office at germany 's federal environmental agency .
" that 's why the prices hit rock bottom , " he said . a ton of co2 cost nearly 30 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- in spring 2006 at the european energy exchange in leipzig .
today the price stands at less than one euro .
buying the right to pollute has become so cheap because the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , made mistakes when it estimated co2 emissions .
in 2006 , europe 's industries were able to emit 50 million tons more co2 than they ought to have . since the prices for certificates were so cheap , businesses did n't necessarily see the need to invest in new technologies that would produce fewer emissions . " when prices were higher , that happened , " said verena graichen , an expert on environmental protection at the institute for applied ecology , a german think tank . german power companies , for example , had shut down old lignite coal power plants in favor of more environmentally friendly anthracite coal plants although the latter were more expensive to run , she said .
better the second time around ?
" unfortunately the emissions trade does n't work very well , but we ca n't change anything anymore , " conceded dimas ' spokeswoman helfferich .
instead , she suggested looking to the future .
in 2008 , the second phase of the emissions trade , which continues until 2012 , is set to begin .
in order to meet the kyoto targets , the european commission has mandated a much lower number of emission certificates be issued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry needs more encouragement to cut emissions " from 2008 to 2012 , we will fulfill four kyoto percent , " helfferich predicted and referred to dozens of eu projects concerning climate protection as well as the emissions trade , which she said would then work " significantly better . " current prices for emissions certificates wo n't have an effect on their cost in the future , since the price will be recalculated in 2008 .
however , their greatly reduced number has already had an influence on today 's market : " futures , " that is , options on certificates that will be traded in the future , already cost between 16 and 17 euros per ton . but critics say the eu should alter the plans for the second phase of the emissions trade .
instead of issuing the licenses to pollute largely for free in 2008 , industry should have to buy them from the start . " companies do n't receive machines for free , " pointed out nantke of germany 's environmental agency . torsten schäfer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite climate concerns , germany plans coal power plants european union states agreed earlier this month on a binding 20 percent cut in co2 emissions by 2020 .
yet over 20 coal-fired power plants - major producers of greenhouse gases - are planned for germany .
-lrb- 21.03.2007 -rrb- eu clinches climate deal , but hard work yet to come european union leaders clinched a wide-ranging climate change accord on friday but postponed the thorny task of setting mandatory renewable energy goals for each member country to meet .

tehran says its nuclear program is purely for electricity production . european union foreign policy chief javier solana discussed prospects for negotiations on iran 's nuclear program with iranian negotiator ali larijani in a telephone call shortly before iran freed the 15 british navy personnel , an eu official said on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.04.2007 eu 's environmental policy flounders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has a long way to go to reach its co2 emissions targets as experts in brussels wrangle over the wording of a un report on the impact of global warming , the eu 's own climate policy is stagnating .
even the emissions trade , once held up as a model to be emulated , is floundering . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas focused his ire on australia at the start of a meeting of the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- this week .
he called on the world 's second-biggest producer of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- to finally ratify the kyoto protocol , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are primarily responsible for global warming . australian prime minister john howard 's response was brusque : " you 've got the spokesman for a group of countries lecturing us about not having signed kyoto , yet the great bulk of the countries on whose behalf he speaks are falling well behind their kyoto targets and are doing less well than australia in meeting them , " he told australian broadcasting corporation radio . " our answer to the spokesman for the european union is look to your own affairs , get your countries complying with the targets you 've proclaimed , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas ' house could be in better shape , too dimas ' spokeswoman , barbara helfferich , was keen to rebuff the criticism .
" we said what needed to be said .
and the eu will in any case comply with its kyoto targets , " she told dw-world.de. but howard had a point .
the eu is far from attaining the targets it agreed to by ratifying the kyoto protocol .
the 15 older eu states are obliged to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions by eight percent by 2012 in comparison to 1990 levels , while the newer members of the bloc agreed to different targets .
but it was recently revealed that the eu had only achieved 1.6 percent by 2005 .
in 2006 , the countries carbon dioxide emissions actually increased by 1.5 percent above the previous year 's level .
flawed emissions trade critics lay some of the blame on the eu 's emissions trade , which allows companies to pollute as long as they have the necessary certificates , which can be traded .
the idea was that businesses would invest in environmentally friendly technologies to cut emissions if their only other option was to pay for a limited number of expensive licenses to pollute . but the emissions trade has so far failed to bring about a decrease in co2 pollution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is cheap at european energy exchanges the eu issued too many certificates , according to hans-jürgen nantke , head of the emissions trade office at germany 's federal environmental agency .
" that 's why the prices hit rock bottom , " he said . a ton of co2 cost nearly 30 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- in spring 2006 at the european energy exchange in leipzig .
today the price stands at less than one euro .
buying the right to pollute has become so cheap because the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , made mistakes when it estimated co2 emissions .
in 2006 , europe 's industries were able to emit 50 million tons more co2 than they ought to have . since the prices for certificates were so cheap , businesses did n't necessarily see the need to invest in new technologies that would produce fewer emissions . " when prices were higher , that happened , " said verena graichen , an expert on environmental protection at the institute for applied ecology , a german think tank . german power companies , for example , had shut down old lignite coal power plants in favor of more environmentally friendly anthracite coal plants although the latter were more expensive to run , she said .
better the second time around ?
" unfortunately the emissions trade does n't work very well , but we ca n't change anything anymore , " conceded dimas ' spokeswoman helfferich .
instead , she suggested looking to the future .
in 2008 , the second phase of the emissions trade , which continues until 2012 , is set to begin .
in order to meet the kyoto targets , the european commission has mandated a much lower number of emission certificates be issued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry needs more encouragement to cut emissions " from 2008 to 2012 , we will fulfill four kyoto percent , " helfferich predicted and referred to dozens of eu projects concerning climate protection as well as the emissions trade , which she said would then work " significantly better . " current prices for emissions certificates wo n't have an effect on their cost in the future , since the price will be recalculated in 2008 .
however , their greatly reduced number has already had an influence on today 's market : " futures , " that is , options on certificates that will be traded in the future , already cost between 16 and 17 euros per ton . but critics say the eu should alter the plans for the second phase of the emissions trade .
instead of issuing the licenses to pollute largely for free in 2008 , industry should have to buy them from the start . " companies do n't receive machines for free , " pointed out nantke of germany 's environmental agency . torsten schäfer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite climate concerns , germany plans coal power plants european union states agreed earlier this month on a binding 20 percent cut in co2 emissions by 2020 .

he called on the world 's second-biggest producer of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- to finally ratify the kyoto protocol , which aims to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are primarily responsible for global warming . australian prime minister john howard 's response was brusque : " you 've got the spokesman for a group of countries lecturing us about not having signed kyoto , yet the great bulk of the countries on whose behalf he speaks are falling well behind their kyoto targets and are doing less well than australia in meeting them , " he told australian broadcasting corporation radio .

" we said what needed to be said .
and the eu will in any case comply with its kyoto targets , " she told dw-world.de. but howard had a point .
the eu is far from attaining the targets it agreed to by ratifying the kyoto protocol .
the 15 older eu states are obliged to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions by eight percent by 2012 in comparison to 1990 levels , while the newer members of the bloc agreed to different targets .
but it was recently revealed that the eu had only achieved 1.6 percent by 2005 .
in 2006 , the countries carbon dioxide emissions actually increased by 1.5 percent above the previous year 's level .
flawed emissions trade critics lay some of the blame on the eu 's emissions trade , which allows companies to pollute as long as they have the necessary certificates , which can be traded .
the idea was that businesses would invest in environmentally friendly technologies to cut emissions if their only other option was to pay for a limited number of expensive licenses to pollute . but the emissions trade has so far failed to bring about a decrease in co2 pollution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution is cheap at european energy exchanges the eu issued too many certificates , according to hans-jürgen nantke , head of the emissions trade office at germany 's federal environmental agency .
" that 's why the prices hit rock bottom , " he said . a ton of co2 cost nearly 30 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- in spring 2006 at the european energy exchange in leipzig .
today the price stands at less than one euro .
buying the right to pollute has become so cheap because the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , made mistakes when it estimated co2 emissions .
in 2006 , europe 's industries were able to emit 50 million tons more co2 than they ought to have . since the prices for certificates were so cheap , businesses did n't necessarily see the need to invest in new technologies that would produce fewer emissions . " when prices were higher , that happened , " said verena graichen , an expert on environmental protection at the institute for applied ecology , a german think tank . german power companies , for example , had shut down old lignite coal power plants in favor of more environmentally friendly anthracite coal plants although the latter were more expensive to run , she said .

" unfortunately the emissions trade does n't work very well , but we ca n't change anything anymore , " conceded dimas ' spokeswoman helfferich .
instead , she suggested looking to the future .
in 2008 , the second phase of the emissions trade , which continues until 2012 , is set to begin .
in order to meet the kyoto targets , the european commission has mandated a much lower number of emission certificates be issued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry needs more encouragement to cut emissions " from 2008 to 2012 , we will fulfill four kyoto percent , " helfferich predicted and referred to dozens of eu projects concerning climate protection as well as the emissions trade , which she said would then work " significantly better .

tehran says its nuclear program is purely for electricity production . european union foreign policy chief javier solana discussed prospects for negotiations on iran 's nuclear program with iranian negotiator ali larijani in a telephone call shortly before iran freed the 15 british navy personnel , an eu official said on thursday . " the contents are confidential , but i can say they discussed the nuclear file and the possibility of getting back to negotiations , " the official told reuters , adding that contacts remained open and another telephone call was likely soon .

" we view this as a goodwill gesture on the part of the iranian leadership , " deputy foreign minister alexander losyukov was quoted by interfax news agency as saying .

" i do not think there is a moderate and ' non-moderate ' taliban .
this distinction was invented by somebody who knows nothing about afghanistan , " spanta told germany 's regional ndr radio .
he compared the proposal by social democrat leader kurt beck to forming a coalition with the neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in beck 's home state of rhineland-palatinate in western germany . " it is like saying one can form a coalition with the npd in rhineland-palatinate , or with the moderate npd . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanta said beck knew nothing about afghanistan beck , whose party rules germany in coalition with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives , suggested after a visit to german troops in afghanistan last weekend that military force alone would not put the country on the path to peace . " we have exhausted our possibilities ...
it is time to explore the possibility of a national reconciliation with the taliban , " beck said . he suggested holding a meeting on afghanistan along the lines of the un-sponsored conference on the country 's future that took place in bonn in late 2001 as the taliban were being overthrown . but spanta said : " at the moment i see no point in organizing and holding such a conference . "
beck misguided ?
he also said he was surprised by beck 's proposal , adding that the afghan government had been trying for some time to locate moderate taliban .
" if western politicians have such a thing they could give us the address and contact people , " spanta said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck recently visited german troops in afghanistan beck 's comments drew muted support from foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is a member of the social democrats , but was strongly criticized by merkel 's christian democrats . observers saw it as a misguided attempt by beck to broaden his foreign policy profile and boost his party 's ratings . nato-led forces are battling the strongest taliban insurgency yet since the hard-line islamist movement was toppled for harboring osama bin laden . germany has some 2,750 troops serving in the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in northern afghanistan and this week sent six tornado jets to carry out surveillance missions to help their nato allies . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " these people are ready to kill " gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesperson for the social democratic party , told dw-world.de that germany is not ready to give in to the terrorists ’ 10-day ultimatum to withdraw troops from afghanistan .

other baltic sea states , including finland , denmark and estonia , also worry that the construction work could stir up toxic material on the seabed and even disturb unexploded chemical weapons left over from world war two . nord stream , the russian-german consortium building the pipeline , seeks to alleviate these concerns and " has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " according to a statement . rerouting the pipeline nord stream first proposed building the pipeline across the gulf of finland and down the middle of the baltic sea , passing just below the swedish island of gotland .
but following lengthy consultations with affected baltic sea states , the consortium is now looking into three alternate routes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , is on nord stream 's board " further optimization " of the route might be necessary in the gulf of finland , nord stream said , where the pipeline could be built along a more southern route near of estonia .
other options include laying the pipeline 10 kilometers further south of gotland , bypassing swedish wildlife reserves , or running it along a route north of the danish island of bornholm . nord stream , which appointed former german chancellor gerhard schröder to its executive board shortly after he left office , says it is " determined to make sure that the new pipeline meets high environmental standards . " the controversial pipeline has been a hard sell for nord stream , and the success of this five-billion-euro project hinges on the approval of finland , sweden and denmark . a hard sell with high stakes in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected . nord stream is expected to submit an extensive eia in the early autumn of 2007 , and hopes to begin construction of the pipeline by 2008 , following final approval of the impact assessment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 27.5 billion cubic meters of russian gas could be flowing into gemany in 2010 the consortium has also submitted reports to poland , latvia , lithuania and estonia .
polish officials have expressed fears that the project could threaten poland ’ s energy security , as the new pipeline would allow russia to sell natural gas to western europe without the need for polish transit lines . in april last year , polish defense minister radoslaw sikorski even went so far as to compare the project to the hitler-stalin pact of 1939 , which divided poland among russia and germany .
but poland has no veto power over the project . sweden has also cited security concerns : officials there have expressed fears that an offshore platform near the swedish coast could be used as a venue for russian intelligence gathering . baltic sea states are also uneasy about russia ’ s plans to increase its military presence in the baltic sea , ostensibly to protect the project and assist in the removal of unexploded ordnance from the seabed . satisfying european energy needs nord stream is a russian-german joint venture created solely for the construction of the baltic sea pipeline .
russian energy giant gazprom own a majority stake in the consortium , and germany ’ s e.on ruhrgas and wintershall hold 24.5 percent shares each . if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .
in a second phase , a parallel pipeline would double that transport capacity , and nord stream estimates that will meet about 25 percent of the additional gas needs of the european union . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic pipeline creates waves in scandinavian countries finland is the latest country to express its displeasure at the planned route for the russian-german pipeline through the baltic sea .

other baltic sea states , including finland , denmark and estonia , also worry that the construction work could stir up toxic material on the seabed and even disturb unexploded chemical weapons left over from world war two . nord stream , the russian-german consortium building the pipeline , seeks to alleviate these concerns and " has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " according to a statement . rerouting the pipeline nord stream first proposed building the pipeline across the gulf of finland and down the middle of the baltic sea , passing just below the swedish island of gotland .

the money would be used to fund environmental development . tanja gönner , the conservative environment minister in the southern german state of baden-württemberg , told german daily berliner zeitung on thursday that the measure “ would enable us to finance climate protection activities at home or in developing countries . ” the fee should not exceed “ the high single-digit or low double-digit bracket , ” gönner told the paper . the proposal is part of an ongoing debate on how to call the flight industry to account for its contribution to global warming . boom in discount airlines last month german economics minster michael glos said aircraft were responsible for 1.5 percent of climate-damaging emissions worldwide .
the european union said aviation makes up 3 percent of direct greenhouse gas emissions , though the estimates do not factor in indirect warming effects . previously , politicians had suggested raising a europe-wide tax on kerosene , the high-powered fuel used in aircraft engines .
but under pressure from industry leaders , that proposal has made little headway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boom in budget airlines has hugely increased air traffic february , baden-württemberg ’ s general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , thomas strobl , suggested an alternative .
he joined calls from his social democratic and green counterparts to levy a flat fee on the price of airline tickets . strobl said that “ flying is much too cheap compared to taking the train , ” and that an additional ten euros is within any traveller ’ s budget .
a boom in low-fare airlines has greatly increased the amount of air traffic in europe in recent years .
the rail industry is heavily subsidized in most european countries , while air travel is not . airlines resist proposal but the flat-tax proposal is bound to encounter resistance from the airline industry .
the european regions airline association represents over 220 flight-related companies in europe , and spokeswoman lesley shepherd responded with a “ clear ‘ no ’ ” to the idea . “ we are not in favour of environmental taxes - they do not benefit the environment , ” she said .
she called strobl ’ s proposal a “ misconception . ” lesley suggested that government revenues from environmental taxes are not always used for environmental research .
she said “ the real reason -lrb- for the fee -rrb- is to stop people from flying . ” indeed , the debate began late last year when politicians called on germans to avoid jetting off to far-flung destinations and holiday at home instead .
the latest proposal was timed to coincide with the publication of the second united nations report on climate change , due to appear on friday . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany seeks emerging economies ' support on climate deal germany is to ask for the support of emerging economies for greater climate protection and push for a long-term anti-global warming agreement at a meeting of leading industrial nations ' environment ministers .

" sophisticated political theater , " " perfect british diplomacy , " - or both ?
the international press reacted to the release , after 13 days ' captivity , of 15 british sailors held hostage in iran . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad ’ s move to call the hostage release a “ gift ” to the british people was nothing less than a “ sophisticated piece of political theatre , in which the president turned what had become a diplomatic disaster for iran into something of a personal victory , ” uk daily the guardian wrote . but just how effective was the “ pardon ” in the end ? “ ultimately , the larger issue is the effect of all this on the wider stage , ” the paper mused .
“ surely the real lesson to draw from yesterday ’ s theatre is that quiet diplomacy does work and that it can work in the future . ” summing up , the paper argued : “ there is no substitute for direct negotiation , especially with a revolutionary islamic regime in iran , for whom the popularly held grievance about past american and british interference in the gulf is as important as the issue in hand . ” “ iran ’ s president is the uncrowned king of tragicomic political theater , ” agreed the basler zeitung of basel , switzerland .
“ the way he announced the freeing of the 15 captive british sailors was as grotesque as it was masterful . … so , did iran cave in to the angry reactions of the international community ?
were they scared of a threatening liberation action by the british and americans ?
not a chance .
from outside , at least , it looks like iran once again played a perfect hand , and made its political point . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad announced the release at a press conference in tehran but in rome , the daily il messaggero wondered what london had to agree to in order to negotiation the sailors ’ release : “ the release of the the british sailors will no doubt relax relations between britain and tehran . … we don ’ t know yet what quid pro quo the government in london accepted , but it is sure that there was one .
and it wouldn ’ t be surprising if there were a prisoner exchange .
but that would only happen at such time when london and washington could claim they are sticking to their stated principle of not accepting a quid pro quo , ” the paper wrote . “ in any case , there is no reason to be shocked : there have always been prisoner exchanges , whether of soldiers or of journalists . ” dutch newspaper de volkskrant also mulled what , exactly , went on behind the scenes of negotiations . “ in the coming days we will doubtless find out the basics of what went on between london and tehran when it came to arranging for the release of the british hostages , ” de volkskrant wrote .
“ but it is already clear that the affair can not be seen without making a connection to the kidnapping of an iranian diplomat and the arrest of five iranian fighters in iraq .
on tuesday , it was announced that the diplomat will be released , and an iranian consul can visit the fighters .
it is clear that the whole affair was not simply about iran ’ s territorial integrity , or of pardons or shows of might .
it was an exchange . ” bulgaria ’ s monitor newspaper saw the dealings as a major coup for the uk on the world political stage .
“ there is no doubt the sailors have perfect british diplomacy to thank ” for their release , the paper wrote .
“ it was no secret that london started backstage negotiations two or three days ago .
clearly , the brits could give all of humanity a break if they could quickly negotiate between tehran and washinton , like they did in the case of the sailors . ” finally , austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten said the risk of escalation was too big in the situation - and everyone involved knew it . “ a new ahmadinedschad ; the heavily embattled iranian president can celebrate an urgently needed victory .
both sides managed to reach their goals , including the release of iranian hardliners captured by the british , without any loss of face .
uk premier tony blair did not need to apologize for supposed border violations , nor did the regime in tehran need to tone down its loud threats .
for both parties , the risk of escalation appeared too great .
it has been a very calming experience for the rest of the world , ” the paper wrote . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes iran move also a signal on nuclear issue german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday he hoped tehran 's decision to free 15 british sailors was a signal iran was ready to compromise on other matters such as its nuclear program .

the international press reacted to the release , after 13 days ' captivity , of 15 british sailors held hostage in iran . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad ’ s move to call the hostage release a “ gift ” to the british people was nothing less than a “ sophisticated piece of political theatre , in which the president turned what had become a diplomatic disaster for iran into something of a personal victory , ” uk daily the guardian wrote . but just how effective was the “ pardon ” in the end ? “ ultimately , the larger issue is the effect of all this on the wider stage , ” the paper mused .
“ surely the real lesson to draw from yesterday ’ s theatre is that quiet diplomacy does work and that it can work in the future . ” summing up , the paper argued : “ there is no substitute for direct negotiation , especially with a revolutionary islamic regime in iran , for whom the popularly held grievance about past american and british interference in the gulf is as important as the issue in hand . ” “ iran ’ s president is the uncrowned king of tragicomic political theater , ” agreed the basler zeitung of basel , switzerland .

their parliamentary party chiefs , gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , signed the document - despite their own misgivings about certain passages . since getting seats in the german parliament at the end of 2005 , theleft has established a " contact point for extra-parliamentary movements , " aimed at trying to create more dialog with groups like attac . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 to offer micro-credit help , step up aids funding for africa development ministers from the g8 undertook in berlin on tuesday to set up micro-credit facilities for african nations with the help of the world bank and increase funds for the fight against aids .

but by distancing itself from some anti-globalization activists , the party risks losing its left-wing adherents , some say . when it comes to the g8 summit , to be held this summer in the german resort of heiligendamm , the green party ’ s curse may be the far-left ’ s blessing . the ecology-based greens are not players in the negotiations , but with their increasingly mainstream status - they were part of the ruling coalition in germany between 1998 and 2005 - they appear to be shying away from the noisy and disruptive anti-globalization movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new party theleft -lrb- dielinke . -rrb- aims to profit from the greens ' slide to center according to an article in germany ’ s welt online , some 300 groups have plans to stage opposition demonstrations to the june 5 summit under the motto “ a different world is possible . ”
these range from the appd -lrb- anarchic pogo party of germany -rrb- to the better-known groups like attac and greenpeace .
an initiative called “ paula ” has promised a “ well aimed violent demonstration ” in a town nearby heiligendamm .
for the greens , however , the overtly anti-capitalist actions pose a problem , leaving them to walk a fine line between being part of the policymaking establishment and alienating their left-wing membership .
signature denied when the greens were in a coalition government with gerhard schröder ’ s spd , a lot of the party ’ s left-leaning adherents felt obligated to make uncomfortable compromises .
now , the party risks losing these voters – peace activists , anti-nuclear activists , members of the women ’ s movement , for example – to an increasingly active german far left . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roth , right , with anti-globalism protester , refused to sign the document meanwhile , greens chairwoman claudia roth recently refused to sign a letter calling for demonstrations against the summit , written by opponents of the group of eight industrialized nations .
she cited “ a serious difference of opinion on key sections ” of the letter , welt online said . roth said the letter ’ s call to demonstrate was not as harmless as depicted .
she especially opposed the part where it said the g8 was a “ precursor to a world-order based on war . ” attac , possibly the best known of the opposition groups expected to demonstrate against the g8 , said it had roth ’ s stance was " disappointing . " ' one leg in the government ' frauke distelrath , a speaker for the group , told the süddeutsche zeitung that the greens apparently " still had one leg in the government , " and said she could not otherwise think of a reason why they would refuse to sign the call-to-demonstrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin claims there is no split between greens and other protesters " on the one hand the greens are looking to get back in touch with the social movement .

" sophisticated political theater , " " perfect british diplomacy , " - or both ?
the international press reacted to the release , after 13 days ' captivity , of 15 british sailors held hostage in iran . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad ’ s move to call the hostage release a “ gift ” to the british people was nothing less than a “ sophisticated piece of political theatre , in which the president turned what had become a diplomatic disaster for iran into something of a personal victory , ” uk daily the guardian wrote . but just how effective was the “ pardon ” in the end ? “ ultimately , the larger issue is the effect of all this on the wider stage , ” the paper mused .
“ surely the real lesson to draw from yesterday ’ s theatre is that quiet diplomacy does work and that it can work in the future . ” summing up , the paper argued : “ there is no substitute for direct negotiation , especially with a revolutionary islamic regime in iran , for whom the popularly held grievance about past american and british interference in the gulf is as important as the issue in hand . ” “ iran ’ s president is the uncrowned king of tragicomic political theater , ” agreed the basler zeitung of basel , switzerland .
“ the way he announced the freeing of the 15 captive british sailors was as grotesque as it was masterful . … so , did iran cave in to the angry reactions of the international community ?
were they scared of a threatening liberation action by the british and americans ?
not a chance .
from outside , at least , it looks like iran once again played a perfect hand , and made its political point . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad announced the release at a press conference in tehran but in rome , the daily il messaggero wondered what london had to agree to in order to negotiation the sailors ’ release : “ the release of the the british sailors will no doubt relax relations between britain and tehran . … we don ’ t know yet what quid pro quo the government in london accepted , but it is sure that there was one .
and it wouldn ’ t be surprising if there were a prisoner exchange .
but that would only happen at such time when london and washington could claim they are sticking to their stated principle of not accepting a quid pro quo , ” the paper wrote . “ in any case , there is no reason to be shocked : there have always been prisoner exchanges , whether of soldiers or of journalists . ” dutch newspaper de volkskrant also mulled what , exactly , went on behind the scenes of negotiations . “ in the coming days we will doubtless find out the basics of what went on between london and tehran when it came to arranging for the release of the british hostages , ” de volkskrant wrote .
“ but it is already clear that the affair can not be seen without making a connection to the kidnapping of an iranian diplomat and the arrest of five iranian fighters in iraq .
on tuesday , it was announced that the diplomat will be released , and an iranian consul can visit the fighters .
it is clear that the whole affair was not simply about iran ’ s territorial integrity , or of pardons or shows of might .
it was an exchange . ” bulgaria ’ s monitor newspaper saw the dealings as a major coup for the uk on the world political stage .
“ there is no doubt the sailors have perfect british diplomacy to thank ” for their release , the paper wrote .
“ it was no secret that london started backstage negotiations two or three days ago .
clearly , the brits could give all of humanity a break if they could quickly negotiate between tehran and washinton , like they did in the case of the sailors . ” finally , austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten said the risk of escalation was too big in the situation - and everyone involved knew it . “ a new ahmadinedschad ; the heavily embattled iranian president can celebrate an urgently needed victory .
both sides managed to reach their goals , including the release of iranian hardliners captured by the british , without any loss of face .
uk premier tony blair did not need to apologize for supposed border violations , nor did the regime in tehran need to tone down its loud threats .

" egypt 's sunken treasures , " an exhibition of artifacts unearthed during goddio 's excavations , went on show in bonn on thursday . dw-world.de : after thousands of excursions to sunken cities and shipwrecks around the world , your living room must look like an adventurous place . franck goddio : well , it 's not an adventure .
i would say it 's a job , and we are doing this job very professionally .
we plan each mission carefully and train our staff for that , and before starting , there is a lot of paperwork that has to be done . before you started to search for sunken treasures , you studied mathematics and worked as a financial consultant .
how does that fit with archaeology ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goddio devoted himself to marine archeology in the 1980s as a matter of fact , it does help .
after 10 years in finance , i decided to take a one-year break .
i looked at what at the time has been done in underwater archaeology , and i realized that there was a need for a privately funded independent institute that could work for governments and other institutions . you opened such an institute for underwater archaeology in paris in 1985 .
were you always sure that it would become a success story ? maybe i was a little naive at the beginning .
when i started to search for the sunken parts of alexandria in 1984 the geophysical instruments that you need for missions like that did n't exist . but you did find ancient alexandria in the end . but for alexandria , it took years and years because we had to perform a four-year geophysical survey before we even had a detailed map that showed that there was something under the sediment .
it 's a bit like modern surgery .
you use the scanner , and then afterwards , when you know where to search , you do the operation at the right place . are you still thrilled by your work ? it 's very hard work because for months and months you only sail along straight lines in the harbor , towing instruments and registering data in order to create an electronic map .
when you start to see the map , you get this feeling that there is something down there .
and only then does it become thrilling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of artifacts are on show in bonn it seems that your work has little in common with an indiana jones adventure . not at all , on the contrary i would say .
my job is to prevent adventure . when you take artifacts from the ancient port of alexandria , you put them in different colored baskets .
does the color mean something ? the color is in fact no criteria , but you need these baskets in order to desalinate the artifacts .
when you raise it from the sea , where the object has been for some 2,000 years , you have to remove the salt .
for a small artifact , this can take a few days .
for a very big artefact , like the statue of hapi -lrb- editor 's note : a more than five-meter or 16-feet high statue -rrb- , we needed 18 months to remove the salt . what happens if you do n't do that ? the stone will disintegrate .
chemical reactions will make the stone weaker , until it finally disintegrates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this stele of the ptolemy is also part of the exhibition the exhibition in bonn is showing 500 artifacts , most of them from alexandria .
what kind of feeling should the exhibition evoke in visitors ? we found all the artifacts right next to each other .
they were on the same place for thousands of years and supplemented each other , they were literally living together .
in the exhibition you can see that they speak to each other . who owns the artifacts ? they belong to egypt of course .
all artifacts that you see in the exhibit in bonn will one day end up in a museum which will be built for them - in alexandria . " egypt 's sunken treasures " runs until jan .

" egypt 's sunken treasures , " an exhibition of artifacts unearthed during goddio 's excavations , went on show in bonn on thursday . dw-world.de : after thousands of excursions to sunken cities and shipwrecks around the world , your living room must look like an adventurous place . franck goddio : well , it 's not an adventure .
i would say it 's a job , and we are doing this job very professionally .
we plan each mission carefully and train our staff for that , and before starting , there is a lot of paperwork that has to be done . before you started to search for sunken treasures , you studied mathematics and worked as a financial consultant .
how does that fit with archaeology ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goddio devoted himself to marine archeology in the 1980s as a matter of fact , it does help .
after 10 years in finance , i decided to take a one-year break .
i looked at what at the time has been done in underwater archaeology , and i realized that there was a need for a privately funded independent institute that could work for governments and other institutions . you opened such an institute for underwater archaeology in paris in 1985 .
were you always sure that it would become a success story ? maybe i was a little naive at the beginning .
when i started to search for the sunken parts of alexandria in 1984 the geophysical instruments that you need for missions like that did n't exist . but you did find ancient alexandria in the end . but for alexandria , it took years and years because we had to perform a four-year geophysical survey before we even had a detailed map that showed that there was something under the sediment .
it 's a bit like modern surgery .
you use the scanner , and then afterwards , when you know where to search , you do the operation at the right place . are you still thrilled by your work ? it 's very hard work because for months and months you only sail along straight lines in the harbor , towing instruments and registering data in order to create an electronic map .
when you start to see the map , you get this feeling that there is something down there .
and only then does it become thrilling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of artifacts are on show in bonn it seems that your work has little in common with an indiana jones adventure . not at all , on the contrary i would say .
my job is to prevent adventure . when you take artifacts from the ancient port of alexandria , you put them in different colored baskets .
does the color mean something ? the color is in fact no criteria , but you need these baskets in order to desalinate the artifacts .
when you raise it from the sea , where the object has been for some 2,000 years , you have to remove the salt .
for a small artifact , this can take a few days .
for a very big artefact , like the statue of hapi -lrb- editor 's note : a more than five-meter or 16-feet high statue -rrb- , we needed 18 months to remove the salt . what happens if you do n't do that ? the stone will disintegrate .
chemical reactions will make the stone weaker , until it finally disintegrates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this stele of the ptolemy is also part of the exhibition the exhibition in bonn is showing 500 artifacts , most of them from alexandria .
what kind of feeling should the exhibition evoke in visitors ? we found all the artifacts right next to each other .
they were on the same place for thousands of years and supplemented each other , they were literally living together .
in the exhibition you can see that they speak to each other . who owns the artifacts ? they belong to egypt of course .

but the proposal has been met with scorn . the european commission and the 78-nation so-called acp group - mostly former european colonies - are struggling to make progress to conclude new trade agreements by the end of the year when a current preferential market access accord is due to expire . under the european union 's new offer , all quotas and tariffs on acp goods would be lifted immediately once a deal was signed , with the exception of rice and sugar .
97 percent of eu imports from acp nations are already tariff-free or are taxed only at very low levels while 40 of the poorest countries already enjoy free access to eu markets . acp nations include nigeria , kenya , cuba and east timor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union trade commissioner peter mandelson " trade and development for acp countries is about much more than just access to the european market , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said .
" but by removing all remaining tariffs and quotas for all african , caribbean and pacific countries we will create the best possible opportunities for these economies , " he added . offer slammed as " derisory " in reaction , the negotiator for the caribbean acp countries slammed the offer owing to the exceptions on rice and sugar , describing it as " derisory " and warning it could cause more harm than good . " the european commission offer threatens to poison the negotiating climate , especially at a time when both sides are making strides -lrb- on -rrb- flexibilities , " said junior lodge .
" we therefore hope that good sense will prevail and the european commission will offer all acp regions a more constructive and attractive market access offer , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sugar exports from acp nations are n't included in the eu offer levies on sugar would be phased out by 2015 while a reform in subsidies for eu sugar farmers is carried out and a firm date has not yet been set for rice , the commission said . the offer did not cover south africa , which has a bilateral trade agreement with the eu and which the commission said produces " a number of globally competitive products . " the acp group , made up mostly of former european colonies , has benefited from preferential access to eu markets since the signing of the lome accord in 1975 . but other equally poor countries , mostly in latin america , have contested the acp 's preferential treatment and have won backing from the world trade organisation . in 2001 , the world trade referee gave the eu until the end of this year to come up with a new framework that would be more compatible with international rules of commerce . deadline for talks nears after their wto defeat , the europeans and the acp opened talks in 2002 to reach new so-called economic partnership agreements which are being conducted by regions - eastern , central and southern africa , the caribbean and the pacific . but little progress has been made , and pressure is building as the year-end deadline approaches .
a number of development pressure groups , including oxfam and action aid , consider the deadline to be unrealistic and have called for it to be pushed back . the european commission had promised that it would offer greater market access as part of the negotiations , which some development pressure groups have accused the eu of using to gain greater access to acp markets . brussels said the new offer was not conditional on acp countries matching the eu in tearing down tariff and quota barriers and that any greater market access they would have to provide to meet wto rules could be phased in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the eu is trying to gain greater access to markets in the developing world british pro-development pressure group oxfam said the offer was the minimum the commission could do and that it should not be used to strong-arm acp countries into an agreement by the end of the year .

a number of development pressure groups , including oxfam and action aid , consider the deadline to be unrealistic and have called for it to be pushed back . the european commission had promised that it would offer greater market access as part of the negotiations , which some development pressure groups have accused the eu of using to gain greater access to acp markets . brussels said the new offer was not conditional on acp countries matching the eu in tearing down tariff and quota barriers and that any greater market access they would have to provide to meet wto rules could be phased in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the eu is trying to gain greater access to markets in the developing world british pro-development pressure group oxfam said the offer was the minimum the commission could do and that it should not be used to strong-arm acp countries into an agreement by the end of the year . " developing countries look set to be asked to open their markets dramatically , which could have seriously negative implications for poor peoples ' livelihoods and future economic development , " said oxfam 's brussels head luis morago . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants new deal with african , caribbean , pacific partners the european union said it wants to complete new trade agreements with 78 african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- countries by the end of the year despite opposition from developing countries .

but the proposal has been met with scorn . the european commission and the 78-nation so-called acp group - mostly former european colonies - are struggling to make progress to conclude new trade agreements by the end of the year when a current preferential market access accord is due to expire . under the european union 's new offer , all quotas and tariffs on acp goods would be lifted immediately once a deal was signed , with the exception of rice and sugar .

" egypt 's sunken treasures , " an exhibition of artifacts unearthed during goddio 's excavations , went on show in bonn on thursday . dw-world.de : after thousands of excursions to sunken cities and shipwrecks around the world , your living room must look like an adventurous place . franck goddio : well , it 's not an adventure .
i would say it 's a job , and we are doing this job very professionally .
we plan each mission carefully and train our staff for that , and before starting , there is a lot of paperwork that has to be done . before you started to search for sunken treasures , you studied mathematics and worked as a financial consultant .
how does that fit with archaeology ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goddio devoted himself to marine archeology in the 1980s as a matter of fact , it does help .
after 10 years in finance , i decided to take a one-year break .
i looked at what at the time has been done in underwater archaeology , and i realized that there was a need for a privately funded independent institute that could work for governments and other institutions . you opened such an institute for underwater archaeology in paris in 1985 .
were you always sure that it would become a success story ? maybe i was a little naive at the beginning .
when i started to search for the sunken parts of alexandria in 1984 the geophysical instruments that you need for missions like that did n't exist . but you did find ancient alexandria in the end . but for alexandria , it took years and years because we had to perform a four-year geophysical survey before we even had a detailed map that showed that there was something under the sediment .
it 's a bit like modern surgery .
you use the scanner , and then afterwards , when you know where to search , you do the operation at the right place . are you still thrilled by your work ? it 's very hard work because for months and months you only sail along straight lines in the harbor , towing instruments and registering data in order to create an electronic map .
when you start to see the map , you get this feeling that there is something down there .
and only then does it become thrilling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of artifacts are on show in bonn it seems that your work has little in common with an indiana jones adventure . not at all , on the contrary i would say .
my job is to prevent adventure . when you take artifacts from the ancient port of alexandria , you put them in different colored baskets .
does the color mean something ? the color is in fact no criteria , but you need these baskets in order to desalinate the artifacts .
when you raise it from the sea , where the object has been for some 2,000 years , you have to remove the salt .
for a small artifact , this can take a few days .
for a very big artefact , like the statue of hapi -lrb- editor 's note : a more than five-meter or 16-feet high statue -rrb- , we needed 18 months to remove the salt . what happens if you do n't do that ? the stone will disintegrate .
chemical reactions will make the stone weaker , until it finally disintegrates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this stele of the ptolemy is also part of the exhibition the exhibition in bonn is showing 500 artifacts , most of them from alexandria .
what kind of feeling should the exhibition evoke in visitors ? we found all the artifacts right next to each other .
they were on the same place for thousands of years and supplemented each other , they were literally living together .
in the exhibition you can see that they speak to each other . who owns the artifacts ? they belong to egypt of course .
all artifacts that you see in the exhibit in bonn will one day end up in a museum which will be built for them - in alexandria . " egypt 's sunken treasures " runs until jan .

but the proposal has been met with scorn . the european commission and the 78-nation so-called acp group - mostly former european colonies - are struggling to make progress to conclude new trade agreements by the end of the year when a current preferential market access accord is due to expire . under the european union 's new offer , all quotas and tariffs on acp goods would be lifted immediately once a deal was signed , with the exception of rice and sugar .
97 percent of eu imports from acp nations are already tariff-free or are taxed only at very low levels while 40 of the poorest countries already enjoy free access to eu markets . acp nations include nigeria , kenya , cuba and east timor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union trade commissioner peter mandelson " trade and development for acp countries is about much more than just access to the european market , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said .
" but by removing all remaining tariffs and quotas for all african , caribbean and pacific countries we will create the best possible opportunities for these economies , " he added . offer slammed as " derisory " in reaction , the negotiator for the caribbean acp countries slammed the offer owing to the exceptions on rice and sugar , describing it as " derisory " and warning it could cause more harm than good .

" the acp group , made up mostly of former european colonies , has benefited from preferential access to eu markets since the signing of the lome accord in 1975 . but other equally poor countries , mostly in latin america , have contested the acp 's preferential treatment and have won backing from the world trade organisation . in 2001 , the world trade referee gave the eu until the end of this year to come up with a new framework that would be more compatible with international rules of commerce . deadline for talks nears after their wto defeat , the europeans and the acp opened talks in 2002 to reach new so-called economic partnership agreements which are being conducted by regions - eastern , central and southern africa , the caribbean and the pacific . but little progress has been made , and pressure is building as the year-end deadline approaches .
a number of development pressure groups , including oxfam and action aid , consider the deadline to be unrealistic and have called for it to be pushed back . the european commission had promised that it would offer greater market access as part of the negotiations , which some development pressure groups have accused the eu of using to gain greater access to acp markets . brussels said the new offer was not conditional on acp countries matching the eu in tearing down tariff and quota barriers and that any greater market access they would have to provide to meet wto rules could be phased in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the eu is trying to gain greater access to markets in the developing world british pro-development pressure group oxfam said the offer was the minimum the commission could do and that it should not be used to strong-arm acp countries into an agreement by the end of the year .

" sophisticated political theater , " " perfect british diplomacy , " - or both ?
the international press reacted to the release , after 13 days ' captivity , of 15 british sailors held hostage in iran . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad ’ s move to call the hostage release a “ gift ” to the british people was nothing less than a “ sophisticated piece of political theatre , in which the president turned what had become a diplomatic disaster for iran into something of a personal victory , ” uk daily the guardian wrote . but just how effective was the “ pardon ” in the end ? “ ultimately , the larger issue is the effect of all this on the wider stage , ” the paper mused .
“ surely the real lesson to draw from yesterday ’ s theatre is that quiet diplomacy does work and that it can work in the future . ” summing up , the paper argued : “ there is no substitute for direct negotiation , especially with a revolutionary islamic regime in iran , for whom the popularly held grievance about past american and british interference in the gulf is as important as the issue in hand . ” “ iran ’ s president is the uncrowned king of tragicomic political theater , ” agreed the basler zeitung of basel , switzerland .
“ the way he announced the freeing of the 15 captive british sailors was as grotesque as it was masterful . … so , did iran cave in to the angry reactions of the international community ?
were they scared of a threatening liberation action by the british and americans ?
not a chance .
from outside , at least , it looks like iran once again played a perfect hand , and made its political point . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad announced the release at a press conference in tehran but in rome , the daily il messaggero wondered what london had to agree to in order to negotiation the sailors ’ release : “ the release of the the british sailors will no doubt relax relations between britain and tehran . … we don ’ t know yet what quid pro quo the government in london accepted , but it is sure that there was one .
and it wouldn ’ t be surprising if there were a prisoner exchange .
but that would only happen at such time when london and washington could claim they are sticking to their stated principle of not accepting a quid pro quo , ” the paper wrote . “ in any case , there is no reason to be shocked : there have always been prisoner exchanges , whether of soldiers or of journalists . ” dutch newspaper de volkskrant also mulled what , exactly , went on behind the scenes of negotiations . “ in the coming days we will doubtless find out the basics of what went on between london and tehran when it came to arranging for the release of the british hostages , ” de volkskrant wrote .
“ but it is already clear that the affair can not be seen without making a connection to the kidnapping of an iranian diplomat and the arrest of five iranian fighters in iraq .
on tuesday , it was announced that the diplomat will be released , and an iranian consul can visit the fighters .
it is clear that the whole affair was not simply about iran ’ s territorial integrity , or of pardons or shows of might .
it was an exchange . ” bulgaria ’ s monitor newspaper saw the dealings as a major coup for the uk on the world political stage .
“ there is no doubt the sailors have perfect british diplomacy to thank ” for their release , the paper wrote .
“ it was no secret that london started backstage negotiations two or three days ago .
clearly , the brits could give all of humanity a break if they could quickly negotiate between tehran and washinton , like they did in the case of the sailors . ” finally , austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten said the risk of escalation was too big in the situation - and everyone involved knew it . “ a new ahmadinedschad ; the heavily embattled iranian president can celebrate an urgently needed victory .
both sides managed to reach their goals , including the release of iranian hardliners captured by the british , without any loss of face .
uk premier tony blair did not need to apologize for supposed border violations , nor did the regime in tehran need to tone down its loud threats .
for both parties , the risk of escalation appeared too great .

it is clear that the whole affair was not simply about iran ’ s territorial integrity , or of pardons or shows of might .
it was an exchange . ” bulgaria ’ s monitor newspaper saw the dealings as a major coup for the uk on the world political stage .
“ there is no doubt the sailors have perfect british diplomacy to thank ” for their release , the paper wrote .
“ it was no secret that london started backstage negotiations two or three days ago .
clearly , the brits could give all of humanity a break if they could quickly negotiate between tehran and washinton , like they did in the case of the sailors . ” finally , austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten said the risk of escalation was too big in the situation - and everyone involved knew it . “ a new ahmadinedschad ; the heavily embattled iranian president can celebrate an urgently needed victory .
both sides managed to reach their goals , including the release of iranian hardliners captured by the british , without any loss of face .
uk premier tony blair did not need to apologize for supposed border violations , nor did the regime in tehran need to tone down its loud threats .

" sophisticated political theater , " " perfect british diplomacy , " - or both ?
the international press reacted to the release , after 13 days ' captivity , of 15 british sailors held hostage in iran . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad ’ s move to call the hostage release a “ gift ” to the british people was nothing less than a “ sophisticated piece of political theatre , in which the president turned what had become a diplomatic disaster for iran into something of a personal victory , ” uk daily the guardian wrote . but just how effective was the “ pardon ” in the end ? “ ultimately , the larger issue is the effect of all this on the wider stage , ” the paper mused .
“ surely the real lesson to draw from yesterday ’ s theatre is that quiet diplomacy does work and that it can work in the future . ” summing up , the paper argued : “ there is no substitute for direct negotiation , especially with a revolutionary islamic regime in iran , for whom the popularly held grievance about past american and british interference in the gulf is as important as the issue in hand . ” “ iran ’ s president is the uncrowned king of tragicomic political theater , ” agreed the basler zeitung of basel , switzerland .
“ the way he announced the freeing of the 15 captive british sailors was as grotesque as it was masterful . … so , did iran cave in to the angry reactions of the international community ?
were they scared of a threatening liberation action by the british and americans ?
not a chance .
from outside , at least , it looks like iran once again played a perfect hand , and made its political point . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad announced the release at a press conference in tehran but in rome , the daily il messaggero wondered what london had to agree to in order to negotiation the sailors ’ release : “ the release of the the british sailors will no doubt relax relations between britain and tehran . … we don ’ t know yet what quid pro quo the government in london accepted , but it is sure that there was one .
and it wouldn ’ t be surprising if there were a prisoner exchange .
but that would only happen at such time when london and washington could claim they are sticking to their stated principle of not accepting a quid pro quo , ” the paper wrote . “ in any case , there is no reason to be shocked : there have always been prisoner exchanges , whether of soldiers or of journalists . ” dutch newspaper de volkskrant also mulled what , exactly , went on behind the scenes of negotiations . “ in the coming days we will doubtless find out the basics of what went on between london and tehran when it came to arranging for the release of the british hostages , ” de volkskrant wrote .
“ but it is already clear that the affair can not be seen without making a connection to the kidnapping of an iranian diplomat and the arrest of five iranian fighters in iraq .
on tuesday , it was announced that the diplomat will be released , and an iranian consul can visit the fighters .
it is clear that the whole affair was not simply about iran ’ s territorial integrity , or of pardons or shows of might .
it was an exchange . ” bulgaria ’ s monitor newspaper saw the dealings as a major coup for the uk on the world political stage .
“ there is no doubt the sailors have perfect british diplomacy to thank ” for their release , the paper wrote .
“ it was no secret that london started backstage negotiations two or three days ago .
clearly , the brits could give all of humanity a break if they could quickly negotiate between tehran and washinton , like they did in the case of the sailors . ” finally , austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten said the risk of escalation was too big in the situation - and everyone involved knew it . “ a new ahmadinedschad ; the heavily embattled iranian president can celebrate an urgently needed victory .
both sides managed to reach their goals , including the release of iranian hardliners captured by the british , without any loss of face .
uk premier tony blair did not need to apologize for supposed border violations , nor did the regime in tehran need to tone down its loud threats .
for both parties , the risk of escalation appeared too great .
it has been a very calming experience for the rest of the world , ” the paper wrote . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes iran move also a signal on nuclear issue german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday he hoped tehran 's decision to free 15 british sailors was a signal iran was ready to compromise on other matters such as its nuclear program .

the money would be used to fund environmental development . tanja gönner , the conservative environment minister in the southern german state of baden-württemberg , told german daily berliner zeitung on thursday that the measure “ would enable us to finance climate protection activities at home or in developing countries . ” the fee should not exceed “ the high single-digit or low double-digit bracket , ” gönner told the paper . the proposal is part of an ongoing debate on how to call the flight industry to account for its contribution to global warming . boom in discount airlines last month german economics minster michael glos said aircraft were responsible for 1.5 percent of climate-damaging emissions worldwide .
the european union said aviation makes up 3 percent of direct greenhouse gas emissions , though the estimates do not factor in indirect warming effects . previously , politicians had suggested raising a europe-wide tax on kerosene , the high-powered fuel used in aircraft engines .
but under pressure from industry leaders , that proposal has made little headway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boom in budget airlines has hugely increased air traffic february , baden-württemberg ’ s general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , thomas strobl , suggested an alternative .
he joined calls from his social democratic and green counterparts to levy a flat fee on the price of airline tickets . strobl said that “ flying is much too cheap compared to taking the train , ” and that an additional ten euros is within any traveller ’ s budget .
a boom in low-fare airlines has greatly increased the amount of air traffic in europe in recent years .
the rail industry is heavily subsidized in most european countries , while air travel is not . airlines resist proposal but the flat-tax proposal is bound to encounter resistance from the airline industry .
the european regions airline association represents over 220 flight-related companies in europe , and spokeswoman lesley shepherd responded with a “ clear ‘ no ’ ” to the idea . “ we are not in favour of environmental taxes - they do not benefit the environment , ” she said .
she called strobl ’ s proposal a “ misconception . ” lesley suggested that government revenues from environmental taxes are not always used for environmental research .
she said “ the real reason -lrb- for the fee -rrb- is to stop people from flying . ” indeed , the debate began late last year when politicians called on germans to avoid jetting off to far-flung destinations and holiday at home instead .

the money would be used to fund environmental development . tanja gönner , the conservative environment minister in the southern german state of baden-württemberg , told german daily berliner zeitung on thursday that the measure “ would enable us to finance climate protection activities at home or in developing countries . ” the fee should not exceed “ the high single-digit or low double-digit bracket , ” gönner told the paper . the proposal is part of an ongoing debate on how to call the flight industry to account for its contribution to global warming . boom in discount airlines last month german economics minster michael glos said aircraft were responsible for 1.5 percent of climate-damaging emissions worldwide .
the european union said aviation makes up 3 percent of direct greenhouse gas emissions , though the estimates do not factor in indirect warming effects . previously , politicians had suggested raising a europe-wide tax on kerosene , the high-powered fuel used in aircraft engines .
but under pressure from industry leaders , that proposal has made little headway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boom in budget airlines has hugely increased air traffic february , baden-württemberg ’ s general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , thomas strobl , suggested an alternative .
he joined calls from his social democratic and green counterparts to levy a flat fee on the price of airline tickets . strobl said that “ flying is much too cheap compared to taking the train , ” and that an additional ten euros is within any traveller ’ s budget .
a boom in low-fare airlines has greatly increased the amount of air traffic in europe in recent years .
the rail industry is heavily subsidized in most european countries , while air travel is not . airlines resist proposal but the flat-tax proposal is bound to encounter resistance from the airline industry .
the european regions airline association represents over 220 flight-related companies in europe , and spokeswoman lesley shepherd responded with a “ clear ‘ no ’ ” to the idea . “ we are not in favour of environmental taxes - they do not benefit the environment , ” she said .
she called strobl ’ s proposal a “ misconception . ” lesley suggested that government revenues from environmental taxes are not always used for environmental research .
she said “ the real reason -lrb- for the fee -rrb- is to stop people from flying . ” indeed , the debate began late last year when politicians called on germans to avoid jetting off to far-flung destinations and holiday at home instead .
the latest proposal was timed to coincide with the publication of the second united nations report on climate change , due to appear on friday . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany seeks emerging economies ' support on climate deal germany is to ask for the support of emerging economies for greater climate protection and push for a long-term anti-global warming agreement at a meeting of leading industrial nations ' environment ministers .

" sophisticated political theater , " " perfect british diplomacy , " - or both ?
the international press reacted to the release , after 13 days ' captivity , of 15 british sailors held hostage in iran . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad ’ s move to call the hostage release a “ gift ” to the british people was nothing less than a “ sophisticated piece of political theatre , in which the president turned what had become a diplomatic disaster for iran into something of a personal victory , ” uk daily the guardian wrote . but just how effective was the “ pardon ” in the end ? “ ultimately , the larger issue is the effect of all this on the wider stage , ” the paper mused .
“ surely the real lesson to draw from yesterday ’ s theatre is that quiet diplomacy does work and that it can work in the future . ” summing up , the paper argued : “ there is no substitute for direct negotiation , especially with a revolutionary islamic regime in iran , for whom the popularly held grievance about past american and british interference in the gulf is as important as the issue in hand . ” “ iran ’ s president is the uncrowned king of tragicomic political theater , ” agreed the basler zeitung of basel , switzerland .
“ the way he announced the freeing of the 15 captive british sailors was as grotesque as it was masterful . … so , did iran cave in to the angry reactions of the international community ?
were they scared of a threatening liberation action by the british and americans ?
not a chance .
from outside , at least , it looks like iran once again played a perfect hand , and made its political point . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad announced the release at a press conference in tehran but in rome , the daily il messaggero wondered what london had to agree to in order to negotiation the sailors ’ release : “ the release of the the british sailors will no doubt relax relations between britain and tehran . … we don ’ t know yet what quid pro quo the government in london accepted , but it is sure that there was one .
and it wouldn ’ t be surprising if there were a prisoner exchange .
but that would only happen at such time when london and washington could claim they are sticking to their stated principle of not accepting a quid pro quo , ” the paper wrote . “ in any case , there is no reason to be shocked : there have always been prisoner exchanges , whether of soldiers or of journalists . ” dutch newspaper de volkskrant also mulled what , exactly , went on behind the scenes of negotiations . “ in the coming days we will doubtless find out the basics of what went on between london and tehran when it came to arranging for the release of the british hostages , ” de volkskrant wrote .
“ but it is already clear that the affair can not be seen without making a connection to the kidnapping of an iranian diplomat and the arrest of five iranian fighters in iraq .
on tuesday , it was announced that the diplomat will be released , and an iranian consul can visit the fighters .
it is clear that the whole affair was not simply about iran ’ s territorial integrity , or of pardons or shows of might .
it was an exchange . ” bulgaria ’ s monitor newspaper saw the dealings as a major coup for the uk on the world political stage .
“ there is no doubt the sailors have perfect british diplomacy to thank ” for their release , the paper wrote .
“ it was no secret that london started backstage negotiations two or three days ago .
clearly , the brits could give all of humanity a break if they could quickly negotiate between tehran and washinton , like they did in the case of the sailors . ” finally , austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten said the risk of escalation was too big in the situation - and everyone involved knew it . “ a new ahmadinedschad ; the heavily embattled iranian president can celebrate an urgently needed victory .
both sides managed to reach their goals , including the release of iranian hardliners captured by the british , without any loss of face .
uk premier tony blair did not need to apologize for supposed border violations , nor did the regime in tehran need to tone down its loud threats .
for both parties , the risk of escalation appeared too great .

but that would only happen at such time when london and washington could claim they are sticking to their stated principle of not accepting a quid pro quo , ” the paper wrote . “ in any case , there is no reason to be shocked : there have always been prisoner exchanges , whether of soldiers or of journalists . ” dutch newspaper de volkskrant also mulled what , exactly , went on behind the scenes of negotiations . “ in the coming days we will doubtless find out the basics of what went on between london and tehran when it came to arranging for the release of the british hostages , ” de volkskrant wrote .
“ but it is already clear that the affair can not be seen without making a connection to the kidnapping of an iranian diplomat and the arrest of five iranian fighters in iraq .
on tuesday , it was announced that the diplomat will be released , and an iranian consul can visit the fighters .
it is clear that the whole affair was not simply about iran ’ s territorial integrity , or of pardons or shows of might .
it was an exchange . ” bulgaria ’ s monitor newspaper saw the dealings as a major coup for the uk on the world political stage .
“ there is no doubt the sailors have perfect british diplomacy to thank ” for their release , the paper wrote .
“ it was no secret that london started backstage negotiations two or three days ago .
clearly , the brits could give all of humanity a break if they could quickly negotiate between tehran and washinton , like they did in the case of the sailors . ” finally , austria ’ s salzburger nachrichten said the risk of escalation was too big in the situation - and everyone involved knew it . “ a new ahmadinedschad ; the heavily embattled iranian president can celebrate an urgently needed victory .
both sides managed to reach their goals , including the release of iranian hardliners captured by the british , without any loss of face .
uk premier tony blair did not need to apologize for supposed border violations , nor did the regime in tehran need to tone down its loud threats .
for both parties , the risk of escalation appeared too great .

the money would be used to fund environmental development . tanja gönner , the conservative environment minister in the southern german state of baden-württemberg , told german daily berliner zeitung on thursday that the measure “ would enable us to finance climate protection activities at home or in developing countries . ” the fee should not exceed “ the high single-digit or low double-digit bracket , ” gönner told the paper . the proposal is part of an ongoing debate on how to call the flight industry to account for its contribution to global warming . boom in discount airlines last month german economics minster michael glos said aircraft were responsible for 1.5 percent of climate-damaging emissions worldwide .
the european union said aviation makes up 3 percent of direct greenhouse gas emissions , though the estimates do not factor in indirect warming effects . previously , politicians had suggested raising a europe-wide tax on kerosene , the high-powered fuel used in aircraft engines .
but under pressure from industry leaders , that proposal has made little headway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boom in budget airlines has hugely increased air traffic february , baden-württemberg ’ s general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , thomas strobl , suggested an alternative .
he joined calls from his social democratic and green counterparts to levy a flat fee on the price of airline tickets . strobl said that “ flying is much too cheap compared to taking the train , ” and that an additional ten euros is within any traveller ’ s budget .
a boom in low-fare airlines has greatly increased the amount of air traffic in europe in recent years .
the rail industry is heavily subsidized in most european countries , while air travel is not . airlines resist proposal but the flat-tax proposal is bound to encounter resistance from the airline industry .
the european regions airline association represents over 220 flight-related companies in europe , and spokeswoman lesley shepherd responded with a “ clear ‘ no ’ ” to the idea . “ we are not in favour of environmental taxes - they do not benefit the environment , ” she said .
she called strobl ’ s proposal a “ misconception . ” lesley suggested that government revenues from environmental taxes are not always used for environmental research .
she said “ the real reason -lrb- for the fee -rrb- is to stop people from flying . ” indeed , the debate began late last year when politicians called on germans to avoid jetting off to far-flung destinations and holiday at home instead .
the latest proposal was timed to coincide with the publication of the second united nations report on climate change , due to appear on friday . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany seeks emerging economies ' support on climate deal germany is to ask for the support of emerging economies for greater climate protection and push for a long-term anti-global warming agreement at a meeting of leading industrial nations ' environment ministers .

" egypt 's sunken treasures , " an exhibition of artifacts unearthed during goddio 's excavations , went on show in bonn on thursday . dw-world.de : after thousands of excursions to sunken cities and shipwrecks around the world , your living room must look like an adventurous place . franck goddio : well , it 's not an adventure .
i would say it 's a job , and we are doing this job very professionally .
we plan each mission carefully and train our staff for that , and before starting , there is a lot of paperwork that has to be done . before you started to search for sunken treasures , you studied mathematics and worked as a financial consultant .
how does that fit with archaeology ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goddio devoted himself to marine archeology in the 1980s as a matter of fact , it does help .
after 10 years in finance , i decided to take a one-year break .
i looked at what at the time has been done in underwater archaeology , and i realized that there was a need for a privately funded independent institute that could work for governments and other institutions . you opened such an institute for underwater archaeology in paris in 1985 .
were you always sure that it would become a success story ? maybe i was a little naive at the beginning .
when i started to search for the sunken parts of alexandria in 1984 the geophysical instruments that you need for missions like that did n't exist . but you did find ancient alexandria in the end . but for alexandria , it took years and years because we had to perform a four-year geophysical survey before we even had a detailed map that showed that there was something under the sediment .
it 's a bit like modern surgery .
you use the scanner , and then afterwards , when you know where to search , you do the operation at the right place . are you still thrilled by your work ? it 's very hard work because for months and months you only sail along straight lines in the harbor , towing instruments and registering data in order to create an electronic map .
when you start to see the map , you get this feeling that there is something down there .
and only then does it become thrilling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of artifacts are on show in bonn it seems that your work has little in common with an indiana jones adventure . not at all , on the contrary i would say .
my job is to prevent adventure . when you take artifacts from the ancient port of alexandria , you put them in different colored baskets .
does the color mean something ? the color is in fact no criteria , but you need these baskets in order to desalinate the artifacts .
when you raise it from the sea , where the object has been for some 2,000 years , you have to remove the salt .
for a small artifact , this can take a few days .
for a very big artefact , like the statue of hapi -lrb- editor 's note : a more than five-meter or 16-feet high statue -rrb- , we needed 18 months to remove the salt . what happens if you do n't do that ? the stone will disintegrate .
chemical reactions will make the stone weaker , until it finally disintegrates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this stele of the ptolemy is also part of the exhibition the exhibition in bonn is showing 500 artifacts , most of them from alexandria .
what kind of feeling should the exhibition evoke in visitors ? we found all the artifacts right next to each other .
they were on the same place for thousands of years and supplemented each other , they were literally living together .
in the exhibition you can see that they speak to each other . who owns the artifacts ? they belong to egypt of course .
all artifacts that you see in the exhibit in bonn will one day end up in a museum which will be built for them - in alexandria . " egypt 's sunken treasures " runs until jan .

he is now preparing to start up a small business to provide for himself and his two brothers davison , 14 , and evance , 12 .
it is a huge turnaround in his life since his parents passed away from aids - his father first in 2001 and his mother in 2004 .
i met steve in southern malawi earlier this month .
before travelling i was convinced of the case that scotland should be giving more practical assistance to what has been described as its ' sister nation ' .
the statistics spoke for themselves ; life expectancy is dropping and is now just 36 , largely because of hiv / aids .
a total of 65 % of rural malawians live below the poverty line , with 40 % attempting to survive on less than 15p a day .
although statistics can tell a shocking story , it is not until you meet real people struggling to survive against the odds that the deep poverty malawians face hits home .
scotland 's renewed interest in the country dates from 2005 when the world 's politicians and media decamped to gleneagles to try to ' make poverty history ' .
one outcome of that summer , when 250,000 people marched through central edinburgh and millions more wore white wristbands , was scotland establishing our own international development policy focused mainly on malawi .
an initial budget of £ 3m per annum , rising shortly thereafter to £ 4.5 , was an acknowledgement that the scottish public supported action from our own politicians and that , as some put it , ' there was more than enough poverty to go round ' . "
as a scottish taxpayer i had no doubt whatsoever that this was a good use of funds " malcolm fleming in malawi i saw for myself some of the good that our infant aid policy has made , and also the need for us to do much more .
i also met steve julio and his brothers and learned how scottish money had changed their lives totally .
as a scottish taxpayer i had no doubt whatsoever that this was a good use of funds .
in golden village , the small hamlet in chiradzulu where the brothers live , steve told me about his parents and how he had coped since their death .
the story was one of tragedy but also opportunity .
" when our parents were alive we never really had any challenges in meeting basic needs , " said steve .
' could n't concentrate ' " the challenges started when dad died as he was the main breadwinner .
" but still mum tried hard .
working our vegetable garden we grew and sold tomatoes to have a little to keep going . "
however in june 2004 , aline julio also passed away , one of hundreds of thousands of malawians , and millions of africans , who have succumbed to the disease .
" between that january when mum got sick , and june when she died , i could n't concentrate on school as i had to take care of her and tend the garden , " steve said .
" when she died i felt very sad .
i felt like the world had come to an end . "
when his mother died steve was 14-years-old and in the first year of secondary school .
after her death he had to combine school with caring for his brothers and tending the garden to try and bring in an income . "
i had wanted to be a lawyer , but that dream died with my mother " steve julio shortly afterwards the eldest brother had to drop out of school as he had no money to pay the fees .
" i got good grades so felt very sad as i 'd done so well at school , but i had no option , " he said .
" i had wanted to be a lawyer , but that dream died with my mother . "
in february 2006 , oxfam , with the help of the local village development committee , began identifying orphans who still had the potential to continue school .
using funds from scotland , oxfam supported steve to go to a local vocational college .
" it felt great as i realised i still had an opportunity to do something to get a livelihood and assist my brothers , " he said .
when he finished training at the end of march , oxfam gave him a tool kit and a small loan to start his own small carpentry business .
' a future ' " i will scout for work , pay back the loan and then someone else can benefit from the money , " he said .
" i 'm very happy and feel that we really have a future . "
part of steve 's course included book-keeping , so he will be able to manage his resources , open a bank account and hopefully be able to pay school fees for his brother .
" our lives have turned round , " he said .
" after mum died we ate one meal a day , now we have three . "
and as for the future ?
" well , i think a lot about what i should do , " steve said .
" i keep thinking hard all the time to ensure my brothers are well taken care of .
it 's not a burden , it 's a responsibility . "
" i also talk to my brothers about aids .
the disease has destroyed our lives as they were and we need to be very careful . "
he said the most important things are food and education .
while i 've been talking with steve , his brothers davison and evance have been listening quietly .
i ask them what they think of their brother .
davison said : " he is a big brother but because of the things he does he has taken the role of our parents . "
earlier this year , with the scottish elections approaching , oxfam in scotland and oxfam in malawi called on scotland 's political parties to outline what more they would do to deliver more and better aid for malawi .
our argument was that if our politicians warm words were to make a real and lasting difference , scotland needs to significantly increase our aid budget and ensure it is spent in an effective , sustainable way .
unachievable ambition it should be targeted at the poorest and led by malawian priorities , not scottish politics .
in malawi i saw the difference that has been made to people 's lives with just a relatively small amount of money , but i also realised just how much more needs to be done .
hopefully over the next few weeks of the scottish election campaign our politicians will set out how they will respond that particular challenge .
and maybe , just maybe , someday steve julio will realise his dreams and become a lawyer .
it had seemed an unachievable ambition when he first mentioned it .
but by the end of our conversation i wondered whether that dream might just come true one day .

it is a huge turnaround in his life since his parents passed away from aids - his father first in 2001 and his mother in 2004 .
i met steve in southern malawi earlier this month .
steve , davison and evance were orphaned in 2004 before travelling i was convinced of the case that scotland should be giving more practical assistance to what has been described as its ' sister nation ' .
the statistics spoke for themselves ; life expectancy is dropping and is now just 36 , largely because of hiv / aids .
a total of 65 % of rural malawians live below the poverty line , with 40 % attempting to survive on less than 15p a day .
although statistics can tell a shocking story , it is not until you meet real people struggling to survive against the odds that the deep poverty malawians face hits home .
scotland 's renewed interest in the country dates from 2005 when the world 's politicians and media decamped to gleneagles to try to ' make poverty history ' .
one outcome of that summer , when 250,000 people marched through central edinburgh and millions more wore white wristbands , was scotland establishing our own international development policy focused mainly on malawi .
an initial budget of £ 3m per annum , rising shortly thereafter to £ 4.5 , was an acknowledgement that the scottish public supported action from our own politicians and that , as some put it , ' there was more than enough poverty to go round ' .
as a scottish taxpayer i had no doubt whatsoever that this was a good use of funds malcolm fleming in malawi i saw for myself some of the good that our infant aid policy has made , and also the need for us to do much more .
i also met steve julio and his brothers and learned how scottish money had changed their lives totally .
as a scottish taxpayer i had no doubt whatsoever that this was a good use of funds .
in golden village , the small hamlet in chiradzulu where the brothers live , steve told me about his parents and how he had coped since their death .
the story was one of tragedy but also opportunity .
" when our parents were alive we never really had any challenges in meeting basic needs , " said steve .
' could n't concentrate ' " the challenges started when dad died as he was the main breadwinner .
" but still mum tried hard .
working our vegetable garden we grew and sold tomatoes to have a little to keep going . "
however in june 2004 , aline julio also passed away , one of hundreds of thousands of malawians , and millions of africans , who have succumbed to the disease .
" between that january when mum got sick , and june when she died , i could n't concentrate on school as i had to take care of her and tend the garden , " steve said .
" when she died i felt very sad .
i felt like the world had come to an end . "
when his mother died steve was 14-years-old and in the first year of secondary school .
after her death he had to combine school with caring for his brothers and tending the garden to try and bring in an income .
i had wanted to be a lawyer , but that dream died with my mother steve julio shortly afterwards the eldest brother had to drop out of school as he had no money to pay the fees .
" i got good grades so felt very sad as i 'd done so well at school , but i had no option , " he said .
" i had wanted to be a lawyer , but that dream died with my mother . "
in february 2006 , oxfam , with the help of the local village development committee , began identifying orphans who still had the potential to continue school .
using funds from scotland , oxfam supported steve to go to a local vocational college .
" it felt great as i realised i still had an opportunity to do something to get a livelihood and assist my brothers , " he said .
when he finished training at the end of march , oxfam gave him a tool kit and a small loan to start his own small carpentry business .
' a future ' " i will scout for work , pay back the loan and then someone else can benefit from the money , " he said .
" i 'm very happy and feel that we really have a future . "
part of steve 's course included book-keeping , so he will be able to manage his resources , open a bank account and hopefully be able to pay school fees for his brother .
" our lives have turned round , " he said .
" after mum died we ate one meal a day , now we have three . "
and as for the future ?
" well , i think a lot about what i should do , " steve said .
" i keep thinking hard all the time to ensure my brothers are well taken care of .
it 's not a burden , it 's a responsibility . "
steve hopes to be able to pay his brothers ' school fees " i also talk to my brothers about aids .
the disease has destroyed our lives as they were and we need to be very careful . "
he said the most important things are food and education .
while i 've been talking with steve , his brothers davison and evance have been listening quietly .
i ask them what they think of their brother .
davison said : " he is a big brother but because of the things he does he has taken the role of our parents . "
earlier this year , with the scottish elections approaching , oxfam in scotland and oxfam in malawi called on scotland 's political parties to outline what more they would do to deliver more and better aid for malawi .
our argument was that if our politicians warm words were to make a real and lasting difference , scotland needs to significantly increase our aid budget and ensure it is spent in an effective , sustainable way .
unachievable ambition it should be targeted at the poorest and led by malawian priorities , not scottish politics .
in malawi i saw the difference that has been made to people 's lives with just a relatively small amount of money , but i also realised just how much more needs to be done .
hopefully over the next few weeks of the scottish election campaign our politicians will set out how they will respond that particular challenge .
and maybe , just maybe , someday steve julio will realise his dreams and become a lawyer .
it had seemed an unachievable ambition when he first mentioned it .
but by the end of our conversation i wondered whether that dream might just come true one day .

helping to offset any problems will be strong growth in nations such as china , and a recovery in japan and europe .
the us is the world 's largest economy and has shown signs of slowing as a weaker housing market has dampened consumer confidence and spending .

" most countries should be in a position to decouple from the us economy and sustain strong growth if the us slowdown remains moderate as expected , " the imf said in its world economic outlook report .

that is a slower rate of growth than the imf predicted in september and reflects the increased problems in the us housing market .
since the turn of the year , problems with the sub-prime mortgage market have further fanned fears about a slump in house prices .
sub-prime lenders provide mortgages to people with poor or non-existent credit histories , and higher interest rates have pushed defaults to a record level .
the worry for the imf is that while the effects of these problems have been limited , should they spread then their impact on other nations could become far greater .
" with the us slowdown to date largely driven by the cooling domestic housing market , spillovers to growth elsewhere have been limited , " the imf said .
" if the housing market downturn spread to consumption and business investment , however , then cross-border spillovers could be significantly larger , " it warned .

the awards have been set up to highlight the rural hideaways that have been in the shadow of bigger seaside resorts .

"
he said the awards were based on the experiences of seaside visitors who " told us what they need from their beaches and beach awards , and we listened " .
the two beaches named as good for " a bit of coastal isolation " were holywell in eastbourne and normans bay , both in east sussex .
the region 's three best beaches for taking a dip were in east and west sussex - the stretch from eastbourne pier to wish tower , camber , and west wittering .
canterbury had two beaches named as good for " a nice seaside stroll " - herne bay east and reculver .

where have you been for the last 10 years ?
my first record was released here and it did very well in the states , too .
but the next two records were very different and my record company in america thought i was crazy .
they said : " why do n't you just do what christina aguilera and britney spears are doing ?
they 're doing so well . "
and i totally understand that , but i wanted to do my own thing , and it meant i made two records that they did n't release .
a lot of people would have given up at that point .
i probably could have done , but then this idea of starting my own record company came about and it was really my salvation .
it totally made it possible for me to make pop music but make it on my own terms .
the singer 's theatrical background is reflected in her videos the record does n't sound like a lot of other pop albums .
is it important to you to create something that sounds unique ?
that 's what pop music is supposed to be .
it 's supposed to be modern .
it 's supposed to describe the present time .
and so it 's natural that it 's always pushing boundaries .
but the most important thing to me is the songs .
the album 's first single , konichiwa bitches , includes a lot of tongue-in-cheek boasts , such as " i 'll count you out like a mathematician " .
what inspired the lyrics ?
i grew up with hip-hop and i 've always been fascinated by that classic hip-hop theme of you being the best and everyone else being stupid and they suck .
but of course i 'm not biggie , so i ca n't go talking about drugs and guns .
i need to speak about what 's relevant to me .
so that 's how konichiwa bitches came about .
you have also covered prince 's jack u off .
of all the hundreds of prince songs , why that one ?
you ca n't cover purple rain - it 's impossible !
jack u off is a great song because it 's unpretentious and it 's funny .
you know , people think prince is weird but he 's not .
he 's very on point with people 's inner relationships .
i think that 's his genius .
you 're a big star in sweden .
is it strange to come over here and play small-scale club gigs ?
not at all - i really enjoy myself .
i feel totally cool with being a debut artist .
i 'm glad that people do n't know my other records , because it means i can start over .
robyn named her record label after the song konichiwa bitches and people seem to know all the words already ...
i think there are a lot of swedish people there !
but i 'm totally excited about the chance i 'm getting to have contact with my fans .
because i have my record label now it 's all very direct and organic .
the last show was 200 people and now it 's 300 people .
i 'm really enjoying it .
what 's the strangest haircut you 've ever had ?
my mother used to shave my head when i was a little girl .
she thought it would make my hair grow thicker but it never did .
it 's always been thin and swedish .
and , because my name is a boy 's name in sweden , when i met people with my shaved head i 'd have to say : " my name 's robyn but i 'm a girl ! "
if you were made prime minister , what would you do first ?
that 's a hard question ...
i would probably try to deal with the energy issue .
it 's something i 've been interested in for years .
sweden is quite a green country but no-one is independent from fuel and coal and gas resources .
finally , if you were a household appliance , which one would you be ?
i 'd be a dishwasher , i think that 's a great machine .
a time saver .
robyn 's album is out now .
she was talking to bbc news entertainment reporter mark savage .

the flaw came to light in late march and lets attackers take over vulnerable pcs via booby-trapped websites .
warcraft players seem to be one of the targets because accounts for the game are potentially worth significant sums of money .
microsoft has issued a patch for the flaw early to combat the rising number of attacks .
player power security firms tracking how criminal hackers are exploiting the cursor flaw suspect there are many websites hosting the code that can be used to take over vulnerable pcs .
some of the sites have been specially created but others have been hacked to be unwitting hosts for the infection .
the potential for the flaw to do harm grew significantly with the discovery of a website that automatically generates all the attack files needed to turn a site into a booby-trap .
a large number of criminally-minded hacking gangs are cashing in on the flaw .
one chinese group known to be using the animated cursor flaw scored some success in february when it managed to hack a superbowl website and use it to host code for spyware .
there is a ready market for card data on the net analysis of that malicious software showed that it lay dormant on a victims machine until they ran world of warcraft -lrb- wow -rrb- at which point it captured login data and sent it to the hacking group .
the group 's enthusiastic use of the cursor flaw suggests it is trying to do the same again .
the online fantasy game now has more than eight million active players around the world .
research by security firm symantec suggests that the raw value of a wow account is now higher than a credit card and its associated verification data .
one card can be sold for up to $ 6 -lrb- £ 3 -rrb- suggests symantec , but a wow account will be worth at least $ 10 .
an account that has several high level characters associated with it could be worth far more as the gold and rare items can be sold for real cash .
in a bid to head off the growing threat from the animated cursor flaw , microsoft took the unusual step of releasing a patch for the bug on 3 april .
usually microsoft issues security patches on the second tuesday of every month .
the patch for the cursor flaw arrived a week early and microsoft has been preparing it since december when the bug was first reported .
windows users can get the patch via automatic updates or visit microsoft to download it manually .
on its security blog , microsoft said the patch was released early " to help better protect customers from this threat " .
the software giant urged windows users to download and install the patch .
it said there was a chance that attacks via the vulnerability would increase but had seen little evidence of widespread use yet .

the flaw came to light in late march and lets attackers take over vulnerable pcs via booby-trapped websites .
warcraft players seem to be one of the targets because accounts for the game are potentially worth significant sums of money .
microsoft has issued a patch for the flaw early to combat the rising number of attacks .
player power security firms tracking how criminal hackers are exploiting the cursor flaw suspect there are many websites hosting the code that can be used to take over vulnerable pcs .
some of the sites have been specially created but others have been hacked to be unwitting hosts for the infection .
the potential for the flaw to do harm grew significantly with the discovery of a website that automatically generates all the attack files needed to turn a site into a booby-trap .
a large number of criminally-minded hacking gangs are cashing in on the flaw .
one chinese group known to be using the animated cursor flaw scored some success in february when it managed to hack a superbowl website and use it to host code for spyware .
there is a ready market for card data on the net analysis of that malicious software showed that it lay dormant on a victims machine until they ran world of warcraft -lrb- wow -rrb- at which point it captured login data and sent it to the hacking group .
the group 's enthusiastic use of the cursor flaw suggests it is trying to do the same again .
the online fantasy game now has more than eight million active players around the world .
research by security firm symantec suggests that the raw value of a wow account is now higher than a credit card and its associated verification data .
one card can be sold for up to $ 6 -lrb- £ 3 -rrb- suggests symantec , but a wow account will be worth at least $ 10 .
an account that has several high level characters associated with it could be worth far more as the gold and rare items can be sold for real cash .
in a bid to head off the growing threat from the animated cursor flaw , microsoft took the unusual step of releasing a patch for the bug on 3 april .
usually microsoft issues security patches on the second tuesday of every month .

amid all the speculation , the fate of its loss-making north american unit , chrysler , was the main topic on the agenda .
daimlerchrysler 's chief executive dieter zetsche admitted for the first time that the group has started negotiations with a number of parties about the sale of chrysler .
speaking at the meeting , mr zetsche said : " i can confirm that we are talking with some of the potential partners who have shown a clear interest . "
but he refused to be drawn on any details about the identity of these potential buyers .
" we need to keep all options open and i can not disclose any details , because we need to have the maximum scope for manoeuvre , " he said .
' hellish marriage ' many angry shareholders stood up during the meeting to condemn the transatlantic merger which took place between daimler-benz and chrysler in 1998 .
the saying went in the us , if you want to buy chrysler , then you also have to buy a permanent mechanic willie wolf , daimlerchrysler investor one investor from munich said it was a " marriage made in hell " and he urged the group to get rid of the chrysler division as soon as possible .

dieter zetsche faces some tough discussions over selling chrysler " there are so many problems in the us car market .
i have invested quite a lot of money in these stocks because i always thought that the group was producing great cars - like mercedes .

' mess ' mr zetsche said any decision on chrysler 's future had to be the best solution for both companies , as well as workers and customers .
merging with chrysler has not been enjoyable for daimler but investors were keen to hear how the management were planning to save the group from hitting major trouble .
" i hope that we do n't reach the time when we are in a real crisis , " said klaus fiereck , a shareholder from stuttgart .
" there are many differences between the german company daimler-benz and the us division , chrysler .
" maybe next year there will be two separate companies , one in the us and one here in germany .
i think they will go their separate ways by 2008 , " he added .
" my son called me in 1998 when he was living in america and told me that daimler-benz wanted to buy chrysler , " said willie wolf , an investor from munich .

amid all the speculation , the fate of its loss-making north american unit , chrysler , was the main topic on the agenda .
daimlerchrysler 's chief executive dieter zetsche admitted for the first time that the group has started negotiations with a number of parties about the sale of chrysler .
speaking at the meeting , mr zetsche said : " i can confirm that we are talking with some of the potential partners who have shown a clear interest . "
but he refused to be drawn on any details about the identity of these potential buyers .
" we need to keep all options open and i can not disclose any details , because we need to have the maximum scope for manoeuvre , " he said .
' hellish marriage ' many angry shareholders stood up during the meeting to condemn the transatlantic merger which took place between daimler-benz and chrysler in 1998 .
the saying went in the us , if you want to buy chrysler , then you also have to buy a permanent mechanic willie wolf , daimlerchrysler investor one investor from munich said it was a " marriage made in hell " and he urged the group to get rid of the chrysler division as soon as possible .
" i have very good friends over in michigan , and i spoke to them yesterday , and i am pretty sure daimlerchrysler will break-up , " said christian fabricius , another shareholder from munich .
dieter zetsche faces some tough discussions over selling chrysler " there are so many problems in the us car market .
i have invested quite a lot of money in these stocks because i always thought that the group was producing great cars - like mercedes .
" but there are big problems with chrysler , all these cars are not fuel-efficient , they were n't thinking about greenhouse gas emissions .
" daimler-benz and chrysler will have to split up and in the long-run that 's better for the mercedes car group , " he added .
henning gebhardt , from dws , a major german asset management firm said he would be happy if " chrysler is finally led before the divorce judge " .
" but what happens if you do n't find a new bridegroom or if he demands an inappropriately high dowry ? "
' mess ' mr zetsche said any decision on chrysler 's future had to be the best solution for both companies , as well as workers and customers .
merging with chrysler has not been enjoyable for daimler but investors were keen to hear how the management were planning to save the group from hitting major trouble .
" i hope that we do n't reach the time when we are in a real crisis , " said klaus fiereck , a shareholder from stuttgart .
" there are many differences between the german company daimler-benz and the us division , chrysler .
" maybe next year there will be two separate companies , one in the us and one here in germany .
i think they will go their separate ways by 2008 , " he added .
" my son called me in 1998 when he was living in america and told me that daimler-benz wanted to buy chrysler , " said willie wolf , an investor from munich .
" and as the saying went in the us , if you want to buy chrysler , then you also have to buy a permanent mechanic .
" almost 10 years later , here we are in this mess .
daimler has to separate from chrysler as fast as possible . "
according to media reports , a few bidders have already expressed an interest in buying chrysler , including the private equity firms , cerberus capital management , and the blackstone group , as well as the canadian car-parts supplier magna international .
there are even rumours that there could be a deal later this month , although some analysts have urged caution , warning that any negotiations will be protracted and tough .

in october , the multi-millionaire donated £ 100,000 to the snp 's campaign to create a " level playing field " with the other parties .
he told bbc scotland that the majority of people wanted a change from the current " halfway house " of devolution .
however , cbi scotland warned last year that seeking more powers for holyrood should not dominate the elections .
speaking to newsnight scotland , kwik-fit founder sir tom would still not confirm outright who he would be voting for at the may elections .
but he said : " i would like to see more responsibility and more scottish affairs being under our own control .
" so , yes , i think i have a leaning now more towards the snp than i had before . "
" if we had a government whose responsibility was to collect the money - they could only spend that which they collected - we would be a lot better off " sir tom farmer sir tom added : " i do n't feel happy with the current situation where we are half pregnant .
it 's a halfway house that we have just now .
" what 's happened with devolution is it has not met people 's expectations ... and they feel , quite simply , that having had a coalition management of a devolved parliament that it 's time for change and they want to see that change happening and this is the opportunity in this election . "
sir tom said he believed fiscal autonomy would make the administration in scotland more efficient .
" there 's a general feeling that bureaucracy and cost is not something that 's very tightly controlled at the moment , " he said .
" if we had a government whose responsibility was to collect the money - they could only spend that which they collected - we would be a lot better off . "
he also said he did not believe big business would leave scotland if an snp-led scottish parliament called for a referendum . "
i do n't think the snp have convinced a majority of business leaders that the balance of advantage lies in cessation from the united kingdom " iain mcmillan sir tom said about 90 % of businesses in scotland did not think that the scottish executive had been pro-business .
iain mcmillan , director of cbi scotland , told newsnight scotland that he believed a number of successful business leaders would disagree with sir tom farmer .
he said : " he does appear to be calling for the defeat of the current labour party and the liberal democrat party in terms of their coalition . "
when asked to comment on the economic implications of independence for scotland , he said : " i think there are questions outstanding , i do n't think yet , to be fair to the snp , that they have convinced a majority of business leaders that the balance of advantage lies in cessation from the united kingdom . "
' dependency culture ' last month the former royal bank of scotland chairman sir george mathewson backed snp leader alex salmond to be the next first minister of scotland .
he said independence could liberate scotland from a " dependency culture " .
his comments were dismissed by prime minister tony blair as " self-indulgent and absurd " .
rangers fc chairman sir david murray also joined the debate , by accusing mr salmond of " intimidating " scotland 's business community into staying silent on independence .
the tycoon said " time was running out " for captains of industry to stand up for the union before may 's election .

in october , the multi-millionaire donated £ 100,000 to the snp 's campaign to create a " level playing field " with the other parties .
he told bbc scotland that the majority of people wanted a change from the current " halfway house " of devolution .
however , cbi scotland warned last year that seeking more powers for holyrood should not dominate the elections .
speaking to newsnight scotland , kwik-fit founder sir tom would still not confirm outright who he would be voting for at the may elections .
but he said : " i would like to see more responsibility and more scottish affairs being under our own control .
" so , yes , i think i have a leaning now more towards the snp than i had before . "
if we had a government whose responsibility was to collect the money - they could only spend that which they collected - we would be a lot better off sir tom farmer sir tom added : " i do n't feel happy with the current situation where we are half pregnant .
it 's a halfway house that we have just now .
" what 's happened with devolution is it has not met people 's expectations ... and they feel , quite simply , that having had a coalition management of a devolved parliament that it 's time for change and they want to see that change happening and this is the opportunity in this election . "
sir tom said he believed fiscal autonomy would make the administration in scotland more efficient .
" there 's a general feeling that bureaucracy and cost is not something that 's very tightly controlled at the moment , " he said .
" if we had a government whose responsibility was to collect the money - they could only spend that which they collected - we would be a lot better off . "
he also said he did not believe big business would leave scotland if an snp-led scottish parliament called for a referendum .
i do n't think the snp have convinced a majority of business leaders that the balance of advantage lies in cessation from the united kingdom iain mcmillan sir tom said about 90 % of businesses in scotland did not think that the scottish executive had been pro-business .
iain mcmillan , director of cbi scotland , told newsnight scotland that he believed a number of successful business leaders would disagree with sir tom farmer .
he said : " he does appear to be calling for the defeat of the current labour party and the liberal democrat party in terms of their coalition . "
when asked to comment on the economic implications of independence for scotland , he said : " i think there are questions outstanding , i do n't think yet , to be fair to the snp , that they have convinced a majority of business leaders that the balance of advantage lies in cessation from the united kingdom . "
' dependency culture ' last month the former royal bank of scotland chairman sir george mathewson backed snp leader alex salmond to be the next first minister of scotland .
he said independence could liberate scotland from a " dependency culture " .
his comments were dismissed by prime minister tony blair as " self-indulgent and absurd " .
rangers fc chairman sir david murray also joined the debate , by accusing mr salmond of " intimidating " scotland 's business community into staying silent on independence .
the tycoon said " time was running out " for captains of industry to stand up for the union before may 's election .
