18 germany 's chinese population is expected to mark the lunar new year in a similar fashion to years past , though the cloud of seven unexplained murders will hang over the celebrations . chinese in germany celebrate the lunar new year on sunday the way ethnic chinese do all over the world - with family gatherings , visits to friends and lots to eat - but this year the celebrations have been overshadowed by the still-unexplained killings of seven chinese , who were found shot to death in a chinese restaurant near hamburg last week . " people were horrified by this terrible event , " said yu ming chu , chairwoman of the chinese gastronomy section of the german federation of hotels and restaurants . but yu and other members of the chinese community were more upset by the way the german press seized on the story , linking the slayings in the small town of sittensen to gangsters and protection rackets . will customers come back ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six people were found dead in a chinese restaurant , another died later in the hospital " of course there are such cases , but they are very few , " said yu , whose organization represents 62 of the estimated 150 chinese restaurants operating in hamburg . " some of our members reported a sharp drop in business " after the killings , she said she expects customers will return for chinese new year celebrations when many restaurants offer special banquets . her own restaurant in the suburb of niendorf will be offering a 10-course year of the pig menu that includes shanghai-style " nian gao , " a new year 's cake made of glutinous rice . there are up to 80,000 chinese living in germany , about 0.1 percent of the country 's total population .
the largest chinese communities are located in hamburg and berlin . with its huge elbe river port and centuries of tradition in the export trade , hamburg has also become a major hub for chinese firms trying to establish a foothold in europe . about 10,000 chinese live in hamburg , whose links to china date back to the 19th century .
today there are about 400 chinese companies based in the port city , more than any other german or continental european metropolis . " chinese are very well-liked abroad , " said liu jen-kai of the german institute for asian affairs .
" they go about their business and are inconspicuous . " chinese part of everyday european life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is preparing for a weeklong spring festival beginning sunday chinese restaurants are today part of the architecture of almost every german city and a growing number of chinese-owned shops are sprouting up , selling chinese trinkets and other cheap goods . there has also been an influx of students from the people 's republic , making chinese the biggest group of foreigners studying at german universities . " germany is the most popular destination for chinese students after the united states , " liu said .
" most of them stay two to three years before returning home . " in the run-up to chinese new year celebrations , the chinese consulate in hamburg has thrown a reception and the taipei representative office is planning to do the same . the port city 's chinese association is hosting a major function at the plush hamburg conference center , complete with music , dancing and a raffle - but not until feb .
24 . chinese from taiwan , the people 's republic , malaysia , vietnam and other south-east asian nations are expected to attend . " the chinese community is very close , " said yu .
" everyone knows everyone else . " unlike other countries , there are no chinatowns in german cities .
but this does not bother the chinese community , according to yu .
in fact many of them are happy about it . " there are often protection rackets in such places , and many undesirable elements hang out there , " she said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg hosts china time festival it 's " china time " in hamburg - a city with a long history of chinese ties and the " china meets europe " summit set to take place from september 13-15 will be attracting an elite guest list from china and europe .

katharina has directed wagner operas before - " der fliegende holländer " -lrb- the flying dutchman -rrb- in würzburg in 2002 and " lohengrin " in budapest in 2003 . the legendary bayreuth the summer music festival , dedicated exclusively to the works of richard wagner , runs from july 25 to august 28 and comprises 30 performances , all sold-out long in advance .
the waiting list for tickets is currently over 10 years . father wo n't interfere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang wagner , before the ' festspielhaus ' theater in bayreuth this year will be katharina 's debut in the legendary festspielhaus built to the richard wagner 's own designs . bayreuth festival spokesman peter emmerich said that , as a direct descendent of the composer , katharina was " well aware that she must come up with something special , " adding that she " has a strong will of interpretation that wo n't bow even to ' meistersinger . " ' katharina 's production promised to turn on their head some of the cliches attached to the work and challenge traditional wagner fans , emmerich said .
wolfgang , who has himself directed three different stagings of " meistersinger " in bayreuth , had not interfered in katharina 's staging , he added . troupe of young novices in the pit for the new production will be upcoming german conductor sebastian weigle , also making his debut in bayreuth .
many of the mostly young cast of singers will also be singing in the hallowed auditorium for the first time as well , including german bass franz hawlata as hans sachs .
a relative newcomer , us soprano amanda mace , is to sing the role of eva . the only bayreuth veteran in the production will be us tenor robert dean smith as walther von stolzing .
smith has trodden bayreuth 's boards before , in the equally taxing roles of tristan , lohengrin and siegmund . katharina 's partner , endrik von wottrich , is to star as siegmund in the first revival of tankred dorst 's complete four-part " ring , " which critics panned at its premiere last year . some old favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner has big shoes to fill us tenor stephen gould will return in the role of siegfried as well us soprano linda watson as brünnhilde while german star conductor christian thielemann , bayreuth 's unofficial musical director , is to be in the pit once again . italian conductor fabio luisi is to make his debut in a revival of philip arlaud 's well-loved production of " tannhäuser " with german tenor wolfgang millgramm in the title role . the controversial production of " parsifal " by christoph schlingensief , considered the enfant terrible of german theater , is being revived for the final time under the baton of hungarian conductor adam fischer . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bravos and boos for new " ring " production in bayreuth the first " ring " cycle concluded monday to mixed reviews and a polarized audience .

" what people will remember , i have no idea .
i 'm not really a vain person , " chirac tells journalist pierre pean in " the stranger in the elysee , " long extracts of which appeared in this week 's edition of the magazine marianne .
" what i would like them to remember is that ...
france is , or tries to be , a country of tolerance . " chirac said this is what was in his mind in 1995 when he acknowledged france 's complicity in the deportation of jews to nazi germany and later recognizing slavery as a crime against humanity . " what we did during the war towards the jews ... is something i can not imagine as emanating from the human spirit , " he said .
" whether you like it or not , slavery was a tragic moment in the world 's history , and we took part in it . " chirac - who hosted possibly his last france-africa summit in southern france during the week - speaks at length of his respect for non-western cultures , criticizing the colonial-era " looting " of the african continent . regret for african exploitation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac wants to be remembered as a friend of africa " we stole everything they had , and then told them they were no good , " he said .
" now we are using grants to poach their brightest people and keep on telling those that remain : ' these negroes are really good for nothing . " ' from the 1960s , he said he secretly raised funds for nelson mandela 's african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- - priding himself on his public refusal to visit south africa under apartheid . he described his aversion for racism as " something almost physical , " saying he always resisted pressure to strike an alliance with jean-marie le pen 's anti-immigration national front . " a deal with the national front was the line i always refused to cross , " chirac said .
" there is a profound danger there , because you are playing with the lowest of human instincts . " chirac still adamant over iraq decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq spilt was strongest between bush and chirac asked about the decision to go head-to-head with us president george w. bush over the invasion of iraq , chirac stood by his guns . " i told bush over and over that he was making a colossal mistake ...

katharina has directed wagner operas before - " der fliegende holländer " -lrb- the flying dutchman -rrb- in würzburg in 2002 and " lohengrin " in budapest in 2003 . the legendary bayreuth the summer music festival , dedicated exclusively to the works of richard wagner , runs from july 25 to august 28 and comprises 30 performances , all sold-out long in advance .
the waiting list for tickets is currently over 10 years . father wo n't interfere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang wagner , before the ' festspielhaus ' theater in bayreuth this year will be katharina 's debut in the legendary festspielhaus built to the richard wagner 's own designs . bayreuth festival spokesman peter emmerich said that , as a direct descendent of the composer , katharina was " well aware that she must come up with something special , " adding that she " has a strong will of interpretation that wo n't bow even to ' meistersinger . " ' katharina 's production promised to turn on their head some of the cliches attached to the work and challenge traditional wagner fans , emmerich said .
wolfgang , who has himself directed three different stagings of " meistersinger " in bayreuth , had not interfered in katharina 's staging , he added . troupe of young novices in the pit for the new production will be upcoming german conductor sebastian weigle , also making his debut in bayreuth .
many of the mostly young cast of singers will also be singing in the hallowed auditorium for the first time as well , including german bass franz hawlata as hans sachs .
a relative newcomer , us soprano amanda mace , is to sing the role of eva . the only bayreuth veteran in the production will be us tenor robert dean smith as walther von stolzing .
smith has trodden bayreuth 's boards before , in the equally taxing roles of tristan , lohengrin and siegmund . katharina 's partner , endrik von wottrich , is to star as siegmund in the first revival of tankred dorst 's complete four-part " ring , " which critics panned at its premiere last year . some old favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner has big shoes to fill us tenor stephen gould will return in the role of siegfried as well us soprano linda watson as brünnhilde while german star conductor christian thielemann , bayreuth 's unofficial musical director , is to be in the pit once again . italian conductor fabio luisi is to make his debut in a revival of philip arlaud 's well-loved production of " tannhäuser " with german tenor wolfgang millgramm in the title role . the controversial production of " parsifal " by christoph schlingensief , considered the enfant terrible of german theater , is being revived for the final time under the baton of hungarian conductor adam fischer . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bravos and boos for new " ring " production in bayreuth the first " ring " cycle concluded monday to mixed reviews and a polarized audience .

" what people will remember , i have no idea .
i 'm not really a vain person , " chirac tells journalist pierre pean in " the stranger in the elysee , " long extracts of which appeared in this week 's edition of the magazine marianne .
" what i would like them to remember is that ...
france is , or tries to be , a country of tolerance . " chirac said this is what was in his mind in 1995 when he acknowledged france 's complicity in the deportation of jews to nazi germany and later recognizing slavery as a crime against humanity . " what we did during the war towards the jews ... is something i can not imagine as emanating from the human spirit , " he said .
" whether you like it or not , slavery was a tragic moment in the world 's history , and we took part in it . " chirac - who hosted possibly his last france-africa summit in southern france during the week - speaks at length of his respect for non-western cultures , criticizing the colonial-era " looting " of the african continent . regret for african exploitation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac wants to be remembered as a friend of africa " we stole everything they had , and then told them they were no good , " he said .
" now we are using grants to poach their brightest people and keep on telling those that remain : ' these negroes are really good for nothing . " ' from the 1960s , he said he secretly raised funds for nelson mandela 's african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- - priding himself on his public refusal to visit south africa under apartheid . he described his aversion for racism as " something almost physical , " saying he always resisted pressure to strike an alliance with jean-marie le pen 's anti-immigration national front . " a deal with the national front was the line i always refused to cross , " chirac said .
" there is a profound danger there , because you are playing with the lowest of human instincts . " chirac still adamant over iraq decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq spilt was strongest between bush and chirac asked about the decision to go head-to-head with us president george w. bush over the invasion of iraq , chirac stood by his guns . " i told bush over and over that he was making a colossal mistake ...
the americans refused to believe me , " chirac said .
" the war in iraq gave us ample proof that any solution founded on unilateralism , force , or the illusion that the western model can be exported off-the-shelf , is doomed to failure . " chirac also admitted he has always been " uncomfortable with the hegemony of companies like coca-cola ...
i am constantly running into problems with the americans , always trying to impose their point of view . " he described the delicate task of preserving france 's welfare state in a time of globalization : " i am convinced that economic liberalism is destined to the same failure as communism , and that it will lead to the same excesses . " " jacques the lad " reputation addressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac 's reputation as a charmer has not been denied long chapters delve into chirac 's personal life , where he speaks candidly of his daughter laurence 's life-long battle with anorexia .
" i have no reason to deny it .
it has been the tragedy of my life , " he said , making even the worst " political backstabbing " pale into insignificance . chirac confessed that he had not been " averse to women " , but " never overdid it either , " laughing off his wife 's bernadette 's comments about his alleged appetites as " exaggerated . " he half-admits rumors of a passionate relationship with a french journalist in the 1970s . " perhaps ...
i do n't deny it , " but he turned serious when asked if his marriage was ever at risk : " it is absolutely clear that i never thought of leaving my wife .

" one should have spoken with russia earlier as the sites where they -lrb- the missiles -rrb- are to be stationed are edging closer to russia , " steinmeier told the german business daily handelsblatt in an interview to be published monday .
" given the strategic nature of such projects , i call for a prudent approach and intensive dialogue with all partners who are directly or indirectly affected . " russian president vladimir putin last week accused the united states of making the world a more place with its plans for an anti-missile system . " one-sided illegitimate action has n't solved a single problem and has become a generator of many human tragedies , a source of tension , " putin said . iran not a threat to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said iran 's missiles could not reach europe us secretary of defense robert gates insisted that the missile system , which calls for placing 10 interceptor missiles in poland and the czech republic , was not directed against russia but to protect europe from missiles launched in the middle east . steinmeier , however , dismissed any potential threat posed by iranian rockets , saying tehran did not possess the technology to make such an attack .
he also spoke out against any immediate new sanctions against iran over its nuclear policies . " the most recent resolution of the un security council does not contain any automatic mechanism for the situation where iran does not fulfill its obligations , " he said . us waiting for poland 's official answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has stationed some missiles in japan already the leader of the oppositions greens party , fritz kuhn , said the german government needed to make it clear to us secretary of state condoleezza rice during her visit to berlin this week that it would not support placing missiles in the two eu and nato member countries . " what the usa is doing can only be understood by russia as a provocation , " he told monday 's saarbrücker zeitung . exactly how much criticism germany needs to give the us remains unclear as poland has yet to decide if it will allow the americans to station missiles within the country .

18 germany 's chinese population is expected to mark the lunar new year in a similar fashion to years past , though the cloud of seven unexplained murders will hang over the celebrations . chinese in germany celebrate the lunar new year on sunday the way ethnic chinese do all over the world - with family gatherings , visits to friends and lots to eat - but this year the celebrations have been overshadowed by the still-unexplained killings of seven chinese , who were found shot to death in a chinese restaurant near hamburg last week . " people were horrified by this terrible event , " said yu ming chu , chairwoman of the chinese gastronomy section of the german federation of hotels and restaurants . but yu and other members of the chinese community were more upset by the way the german press seized on the story , linking the slayings in the small town of sittensen to gangsters and protection rackets . will customers come back ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six people were found dead in a chinese restaurant , another died later in the hospital " of course there are such cases , but they are very few , " said yu , whose organization represents 62 of the estimated 150 chinese restaurants operating in hamburg . " some of our members reported a sharp drop in business " after the killings , she said she expects customers will return for chinese new year celebrations when many restaurants offer special banquets . her own restaurant in the suburb of niendorf will be offering a 10-course year of the pig menu that includes shanghai-style " nian gao , " a new year 's cake made of glutinous rice . there are up to 80,000 chinese living in germany , about 0.1 percent of the country 's total population .
the largest chinese communities are located in hamburg and berlin . with its huge elbe river port and centuries of tradition in the export trade , hamburg has also become a major hub for chinese firms trying to establish a foothold in europe . about 10,000 chinese live in hamburg , whose links to china date back to the 19th century .
today there are about 400 chinese companies based in the port city , more than any other german or continental european metropolis . " chinese are very well-liked abroad , " said liu jen-kai of the german institute for asian affairs .
" they go about their business and are inconspicuous . " chinese part of everyday european life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is preparing for a weeklong spring festival beginning sunday chinese restaurants are today part of the architecture of almost every german city and a growing number of chinese-owned shops are sprouting up , selling chinese trinkets and other cheap goods . there has also been an influx of students from the people 's republic , making chinese the biggest group of foreigners studying at german universities .

18 germany 's chinese population is expected to mark the lunar new year in a similar fashion to years past , though the cloud of seven unexplained murders will hang over the celebrations . chinese in germany celebrate the lunar new year on sunday the way ethnic chinese do all over the world - with family gatherings , visits to friends and lots to eat - but this year the celebrations have been overshadowed by the still-unexplained killings of seven chinese , who were found shot to death in a chinese restaurant near hamburg last week . " people were horrified by this terrible event , " said yu ming chu , chairwoman of the chinese gastronomy section of the german federation of hotels and restaurants . but yu and other members of the chinese community were more upset by the way the german press seized on the story , linking the slayings in the small town of sittensen to gangsters and protection rackets . will customers come back ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six people were found dead in a chinese restaurant , another died later in the hospital " of course there are such cases , but they are very few , " said yu , whose organization represents 62 of the estimated 150 chinese restaurants operating in hamburg . " some of our members reported a sharp drop in business " after the killings , she said she expects customers will return for chinese new year celebrations when many restaurants offer special banquets . her own restaurant in the suburb of niendorf will be offering a 10-course year of the pig menu that includes shanghai-style " nian gao , " a new year 's cake made of glutinous rice . there are up to 80,000 chinese living in germany , about 0.1 percent of the country 's total population .
the largest chinese communities are located in hamburg and berlin . with its huge elbe river port and centuries of tradition in the export trade , hamburg has also become a major hub for chinese firms trying to establish a foothold in europe . about 10,000 chinese live in hamburg , whose links to china date back to the 19th century .
today there are about 400 chinese companies based in the port city , more than any other german or continental european metropolis . " chinese are very well-liked abroad , " said liu jen-kai of the german institute for asian affairs .
" they go about their business and are inconspicuous . " chinese part of everyday european life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is preparing for a weeklong spring festival beginning sunday chinese restaurants are today part of the architecture of almost every german city and a growing number of chinese-owned shops are sprouting up , selling chinese trinkets and other cheap goods . there has also been an influx of students from the people 's republic , making chinese the biggest group of foreigners studying at german universities . " germany is the most popular destination for chinese students after the united states , " liu said .
" most of them stay two to three years before returning home . " in the run-up to chinese new year celebrations , the chinese consulate in hamburg has thrown a reception and the taipei representative office is planning to do the same . the port city 's chinese association is hosting a major function at the plush hamburg conference center , complete with music , dancing and a raffle - but not until feb .
24 . chinese from taiwan , the people 's republic , malaysia , vietnam and other south-east asian nations are expected to attend . " the chinese community is very close , " said yu .
" everyone knows everyone else . " unlike other countries , there are no chinatowns in german cities .
but this does not bother the chinese community , according to yu .
in fact many of them are happy about it .

" some of our members reported a sharp drop in business " after the killings , she said she expects customers will return for chinese new year celebrations when many restaurants offer special banquets . her own restaurant in the suburb of niendorf will be offering a 10-course year of the pig menu that includes shanghai-style " nian gao , " a new year 's cake made of glutinous rice . there are up to 80,000 chinese living in germany , about 0.1 percent of the country 's total population .
the largest chinese communities are located in hamburg and berlin . with its huge elbe river port and centuries of tradition in the export trade , hamburg has also become a major hub for chinese firms trying to establish a foothold in europe . about 10,000 chinese live in hamburg , whose links to china date back to the 19th century .
today there are about 400 chinese companies based in the port city , more than any other german or continental european metropolis . " chinese are very well-liked abroad , " said liu jen-kai of the german institute for asian affairs .
" they go about their business and are inconspicuous . " chinese part of everyday european life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is preparing for a weeklong spring festival beginning sunday chinese restaurants are today part of the architecture of almost every german city and a growing number of chinese-owned shops are sprouting up , selling chinese trinkets and other cheap goods . there has also been an influx of students from the people 's republic , making chinese the biggest group of foreigners studying at german universities . " germany is the most popular destination for chinese students after the united states , " liu said .
" most of them stay two to three years before returning home . " in the run-up to chinese new year celebrations , the chinese consulate in hamburg has thrown a reception and the taipei representative office is planning to do the same . the port city 's chinese association is hosting a major function at the plush hamburg conference center , complete with music , dancing and a raffle - but not until feb .
24 . chinese from taiwan , the people 's republic , malaysia , vietnam and other south-east asian nations are expected to attend . " the chinese community is very close , " said yu .
" everyone knows everyone else . " unlike other countries , there are no chinatowns in german cities .
but this does not bother the chinese community , according to yu .
in fact many of them are happy about it . " there are often protection rackets in such places , and many undesirable elements hang out there , " she said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg hosts china time festival it 's " china time " in hamburg - a city with a long history of chinese ties and the " china meets europe " summit set to take place from september 13-15 will be attracting an elite guest list from china and europe .

katharina has directed wagner operas before - " der fliegende holländer " -lrb- the flying dutchman -rrb- in würzburg in 2002 and " lohengrin " in budapest in 2003 . the legendary bayreuth the summer music festival , dedicated exclusively to the works of richard wagner , runs from july 25 to august 28 and comprises 30 performances , all sold-out long in advance .
the waiting list for tickets is currently over 10 years . father wo n't interfere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang wagner , before the ' festspielhaus ' theater in bayreuth this year will be katharina 's debut in the legendary festspielhaus built to the richard wagner 's own designs . bayreuth festival spokesman peter emmerich said that , as a direct descendent of the composer , katharina was " well aware that she must come up with something special , " adding that she " has a strong will of interpretation that wo n't bow even to ' meistersinger . " ' katharina 's production promised to turn on their head some of the cliches attached to the work and challenge traditional wagner fans , emmerich said .
wolfgang , who has himself directed three different stagings of " meistersinger " in bayreuth , had not interfered in katharina 's staging , he added . troupe of young novices in the pit for the new production will be upcoming german conductor sebastian weigle , also making his debut in bayreuth .
many of the mostly young cast of singers will also be singing in the hallowed auditorium for the first time as well , including german bass franz hawlata as hans sachs .
a relative newcomer , us soprano amanda mace , is to sing the role of eva . the only bayreuth veteran in the production will be us tenor robert dean smith as walther von stolzing .
smith has trodden bayreuth 's boards before , in the equally taxing roles of tristan , lohengrin and siegmund . katharina 's partner , endrik von wottrich , is to star as siegmund in the first revival of tankred dorst 's complete four-part " ring , " which critics panned at its premiere last year . some old favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner has big shoes to fill us tenor stephen gould will return in the role of siegfried as well us soprano linda watson as brünnhilde while german star conductor christian thielemann , bayreuth 's unofficial musical director , is to be in the pit once again . italian conductor fabio luisi is to make his debut in a revival of philip arlaud 's well-loved production of " tannhäuser " with german tenor wolfgang millgramm in the title role . the controversial production of " parsifal " by christoph schlingensief , considered the enfant terrible of german theater , is being revived for the final time under the baton of hungarian conductor adam fischer . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bravos and boos for new " ring " production in bayreuth the first " ring " cycle concluded monday to mixed reviews and a polarized audience .

" chirac said this is what was in his mind in 1995 when he acknowledged france 's complicity in the deportation of jews to nazi germany and later recognizing slavery as a crime against humanity . " what we did during the war towards the jews ... is something i can not imagine as emanating from the human spirit , " he said .
" whether you like it or not , slavery was a tragic moment in the world 's history , and we took part in it . " chirac - who hosted possibly his last france-africa summit in southern france during the week - speaks at length of his respect for non-western cultures , criticizing the colonial-era " looting " of the african continent . regret for african exploitation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac wants to be remembered as a friend of africa " we stole everything they had , and then told them they were no good , " he said .
" now we are using grants to poach their brightest people and keep on telling those that remain : ' these negroes are really good for nothing . " ' from the 1960s , he said he secretly raised funds for nelson mandela 's african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- - priding himself on his public refusal to visit south africa under apartheid . he described his aversion for racism as " something almost physical , " saying he always resisted pressure to strike an alliance with jean-marie le pen 's anti-immigration national front . " a deal with the national front was the line i always refused to cross , " chirac said .
" there is a profound danger there , because you are playing with the lowest of human instincts . " chirac still adamant over iraq decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq spilt was strongest between bush and chirac asked about the decision to go head-to-head with us president george w. bush over the invasion of iraq , chirac stood by his guns . " i told bush over and over that he was making a colossal mistake ...
the americans refused to believe me , " chirac said .
" the war in iraq gave us ample proof that any solution founded on unilateralism , force , or the illusion that the western model can be exported off-the-shelf , is doomed to failure . " chirac also admitted he has always been " uncomfortable with the hegemony of companies like coca-cola ...
i am constantly running into problems with the americans , always trying to impose their point of view . " he described the delicate task of preserving france 's welfare state in a time of globalization : " i am convinced that economic liberalism is destined to the same failure as communism , and that it will lead to the same excesses . " " jacques the lad " reputation addressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac 's reputation as a charmer has not been denied long chapters delve into chirac 's personal life , where he speaks candidly of his daughter laurence 's life-long battle with anorexia .
" i have no reason to deny it .
it has been the tragedy of my life , " he said , making even the worst " political backstabbing " pale into insignificance . chirac confessed that he had not been " averse to women " , but " never overdid it either , " laughing off his wife 's bernadette 's comments about his alleged appetites as " exaggerated . " he half-admits rumors of a passionate relationship with a french journalist in the 1970s . " perhaps ...
i do n't deny it , " but he turned serious when asked if his marriage was ever at risk : " it is absolutely clear that i never thought of leaving my wife .

" argentina : europe at a third of the price , " says one investment-promoting internet blurb .
another market observer puts the prices as low as one-tenth of european prices . while price is the key factor , cultural affinity also plays an important role , with the portuguese drawn to brazil and spaniards and italians to buenos aires , many to consolidate family ties . in argentina , where global tycoons have been buying up land in patagonia since the 1990s , middle-income investment is concentrating in the more up-market areas of its capital .

author gonzalo sanchez claims in his book " patagonia sold " that at least 10 percent of argentina 's territory is in foreign hands . with the influx of money , prices are starting to rise in brazil .
foreign-driven development along brazil 's coast and a property boom in the country 's northeast , around natal and recife , have boosted land prices substantially . " in the cities , there is not so much difference , " brazilian real estate agent johannes von leiben told dpa .
" rio is expensive , sao paulo also , but they always were .

he was 96 . " i will personally see to it that the cross of the commander of the legion of honor that was bestowed to him by charles de gaulle , for eternity , be placed with him in his casket , " lawyer francis vuillemin said in a statement . papon was stripped of france 's highest distinction , which he received as paris police chief personally from de gaulle in 1962 , by decree in november 1999 as is the case for any appointee to the legion who is convicted of a crime . guilty of crimes against humanity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papon 's role in the vichy government was made clear in a 1998 trial a senior official under the wartime vichy government , papon was sentenced to 10 years in jail in 1998 for his role in organizing the deportation of hundreds of jews to nazi germany , where most of them died in extermination camps . he was the only french nazi official to be convicted of a crime for his role in deporting french jews during world war two .
papon said he was unaware of the holocaust at the time and used his position in the vichy government to aid the french resistance . during the six-month trial , the longest in french history , papon came to symbolize france 's collaboration with the nazis . he was convicted of complicity in crimes against humanity after the court rejected his plea that he was a civil servant following instructions from above .
his release from paris ' la sante prison in 2002 on medical grounds angered jewish groups , who said that at his trial he never expressed sorrow for the victims of his bureaucratic zeal . the 1998 verdict came after president jacques chirac had for the first time acknowledged french responsibility in the jewish genocide , and appeared to confirm a new willingness to face up to the country 's wartime past . no remorse for crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the jews papon deported from france died in nazi extermination camps one of the lawyers representing the victims during the trial said the nazi collaborator went to his grave without ever feeling remorseful for his actions . " we never succeeded in bringing the henchman back to humanity , " gerard boulanger told the afp news service .
" maurice papon never understood and never admitted to what he had done . " for juliette benzazon , 77 , who lost 12 family members under the deportation orders , papon was also unrepentant to the end . " he was a man who did not want to recognize what he had done , who did not want to ask forgiveness from us or from the grand rabbi , " she told afp .
" he had no regrets , he said he was a civil servant . " vuillemin said papon 's family had yet to set a date for the funeral .

katharina has directed wagner operas before - " der fliegende holländer " -lrb- the flying dutchman -rrb- in würzburg in 2002 and " lohengrin " in budapest in 2003 . the legendary bayreuth the summer music festival , dedicated exclusively to the works of richard wagner , runs from july 25 to august 28 and comprises 30 performances , all sold-out long in advance .
the waiting list for tickets is currently over 10 years . father wo n't interfere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang wagner , before the ' festspielhaus ' theater in bayreuth this year will be katharina 's debut in the legendary festspielhaus built to the richard wagner 's own designs . bayreuth festival spokesman peter emmerich said that , as a direct descendent of the composer , katharina was " well aware that she must come up with something special , " adding that she " has a strong will of interpretation that wo n't bow even to ' meistersinger . " ' katharina 's production promised to turn on their head some of the cliches attached to the work and challenge traditional wagner fans , emmerich said .
wolfgang , who has himself directed three different stagings of " meistersinger " in bayreuth , had not interfered in katharina 's staging , he added . troupe of young novices in the pit for the new production will be upcoming german conductor sebastian weigle , also making his debut in bayreuth .
many of the mostly young cast of singers will also be singing in the hallowed auditorium for the first time as well , including german bass franz hawlata as hans sachs .
a relative newcomer , us soprano amanda mace , is to sing the role of eva . the only bayreuth veteran in the production will be us tenor robert dean smith as walther von stolzing .
smith has trodden bayreuth 's boards before , in the equally taxing roles of tristan , lohengrin and siegmund . katharina 's partner , endrik von wottrich , is to star as siegmund in the first revival of tankred dorst 's complete four-part " ring , " which critics panned at its premiere last year . some old favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner has big shoes to fill us tenor stephen gould will return in the role of siegfried as well us soprano linda watson as brünnhilde while german star conductor christian thielemann , bayreuth 's unofficial musical director , is to be in the pit once again . italian conductor fabio luisi is to make his debut in a revival of philip arlaud 's well-loved production of " tannhäuser " with german tenor wolfgang millgramm in the title role . the controversial production of " parsifal " by christoph schlingensief , considered the enfant terrible of german theater , is being revived for the final time under the baton of hungarian conductor adam fischer . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bravos and boos for new " ring " production in bayreuth the first " ring " cycle concluded monday to mixed reviews and a polarized audience .

" argentina : europe at a third of the price , " says one investment-promoting internet blurb .
another market observer puts the prices as low as one-tenth of european prices . while price is the key factor , cultural affinity also plays an important role , with the portuguese drawn to brazil and spaniards and italians to buenos aires , many to consolidate family ties . in argentina , where global tycoons have been buying up land in patagonia since the 1990s , middle-income investment is concentrating in the more up-market areas of its capital . " -lrb- investors -rrb- consider that buenos aires is a very similar city to any european capital , but with much lower real estate values , " guillermo rivanera , vice president of tizado propiedades , told the dpa news agency . preferred investment is in the pre-construction sale of large developments , and he said foreign interest has not yet had a significant impact on prices paid by locals in the city of more than 12 million . brazil and argentina share several qualities : with high interest rates and a history of economic uncertainties , mortgages are relatively rare , and real estate is usually paid for in cash . brazil 's real , valued 1-to-1 with the dollar in the mid-1990s , has fallen by more than half to 2.1 to the dollar .
argentina 's peso , after being allowed to float in early 2002 , dropped from 1-to-1 with the dollar to more than 3-to-1 . south america now a retirement destination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these ladies could be sunning themselves in rio meanwhile , the appreciating euro now punches more purchasing power in latin america , but not enough to keep up with the soaring property values in traditional second-home or retirement destinations in southern europe .
overcrowding in spain , portugal and greece have eroded those countries ' charm , making distant south america even more attractive . " the scenery and beaches in brazil are quite simply breathtaking , the cost of living -lrb- can range to -rrb- 20 percent lower than the average uk or european equivalents , property prices are incredibly cheap and the country is highly accessible , " international property consultant amberland tells prospective buyers on its web site . brazil places no restrictions on the purchase of real estate by foreigners , who are only required to have an identification number for fiscal purposes . argentineans fight to keep land out of foreign hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buenos aires : argentina 's " european " capital argentina however bans foreigners from buying property within 100 kilometers of the country 's borders .
the purchase of huge tracts of land by tycoons like ted turner , douglas tompkins or luciano benetton , in fact , has stirred public sentiment .
author gonzalo sanchez claims in his book " patagonia sold " that at least 10 percent of argentina 's territory is in foreign hands . with the influx of money , prices are starting to rise in brazil .
foreign-driven development along brazil 's coast and a property boom in the country 's northeast , around natal and recife , have boosted land prices substantially . " in the cities , there is not so much difference , " brazilian real estate agent johannes von leiben told dpa .
" rio is expensive , sao paulo also , but they always were .
the really big difference is at the beach , that 's where prices went up in the last years . " in this context , some dare to point to uruguay - sandwiched between the regional giants and once known as " the switzerland of south america " - as next in line for a property boom . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lured by property bargains , foreign investors flock to berlin drawn by some of the lowest property prices in europe and signs of an economic revival in germany , foreign investors are rushing to berlin to get a piece of the hot real estate market .

katharina has directed wagner operas before - " der fliegende holländer " -lrb- the flying dutchman -rrb- in würzburg in 2002 and " lohengrin " in budapest in 2003 . the legendary bayreuth the summer music festival , dedicated exclusively to the works of richard wagner , runs from july 25 to august 28 and comprises 30 performances , all sold-out long in advance .
the waiting list for tickets is currently over 10 years . father wo n't interfere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang wagner , before the ' festspielhaus ' theater in bayreuth this year will be katharina 's debut in the legendary festspielhaus built to the richard wagner 's own designs . bayreuth festival spokesman peter emmerich said that , as a direct descendent of the composer , katharina was " well aware that she must come up with something special , " adding that she " has a strong will of interpretation that wo n't bow even to ' meistersinger . " ' katharina 's production promised to turn on their head some of the cliches attached to the work and challenge traditional wagner fans , emmerich said .
wolfgang , who has himself directed three different stagings of " meistersinger " in bayreuth , had not interfered in katharina 's staging , he added . troupe of young novices in the pit for the new production will be upcoming german conductor sebastian weigle , also making his debut in bayreuth .

18 germany 's chinese population is expected to mark the lunar new year in a similar fashion to years past , though the cloud of seven unexplained murders will hang over the celebrations . chinese in germany celebrate the lunar new year on sunday the way ethnic chinese do all over the world - with family gatherings , visits to friends and lots to eat - but this year the celebrations have been overshadowed by the still-unexplained killings of seven chinese , who were found shot to death in a chinese restaurant near hamburg last week . " people were horrified by this terrible event , " said yu ming chu , chairwoman of the chinese gastronomy section of the german federation of hotels and restaurants . but yu and other members of the chinese community were more upset by the way the german press seized on the story , linking the slayings in the small town of sittensen to gangsters and protection rackets . will customers come back ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six people were found dead in a chinese restaurant , another died later in the hospital " of course there are such cases , but they are very few , " said yu , whose organization represents 62 of the estimated 150 chinese restaurants operating in hamburg . " some of our members reported a sharp drop in business " after the killings , she said she expects customers will return for chinese new year celebrations when many restaurants offer special banquets . her own restaurant in the suburb of niendorf will be offering a 10-course year of the pig menu that includes shanghai-style " nian gao , " a new year 's cake made of glutinous rice . there are up to 80,000 chinese living in germany , about 0.1 percent of the country 's total population .
the largest chinese communities are located in hamburg and berlin . with its huge elbe river port and centuries of tradition in the export trade , hamburg has also become a major hub for chinese firms trying to establish a foothold in europe . about 10,000 chinese live in hamburg , whose links to china date back to the 19th century .
today there are about 400 chinese companies based in the port city , more than any other german or continental european metropolis . " chinese are very well-liked abroad , " said liu jen-kai of the german institute for asian affairs .
" they go about their business and are inconspicuous . " chinese part of everyday european life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is preparing for a weeklong spring festival beginning sunday chinese restaurants are today part of the architecture of almost every german city and a growing number of chinese-owned shops are sprouting up , selling chinese trinkets and other cheap goods . there has also been an influx of students from the people 's republic , making chinese the biggest group of foreigners studying at german universities . " germany is the most popular destination for chinese students after the united states , " liu said .
" most of them stay two to three years before returning home . " in the run-up to chinese new year celebrations , the chinese consulate in hamburg has thrown a reception and the taipei representative office is planning to do the same . the port city 's chinese association is hosting a major function at the plush hamburg conference center , complete with music , dancing and a raffle - but not until feb .
24 . chinese from taiwan , the people 's republic , malaysia , vietnam and other south-east asian nations are expected to attend . " the chinese community is very close , " said yu .
" everyone knows everyone else . " unlike other countries , there are no chinatowns in german cities .
but this does not bother the chinese community , according to yu .
in fact many of them are happy about it . " there are often protection rackets in such places , and many undesirable elements hang out there , " she said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg hosts china time festival it 's " china time " in hamburg - a city with a long history of chinese ties and the " china meets europe " summit set to take place from september 13-15 will be attracting an elite guest list from china and europe .

" what people will remember , i have no idea .
i 'm not really a vain person , " chirac tells journalist pierre pean in " the stranger in the elysee , " long extracts of which appeared in this week 's edition of the magazine marianne .
" what i would like them to remember is that ...
france is , or tries to be , a country of tolerance . " chirac said this is what was in his mind in 1995 when he acknowledged france 's complicity in the deportation of jews to nazi germany and later recognizing slavery as a crime against humanity . " what we did during the war towards the jews ... is something i can not imagine as emanating from the human spirit , " he said .
" whether you like it or not , slavery was a tragic moment in the world 's history , and we took part in it . " chirac - who hosted possibly his last france-africa summit in southern france during the week - speaks at length of his respect for non-western cultures , criticizing the colonial-era " looting " of the african continent . regret for african exploitation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac wants to be remembered as a friend of africa " we stole everything they had , and then told them they were no good , " he said .
" now we are using grants to poach their brightest people and keep on telling those that remain : ' these negroes are really good for nothing . " ' from the 1960s , he said he secretly raised funds for nelson mandela 's african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- - priding himself on his public refusal to visit south africa under apartheid . he described his aversion for racism as " something almost physical , " saying he always resisted pressure to strike an alliance with jean-marie le pen 's anti-immigration national front . " a deal with the national front was the line i always refused to cross , " chirac said .
" there is a profound danger there , because you are playing with the lowest of human instincts . " chirac still adamant over iraq decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq spilt was strongest between bush and chirac asked about the decision to go head-to-head with us president george w. bush over the invasion of iraq , chirac stood by his guns . " i told bush over and over that he was making a colossal mistake ...
the americans refused to believe me , " chirac said .
" the war in iraq gave us ample proof that any solution founded on unilateralism , force , or the illusion that the western model can be exported off-the-shelf , is doomed to failure . " chirac also admitted he has always been " uncomfortable with the hegemony of companies like coca-cola ...
i am constantly running into problems with the americans , always trying to impose their point of view . " he described the delicate task of preserving france 's welfare state in a time of globalization : " i am convinced that economic liberalism is destined to the same failure as communism , and that it will lead to the same excesses . " " jacques the lad " reputation addressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac 's reputation as a charmer has not been denied long chapters delve into chirac 's personal life , where he speaks candidly of his daughter laurence 's life-long battle with anorexia .
" i have no reason to deny it .
it has been the tragedy of my life , " he said , making even the worst " political backstabbing " pale into insignificance . chirac confessed that he had not been " averse to women " , but " never overdid it either , " laughing off his wife 's bernadette 's comments about his alleged appetites as " exaggerated . " he half-admits rumors of a passionate relationship with a french journalist in the 1970s . " perhaps ...
i do n't deny it , " but he turned serious when asked if his marriage was ever at risk : " it is absolutely clear that i never thought of leaving my wife .

" what people will remember , i have no idea .
i 'm not really a vain person , " chirac tells journalist pierre pean in " the stranger in the elysee , " long extracts of which appeared in this week 's edition of the magazine marianne .
" what i would like them to remember is that ...
france is , or tries to be , a country of tolerance . " chirac said this is what was in his mind in 1995 when he acknowledged france 's complicity in the deportation of jews to nazi germany and later recognizing slavery as a crime against humanity . " what we did during the war towards the jews ... is something i can not imagine as emanating from the human spirit , " he said .
" whether you like it or not , slavery was a tragic moment in the world 's history , and we took part in it . " chirac - who hosted possibly his last france-africa summit in southern france during the week - speaks at length of his respect for non-western cultures , criticizing the colonial-era " looting " of the african continent . regret for african exploitation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac wants to be remembered as a friend of africa " we stole everything they had , and then told them they were no good , " he said .
" now we are using grants to poach their brightest people and keep on telling those that remain : ' these negroes are really good for nothing . " ' from the 1960s , he said he secretly raised funds for nelson mandela 's african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- - priding himself on his public refusal to visit south africa under apartheid . he described his aversion for racism as " something almost physical , " saying he always resisted pressure to strike an alliance with jean-marie le pen 's anti-immigration national front . " a deal with the national front was the line i always refused to cross , " chirac said .
" there is a profound danger there , because you are playing with the lowest of human instincts . " chirac still adamant over iraq decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq spilt was strongest between bush and chirac asked about the decision to go head-to-head with us president george w. bush over the invasion of iraq , chirac stood by his guns . " i told bush over and over that he was making a colossal mistake ...
the americans refused to believe me , " chirac said .
" the war in iraq gave us ample proof that any solution founded on unilateralism , force , or the illusion that the western model can be exported off-the-shelf , is doomed to failure . " chirac also admitted he has always been " uncomfortable with the hegemony of companies like coca-cola ...
i am constantly running into problems with the americans , always trying to impose their point of view . " he described the delicate task of preserving france 's welfare state in a time of globalization : " i am convinced that economic liberalism is destined to the same failure as communism , and that it will lead to the same excesses . " " jacques the lad " reputation addressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac 's reputation as a charmer has not been denied long chapters delve into chirac 's personal life , where he speaks candidly of his daughter laurence 's life-long battle with anorexia .
" i have no reason to deny it .
it has been the tragedy of my life , " he said , making even the worst " political backstabbing " pale into insignificance . chirac confessed that he had not been " averse to women " , but " never overdid it either , " laughing off his wife 's bernadette 's comments about his alleged appetites as " exaggerated . " he half-admits rumors of a passionate relationship with a french journalist in the 1970s . " perhaps ...
i do n't deny it , " but he turned serious when asked if his marriage was ever at risk : " it is absolutely clear that i never thought of leaving my wife .

" argentina : europe at a third of the price , " says one investment-promoting internet blurb .
another market observer puts the prices as low as one-tenth of european prices . while price is the key factor , cultural affinity also plays an important role , with the portuguese drawn to brazil and spaniards and italians to buenos aires , many to consolidate family ties . in argentina , where global tycoons have been buying up land in patagonia since the 1990s , middle-income investment is concentrating in the more up-market areas of its capital . " -lrb- investors -rrb- consider that buenos aires is a very similar city to any european capital , but with much lower real estate values , " guillermo rivanera , vice president of tizado propiedades , told the dpa news agency . preferred investment is in the pre-construction sale of large developments , and he said foreign interest has not yet had a significant impact on prices paid by locals in the city of more than 12 million . brazil and argentina share several qualities : with high interest rates and a history of economic uncertainties , mortgages are relatively rare , and real estate is usually paid for in cash . brazil 's real , valued 1-to-1 with the dollar in the mid-1990s , has fallen by more than half to 2.1 to the dollar .
argentina 's peso , after being allowed to float in early 2002 , dropped from 1-to-1 with the dollar to more than 3-to-1 . south america now a retirement destination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these ladies could be sunning themselves in rio meanwhile , the appreciating euro now punches more purchasing power in latin america , but not enough to keep up with the soaring property values in traditional second-home or retirement destinations in southern europe .
overcrowding in spain , portugal and greece have eroded those countries ' charm , making distant south america even more attractive . " the scenery and beaches in brazil are quite simply breathtaking , the cost of living -lrb- can range to -rrb- 20 percent lower than the average uk or european equivalents , property prices are incredibly cheap and the country is highly accessible , " international property consultant amberland tells prospective buyers on its web site . brazil places no restrictions on the purchase of real estate by foreigners , who are only required to have an identification number for fiscal purposes . argentineans fight to keep land out of foreign hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buenos aires : argentina 's " european " capital argentina however bans foreigners from buying property within 100 kilometers of the country 's borders .
the purchase of huge tracts of land by tycoons like ted turner , douglas tompkins or luciano benetton , in fact , has stirred public sentiment .
author gonzalo sanchez claims in his book " patagonia sold " that at least 10 percent of argentina 's territory is in foreign hands . with the influx of money , prices are starting to rise in brazil .
foreign-driven development along brazil 's coast and a property boom in the country 's northeast , around natal and recife , have boosted land prices substantially . " in the cities , there is not so much difference , " brazilian real estate agent johannes von leiben told dpa .
" rio is expensive , sao paulo also , but they always were .
the really big difference is at the beach , that 's where prices went up in the last years . " in this context , some dare to point to uruguay - sandwiched between the regional giants and once known as " the switzerland of south america " - as next in line for a property boom . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lured by property bargains , foreign investors flock to berlin drawn by some of the lowest property prices in europe and signs of an economic revival in germany , foreign investors are rushing to berlin to get a piece of the hot real estate market .

18 germany 's chinese population is expected to mark the lunar new year in a similar fashion to years past , though the cloud of seven unexplained murders will hang over the celebrations . chinese in germany celebrate the lunar new year on sunday the way ethnic chinese do all over the world - with family gatherings , visits to friends and lots to eat - but this year the celebrations have been overshadowed by the still-unexplained killings of seven chinese , who were found shot to death in a chinese restaurant near hamburg last week . " people were horrified by this terrible event , " said yu ming chu , chairwoman of the chinese gastronomy section of the german federation of hotels and restaurants . but yu and other members of the chinese community were more upset by the way the german press seized on the story , linking the slayings in the small town of sittensen to gangsters and protection rackets . will customers come back ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six people were found dead in a chinese restaurant , another died later in the hospital " of course there are such cases , but they are very few , " said yu , whose organization represents 62 of the estimated 150 chinese restaurants operating in hamburg . " some of our members reported a sharp drop in business " after the killings , she said she expects customers will return for chinese new year celebrations when many restaurants offer special banquets . her own restaurant in the suburb of niendorf will be offering a 10-course year of the pig menu that includes shanghai-style " nian gao , " a new year 's cake made of glutinous rice . there are up to 80,000 chinese living in germany , about 0.1 percent of the country 's total population .
the largest chinese communities are located in hamburg and berlin . with its huge elbe river port and centuries of tradition in the export trade , hamburg has also become a major hub for chinese firms trying to establish a foothold in europe . about 10,000 chinese live in hamburg , whose links to china date back to the 19th century .
today there are about 400 chinese companies based in the port city , more than any other german or continental european metropolis . " chinese are very well-liked abroad , " said liu jen-kai of the german institute for asian affairs .
" they go about their business and are inconspicuous . " chinese part of everyday european life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is preparing for a weeklong spring festival beginning sunday chinese restaurants are today part of the architecture of almost every german city and a growing number of chinese-owned shops are sprouting up , selling chinese trinkets and other cheap goods . there has also been an influx of students from the people 's republic , making chinese the biggest group of foreigners studying at german universities . " germany is the most popular destination for chinese students after the united states , " liu said .
" most of them stay two to three years before returning home . " in the run-up to chinese new year celebrations , the chinese consulate in hamburg has thrown a reception and the taipei representative office is planning to do the same . the port city 's chinese association is hosting a major function at the plush hamburg conference center , complete with music , dancing and a raffle - but not until feb .
24 . chinese from taiwan , the people 's republic , malaysia , vietnam and other south-east asian nations are expected to attend . " the chinese community is very close , " said yu .
" everyone knows everyone else . " unlike other countries , there are no chinatowns in german cities .
but this does not bother the chinese community , according to yu .
in fact many of them are happy about it .

" argentina : europe at a third of the price , " says one investment-promoting internet blurb .
another market observer puts the prices as low as one-tenth of european prices . while price is the key factor , cultural affinity also plays an important role , with the portuguese drawn to brazil and spaniards and italians to buenos aires , many to consolidate family ties . in argentina , where global tycoons have been buying up land in patagonia since the 1990s , middle-income investment is concentrating in the more up-market areas of its capital .

" the scenery and beaches in brazil are quite simply breathtaking , the cost of living -lrb- can range to -rrb- 20 percent lower than the average uk or european equivalents , property prices are incredibly cheap and the country is highly accessible , " international property consultant amberland tells prospective buyers on its web site . brazil places no restrictions on the purchase of real estate by foreigners , who are only required to have an identification number for fiscal purposes . argentineans fight to keep land out of foreign hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buenos aires : argentina 's " european " capital argentina however bans foreigners from buying property within 100 kilometers of the country 's borders .

author gonzalo sanchez claims in his book " patagonia sold " that at least 10 percent of argentina 's territory is in foreign hands . with the influx of money , prices are starting to rise in brazil .
foreign-driven development along brazil 's coast and a property boom in the country 's northeast , around natal and recife , have boosted land prices substantially . " in the cities , there is not so much difference , " brazilian real estate agent johannes von leiben told dpa .
" rio is expensive , sao paulo also , but they always were .
the really big difference is at the beach , that 's where prices went up in the last years .

" i will personally see to it that the cross of the commander of the legion of honor that was bestowed to him by charles de gaulle , for eternity , be placed with him in his casket , " lawyer francis vuillemin said in a statement . papon was stripped of france 's highest distinction , which he received as paris police chief personally from de gaulle in 1962 , by decree in november 1999 as is the case for any appointee to the legion who is convicted of a crime . guilty of crimes against humanity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papon 's role in the vichy government was made clear in a 1998 trial a senior official under the wartime vichy government , papon was sentenced to 10 years in jail in 1998 for his role in organizing the deportation of hundreds of jews to nazi germany , where most of them died in extermination camps . he was the only french nazi official to be convicted of a crime for his role in deporting french jews during world war two .
papon said he was unaware of the holocaust at the time and used his position in the vichy government to aid the french resistance . during the six-month trial , the longest in french history , papon came to symbolize france 's collaboration with the nazis . he was convicted of complicity in crimes against humanity after the court rejected his plea that he was a civil servant following instructions from above .
his release from paris ' la sante prison in 2002 on medical grounds angered jewish groups , who said that at his trial he never expressed sorrow for the victims of his bureaucratic zeal . the 1998 verdict came after president jacques chirac had for the first time acknowledged french responsibility in the jewish genocide , and appeared to confirm a new willingness to face up to the country 's wartime past . no remorse for crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the jews papon deported from france died in nazi extermination camps one of the lawyers representing the victims during the trial said the nazi collaborator went to his grave without ever feeling remorseful for his actions . " we never succeeded in bringing the henchman back to humanity , " gerard boulanger told the afp news service .
" maurice papon never understood and never admitted to what he had done . " for juliette benzazon , 77 , who lost 12 family members under the deportation orders , papon was also unrepentant to the end . " he was a man who did not want to recognize what he had done , who did not want to ask forgiveness from us or from the grand rabbi , " she told afp .
" he had no regrets , he said he was a civil servant . " vuillemin said papon 's family had yet to set a date for the funeral .
papon is survived by three children : aline , alain and muriel . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : belgium collaborated with nazis in deporting jews belgian historians have concluded that the country actively cooperated with germany 's nazi regime during world war ii in deporting jews .

" what people will remember , i have no idea .
i 'm not really a vain person , " chirac tells journalist pierre pean in " the stranger in the elysee , " long extracts of which appeared in this week 's edition of the magazine marianne .
" what i would like them to remember is that ...
france is , or tries to be , a country of tolerance . " chirac said this is what was in his mind in 1995 when he acknowledged france 's complicity in the deportation of jews to nazi germany and later recognizing slavery as a crime against humanity . " what we did during the war towards the jews ... is something i can not imagine as emanating from the human spirit , " he said .
" whether you like it or not , slavery was a tragic moment in the world 's history , and we took part in it . " chirac - who hosted possibly his last france-africa summit in southern france during the week - speaks at length of his respect for non-western cultures , criticizing the colonial-era " looting " of the african continent . regret for african exploitation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac wants to be remembered as a friend of africa " we stole everything they had , and then told them they were no good , " he said .
" now we are using grants to poach their brightest people and keep on telling those that remain : ' these negroes are really good for nothing . " ' from the 1960s , he said he secretly raised funds for nelson mandela 's african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- - priding himself on his public refusal to visit south africa under apartheid . he described his aversion for racism as " something almost physical , " saying he always resisted pressure to strike an alliance with jean-marie le pen 's anti-immigration national front . " a deal with the national front was the line i always refused to cross , " chirac said .
" there is a profound danger there , because you are playing with the lowest of human instincts . " chirac still adamant over iraq decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq spilt was strongest between bush and chirac asked about the decision to go head-to-head with us president george w. bush over the invasion of iraq , chirac stood by his guns . " i told bush over and over that he was making a colossal mistake ...
the americans refused to believe me , " chirac said .
" the war in iraq gave us ample proof that any solution founded on unilateralism , force , or the illusion that the western model can be exported off-the-shelf , is doomed to failure . " chirac also admitted he has always been " uncomfortable with the hegemony of companies like coca-cola ...
i am constantly running into problems with the americans , always trying to impose their point of view . " he described the delicate task of preserving france 's welfare state in a time of globalization : " i am convinced that economic liberalism is destined to the same failure as communism , and that it will lead to the same excesses . " " jacques the lad " reputation addressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac 's reputation as a charmer has not been denied long chapters delve into chirac 's personal life , where he speaks candidly of his daughter laurence 's life-long battle with anorexia .
" i have no reason to deny it .
it has been the tragedy of my life , " he said , making even the worst " political backstabbing " pale into insignificance . chirac confessed that he had not been " averse to women " , but " never overdid it either , " laughing off his wife 's bernadette 's comments about his alleged appetites as " exaggerated . " he half-admits rumors of a passionate relationship with a french journalist in the 1970s . " perhaps ...
i do n't deny it , " but he turned serious when asked if his marriage was ever at risk : " it is absolutely clear that i never thought of leaving my wife .

" one should have spoken with russia earlier as the sites where they -lrb- the missiles -rrb- are to be stationed are edging closer to russia , " steinmeier told the german business daily handelsblatt in an interview to be published monday .

he also spoke out against any immediate new sanctions against iran over its nuclear policies .

he was 96 . " i will personally see to it that the cross of the commander of the legion of honor that was bestowed to him by charles de gaulle , for eternity , be placed with him in his casket , " lawyer francis vuillemin said in a statement . papon was stripped of france 's highest distinction , which he received as paris police chief personally from de gaulle in 1962 , by decree in november 1999 as is the case for any appointee to the legion who is convicted of a crime . guilty of crimes against humanity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papon 's role in the vichy government was made clear in a 1998 trial a senior official under the wartime vichy government , papon was sentenced to 10 years in jail in 1998 for his role in organizing the deportation of hundreds of jews to nazi germany , where most of them died in extermination camps . he was the only french nazi official to be convicted of a crime for his role in deporting french jews during world war two .
papon said he was unaware of the holocaust at the time and used his position in the vichy government to aid the french resistance . during the six-month trial , the longest in french history , papon came to symbolize france 's collaboration with the nazis . he was convicted of complicity in crimes against humanity after the court rejected his plea that he was a civil servant following instructions from above .
his release from paris ' la sante prison in 2002 on medical grounds angered jewish groups , who said that at his trial he never expressed sorrow for the victims of his bureaucratic zeal . the 1998 verdict came after president jacques chirac had for the first time acknowledged french responsibility in the jewish genocide , and appeared to confirm a new willingness to face up to the country 's wartime past . no remorse for crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the jews papon deported from france died in nazi extermination camps one of the lawyers representing the victims during the trial said the nazi collaborator went to his grave without ever feeling remorseful for his actions . " we never succeeded in bringing the henchman back to humanity , " gerard boulanger told the afp news service .
" maurice papon never understood and never admitted to what he had done . " for juliette benzazon , 77 , who lost 12 family members under the deportation orders , papon was also unrepentant to the end . " he was a man who did not want to recognize what he had done , who did not want to ask forgiveness from us or from the grand rabbi , " she told afp .
" he had no regrets , he said he was a civil servant . " vuillemin said papon 's family had yet to set a date for the funeral .
papon is survived by three children : aline , alain and muriel . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : belgium collaborated with nazis in deporting jews belgian historians have concluded that the country actively cooperated with germany 's nazi regime during world war ii in deporting jews .

he was 96 . " i will personally see to it that the cross of the commander of the legion of honor that was bestowed to him by charles de gaulle , for eternity , be placed with him in his casket , " lawyer francis vuillemin said in a statement . papon was stripped of france 's highest distinction , which he received as paris police chief personally from de gaulle in 1962 , by decree in november 1999 as is the case for any appointee to the legion who is convicted of a crime . guilty of crimes against humanity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papon 's role in the vichy government was made clear in a 1998 trial a senior official under the wartime vichy government , papon was sentenced to 10 years in jail in 1998 for his role in organizing the deportation of hundreds of jews to nazi germany , where most of them died in extermination camps . he was the only french nazi official to be convicted of a crime for his role in deporting french jews during world war two .
papon said he was unaware of the holocaust at the time and used his position in the vichy government to aid the french resistance . during the six-month trial , the longest in french history , papon came to symbolize france 's collaboration with the nazis . he was convicted of complicity in crimes against humanity after the court rejected his plea that he was a civil servant following instructions from above .
his release from paris ' la sante prison in 2002 on medical grounds angered jewish groups , who said that at his trial he never expressed sorrow for the victims of his bureaucratic zeal . the 1998 verdict came after president jacques chirac had for the first time acknowledged french responsibility in the jewish genocide , and appeared to confirm a new willingness to face up to the country 's wartime past . no remorse for crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the jews papon deported from france died in nazi extermination camps one of the lawyers representing the victims during the trial said the nazi collaborator went to his grave without ever feeling remorseful for his actions . " we never succeeded in bringing the henchman back to humanity , " gerard boulanger told the afp news service .
" maurice papon never understood and never admitted to what he had done . " for juliette benzazon , 77 , who lost 12 family members under the deportation orders , papon was also unrepentant to the end . " he was a man who did not want to recognize what he had done , who did not want to ask forgiveness from us or from the grand rabbi , " she told afp .
" he had no regrets , he said he was a civil servant . " vuillemin said papon 's family had yet to set a date for the funeral .
papon is survived by three children : aline , alain and muriel . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : belgium collaborated with nazis in deporting jews belgian historians have concluded that the country actively cooperated with germany 's nazi regime during world war ii in deporting jews .
the state even went beyond german demands at the time .

" one should have spoken with russia earlier as the sites where they -lrb- the missiles -rrb- are to be stationed are edging closer to russia , " steinmeier told the german business daily handelsblatt in an interview to be published monday .

" argentina : europe at a third of the price , " says one investment-promoting internet blurb .
another market observer puts the prices as low as one-tenth of european prices . while price is the key factor , cultural affinity also plays an important role , with the portuguese drawn to brazil and spaniards and italians to buenos aires , many to consolidate family ties . in argentina , where global tycoons have been buying up land in patagonia since the 1990s , middle-income investment is concentrating in the more up-market areas of its capital . " -lrb- investors -rrb- consider that buenos aires is a very similar city to any european capital , but with much lower real estate values , " guillermo rivanera , vice president of tizado propiedades , told the dpa news agency . preferred investment is in the pre-construction sale of large developments , and he said foreign interest has not yet had a significant impact on prices paid by locals in the city of more than 12 million . brazil and argentina share several qualities : with high interest rates and a history of economic uncertainties , mortgages are relatively rare , and real estate is usually paid for in cash . brazil 's real , valued 1-to-1 with the dollar in the mid-1990s , has fallen by more than half to 2.1 to the dollar .
argentina 's peso , after being allowed to float in early 2002 , dropped from 1-to-1 with the dollar to more than 3-to-1 . south america now a retirement destination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these ladies could be sunning themselves in rio meanwhile , the appreciating euro now punches more purchasing power in latin america , but not enough to keep up with the soaring property values in traditional second-home or retirement destinations in southern europe .
overcrowding in spain , portugal and greece have eroded those countries ' charm , making distant south america even more attractive . " the scenery and beaches in brazil are quite simply breathtaking , the cost of living -lrb- can range to -rrb- 20 percent lower than the average uk or european equivalents , property prices are incredibly cheap and the country is highly accessible , " international property consultant amberland tells prospective buyers on its web site . brazil places no restrictions on the purchase of real estate by foreigners , who are only required to have an identification number for fiscal purposes . argentineans fight to keep land out of foreign hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buenos aires : argentina 's " european " capital argentina however bans foreigners from buying property within 100 kilometers of the country 's borders .
the purchase of huge tracts of land by tycoons like ted turner , douglas tompkins or luciano benetton , in fact , has stirred public sentiment .
author gonzalo sanchez claims in his book " patagonia sold " that at least 10 percent of argentina 's territory is in foreign hands . with the influx of money , prices are starting to rise in brazil .
foreign-driven development along brazil 's coast and a property boom in the country 's northeast , around natal and recife , have boosted land prices substantially . " in the cities , there is not so much difference , " brazilian real estate agent johannes von leiben told dpa .
" rio is expensive , sao paulo also , but they always were .
the really big difference is at the beach , that 's where prices went up in the last years .

he was 96 . " i will personally see to it that the cross of the commander of the legion of honor that was bestowed to him by charles de gaulle , for eternity , be placed with him in his casket , " lawyer francis vuillemin said in a statement . papon was stripped of france 's highest distinction , which he received as paris police chief personally from de gaulle in 1962 , by decree in november 1999 as is the case for any appointee to the legion who is convicted of a crime . guilty of crimes against humanity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papon 's role in the vichy government was made clear in a 1998 trial a senior official under the wartime vichy government , papon was sentenced to 10 years in jail in 1998 for his role in organizing the deportation of hundreds of jews to nazi germany , where most of them died in extermination camps . he was the only french nazi official to be convicted of a crime for his role in deporting french jews during world war two .
papon said he was unaware of the holocaust at the time and used his position in the vichy government to aid the french resistance . during the six-month trial , the longest in french history , papon came to symbolize france 's collaboration with the nazis . he was convicted of complicity in crimes against humanity after the court rejected his plea that he was a civil servant following instructions from above .
his release from paris ' la sante prison in 2002 on medical grounds angered jewish groups , who said that at his trial he never expressed sorrow for the victims of his bureaucratic zeal . the 1998 verdict came after president jacques chirac had for the first time acknowledged french responsibility in the jewish genocide , and appeared to confirm a new willingness to face up to the country 's wartime past . no remorse for crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the jews papon deported from france died in nazi extermination camps one of the lawyers representing the victims during the trial said the nazi collaborator went to his grave without ever feeling remorseful for his actions . " we never succeeded in bringing the henchman back to humanity , " gerard boulanger told the afp news service .
" maurice papon never understood and never admitted to what he had done . " for juliette benzazon , 77 , who lost 12 family members under the deportation orders , papon was also unrepentant to the end . " he was a man who did not want to recognize what he had done , who did not want to ask forgiveness from us or from the grand rabbi , " she told afp .
" he had no regrets , he said he was a civil servant . " vuillemin said papon 's family had yet to set a date for the funeral .

" one should have spoken with russia earlier as the sites where they -lrb- the missiles -rrb- are to be stationed are edging closer to russia , " steinmeier told the german business daily handelsblatt in an interview to be published monday .
" given the strategic nature of such projects , i call for a prudent approach and intensive dialogue with all partners who are directly or indirectly affected . " russian president vladimir putin last week accused the united states of making the world a more place with its plans for an anti-missile system . " one-sided illegitimate action has n't solved a single problem and has become a generator of many human tragedies , a source of tension , " putin said . iran not a threat to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said iran 's missiles could not reach europe us secretary of defense robert gates insisted that the missile system , which calls for placing 10 interceptor missiles in poland and the czech republic , was not directed against russia but to protect europe from missiles launched in the middle east . steinmeier , however , dismissed any potential threat posed by iranian rockets , saying tehran did not possess the technology to make such an attack .
he also spoke out against any immediate new sanctions against iran over its nuclear policies . " the most recent resolution of the un security council does not contain any automatic mechanism for the situation where iran does not fulfill its obligations , " he said . us waiting for poland 's official answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has stationed some missiles in japan already the leader of the oppositions greens party , fritz kuhn , said the german government needed to make it clear to us secretary of state condoleezza rice during her visit to berlin this week that it would not support placing missiles in the two eu and nato member countries . " what the usa is doing can only be understood by russia as a provocation , " he told monday 's saarbrücker zeitung . exactly how much criticism germany needs to give the us remains unclear as poland has yet to decide if it will allow the americans to station missiles within the country .

" argentina : europe at a third of the price , " says one investment-promoting internet blurb .
another market observer puts the prices as low as one-tenth of european prices . while price is the key factor , cultural affinity also plays an important role , with the portuguese drawn to brazil and spaniards and italians to buenos aires , many to consolidate family ties . in argentina , where global tycoons have been buying up land in patagonia since the 1990s , middle-income investment is concentrating in the more up-market areas of its capital . " -lrb- investors -rrb- consider that buenos aires is a very similar city to any european capital , but with much lower real estate values , " guillermo rivanera , vice president of tizado propiedades , told the dpa news agency . preferred investment is in the pre-construction sale of large developments , and he said foreign interest has not yet had a significant impact on prices paid by locals in the city of more than 12 million . brazil and argentina share several qualities : with high interest rates and a history of economic uncertainties , mortgages are relatively rare , and real estate is usually paid for in cash . brazil 's real , valued 1-to-1 with the dollar in the mid-1990s , has fallen by more than half to 2.1 to the dollar .

overcrowding in spain , portugal and greece have eroded those countries ' charm , making distant south america even more attractive . " the scenery and beaches in brazil are quite simply breathtaking , the cost of living -lrb- can range to -rrb- 20 percent lower than the average uk or european equivalents , property prices are incredibly cheap and the country is highly accessible , " international property consultant amberland tells prospective buyers on its web site . brazil places no restrictions on the purchase of real estate by foreigners , who are only required to have an identification number for fiscal purposes . argentineans fight to keep land out of foreign hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buenos aires : argentina 's " european " capital argentina however bans foreigners from buying property within 100 kilometers of the country 's borders .
the purchase of huge tracts of land by tycoons like ted turner , douglas tompkins or luciano benetton , in fact , has stirred public sentiment .
author gonzalo sanchez claims in his book " patagonia sold " that at least 10 percent of argentina 's territory is in foreign hands . with the influx of money , prices are starting to rise in brazil .
foreign-driven development along brazil 's coast and a property boom in the country 's northeast , around natal and recife , have boosted land prices substantially . " in the cities , there is not so much difference , " brazilian real estate agent johannes von leiben told dpa .
" rio is expensive , sao paulo also , but they always were .

he was 96 . " i will personally see to it that the cross of the commander of the legion of honor that was bestowed to him by charles de gaulle , for eternity , be placed with him in his casket , " lawyer francis vuillemin said in a statement . papon was stripped of france 's highest distinction , which he received as paris police chief personally from de gaulle in 1962 , by decree in november 1999 as is the case for any appointee to the legion who is convicted of a crime . guilty of crimes against humanity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papon 's role in the vichy government was made clear in a 1998 trial a senior official under the wartime vichy government , papon was sentenced to 10 years in jail in 1998 for his role in organizing the deportation of hundreds of jews to nazi germany , where most of them died in extermination camps . he was the only french nazi official to be convicted of a crime for his role in deporting french jews during world war two .
papon said he was unaware of the holocaust at the time and used his position in the vichy government to aid the french resistance . during the six-month trial , the longest in french history , papon came to symbolize france 's collaboration with the nazis . he was convicted of complicity in crimes against humanity after the court rejected his plea that he was a civil servant following instructions from above .
his release from paris ' la sante prison in 2002 on medical grounds angered jewish groups , who said that at his trial he never expressed sorrow for the victims of his bureaucratic zeal . the 1998 verdict came after president jacques chirac had for the first time acknowledged french responsibility in the jewish genocide , and appeared to confirm a new willingness to face up to the country 's wartime past . no remorse for crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the jews papon deported from france died in nazi extermination camps one of the lawyers representing the victims during the trial said the nazi collaborator went to his grave without ever feeling remorseful for his actions . " we never succeeded in bringing the henchman back to humanity , " gerard boulanger told the afp news service .
" maurice papon never understood and never admitted to what he had done . " for juliette benzazon , 77 , who lost 12 family members under the deportation orders , papon was also unrepentant to the end . " he was a man who did not want to recognize what he had done , who did not want to ask forgiveness from us or from the grand rabbi , " she told afp .
" he had no regrets , he said he was a civil servant . " vuillemin said papon 's family had yet to set a date for the funeral .

" one should have spoken with russia earlier as the sites where they -lrb- the missiles -rrb- are to be stationed are edging closer to russia , " steinmeier told the german business daily handelsblatt in an interview to be published monday .
" given the strategic nature of such projects , i call for a prudent approach and intensive dialogue with all partners who are directly or indirectly affected . " russian president vladimir putin last week accused the united states of making the world a more place with its plans for an anti-missile system .

he also spoke out against any immediate new sanctions against iran over its nuclear policies . " the most recent resolution of the un security council does not contain any automatic mechanism for the situation where iran does not fulfill its obligations , " he said . us waiting for poland 's official answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has stationed some missiles in japan already the leader of the oppositions greens party , fritz kuhn , said the german government needed to make it clear to us secretary of state condoleezza rice during her visit to berlin this week that it would not support placing missiles in the two eu and nato member countries . " what the usa is doing can only be understood by russia as a provocation , " he told monday 's saarbrücker zeitung . exactly how much criticism germany needs to give the us remains unclear as poland has yet to decide if it will allow the americans to station missiles within the country . " we are preparing an answer that i think we will give to the american administration by diplomatic means within two weeks , " new polish defense minister aleksander szczyglo told poland 's pap news agency on sunday . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us defense chief to putin : " one cold war was enough " us defense secretary robert gates on sunday dismissed a stinging broadside against the united states by russian president vladimir putin , declaring : " one cold war was quite enough .

katharina has directed wagner operas before - " der fliegende holländer " -lrb- the flying dutchman -rrb- in würzburg in 2002 and " lohengrin " in budapest in 2003 . the legendary bayreuth the summer music festival , dedicated exclusively to the works of richard wagner , runs from july 25 to august 28 and comprises 30 performances , all sold-out long in advance .
the waiting list for tickets is currently over 10 years . father wo n't interfere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang wagner , before the ' festspielhaus ' theater in bayreuth this year will be katharina 's debut in the legendary festspielhaus built to the richard wagner 's own designs . bayreuth festival spokesman peter emmerich said that , as a direct descendent of the composer , katharina was " well aware that she must come up with something special , " adding that she " has a strong will of interpretation that wo n't bow even to ' meistersinger . " ' katharina 's production promised to turn on their head some of the cliches attached to the work and challenge traditional wagner fans , emmerich said .
wolfgang , who has himself directed three different stagings of " meistersinger " in bayreuth , had not interfered in katharina 's staging , he added . troupe of young novices in the pit for the new production will be upcoming german conductor sebastian weigle , also making his debut in bayreuth .
many of the mostly young cast of singers will also be singing in the hallowed auditorium for the first time as well , including german bass franz hawlata as hans sachs .
a relative newcomer , us soprano amanda mace , is to sing the role of eva . the only bayreuth veteran in the production will be us tenor robert dean smith as walther von stolzing .
smith has trodden bayreuth 's boards before , in the equally taxing roles of tristan , lohengrin and siegmund . katharina 's partner , endrik von wottrich , is to star as siegmund in the first revival of tankred dorst 's complete four-part " ring , " which critics panned at its premiere last year . some old favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner has big shoes to fill us tenor stephen gould will return in the role of siegfried as well us soprano linda watson as brünnhilde while german star conductor christian thielemann , bayreuth 's unofficial musical director , is to be in the pit once again . italian conductor fabio luisi is to make his debut in a revival of philip arlaud 's well-loved production of " tannhäuser " with german tenor wolfgang millgramm in the title role . the controversial production of " parsifal " by christoph schlingensief , considered the enfant terrible of german theater , is being revived for the final time under the baton of hungarian conductor adam fischer . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bravos and boos for new " ring " production in bayreuth the first " ring " cycle concluded monday to mixed reviews and a polarized audience .
most agree , however , that conductor christian thielemann and the singers saved the underdeveloped production .

katharina has directed wagner operas before - " der fliegende holländer " -lrb- the flying dutchman -rrb- in würzburg in 2002 and " lohengrin " in budapest in 2003 . the legendary bayreuth the summer music festival , dedicated exclusively to the works of richard wagner , runs from july 25 to august 28 and comprises 30 performances , all sold-out long in advance .
the waiting list for tickets is currently over 10 years . father wo n't interfere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang wagner , before the ' festspielhaus ' theater in bayreuth this year will be katharina 's debut in the legendary festspielhaus built to the richard wagner 's own designs . bayreuth festival spokesman peter emmerich said that , as a direct descendent of the composer , katharina was " well aware that she must come up with something special , " adding that she " has a strong will of interpretation that wo n't bow even to ' meistersinger . " ' katharina 's production promised to turn on their head some of the cliches attached to the work and challenge traditional wagner fans , emmerich said .
wolfgang , who has himself directed three different stagings of " meistersinger " in bayreuth , had not interfered in katharina 's staging , he added . troupe of young novices in the pit for the new production will be upcoming german conductor sebastian weigle , also making his debut in bayreuth .
many of the mostly young cast of singers will also be singing in the hallowed auditorium for the first time as well , including german bass franz hawlata as hans sachs .
a relative newcomer , us soprano amanda mace , is to sing the role of eva . the only bayreuth veteran in the production will be us tenor robert dean smith as walther von stolzing .
smith has trodden bayreuth 's boards before , in the equally taxing roles of tristan , lohengrin and siegmund . katharina 's partner , endrik von wottrich , is to star as siegmund in the first revival of tankred dorst 's complete four-part " ring , " which critics panned at its premiere last year . some old favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner has big shoes to fill us tenor stephen gould will return in the role of siegfried as well us soprano linda watson as brünnhilde while german star conductor christian thielemann , bayreuth 's unofficial musical director , is to be in the pit once again . italian conductor fabio luisi is to make his debut in a revival of philip arlaud 's well-loved production of " tannhäuser " with german tenor wolfgang millgramm in the title role . the controversial production of " parsifal " by christoph schlingensief , considered the enfant terrible of german theater , is being revived for the final time under the baton of hungarian conductor adam fischer . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bravos and boos for new " ring " production in bayreuth the first " ring " cycle concluded monday to mixed reviews and a polarized audience .

" what people will remember , i have no idea .
i 'm not really a vain person , " chirac tells journalist pierre pean in " the stranger in the elysee , " long extracts of which appeared in this week 's edition of the magazine marianne .
" what i would like them to remember is that ...
france is , or tries to be , a country of tolerance . " chirac said this is what was in his mind in 1995 when he acknowledged france 's complicity in the deportation of jews to nazi germany and later recognizing slavery as a crime against humanity . " what we did during the war towards the jews ... is something i can not imagine as emanating from the human spirit , " he said .
" whether you like it or not , slavery was a tragic moment in the world 's history , and we took part in it . " chirac - who hosted possibly his last france-africa summit in southern france during the week - speaks at length of his respect for non-western cultures , criticizing the colonial-era " looting " of the african continent . regret for african exploitation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac wants to be remembered as a friend of africa " we stole everything they had , and then told them they were no good , " he said .
" now we are using grants to poach their brightest people and keep on telling those that remain : ' these negroes are really good for nothing . " ' from the 1960s , he said he secretly raised funds for nelson mandela 's african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- - priding himself on his public refusal to visit south africa under apartheid . he described his aversion for racism as " something almost physical , " saying he always resisted pressure to strike an alliance with jean-marie le pen 's anti-immigration national front . " a deal with the national front was the line i always refused to cross , " chirac said .
" there is a profound danger there , because you are playing with the lowest of human instincts . " chirac still adamant over iraq decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq spilt was strongest between bush and chirac asked about the decision to go head-to-head with us president george w. bush over the invasion of iraq , chirac stood by his guns . " i told bush over and over that he was making a colossal mistake ...
the americans refused to believe me , " chirac said .
" the war in iraq gave us ample proof that any solution founded on unilateralism , force , or the illusion that the western model can be exported off-the-shelf , is doomed to failure . " chirac also admitted he has always been " uncomfortable with the hegemony of companies like coca-cola ...
i am constantly running into problems with the americans , always trying to impose their point of view . " he described the delicate task of preserving france 's welfare state in a time of globalization : " i am convinced that economic liberalism is destined to the same failure as communism , and that it will lead to the same excesses . " " jacques the lad " reputation addressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac 's reputation as a charmer has not been denied long chapters delve into chirac 's personal life , where he speaks candidly of his daughter laurence 's life-long battle with anorexia .
" i have no reason to deny it .
it has been the tragedy of my life , " he said , making even the worst " political backstabbing " pale into insignificance . chirac confessed that he had not been " averse to women " , but " never overdid it either , " laughing off his wife 's bernadette 's comments about his alleged appetites as " exaggerated . " he half-admits rumors of a passionate relationship with a french journalist in the 1970s . " perhaps ...
i do n't deny it , " but he turned serious when asked if his marriage was ever at risk : " it is absolutely clear that i never thought of leaving my wife .
absolutely clear .

he was 96 . " i will personally see to it that the cross of the commander of the legion of honor that was bestowed to him by charles de gaulle , for eternity , be placed with him in his casket , " lawyer francis vuillemin said in a statement . papon was stripped of france 's highest distinction , which he received as paris police chief personally from de gaulle in 1962 , by decree in november 1999 as is the case for any appointee to the legion who is convicted of a crime . guilty of crimes against humanity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papon 's role in the vichy government was made clear in a 1998 trial a senior official under the wartime vichy government , papon was sentenced to 10 years in jail in 1998 for his role in organizing the deportation of hundreds of jews to nazi germany , where most of them died in extermination camps . he was the only french nazi official to be convicted of a crime for his role in deporting french jews during world war two .
papon said he was unaware of the holocaust at the time and used his position in the vichy government to aid the french resistance . during the six-month trial , the longest in french history , papon came to symbolize france 's collaboration with the nazis . he was convicted of complicity in crimes against humanity after the court rejected his plea that he was a civil servant following instructions from above .
his release from paris ' la sante prison in 2002 on medical grounds angered jewish groups , who said that at his trial he never expressed sorrow for the victims of his bureaucratic zeal . the 1998 verdict came after president jacques chirac had for the first time acknowledged french responsibility in the jewish genocide , and appeared to confirm a new willingness to face up to the country 's wartime past . no remorse for crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the jews papon deported from france died in nazi extermination camps one of the lawyers representing the victims during the trial said the nazi collaborator went to his grave without ever feeling remorseful for his actions . " we never succeeded in bringing the henchman back to humanity , " gerard boulanger told the afp news service .
" maurice papon never understood and never admitted to what he had done . " for juliette benzazon , 77 , who lost 12 family members under the deportation orders , papon was also unrepentant to the end . " he was a man who did not want to recognize what he had done , who did not want to ask forgiveness from us or from the grand rabbi , " she told afp .
" he had no regrets , he said he was a civil servant . " vuillemin said papon 's family had yet to set a date for the funeral .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de investment -pipe- 18.02.2007 south america braces for influx of european property investors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's cheap property is one of the south american power 's less obvious attractions the rapid devaluation of brazilian and argentine currencies since the 1990s has lured europeans to act quickly on the renewed attractiveness of real estate in south america 's largest economies . " argentina : europe at a third of the price , " says one investment-promoting internet blurb .
another market observer puts the prices as low as one-tenth of european prices . while price is the key factor , cultural affinity also plays an important role , with the portuguese drawn to brazil and spaniards and italians to buenos aires , many to consolidate family ties . in argentina , where global tycoons have been buying up land in patagonia since the 1990s , middle-income investment is concentrating in the more up-market areas of its capital . " -lrb- investors -rrb- consider that buenos aires is a very similar city to any european capital , but with much lower real estate values , " guillermo rivanera , vice president of tizado propiedades , told the dpa news agency . preferred investment is in the pre-construction sale of large developments , and he said foreign interest has not yet had a significant impact on prices paid by locals in the city of more than 12 million . brazil and argentina share several qualities : with high interest rates and a history of economic uncertainties , mortgages are relatively rare , and real estate is usually paid for in cash . brazil 's real , valued 1-to-1 with the dollar in the mid-1990s , has fallen by more than half to 2.1 to the dollar .
argentina 's peso , after being allowed to float in early 2002 , dropped from 1-to-1 with the dollar to more than 3-to-1 . south america now a retirement destination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these ladies could be sunning themselves in rio meanwhile , the appreciating euro now punches more purchasing power in latin america , but not enough to keep up with the soaring property values in traditional second-home or retirement destinations in southern europe .
overcrowding in spain , portugal and greece have eroded those countries ' charm , making distant south america even more attractive . " the scenery and beaches in brazil are quite simply breathtaking , the cost of living -lrb- can range to -rrb- 20 percent lower than the average uk or european equivalents , property prices are incredibly cheap and the country is highly accessible , " international property consultant amberland tells prospective buyers on its web site . brazil places no restrictions on the purchase of real estate by foreigners , who are only required to have an identification number for fiscal purposes . argentineans fight to keep land out of foreign hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buenos aires : argentina 's " european " capital argentina however bans foreigners from buying property within 100 kilometers of the country 's borders .
the purchase of huge tracts of land by tycoons like ted turner , douglas tompkins or luciano benetton , in fact , has stirred public sentiment .
author gonzalo sanchez claims in his book " patagonia sold " that at least 10 percent of argentina 's territory is in foreign hands . with the influx of money , prices are starting to rise in brazil .
foreign-driven development along brazil 's coast and a property boom in the country 's northeast , around natal and recife , have boosted land prices substantially . " in the cities , there is not so much difference , " brazilian real estate agent johannes von leiben told dpa .
" rio is expensive , sao paulo also , but they always were .
the really big difference is at the beach , that 's where prices went up in the last years . " in this context , some dare to point to uruguay - sandwiched between the regional giants and once known as " the switzerland of south america " - as next in line for a property boom . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lured by property bargains , foreign investors flock to berlin drawn by some of the lowest property prices in europe and signs of an economic revival in germany , foreign investors are rushing to berlin to get a piece of the hot real estate market .

18 germany 's chinese population is expected to mark the lunar new year in a similar fashion to years past , though the cloud of seven unexplained murders will hang over the celebrations . chinese in germany celebrate the lunar new year on sunday the way ethnic chinese do all over the world - with family gatherings , visits to friends and lots to eat - but this year the celebrations have been overshadowed by the still-unexplained killings of seven chinese , who were found shot to death in a chinese restaurant near hamburg last week . " people were horrified by this terrible event , " said yu ming chu , chairwoman of the chinese gastronomy section of the german federation of hotels and restaurants . but yu and other members of the chinese community were more upset by the way the german press seized on the story , linking the slayings in the small town of sittensen to gangsters and protection rackets . will customers come back ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six people were found dead in a chinese restaurant , another died later in the hospital " of course there are such cases , but they are very few , " said yu , whose organization represents 62 of the estimated 150 chinese restaurants operating in hamburg . " some of our members reported a sharp drop in business " after the killings , she said she expects customers will return for chinese new year celebrations when many restaurants offer special banquets . her own restaurant in the suburb of niendorf will be offering a 10-course year of the pig menu that includes shanghai-style " nian gao , " a new year 's cake made of glutinous rice . there are up to 80,000 chinese living in germany , about 0.1 percent of the country 's total population .
the largest chinese communities are located in hamburg and berlin . with its huge elbe river port and centuries of tradition in the export trade , hamburg has also become a major hub for chinese firms trying to establish a foothold in europe . about 10,000 chinese live in hamburg , whose links to china date back to the 19th century .
today there are about 400 chinese companies based in the port city , more than any other german or continental european metropolis . " chinese are very well-liked abroad , " said liu jen-kai of the german institute for asian affairs .
" they go about their business and are inconspicuous . " chinese part of everyday european life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is preparing for a weeklong spring festival beginning sunday chinese restaurants are today part of the architecture of almost every german city and a growing number of chinese-owned shops are sprouting up , selling chinese trinkets and other cheap goods . there has also been an influx of students from the people 's republic , making chinese the biggest group of foreigners studying at german universities . " germany is the most popular destination for chinese students after the united states , " liu said .
" most of them stay two to three years before returning home . " in the run-up to chinese new year celebrations , the chinese consulate in hamburg has thrown a reception and the taipei representative office is planning to do the same . the port city 's chinese association is hosting a major function at the plush hamburg conference center , complete with music , dancing and a raffle - but not until feb .
24 . chinese from taiwan , the people 's republic , malaysia , vietnam and other south-east asian nations are expected to attend . " the chinese community is very close , " said yu .
" everyone knows everyone else . " unlike other countries , there are no chinatowns in german cities .
but this does not bother the chinese community , according to yu .
in fact many of them are happy about it . " there are often protection rackets in such places , and many undesirable elements hang out there , " she said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg hosts china time festival it 's " china time " in hamburg - a city with a long history of chinese ties and the " china meets europe " summit set to take place from september 13-15 will be attracting an elite guest list from china and europe .

" what people will remember , i have no idea .
i 'm not really a vain person , " chirac tells journalist pierre pean in " the stranger in the elysee , " long extracts of which appeared in this week 's edition of the magazine marianne .
" what i would like them to remember is that ...
france is , or tries to be , a country of tolerance . " chirac said this is what was in his mind in 1995 when he acknowledged france 's complicity in the deportation of jews to nazi germany and later recognizing slavery as a crime against humanity . " what we did during the war towards the jews ... is something i can not imagine as emanating from the human spirit , " he said .
" whether you like it or not , slavery was a tragic moment in the world 's history , and we took part in it . " chirac - who hosted possibly his last france-africa summit in southern france during the week - speaks at length of his respect for non-western cultures , criticizing the colonial-era " looting " of the african continent . regret for african exploitation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac wants to be remembered as a friend of africa " we stole everything they had , and then told them they were no good , " he said .
" now we are using grants to poach their brightest people and keep on telling those that remain : ' these negroes are really good for nothing . " ' from the 1960s , he said he secretly raised funds for nelson mandela 's african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- - priding himself on his public refusal to visit south africa under apartheid . he described his aversion for racism as " something almost physical , " saying he always resisted pressure to strike an alliance with jean-marie le pen 's anti-immigration national front . " a deal with the national front was the line i always refused to cross , " chirac said .
" there is a profound danger there , because you are playing with the lowest of human instincts . " chirac still adamant over iraq decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq spilt was strongest between bush and chirac asked about the decision to go head-to-head with us president george w. bush over the invasion of iraq , chirac stood by his guns . " i told bush over and over that he was making a colossal mistake ...
the americans refused to believe me , " chirac said .
" the war in iraq gave us ample proof that any solution founded on unilateralism , force , or the illusion that the western model can be exported off-the-shelf , is doomed to failure . " chirac also admitted he has always been " uncomfortable with the hegemony of companies like coca-cola ...
i am constantly running into problems with the americans , always trying to impose their point of view . " he described the delicate task of preserving france 's welfare state in a time of globalization : " i am convinced that economic liberalism is destined to the same failure as communism , and that it will lead to the same excesses . " " jacques the lad " reputation addressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac 's reputation as a charmer has not been denied long chapters delve into chirac 's personal life , where he speaks candidly of his daughter laurence 's life-long battle with anorexia .
" i have no reason to deny it .
it has been the tragedy of my life , " he said , making even the worst " political backstabbing " pale into insignificance . chirac confessed that he had not been " averse to women " , but " never overdid it either , " laughing off his wife 's bernadette 's comments about his alleged appetites as " exaggerated . " he half-admits rumors of a passionate relationship with a french journalist in the 1970s . " perhaps ...
i do n't deny it , " but he turned serious when asked if his marriage was ever at risk : " it is absolutely clear that i never thought of leaving my wife .

" argentina : europe at a third of the price , " says one investment-promoting internet blurb .
another market observer puts the prices as low as one-tenth of european prices . while price is the key factor , cultural affinity also plays an important role , with the portuguese drawn to brazil and spaniards and italians to buenos aires , many to consolidate family ties . in argentina , where global tycoons have been buying up land in patagonia since the 1990s , middle-income investment is concentrating in the more up-market areas of its capital . " -lrb- investors -rrb- consider that buenos aires is a very similar city to any european capital , but with much lower real estate values , " guillermo rivanera , vice president of tizado propiedades , told the dpa news agency . preferred investment is in the pre-construction sale of large developments , and he said foreign interest has not yet had a significant impact on prices paid by locals in the city of more than 12 million . brazil and argentina share several qualities : with high interest rates and a history of economic uncertainties , mortgages are relatively rare , and real estate is usually paid for in cash . brazil 's real , valued 1-to-1 with the dollar in the mid-1990s , has fallen by more than half to 2.1 to the dollar .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de investment -pipe- 18.02.2007 south america braces for influx of european property investors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's cheap property is one of the south american power 's less obvious attractions the rapid devaluation of brazilian and argentine currencies since the 1990s has lured europeans to act quickly on the renewed attractiveness of real estate in south america 's largest economies . " argentina : europe at a third of the price , " says one investment-promoting internet blurb .
another market observer puts the prices as low as one-tenth of european prices . while price is the key factor , cultural affinity also plays an important role , with the portuguese drawn to brazil and spaniards and italians to buenos aires , many to consolidate family ties . in argentina , where global tycoons have been buying up land in patagonia since the 1990s , middle-income investment is concentrating in the more up-market areas of its capital . " -lrb- investors -rrb- consider that buenos aires is a very similar city to any european capital , but with much lower real estate values , " guillermo rivanera , vice president of tizado propiedades , told the dpa news agency . preferred investment is in the pre-construction sale of large developments , and he said foreign interest has not yet had a significant impact on prices paid by locals in the city of more than 12 million . brazil and argentina share several qualities : with high interest rates and a history of economic uncertainties , mortgages are relatively rare , and real estate is usually paid for in cash . brazil 's real , valued 1-to-1 with the dollar in the mid-1990s , has fallen by more than half to 2.1 to the dollar .
argentina 's peso , after being allowed to float in early 2002 , dropped from 1-to-1 with the dollar to more than 3-to-1 . south america now a retirement destination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these ladies could be sunning themselves in rio meanwhile , the appreciating euro now punches more purchasing power in latin america , but not enough to keep up with the soaring property values in traditional second-home or retirement destinations in southern europe .
overcrowding in spain , portugal and greece have eroded those countries ' charm , making distant south america even more attractive . " the scenery and beaches in brazil are quite simply breathtaking , the cost of living -lrb- can range to -rrb- 20 percent lower than the average uk or european equivalents , property prices are incredibly cheap and the country is highly accessible , " international property consultant amberland tells prospective buyers on its web site . brazil places no restrictions on the purchase of real estate by foreigners , who are only required to have an identification number for fiscal purposes . argentineans fight to keep land out of foreign hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buenos aires : argentina 's " european " capital argentina however bans foreigners from buying property within 100 kilometers of the country 's borders .
the purchase of huge tracts of land by tycoons like ted turner , douglas tompkins or luciano benetton , in fact , has stirred public sentiment .
author gonzalo sanchez claims in his book " patagonia sold " that at least 10 percent of argentina 's territory is in foreign hands . with the influx of money , prices are starting to rise in brazil .
foreign-driven development along brazil 's coast and a property boom in the country 's northeast , around natal and recife , have boosted land prices substantially . " in the cities , there is not so much difference , " brazilian real estate agent johannes von leiben told dpa .
" rio is expensive , sao paulo also , but they always were .
the really big difference is at the beach , that 's where prices went up in the last years . " in this context , some dare to point to uruguay - sandwiched between the regional giants and once known as " the switzerland of south america " - as next in line for a property boom . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lured by property bargains , foreign investors flock to berlin drawn by some of the lowest property prices in europe and signs of an economic revival in germany , foreign investors are rushing to berlin to get a piece of the hot real estate market .

" argentina : europe at a third of the price , " says one investment-promoting internet blurb .
another market observer puts the prices as low as one-tenth of european prices . while price is the key factor , cultural affinity also plays an important role , with the portuguese drawn to brazil and spaniards and italians to buenos aires , many to consolidate family ties . in argentina , where global tycoons have been buying up land in patagonia since the 1990s , middle-income investment is concentrating in the more up-market areas of its capital . " -lrb- investors -rrb- consider that buenos aires is a very similar city to any european capital , but with much lower real estate values , " guillermo rivanera , vice president of tizado propiedades , told the dpa news agency . preferred investment is in the pre-construction sale of large developments , and he said foreign interest has not yet had a significant impact on prices paid by locals in the city of more than 12 million . brazil and argentina share several qualities : with high interest rates and a history of economic uncertainties , mortgages are relatively rare , and real estate is usually paid for in cash . brazil 's real , valued 1-to-1 with the dollar in the mid-1990s , has fallen by more than half to 2.1 to the dollar .
argentina 's peso , after being allowed to float in early 2002 , dropped from 1-to-1 with the dollar to more than 3-to-1 . south america now a retirement destination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these ladies could be sunning themselves in rio meanwhile , the appreciating euro now punches more purchasing power in latin america , but not enough to keep up with the soaring property values in traditional second-home or retirement destinations in southern europe .
overcrowding in spain , portugal and greece have eroded those countries ' charm , making distant south america even more attractive . " the scenery and beaches in brazil are quite simply breathtaking , the cost of living -lrb- can range to -rrb- 20 percent lower than the average uk or european equivalents , property prices are incredibly cheap and the country is highly accessible , " international property consultant amberland tells prospective buyers on its web site . brazil places no restrictions on the purchase of real estate by foreigners , who are only required to have an identification number for fiscal purposes . argentineans fight to keep land out of foreign hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buenos aires : argentina 's " european " capital argentina however bans foreigners from buying property within 100 kilometers of the country 's borders .
the purchase of huge tracts of land by tycoons like ted turner , douglas tompkins or luciano benetton , in fact , has stirred public sentiment .
author gonzalo sanchez claims in his book " patagonia sold " that at least 10 percent of argentina 's territory is in foreign hands . with the influx of money , prices are starting to rise in brazil .
foreign-driven development along brazil 's coast and a property boom in the country 's northeast , around natal and recife , have boosted land prices substantially . " in the cities , there is not so much difference , " brazilian real estate agent johannes von leiben told dpa .
" rio is expensive , sao paulo also , but they always were .
the really big difference is at the beach , that 's where prices went up in the last years . " in this context , some dare to point to uruguay - sandwiched between the regional giants and once known as " the switzerland of south america " - as next in line for a property boom . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lured by property bargains , foreign investors flock to berlin drawn by some of the lowest property prices in europe and signs of an economic revival in germany , foreign investors are rushing to berlin to get a piece of the hot real estate market .

" what people will remember , i have no idea .
i 'm not really a vain person , " chirac tells journalist pierre pean in " the stranger in the elysee , " long extracts of which appeared in this week 's edition of the magazine marianne .
" what i would like them to remember is that ...
france is , or tries to be , a country of tolerance . " chirac said this is what was in his mind in 1995 when he acknowledged france 's complicity in the deportation of jews to nazi germany and later recognizing slavery as a crime against humanity . " what we did during the war towards the jews ... is something i can not imagine as emanating from the human spirit , " he said .
" whether you like it or not , slavery was a tragic moment in the world 's history , and we took part in it . " chirac - who hosted possibly his last france-africa summit in southern france during the week - speaks at length of his respect for non-western cultures , criticizing the colonial-era " looting " of the african continent . regret for african exploitation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac wants to be remembered as a friend of africa " we stole everything they had , and then told them they were no good , " he said .
" now we are using grants to poach their brightest people and keep on telling those that remain : ' these negroes are really good for nothing . " ' from the 1960s , he said he secretly raised funds for nelson mandela 's african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- - priding himself on his public refusal to visit south africa under apartheid . he described his aversion for racism as " something almost physical , " saying he always resisted pressure to strike an alliance with jean-marie le pen 's anti-immigration national front . " a deal with the national front was the line i always refused to cross , " chirac said .
" there is a profound danger there , because you are playing with the lowest of human instincts . " chirac still adamant over iraq decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq spilt was strongest between bush and chirac asked about the decision to go head-to-head with us president george w. bush over the invasion of iraq , chirac stood by his guns . " i told bush over and over that he was making a colossal mistake ...
the americans refused to believe me , " chirac said .
" the war in iraq gave us ample proof that any solution founded on unilateralism , force , or the illusion that the western model can be exported off-the-shelf , is doomed to failure . " chirac also admitted he has always been " uncomfortable with the hegemony of companies like coca-cola ...
i am constantly running into problems with the americans , always trying to impose their point of view . " he described the delicate task of preserving france 's welfare state in a time of globalization : " i am convinced that economic liberalism is destined to the same failure as communism , and that it will lead to the same excesses . " " jacques the lad " reputation addressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac 's reputation as a charmer has not been denied long chapters delve into chirac 's personal life , where he speaks candidly of his daughter laurence 's life-long battle with anorexia .
" i have no reason to deny it .
it has been the tragedy of my life , " he said , making even the worst " political backstabbing " pale into insignificance . chirac confessed that he had not been " averse to women " , but " never overdid it either , " laughing off his wife 's bernadette 's comments about his alleged appetites as " exaggerated . " he half-admits rumors of a passionate relationship with a french journalist in the 1970s . " perhaps ...
i do n't deny it , " but he turned serious when asked if his marriage was ever at risk : " it is absolutely clear that i never thought of leaving my wife .

18 germany 's chinese population is expected to mark the lunar new year in a similar fashion to years past , though the cloud of seven unexplained murders will hang over the celebrations . chinese in germany celebrate the lunar new year on sunday the way ethnic chinese do all over the world - with family gatherings , visits to friends and lots to eat - but this year the celebrations have been overshadowed by the still-unexplained killings of seven chinese , who were found shot to death in a chinese restaurant near hamburg last week . " people were horrified by this terrible event , " said yu ming chu , chairwoman of the chinese gastronomy section of the german federation of hotels and restaurants . but yu and other members of the chinese community were more upset by the way the german press seized on the story , linking the slayings in the small town of sittensen to gangsters and protection rackets . will customers come back ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six people were found dead in a chinese restaurant , another died later in the hospital " of course there are such cases , but they are very few , " said yu , whose organization represents 62 of the estimated 150 chinese restaurants operating in hamburg .

today there are about 400 chinese companies based in the port city , more than any other german or continental european metropolis . " chinese are very well-liked abroad , " said liu jen-kai of the german institute for asian affairs .
" they go about their business and are inconspicuous .

" germany is the most popular destination for chinese students after the united states , " liu said .
" most of them stay two to three years before returning home . " in the run-up to chinese new year celebrations , the chinese consulate in hamburg has thrown a reception and the taipei representative office is planning to do the same . the port city 's chinese association is hosting a major function at the plush hamburg conference center , complete with music , dancing and a raffle - but not until feb .

" what people will remember , i have no idea .
i 'm not really a vain person , " chirac tells journalist pierre pean in " the stranger in the elysee , " long extracts of which appeared in this week 's edition of the magazine marianne .
" what i would like them to remember is that ...
france is , or tries to be , a country of tolerance . " chirac said this is what was in his mind in 1995 when he acknowledged france 's complicity in the deportation of jews to nazi germany and later recognizing slavery as a crime against humanity . " what we did during the war towards the jews ... is something i can not imagine as emanating from the human spirit , " he said .
" whether you like it or not , slavery was a tragic moment in the world 's history , and we took part in it . " chirac - who hosted possibly his last france-africa summit in southern france during the week - speaks at length of his respect for non-western cultures , criticizing the colonial-era " looting " of the african continent . regret for african exploitation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac wants to be remembered as a friend of africa " we stole everything they had , and then told them they were no good , " he said .
" now we are using grants to poach their brightest people and keep on telling those that remain : ' these negroes are really good for nothing . " ' from the 1960s , he said he secretly raised funds for nelson mandela 's african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- - priding himself on his public refusal to visit south africa under apartheid . he described his aversion for racism as " something almost physical , " saying he always resisted pressure to strike an alliance with jean-marie le pen 's anti-immigration national front . " a deal with the national front was the line i always refused to cross , " chirac said .
" there is a profound danger there , because you are playing with the lowest of human instincts . " chirac still adamant over iraq decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq spilt was strongest between bush and chirac asked about the decision to go head-to-head with us president george w. bush over the invasion of iraq , chirac stood by his guns . " i told bush over and over that he was making a colossal mistake ...
the americans refused to believe me , " chirac said .
" the war in iraq gave us ample proof that any solution founded on unilateralism , force , or the illusion that the western model can be exported off-the-shelf , is doomed to failure . " chirac also admitted he has always been " uncomfortable with the hegemony of companies like coca-cola ...
i am constantly running into problems with the americans , always trying to impose their point of view . " he described the delicate task of preserving france 's welfare state in a time of globalization : " i am convinced that economic liberalism is destined to the same failure as communism , and that it will lead to the same excesses . " " jacques the lad " reputation addressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac 's reputation as a charmer has not been denied long chapters delve into chirac 's personal life , where he speaks candidly of his daughter laurence 's life-long battle with anorexia .
" i have no reason to deny it .
it has been the tragedy of my life , " he said , making even the worst " political backstabbing " pale into insignificance . chirac confessed that he had not been " averse to women " , but " never overdid it either , " laughing off his wife 's bernadette 's comments about his alleged appetites as " exaggerated . " he half-admits rumors of a passionate relationship with a french journalist in the 1970s . " perhaps ...
i do n't deny it , " but he turned serious when asked if his marriage was ever at risk : " it is absolutely clear that i never thought of leaving my wife .

" argentina : europe at a third of the price , " says one investment-promoting internet blurb .
another market observer puts the prices as low as one-tenth of european prices . while price is the key factor , cultural affinity also plays an important role , with the portuguese drawn to brazil and spaniards and italians to buenos aires , many to consolidate family ties . in argentina , where global tycoons have been buying up land in patagonia since the 1990s , middle-income investment is concentrating in the more up-market areas of its capital . " -lrb- investors -rrb- consider that buenos aires is a very similar city to any european capital , but with much lower real estate values , " guillermo rivanera , vice president of tizado propiedades , told the dpa news agency . preferred investment is in the pre-construction sale of large developments , and he said foreign interest has not yet had a significant impact on prices paid by locals in the city of more than 12 million . brazil and argentina share several qualities : with high interest rates and a history of economic uncertainties , mortgages are relatively rare , and real estate is usually paid for in cash . brazil 's real , valued 1-to-1 with the dollar in the mid-1990s , has fallen by more than half to 2.1 to the dollar .
argentina 's peso , after being allowed to float in early 2002 , dropped from 1-to-1 with the dollar to more than 3-to-1 . south america now a retirement destination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these ladies could be sunning themselves in rio meanwhile , the appreciating euro now punches more purchasing power in latin america , but not enough to keep up with the soaring property values in traditional second-home or retirement destinations in southern europe .
overcrowding in spain , portugal and greece have eroded those countries ' charm , making distant south america even more attractive . " the scenery and beaches in brazil are quite simply breathtaking , the cost of living -lrb- can range to -rrb- 20 percent lower than the average uk or european equivalents , property prices are incredibly cheap and the country is highly accessible , " international property consultant amberland tells prospective buyers on its web site . brazil places no restrictions on the purchase of real estate by foreigners , who are only required to have an identification number for fiscal purposes . argentineans fight to keep land out of foreign hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buenos aires : argentina 's " european " capital argentina however bans foreigners from buying property within 100 kilometers of the country 's borders .
the purchase of huge tracts of land by tycoons like ted turner , douglas tompkins or luciano benetton , in fact , has stirred public sentiment .
author gonzalo sanchez claims in his book " patagonia sold " that at least 10 percent of argentina 's territory is in foreign hands . with the influx of money , prices are starting to rise in brazil .
foreign-driven development along brazil 's coast and a property boom in the country 's northeast , around natal and recife , have boosted land prices substantially . " in the cities , there is not so much difference , " brazilian real estate agent johannes von leiben told dpa .
" rio is expensive , sao paulo also , but they always were .
the really big difference is at the beach , that 's where prices went up in the last years . " in this context , some dare to point to uruguay - sandwiched between the regional giants and once known as " the switzerland of south america " - as next in line for a property boom . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lured by property bargains , foreign investors flock to berlin drawn by some of the lowest property prices in europe and signs of an economic revival in germany , foreign investors are rushing to berlin to get a piece of the hot real estate market .

" argentina : europe at a third of the price , " says one investment-promoting internet blurb .
another market observer puts the prices as low as one-tenth of european prices . while price is the key factor , cultural affinity also plays an important role , with the portuguese drawn to brazil and spaniards and italians to buenos aires , many to consolidate family ties . in argentina , where global tycoons have been buying up land in patagonia since the 1990s , middle-income investment is concentrating in the more up-market areas of its capital . " -lrb- investors -rrb- consider that buenos aires is a very similar city to any european capital , but with much lower real estate values , " guillermo rivanera , vice president of tizado propiedades , told the dpa news agency . preferred investment is in the pre-construction sale of large developments , and he said foreign interest has not yet had a significant impact on prices paid by locals in the city of more than 12 million . brazil and argentina share several qualities : with high interest rates and a history of economic uncertainties , mortgages are relatively rare , and real estate is usually paid for in cash . brazil 's real , valued 1-to-1 with the dollar in the mid-1990s , has fallen by more than half to 2.1 to the dollar .
argentina 's peso , after being allowed to float in early 2002 , dropped from 1-to-1 with the dollar to more than 3-to-1 . south america now a retirement destination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these ladies could be sunning themselves in rio meanwhile , the appreciating euro now punches more purchasing power in latin america , but not enough to keep up with the soaring property values in traditional second-home or retirement destinations in southern europe .
overcrowding in spain , portugal and greece have eroded those countries ' charm , making distant south america even more attractive . " the scenery and beaches in brazil are quite simply breathtaking , the cost of living -lrb- can range to -rrb- 20 percent lower than the average uk or european equivalents , property prices are incredibly cheap and the country is highly accessible , " international property consultant amberland tells prospective buyers on its web site . brazil places no restrictions on the purchase of real estate by foreigners , who are only required to have an identification number for fiscal purposes . argentineans fight to keep land out of foreign hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buenos aires : argentina 's " european " capital argentina however bans foreigners from buying property within 100 kilometers of the country 's borders .
the purchase of huge tracts of land by tycoons like ted turner , douglas tompkins or luciano benetton , in fact , has stirred public sentiment .
author gonzalo sanchez claims in his book " patagonia sold " that at least 10 percent of argentina 's territory is in foreign hands . with the influx of money , prices are starting to rise in brazil .
foreign-driven development along brazil 's coast and a property boom in the country 's northeast , around natal and recife , have boosted land prices substantially . " in the cities , there is not so much difference , " brazilian real estate agent johannes von leiben told dpa .
" rio is expensive , sao paulo also , but they always were .
the really big difference is at the beach , that 's where prices went up in the last years . " in this context , some dare to point to uruguay - sandwiched between the regional giants and once known as " the switzerland of south america " - as next in line for a property boom . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lured by property bargains , foreign investors flock to berlin drawn by some of the lowest property prices in europe and signs of an economic revival in germany , foreign investors are rushing to berlin to get a piece of the hot real estate market .

he was 96 . " i will personally see to it that the cross of the commander of the legion of honor that was bestowed to him by charles de gaulle , for eternity , be placed with him in his casket , " lawyer francis vuillemin said in a statement . papon was stripped of france 's highest distinction , which he received as paris police chief personally from de gaulle in 1962 , by decree in november 1999 as is the case for any appointee to the legion who is convicted of a crime . guilty of crimes against humanity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papon 's role in the vichy government was made clear in a 1998 trial a senior official under the wartime vichy government , papon was sentenced to 10 years in jail in 1998 for his role in organizing the deportation of hundreds of jews to nazi germany , where most of them died in extermination camps . he was the only french nazi official to be convicted of a crime for his role in deporting french jews during world war two .
papon said he was unaware of the holocaust at the time and used his position in the vichy government to aid the french resistance . during the six-month trial , the longest in french history , papon came to symbolize france 's collaboration with the nazis . he was convicted of complicity in crimes against humanity after the court rejected his plea that he was a civil servant following instructions from above .
his release from paris ' la sante prison in 2002 on medical grounds angered jewish groups , who said that at his trial he never expressed sorrow for the victims of his bureaucratic zeal . the 1998 verdict came after president jacques chirac had for the first time acknowledged french responsibility in the jewish genocide , and appeared to confirm a new willingness to face up to the country 's wartime past . no remorse for crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the jews papon deported from france died in nazi extermination camps one of the lawyers representing the victims during the trial said the nazi collaborator went to his grave without ever feeling remorseful for his actions . " we never succeeded in bringing the henchman back to humanity , " gerard boulanger told the afp news service .
" maurice papon never understood and never admitted to what he had done . " for juliette benzazon , 77 , who lost 12 family members under the deportation orders , papon was also unrepentant to the end . " he was a man who did not want to recognize what he had done , who did not want to ask forgiveness from us or from the grand rabbi , " she told afp .
" he had no regrets , he said he was a civil servant . " vuillemin said papon 's family had yet to set a date for the funeral .

" what people will remember , i have no idea .
i 'm not really a vain person , " chirac tells journalist pierre pean in " the stranger in the elysee , " long extracts of which appeared in this week 's edition of the magazine marianne .
" what i would like them to remember is that ...
france is , or tries to be , a country of tolerance . " chirac said this is what was in his mind in 1995 when he acknowledged france 's complicity in the deportation of jews to nazi germany and later recognizing slavery as a crime against humanity . " what we did during the war towards the jews ... is something i can not imagine as emanating from the human spirit , " he said .
" whether you like it or not , slavery was a tragic moment in the world 's history , and we took part in it . " chirac - who hosted possibly his last france-africa summit in southern france during the week - speaks at length of his respect for non-western cultures , criticizing the colonial-era " looting " of the african continent . regret for african exploitation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac wants to be remembered as a friend of africa " we stole everything they had , and then told them they were no good , " he said .
" now we are using grants to poach their brightest people and keep on telling those that remain : ' these negroes are really good for nothing . " ' from the 1960s , he said he secretly raised funds for nelson mandela 's african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- - priding himself on his public refusal to visit south africa under apartheid . he described his aversion for racism as " something almost physical , " saying he always resisted pressure to strike an alliance with jean-marie le pen 's anti-immigration national front . " a deal with the national front was the line i always refused to cross , " chirac said .
" there is a profound danger there , because you are playing with the lowest of human instincts . " chirac still adamant over iraq decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq spilt was strongest between bush and chirac asked about the decision to go head-to-head with us president george w. bush over the invasion of iraq , chirac stood by his guns . " i told bush over and over that he was making a colossal mistake ...
the americans refused to believe me , " chirac said .
" the war in iraq gave us ample proof that any solution founded on unilateralism , force , or the illusion that the western model can be exported off-the-shelf , is doomed to failure . " chirac also admitted he has always been " uncomfortable with the hegemony of companies like coca-cola ...
i am constantly running into problems with the americans , always trying to impose their point of view . " he described the delicate task of preserving france 's welfare state in a time of globalization : " i am convinced that economic liberalism is destined to the same failure as communism , and that it will lead to the same excesses . " " jacques the lad " reputation addressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac 's reputation as a charmer has not been denied long chapters delve into chirac 's personal life , where he speaks candidly of his daughter laurence 's life-long battle with anorexia .
" i have no reason to deny it .
it has been the tragedy of my life , " he said , making even the worst " political backstabbing " pale into insignificance . chirac confessed that he had not been " averse to women " , but " never overdid it either , " laughing off his wife 's bernadette 's comments about his alleged appetites as " exaggerated . " he half-admits rumors of a passionate relationship with a french journalist in the 1970s . " perhaps ...
i do n't deny it , " but he turned serious when asked if his marriage was ever at risk : " it is absolutely clear that i never thought of leaving my wife .

katharina has directed wagner operas before - " der fliegende holländer " -lrb- the flying dutchman -rrb- in würzburg in 2002 and " lohengrin " in budapest in 2003 . the legendary bayreuth the summer music festival , dedicated exclusively to the works of richard wagner , runs from july 25 to august 28 and comprises 30 performances , all sold-out long in advance .

" ' katharina 's production promised to turn on their head some of the cliches attached to the work and challenge traditional wagner fans , emmerich said .

" some of our members reported a sharp drop in business " after the killings , she said she expects customers will return for chinese new year celebrations when many restaurants offer special banquets . her own restaurant in the suburb of niendorf will be offering a 10-course year of the pig menu that includes shanghai-style " nian gao , " a new year 's cake made of glutinous rice . there are up to 80,000 chinese living in germany , about 0.1 percent of the country 's total population .
the largest chinese communities are located in hamburg and berlin . with its huge elbe river port and centuries of tradition in the export trade , hamburg has also become a major hub for chinese firms trying to establish a foothold in europe . about 10,000 chinese live in hamburg , whose links to china date back to the 19th century .
today there are about 400 chinese companies based in the port city , more than any other german or continental european metropolis . " chinese are very well-liked abroad , " said liu jen-kai of the german institute for asian affairs .
" they go about their business and are inconspicuous . " chinese part of everyday european life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is preparing for a weeklong spring festival beginning sunday chinese restaurants are today part of the architecture of almost every german city and a growing number of chinese-owned shops are sprouting up , selling chinese trinkets and other cheap goods . there has also been an influx of students from the people 's republic , making chinese the biggest group of foreigners studying at german universities . " germany is the most popular destination for chinese students after the united states , " liu said .
" most of them stay two to three years before returning home . " in the run-up to chinese new year celebrations , the chinese consulate in hamburg has thrown a reception and the taipei representative office is planning to do the same . the port city 's chinese association is hosting a major function at the plush hamburg conference center , complete with music , dancing and a raffle - but not until feb .
24 . chinese from taiwan , the people 's republic , malaysia , vietnam and other south-east asian nations are expected to attend . " the chinese community is very close , " said yu .
" everyone knows everyone else . " unlike other countries , there are no chinatowns in german cities .
but this does not bother the chinese community , according to yu .
in fact many of them are happy about it . " there are often protection rackets in such places , and many undesirable elements hang out there , " she said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg hosts china time festival it 's " china time " in hamburg - a city with a long history of chinese ties and the " china meets europe " summit set to take place from september 13-15 will be attracting an elite guest list from china and europe .

" one should have spoken with russia earlier as the sites where they -lrb- the missiles -rrb- are to be stationed are edging closer to russia , " steinmeier told the german business daily handelsblatt in an interview to be published monday .

he was 96 . " i will personally see to it that the cross of the commander of the legion of honor that was bestowed to him by charles de gaulle , for eternity , be placed with him in his casket , " lawyer francis vuillemin said in a statement . papon was stripped of france 's highest distinction , which he received as paris police chief personally from de gaulle in 1962 , by decree in november 1999 as is the case for any appointee to the legion who is convicted of a crime . guilty of crimes against humanity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papon 's role in the vichy government was made clear in a 1998 trial a senior official under the wartime vichy government , papon was sentenced to 10 years in jail in 1998 for his role in organizing the deportation of hundreds of jews to nazi germany , where most of them died in extermination camps . he was the only french nazi official to be convicted of a crime for his role in deporting french jews during world war two .
papon said he was unaware of the holocaust at the time and used his position in the vichy government to aid the french resistance . during the six-month trial , the longest in french history , papon came to symbolize france 's collaboration with the nazis . he was convicted of complicity in crimes against humanity after the court rejected his plea that he was a civil servant following instructions from above .
his release from paris ' la sante prison in 2002 on medical grounds angered jewish groups , who said that at his trial he never expressed sorrow for the victims of his bureaucratic zeal . the 1998 verdict came after president jacques chirac had for the first time acknowledged french responsibility in the jewish genocide , and appeared to confirm a new willingness to face up to the country 's wartime past . no remorse for crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the jews papon deported from france died in nazi extermination camps one of the lawyers representing the victims during the trial said the nazi collaborator went to his grave without ever feeling remorseful for his actions . " we never succeeded in bringing the henchman back to humanity , " gerard boulanger told the afp news service .
" maurice papon never understood and never admitted to what he had done . " for juliette benzazon , 77 , who lost 12 family members under the deportation orders , papon was also unrepentant to the end . " he was a man who did not want to recognize what he had done , who did not want to ask forgiveness from us or from the grand rabbi , " she told afp .
" he had no regrets , he said he was a civil servant . " vuillemin said papon 's family had yet to set a date for the funeral .

" argentina : europe at a third of the price , " says one investment-promoting internet blurb .
another market observer puts the prices as low as one-tenth of european prices . while price is the key factor , cultural affinity also plays an important role , with the portuguese drawn to brazil and spaniards and italians to buenos aires , many to consolidate family ties . in argentina , where global tycoons have been buying up land in patagonia since the 1990s , middle-income investment is concentrating in the more up-market areas of its capital . " -lrb- investors -rrb- consider that buenos aires is a very similar city to any european capital , but with much lower real estate values , " guillermo rivanera , vice president of tizado propiedades , told the dpa news agency . preferred investment is in the pre-construction sale of large developments , and he said foreign interest has not yet had a significant impact on prices paid by locals in the city of more than 12 million . brazil and argentina share several qualities : with high interest rates and a history of economic uncertainties , mortgages are relatively rare , and real estate is usually paid for in cash . brazil 's real , valued 1-to-1 with the dollar in the mid-1990s , has fallen by more than half to 2.1 to the dollar .
argentina 's peso , after being allowed to float in early 2002 , dropped from 1-to-1 with the dollar to more than 3-to-1 . south america now a retirement destination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these ladies could be sunning themselves in rio meanwhile , the appreciating euro now punches more purchasing power in latin america , but not enough to keep up with the soaring property values in traditional second-home or retirement destinations in southern europe .
overcrowding in spain , portugal and greece have eroded those countries ' charm , making distant south america even more attractive . " the scenery and beaches in brazil are quite simply breathtaking , the cost of living -lrb- can range to -rrb- 20 percent lower than the average uk or european equivalents , property prices are incredibly cheap and the country is highly accessible , " international property consultant amberland tells prospective buyers on its web site . brazil places no restrictions on the purchase of real estate by foreigners , who are only required to have an identification number for fiscal purposes . argentineans fight to keep land out of foreign hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buenos aires : argentina 's " european " capital argentina however bans foreigners from buying property within 100 kilometers of the country 's borders .
the purchase of huge tracts of land by tycoons like ted turner , douglas tompkins or luciano benetton , in fact , has stirred public sentiment .
author gonzalo sanchez claims in his book " patagonia sold " that at least 10 percent of argentina 's territory is in foreign hands . with the influx of money , prices are starting to rise in brazil .
foreign-driven development along brazil 's coast and a property boom in the country 's northeast , around natal and recife , have boosted land prices substantially . " in the cities , there is not so much difference , " brazilian real estate agent johannes von leiben told dpa .
" rio is expensive , sao paulo also , but they always were .
the really big difference is at the beach , that 's where prices went up in the last years . " in this context , some dare to point to uruguay - sandwiched between the regional giants and once known as " the switzerland of south america " - as next in line for a property boom . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lured by property bargains , foreign investors flock to berlin drawn by some of the lowest property prices in europe and signs of an economic revival in germany , foreign investors are rushing to berlin to get a piece of the hot real estate market .

he was 96 . " i will personally see to it that the cross of the commander of the legion of honor that was bestowed to him by charles de gaulle , for eternity , be placed with him in his casket , " lawyer francis vuillemin said in a statement . papon was stripped of france 's highest distinction , which he received as paris police chief personally from de gaulle in 1962 , by decree in november 1999 as is the case for any appointee to the legion who is convicted of a crime . guilty of crimes against humanity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papon 's role in the vichy government was made clear in a 1998 trial a senior official under the wartime vichy government , papon was sentenced to 10 years in jail in 1998 for his role in organizing the deportation of hundreds of jews to nazi germany , where most of them died in extermination camps . he was the only french nazi official to be convicted of a crime for his role in deporting french jews during world war two .
papon said he was unaware of the holocaust at the time and used his position in the vichy government to aid the french resistance . during the six-month trial , the longest in french history , papon came to symbolize france 's collaboration with the nazis . he was convicted of complicity in crimes against humanity after the court rejected his plea that he was a civil servant following instructions from above .
his release from paris ' la sante prison in 2002 on medical grounds angered jewish groups , who said that at his trial he never expressed sorrow for the victims of his bureaucratic zeal . the 1998 verdict came after president jacques chirac had for the first time acknowledged french responsibility in the jewish genocide , and appeared to confirm a new willingness to face up to the country 's wartime past . no remorse for crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the jews papon deported from france died in nazi extermination camps one of the lawyers representing the victims during the trial said the nazi collaborator went to his grave without ever feeling remorseful for his actions . " we never succeeded in bringing the henchman back to humanity , " gerard boulanger told the afp news service .
" maurice papon never understood and never admitted to what he had done . " for juliette benzazon , 77 , who lost 12 family members under the deportation orders , papon was also unrepentant to the end . " he was a man who did not want to recognize what he had done , who did not want to ask forgiveness from us or from the grand rabbi , " she told afp .
" he had no regrets , he said he was a civil servant . " vuillemin said papon 's family had yet to set a date for the funeral .
papon is survived by three children : aline , alain and muriel . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : belgium collaborated with nazis in deporting jews belgian historians have concluded that the country actively cooperated with germany 's nazi regime during world war ii in deporting jews .

" one should have spoken with russia earlier as the sites where they -lrb- the missiles -rrb- are to be stationed are edging closer to russia , " steinmeier told the german business daily handelsblatt in an interview to be published monday .
" given the strategic nature of such projects , i call for a prudent approach and intensive dialogue with all partners who are directly or indirectly affected .

he also spoke out against any immediate new sanctions against iran over its nuclear policies . " the most recent resolution of the un security council does not contain any automatic mechanism for the situation where iran does not fulfill its obligations , " he said . us waiting for poland 's official answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has stationed some missiles in japan already the leader of the oppositions greens party , fritz kuhn , said the german government needed to make it clear to us secretary of state condoleezza rice during her visit to berlin this week that it would not support placing missiles in the two eu and nato member countries . " what the usa is doing can only be understood by russia as a provocation , " he told monday 's saarbrücker zeitung . exactly how much criticism germany needs to give the us remains unclear as poland has yet to decide if it will allow the americans to station missiles within the country .

he was 96 . " i will personally see to it that the cross of the commander of the legion of honor that was bestowed to him by charles de gaulle , for eternity , be placed with him in his casket , " lawyer francis vuillemin said in a statement . papon was stripped of france 's highest distinction , which he received as paris police chief personally from de gaulle in 1962 , by decree in november 1999 as is the case for any appointee to the legion who is convicted of a crime . guilty of crimes against humanity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papon 's role in the vichy government was made clear in a 1998 trial a senior official under the wartime vichy government , papon was sentenced to 10 years in jail in 1998 for his role in organizing the deportation of hundreds of jews to nazi germany , where most of them died in extermination camps . he was the only french nazi official to be convicted of a crime for his role in deporting french jews during world war two .
papon said he was unaware of the holocaust at the time and used his position in the vichy government to aid the french resistance . during the six-month trial , the longest in french history , papon came to symbolize france 's collaboration with the nazis . he was convicted of complicity in crimes against humanity after the court rejected his plea that he was a civil servant following instructions from above .
his release from paris ' la sante prison in 2002 on medical grounds angered jewish groups , who said that at his trial he never expressed sorrow for the victims of his bureaucratic zeal . the 1998 verdict came after president jacques chirac had for the first time acknowledged french responsibility in the jewish genocide , and appeared to confirm a new willingness to face up to the country 's wartime past . no remorse for crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the jews papon deported from france died in nazi extermination camps one of the lawyers representing the victims during the trial said the nazi collaborator went to his grave without ever feeling remorseful for his actions . " we never succeeded in bringing the henchman back to humanity , " gerard boulanger told the afp news service .
" maurice papon never understood and never admitted to what he had done . " for juliette benzazon , 77 , who lost 12 family members under the deportation orders , papon was also unrepentant to the end . " he was a man who did not want to recognize what he had done , who did not want to ask forgiveness from us or from the grand rabbi , " she told afp .
" he had no regrets , he said he was a civil servant . " vuillemin said papon 's family had yet to set a date for the funeral .

he was 96 . " i will personally see to it that the cross of the commander of the legion of honor that was bestowed to him by charles de gaulle , for eternity , be placed with him in his casket , " lawyer francis vuillemin said in a statement . papon was stripped of france 's highest distinction , which he received as paris police chief personally from de gaulle in 1962 , by decree in november 1999 as is the case for any appointee to the legion who is convicted of a crime . guilty of crimes against humanity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papon 's role in the vichy government was made clear in a 1998 trial a senior official under the wartime vichy government , papon was sentenced to 10 years in jail in 1998 for his role in organizing the deportation of hundreds of jews to nazi germany , where most of them died in extermination camps . he was the only french nazi official to be convicted of a crime for his role in deporting french jews during world war two .
papon said he was unaware of the holocaust at the time and used his position in the vichy government to aid the french resistance . during the six-month trial , the longest in french history , papon came to symbolize france 's collaboration with the nazis . he was convicted of complicity in crimes against humanity after the court rejected his plea that he was a civil servant following instructions from above .
his release from paris ' la sante prison in 2002 on medical grounds angered jewish groups , who said that at his trial he never expressed sorrow for the victims of his bureaucratic zeal . the 1998 verdict came after president jacques chirac had for the first time acknowledged french responsibility in the jewish genocide , and appeared to confirm a new willingness to face up to the country 's wartime past . no remorse for crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the jews papon deported from france died in nazi extermination camps one of the lawyers representing the victims during the trial said the nazi collaborator went to his grave without ever feeling remorseful for his actions . " we never succeeded in bringing the henchman back to humanity , " gerard boulanger told the afp news service .
" maurice papon never understood and never admitted to what he had done . " for juliette benzazon , 77 , who lost 12 family members under the deportation orders , papon was also unrepentant to the end . " he was a man who did not want to recognize what he had done , who did not want to ask forgiveness from us or from the grand rabbi , " she told afp .
" he had no regrets , he said he was a civil servant . " vuillemin said papon 's family had yet to set a date for the funeral .
papon is survived by three children : aline , alain and muriel . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : belgium collaborated with nazis in deporting jews belgian historians have concluded that the country actively cooperated with germany 's nazi regime during world war ii in deporting jews .

" what people will remember , i have no idea .
i 'm not really a vain person , " chirac tells journalist pierre pean in " the stranger in the elysee , " long extracts of which appeared in this week 's edition of the magazine marianne .
" what i would like them to remember is that ...
france is , or tries to be , a country of tolerance . " chirac said this is what was in his mind in 1995 when he acknowledged france 's complicity in the deportation of jews to nazi germany and later recognizing slavery as a crime against humanity . " what we did during the war towards the jews ... is something i can not imagine as emanating from the human spirit , " he said .
" whether you like it or not , slavery was a tragic moment in the world 's history , and we took part in it . " chirac - who hosted possibly his last france-africa summit in southern france during the week - speaks at length of his respect for non-western cultures , criticizing the colonial-era " looting " of the african continent . regret for african exploitation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac wants to be remembered as a friend of africa " we stole everything they had , and then told them they were no good , " he said .
" now we are using grants to poach their brightest people and keep on telling those that remain : ' these negroes are really good for nothing . " ' from the 1960s , he said he secretly raised funds for nelson mandela 's african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- - priding himself on his public refusal to visit south africa under apartheid . he described his aversion for racism as " something almost physical , " saying he always resisted pressure to strike an alliance with jean-marie le pen 's anti-immigration national front . " a deal with the national front was the line i always refused to cross , " chirac said .
" there is a profound danger there , because you are playing with the lowest of human instincts . " chirac still adamant over iraq decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq spilt was strongest between bush and chirac asked about the decision to go head-to-head with us president george w. bush over the invasion of iraq , chirac stood by his guns . " i told bush over and over that he was making a colossal mistake ...
the americans refused to believe me , " chirac said .
" the war in iraq gave us ample proof that any solution founded on unilateralism , force , or the illusion that the western model can be exported off-the-shelf , is doomed to failure . " chirac also admitted he has always been " uncomfortable with the hegemony of companies like coca-cola ...
i am constantly running into problems with the americans , always trying to impose their point of view . " he described the delicate task of preserving france 's welfare state in a time of globalization : " i am convinced that economic liberalism is destined to the same failure as communism , and that it will lead to the same excesses . " " jacques the lad " reputation addressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac 's reputation as a charmer has not been denied long chapters delve into chirac 's personal life , where he speaks candidly of his daughter laurence 's life-long battle with anorexia .
" i have no reason to deny it .
it has been the tragedy of my life , " he said , making even the worst " political backstabbing " pale into insignificance . chirac confessed that he had not been " averse to women " , but " never overdid it either , " laughing off his wife 's bernadette 's comments about his alleged appetites as " exaggerated . " he half-admits rumors of a passionate relationship with a french journalist in the 1970s . " perhaps ...

mr blair told the observer he did not expect to win critics over at once , but a useful debate had been started .
the petition calls the policy " sinister and wrong " and warns the charge would be unfair to those who live away from their families , and poorer people the petition was so popular that at one point it crashed the pm 's website .
it appears on a new section of downing street 's website which was set up in november last year to allow anyone to address and deliver a petition directly to the prime minister .
transport secretary douglas alexander has accused the organisers of the petition on the 10 downing street website of spreading " myths " and pledged to press ahead with plans to pilot the scheme .
the man who started the petition , account manager peter roberts , 46 , from telford , has confessed to being " staggered " by the response and called for a meeting with government officials .
' full debate ' mr blair told the observer he welcomed the petition " not because i share the petitioners ' views - i do n't - but because i know the country needs to have a full debate on how we tackle road congestion and this petition has helped spark it . "
" over the next few days i will be sending out a response to everyone who has signed the petition against road charging explaining the problems the country faces and why i believe road pricing is surely part of the answer here as it is in many other countries .
" i 'm not kidding myself that this will change people 's views overnight .
" i am convinced , however , that the focus on this issue that the e-petition has brought about will help improve our understanding of the problems and the realisation that there are no cost-free answers .
" and that surely has got to be good news for the health of our democracy and for the chances of our country coming up with the right and sustainable solutions to the long-term challenges we face , " he said .
the pm noted that , after being criticised in the past as a " control freak " , he was now " under attack for allowing dissenting views on my own website " .
the observer reported that the government was considering introducing road pricing on a voluntary basis initially .
under plans suggested by the rac foundation , drivers who choose to have satellite-tracking equipment to measure how far and where they travel could be given discounts on other motoring taxes .
one scheme is for people to pay their tolls at the fuel pump in return for discounts on petrol duty .

mr blair told the observer he did not expect to win critics over at once , but a useful debate had been started .
the petition calls the policy " sinister and wrong " and warns the charge would be unfair to those who live away from their families , and poorer people the petition was so popular that at one point it crashed the pm 's website .
it appears on a new section of downing street 's website which was set up in november last year to allow anyone to address and deliver a petition directly to the prime minister .
transport secretary douglas alexander has accused the organisers of the petition on the 10 downing street website of spreading " myths " and pledged to press ahead with plans to pilot the scheme .
the man who started the petition , account manager peter roberts , 46 , from telford , has confessed to being " staggered " by the response and called for a meeting with government officials .
' full debate ' mr blair told the observer he welcomed the petition " not because i share the petitioners ' views - i do n't - but because i know the country needs to have a full debate on how we tackle road congestion and this petition has helped spark it . "
" over the next few days i will be sending out a response to everyone who has signed the petition against road charging explaining the problems the country faces and why i believe road pricing is surely part of the answer here as it is in many other countries .
" i 'm not kidding myself that this will change people 's views overnight .
" i am convinced , however , that the focus on this issue that the e-petition has brought about will help improve our understanding of the problems and the realisation that there are no cost-free answers .
" and that surely has got to be good news for the health of our democracy and for the chances of our country coming up with the right and sustainable solutions to the long-term challenges we face , " he said .
the pm noted that , after being criticised in the past as a " control freak " , he was now " under attack for allowing dissenting views on my own website " .
the observer reported that the government was considering introducing road pricing on a voluntary basis initially .
under plans suggested by the rac foundation , drivers who choose to have satellite-tracking equipment to measure how far and where they travel could be given discounts on other motoring taxes .
one scheme is for people to pay their tolls at the fuel pump in return for discounts on petrol duty .

mr blair told the observer he did not expect to win critics over at once , but a useful debate had been started .
the petition calls the policy " sinister and wrong " and warns the charge would be unfair to those who live away from their families , and poorer people the petition was so popular that at one point it crashed the pm 's website .
it appears on a new section of downing street 's website which was set up in november last year to allow anyone to address and deliver a petition directly to the prime minister .
transport secretary douglas alexander has accused the organisers of the petition on the 10 downing street website of spreading " myths " and pledged to press ahead with plans to pilot the scheme .
the man who started the petition , account manager peter roberts , 46 , from telford , has confessed to being " staggered " by the response and called for a meeting with government officials .
' full debate ' mr blair told the observer he welcomed the petition " not because i share the petitioners ' views - i do n't - but because i know the country needs to have a full debate on how we tackle road congestion and this petition has helped spark it . "
" over the next few days i will be sending out a response to everyone who has signed the petition against road charging explaining the problems the country faces and why i believe road pricing is surely part of the answer here as it is in many other countries .
" i 'm not kidding myself that this will change people 's views overnight .
" i am convinced , however , that the focus on this issue that the e-petition has brought about will help improve our understanding of the problems and the realisation that there are no cost-free answers .
" and that surely has got to be good news for the health of our democracy and for the chances of our country coming up with the right and sustainable solutions to the long-term challenges we face , " he said .
the pm noted that , after being criticised in the past as a " control freak " , he was now " under attack for allowing dissenting views on my own website " .
the observer reported that the government was considering introducing road pricing on a voluntary basis initially .
under plans suggested by the rac foundation , drivers who choose to have satellite-tracking equipment to measure how far and where they travel could be given discounts on other motoring taxes .
one scheme is for people to pay their tolls at the fuel pump in return for discounts on petrol duty .

many of wales ' 29 healthy living centres , set up to tackle social and health inequalities , have closed and the others face an uncertain future .
they were created five years ago with £ 18m of lottery money which was matched by other public bodies .
an assembly government spokesperson said decisions to continue funding the centres should be made locally .
total closure figures are not available from the big lottery fund or the assembly-sponsored wales centre for health , which developed and supports the project .
but the vice xhair of the ystradgynlais healthy living centre -lrb- hlc -rrb- , john steadman , told bbc wales ' the politics show that as many as 23 were closing .
he said : " i only know of two that have actually had additional funding , one up in the north near caernarfon and this one . "
" it was never expected that we should fund something from lottery sources on a permanent basis " hugh vaughan thomas , big lottery fund the ystradgynlais centre has received enough funding from powys county council to survive another year , he said .
the centres were set up to bring preventative health to some of wales ' most deprived communities , and provide services like mother and baby groups .
the £ 18m of lottery funding has now run out and many centres can not find enough cash to continue .
but the big lottery fund has said it was never the intention to provide long-term funding .
hugh vaughan thomas , from the fund , said : " it was never expected that we should fund something from lottery sources on a permanent basis .
' supportive ' " but i think there was every expectation that after our initial period others would be prepared to come in and help meet the costs .
" indeed part of the reason for our setting them up was that it took the pressure off the starting up costs ...
i 'm glad that half in a sense are able to continue .
i would have liked to have seen far more . "
opposition politicians have said more should be done by the assembly government to ensure the future of the project .
the assembly government , which has provided £ 75,000 to keep the maesgeirchen hlc near caernarfon open until it can secure other funding , said it was " supportive " of the work of the centres .
a spokesperson added : " the decision to continue funding healthy living ccentres in wales should be decided locally , for example , through partnership working with local authorities and lhbs .
" this ensures needs are assessed according to the requirements of local communities and in line with the local health , social care and well-being strategies .
" the wales centre for health is working with healthy living centres and the big lottery fund to assist in these transitions . "

mike edmunds , 61 , of trinant , caerphilly , was told last year he had kidney failure and needed a transplant .
he faced a two-year wait until tests revealed that jean , 57 , his wife of 19 years , was a compatible donor .
mr edmunds , who works at the pot noodle factory in crumlin , has described his wife as " one-in-a-million " .
the couple were told on valentine 's day - the same day they celebrated their wedding anniversary - that they can undergo the six-hour surgery .
" without jean i could have died .
she 's giving up part of herself to help me and it 's amazing , " mr edmunds told the south wales argus .
" she 's one-in-a-million - but then i always knew that .
i 'm a very lucky man . "
i could understand it jean edmunds on her husband 's reluctance to have her kidney mrs edmunds , who works at blackwood cancer care line , told the bbc news website that she had been told the fact that her kidney was compatible with her husband was irregular , but not that uncommon .
it was in january 2006 that mr edmunds became increasingly concerned about his health after being told he had kidney failure and his body rejected dialysis treatment .
he was diagnosed in 1989 when it was found that one kidney had failed and the other was operating at 75 % efficiency .
he became more and more ill and a year ago was told the kidney was now operating at only 7 % .
final scan as he faced a potentially long wait for a donor , mrs edmunds went for tests and , following a final scan , discovered that she was a match .
the transplant is now due to take place at the university hospital of wales in cardiff on 12 march .
she said her husband had not initially wanted her to give him her kidney out of concern for her health , but he had become increasingly unwell .
" i could understand it , " she said .
" if it was me -lrb- in his position -rrb- i would n't want his . "
mr edmunds regularly plays a pantomime dame in local amateur theatrical productions , has been too unwell to act recently .

mike edmunds , 61 , of trinant , caerphilly , was told last year he had kidney failure and needed a transplant .
he faced a two-year wait until tests revealed that jean , 57 , his wife of 19 years , was a compatible donor .
mr edmunds , who works at the pot noodle factory in crumlin , has described his wife as " one-in-a-million " .
the couple were told on valentine 's day - the same day they celebrated their wedding anniversary - that they can undergo the six-hour surgery .
" without jean i could have died .
she 's giving up part of herself to help me and it 's amazing , " mr edmunds told the south wales argus .
" she 's one-in-a-million - but then i always knew that .
i 'm a very lucky man . "
i could understand it jean edmunds on her husband 's reluctance to have her kidney mrs edmunds , who works at blackwood cancer care line , told the bbc news website that she had been told the fact that her kidney was compatible with her husband was irregular , but not that uncommon .
it was in january 2006 that mr edmunds became increasingly concerned about his health after being told he had kidney failure and his body rejected dialysis treatment .
he was diagnosed in 1989 when it was found that one kidney had failed and the other was operating at 75 % efficiency .
he became more and more ill and a year ago was told the kidney was now operating at only 7 % .
final scan as he faced a potentially long wait for a donor , mrs edmunds went for tests and , following a final scan , discovered that she was a match .
the transplant is now due to take place at the university hospital of wales in cardiff on 12 march .
she said her husband had not initially wanted her to give him her kidney out of concern for her health , but he had become increasingly unwell .
" i could understand it , " she said .
" if it was me -lrb- in his position -rrb- i would n't want his . "
mr edmunds regularly plays a pantomime dame in local amateur theatrical productions , has been too unwell to act recently .
but he is able to direct alice in memoland , at the newbridge memo , which runs from 21-25 february .

the automated birdwatcher stands in a us wildlife reserve in arkansas , scanning the skies for a glimpse of the elusive ivory-billed woodpecker .
the bird was once thought to be extinct , but potential sightings in the area in 2004 renewed the search .
the system uses two video cameras to capture continuous images of the sky that are scrutinised for evidence of bird life by sophisticated software .
any shot that it does not believe contains a bird is discarded .
" it 's been running for three months continuously now and it only keeps one image in every 10,000 it collects , " said dr ken goldberg of the university of california , berkeley , who developed the system .
" we have caught some very exciting images of birds . "
no pictures of the charismatic red , white and black ivory-billed woodpecker have yet turned up .
unconfirmed sighting the bird used to be found across the south-eastern us and cuba but logging and forest clearance squeezed it out of its environment . "
the presence of a human observer can affect the behaviour of the animals ... robots can help " dr ken goldberg university of california , berkeley the last confirmed sighting of a lonely unpaired female was in 1944 .
since then , decades of searches yielded nothing and any hope of finding the bird diminished .
but a possible sighting in arkansas in 2004 reinvigorated ornithologists , with researchers from cornell leading systematic searches of the cache river national wildlife refuge in arkansas each year .
but the wetland and forest region of the lower mississippi river valley is 62,000 acres -lrb- 250 sq km -rrb- and human searches can be tricky .
" the problem with field biology is that it is very difficult , " said dr goldberg .
" you have to go out to somewhere remote , it 's lonely , it 's cold , it can be downright dangerous ; and the presence of a human observer can affect the behaviour of the animals you are trying to study .
" so our idea is that robots can help . "
everything but the bird the device , installed in the refuge , consists of two high-resolution video cameras connected to a hard disk , all installed in a weatherproof case .
a deliberately conspicuous " radiation hazard " warning sticker is displayed on the outside , " to prevent hunters using it as target practice " .
the digital cameras point towards the sky , continuously capturing two-megapixel images .
advanced algorithms analyse each frame , discarding the images it believes does not contain an image of a bird and saving those that it thinks does .
" we build a statistical model of the sky and look for outliers - pixels that suddenly look very different , " said dr goldberg .
" then we look for groups of outliers of a certain size and then we look for things moving at a certain velocity . "
the saved images are stored on hard disks that are routinely removed by a local birdwatcher who , along with other volunteers , scrutinise each frame .
at the moment falling leaves or other flying objects like helicopters can confuse the system .
but it has captured shots of geese , hawks and a heron , proving that when , and if , the time comes , it is capable of capturing a shot of an ivory-billed woodpecker .
future views however , it does have some limitations , such as only being able to survey one particular site .
the system can also only scan the sky because the algorithms used in the analysis can not cope with staring deep into the forest and trying to pick out moving birds from the gently swaying branches of trees .
dr goldberg believes that this will be possible eventually ; along with other more advanced analysis .
" the next level is to determine what is a woodpecker versus an average bird , but that 's still a long way off , " he said .
in time , he believes it could be used to search for other types of elusive wildlife such as bears and gorillas or in security applications , for example monitoring airports for suspicious packages .
the research was presented at the american association for the advancement of science -lrb- aaas -rrb- annual meeting in san francisco , us .

the automated birdwatcher stands in a us wildlife reserve in arkansas , scanning the skies for a glimpse of the elusive ivory-billed woodpecker .
the bird was once thought to be extinct , but potential sightings in the area in 2004 renewed the search .
the system uses two video cameras to capture continuous images of the sky that are scrutinised for evidence of bird life by sophisticated software .
any shot that it does not believe contains a bird is discarded .
" it 's been running for three months continuously now and it only keeps one image in every 10,000 it collects , " said dr ken goldberg of the university of california , berkeley , who developed the system .
" we have caught some very exciting images of birds . "
no pictures of the charismatic red , white and black ivory-billed woodpecker have yet turned up .
unconfirmed sighting the bird used to be found across the south-eastern us and cuba but logging and forest clearance squeezed it out of its environment .
the presence of a human observer can affect the behaviour of the animals ... robots can help dr ken goldberg university of california , berkeley the last confirmed sighting of a lonely unpaired female was in 1944 .
since then , decades of searches yielded nothing and any hope of finding the bird diminished .
but a possible sighting in arkansas in 2004 reinvigorated ornithologists , with researchers from cornell leading systematic searches of the cache river national wildlife refuge in arkansas each year .
but the wetland and forest region of the lower mississippi river valley is 62,000 acres -lrb- 250 sq km -rrb- and human searches can be tricky .
" the problem with field biology is that it is very difficult , " said dr goldberg .
" you have to go out to somewhere remote , it 's lonely , it 's cold , it can be downright dangerous ; and the presence of a human observer can affect the behaviour of the animals you are trying to study .
" so our idea is that robots can help . "
everything but the bird the device , installed in the refuge , consists of two high-resolution video cameras connected to a hard disk , all installed in a weatherproof case .
geese ... but no woodpecker , yet a deliberately conspicuous " radiation hazard " warning sticker is displayed on the outside , " to prevent hunters using it as target practice " .
the digital cameras point towards the sky , continuously capturing two-megapixel images .
advanced algorithms analyse each frame , discarding the images it believes does not contain an image of a bird and saving those that it thinks does .
" we build a statistical model of the sky and look for outliers - pixels that suddenly look very different , " said dr goldberg .
the last confirmed sighting of an ivory-billed woodpecker was in 1944 " then we look for groups of outliers of a certain size and then we look for things moving at a certain velocity . "
the saved images are stored on hard disks that are routinely removed by a local birdwatcher who , along with other volunteers , scrutinise each frame .
at the moment falling leaves or other flying objects like helicopters can confuse the system .
but it has captured shots of geese , hawks and a heron , proving that when , and if , the time comes , it is capable of capturing a shot of an ivory-billed woodpecker .
future views however , it does have some limitations , such as only being able to survey one particular site .
the system can also only scan the sky because the algorithms used in the analysis can not cope with staring deep into the forest and trying to pick out moving birds from the gently swaying branches of trees .
other aaas robots dr goldberg believes that this will be possible eventually ; along with other more advanced analysis .
" the next level is to determine what is a woodpecker versus an average bird , but that 's still a long way off , " he said .
in time , he believes it could be used to search for other types of elusive wildlife such as bears and gorillas or in security applications , for example monitoring airports for suspicious packages .
the research was presented at the american association for the advancement of science -lrb- aaas -rrb- annual meeting in san francisco , us .

rob greaves , his brother sean and their friend steve boswell are training for the fourth annual north pole marathon .
they will be swapping trainers for snow shoes for the april event .
" when i saw it i thought it was a really good challenge , " said mr greaves , an army pt instructor at st athan , vale of glamorgan .
" i came across a website about the north pole marathon when i was searching for a different sporting event , " he said .
" i thought it would be a good way to raise money for charity too , " he said .
as far as the climate goes ... it 'll just be a case of wrapping up warm rob greaves after telling sean and friend steve , who are also in the army , they signed up too and they are hoping to raise cash for the royal star and garter - which provides nursing and therapeutic care to ex-service personnel - and the stroke association cardiff .
" like me , my brother is really into skiing and running too and we always said we should do an event together , so this is it , " explained mr greaves , of llantwit major .
" and i believe this will be the first time two brothers will have competed in the race . "
although living in different parts of the uk , the trio have been undertaking gruelling training runs since signing up to prepare themselves for the challenge ahead .
north pole race facts the first marathon was run solo by richard donovan in 2002 in strong winds , with wind chill temperature dropping to -60c the following year , it became a race with 10 competitors polar explorer sir ranulph fiennes was among 15 runners in the 2004 marathon the 2006 race involved all 54 runners finishing and 500,000 euros being raised for charity england 's alison hamlett set a new women 's record in 2006 in 5:52:56 .
" we 've been doing conditioning training along the same lines as what you would do if you were training for a normal marathon , " said mr greaves .
" but as far as the climate goes , well we ca n't train for that , it 'll just be a case of wrapping up warm .
" we are probably going to have to wear snow shoes for the run , which are a bit like wearing a tennis racket under your shoes .
" i am still waiting for mine so i have n't had a chance to practice running with them on yet , " he laughed .
the race course in the north pole will be run entirely on ice but even so , mr greaves is hoping to finish the run in under five hours .
" i 've read that some people can take up to 20 hours to complete the race because the wind can make it difficult , " he said .
" but one person did it in three hours 45 minutes .
" if i can do it at around the four-hour mark i will be a happy man . "

the bottle of red fuhrerwein , thought to be from a collection given to adolf hitler 's senior officers , has a picture of the dictator on the label .
the lot was expected to fetch about £ 800 , but went for £ 3,995 at plymouth auction rooms .
the wine is undrinkable because of its age .
the successful bid came from an unnamed english collector on the phone .
the 1943 bottle had attracted worldwide interest and bidding on saturday was described as " vigorous " .
" i have never seen or heard about anything like this in my 20 years -lsb- in the business -rsb- , " auctioneer paul keen said before the sale .
" not only is it unusual , it is also extremely rare to find .
" we understand these bottles were given out to hitler 's top-ranking officers on his birthday . "
the bottle of wine was previously owned by a person from ivybridge in devon , after it was discovered by a friend in france .

david hicks will face a us military commission this year , foreign minister alexander downer said .
mr hicks will either be sent home a free man or , if found guilty , serve any sentence in australia , mr downer said .
mr hicks , 31 , has been held at guantanamo bay for five years .
he was arrested in afghanistan in 2001 for allegedly fighting with the taleban .
" if the trial proceeds and proceeds quickly ... then it 'll be possible to get mr hicks back to australia by the end of the year , either to serve in a prison in australia or of course just to be released , depending on the result of the trial , " mr downer told australian tv network channel 9 .
charge sheet earlier this month the us released more details of the charges against mr hicks , a father of two .
the document revealed for the first time allegations that he was mentored by alleged uk shoe bomber richard reid in afghanistan .
we are on our way to a trial before a military commission , at which mr hicks is sure to receive a fair trial .
and that 's what the us is committed to senior us official it also alleges that he took part in an al-qaeda training course in 2001 , armed himself with 300 rounds of ammunition and three grenades and used the alias abu muslim australia as he conducted surveillance of the us and british embassies in kabul .
mr hicks is facing charges of providing material support for terrorism and attempted murder .
the muslim convert and former kangaroo skinner pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy , attempted murder and aiding the enemy in august 2004 .
those charges were dropped last year when the us supreme court ruled the military commission was unlawful .
the announcements come ahead of us vice president dick cheney 's visit to australia this week .
mr hicks has been at guantanamo bay for five years without trial mr cheney will meet australian prime minister john howard on friday with the case of mr hicks high on the agenda , as mr howard 's government comes under pressure over the case .
" the vice-president is going to , obviously , want to listen closely to the prime minister 's concerns , " a senior us official said .
" we are on our way to a trial before a military commission , at which mr hicks is sure to receive a fair trial .
and that 's what the united states is committed to . "
the opposition australian labor party has accused the government of neglecting hicks ' case .
they say the government 's lobbying now is a ploy ahead of a federal election due in the next 12 months .
" given the government 's record to date on hicks , they seem to be responding because we 're coming up to an election and there 's public outrage , " foreign affairs spokesman robert mcclelland told the national broadcaster , abc .
australia 's only other guantanamo bay inmate , mamdouh habib , was released in january 2005 .
he is now running as a candidate in the upcoming new south wales state election .

the minister for women and child development , renuka chowdhury , told bbc news the cradles would be " everywhere " .
it is the latest initiative to try to wipe out the practice of female foeticide and female infanticide .
a girl child is often viewed as inferior to a boy .
a bride 's dowry can also cripple a family financially .
research for the year 2001 showed that for every 1,000 male babies born in india , there were just 933 girls .
research published last year estimating that the number of female abortions was as high as 500,000 a year was disputed by the indian medical association .
secret " we will have cradles strategically placed all over the place so that people who do n't want their babies can leave them there , " ms chowdhury told the bbc news website .
the sex ratio is so skewed in some states , men can not find brides the cradles could be in places as diverse as the local tax collector 's office , or where local councils meet .
ms chowdhury said parents would be able to leave their babies secretly .
the important thing was to save their lives .
she said she assumed that most of the babies left under the " cradle scheme " would be girls .
" they will be collected and put into homes , " she said .
" there are plenty of existing homes and we will be adding some more also . "
' facade ' in 1994 , india banned the use of technology to determine the sex of unborn children and the termination of pregnancies on the basis of gender .
however , campaigners say many clinics still offer a seemingly legitimate facade for a multi-billion pound racket and that gender determination is a highly profitable business .
experts say female foeticide is mostly linked to socio-economic factors .
it is an idea that many say carries over from the time india was a predominantly agrarian society where boys were considered an extra pair of hands on the farm .
in a separate development , police in the central state of madhya pradesh say they have recovered some 390 bones of babies or foetuses from the grounds of a christian missionary hospital in the town of ratlam after a tip off .
" the question of female foeticide and infanticide is part of our investigation , as is illegal abortions , " superintendent of police satish saxena said , reuters news agency reports .
alarm bell last november a japanese hospital announced plans to set up a " baby hatch " allowing mothers to anonymously drop off their newborns so they could be put up for adoption .
the drop-off at jikei hospital in southern japan will consist of a small window in an outside wall , which opens on to an incubator bed , officials say .

barclays , the first of the " big five " banks to report on tuesday , is expected to see profits rise by a third to £ 7bn .
hsbc surprised investors earlier this month by putting aside an extra £ 878m -lrb- $ 1.7bn -rrb- to cover bad debts in the us .
but banks have tightened uk lending criteria and analysts believe overall profits will rise from £ 33bn last year .
debt concerns despite this jump , levels of unsecured lending and customer defaults are still likely to dominate the results of barclays , hsbc , royal bank of scotland , hbos and lloyds tsb , all of which are due to report profit figures in the next 10 days .
barclays said in november it was continuing to incur higher costs as a result of the sharp growth in personal insolvencies . "
on the whole , banks are in rude health " richard hunter , hargreaves lansdown a year ago barclaycard , the uk 's biggest credit card lender with 11 million customers , had to write off £ 1.57bn in bad debts among its card holders , 44 % more than the year before .
to help combat the problem , it has been turning down 50 % of all new credit card applicants .
but the bank is still expected to show robust profit figures for the past year on the back of stellar growth from its investment banking and fund management businesses .
cost control other banks have been similarly boosted by the surge in takeover activity on global stock markets and by the growth of private client banking for wealthy customers .
according to a poll of leading financial analysts , the top five banks will see combined profits increase from £ 33.4bn last year .
" on the whole , banks are in rude health , " said richard hunter , head of uk equities at stockbrokers hargreaves lansdown .
" stringent cost control measures over the last few years have meant that , as for so much of uk plc , strong corporate earnings are being enjoyed . "
despite difficulties in areas of its us business , hsbc is forecast to record profits of about £ 11.5bn for the past 12 months .
meanwhile , royal bank of scotland , lloyds tsb and halifax bank of scotland are expected to report returns of about £ 9.1bn , £ 3.6bn and £ 5.4bn respectively .
the scale of profits is likely to prompt fresh criticism of the city 's reward culture following comments by politicians that " excessive " staff bonuses paid should be curbed .
