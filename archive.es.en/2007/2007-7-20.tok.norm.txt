program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 20.07.2007 opinion : no cold war sequel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west 's relationship with russia is worsening .
some talk about a repeat of the east-west conflict .
that 's wrong .
there 's the threat of an adversarial climate , but not of a cold war , says dw-world.de 's ingo mannteufel . relations between russia and the west are getting worse - both in terms of rhetoric and actions - especially since the list of controversial issues seems to get longer every day : the planned us defense missile shield in poland and the czech republic ; the un resolution on kosovo ; actual , alleged or planned russian arms deliveries to syria , iran or venezuela ; the iranian nuclear program ; estonia 's attitude towards soviet memorials ; the investigation of the murder of former intelligence agent and emigrant alexander litvinenko ; and finally russia 's decision to pull out of the conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .

the lacking ideological component in the current dispute between russia and the west has yet another consequence : russia has more trouble finding allies in the world as it no longer possesses the global power of attraction of a different political and economical system .
anti-colonial liberation movements in developing countries or anti-american regimes no longer see their own future in the russian role model .
that 's why moscow has lost the opportunity to turn its own disputes with the us and europe into a global confrontation in the sense of the historic cold war .
in the wake of russia 's post-soviet weakness , president putin now thinks the time has come for a new all-encompassing arrangement with the us and europe .
he is aiming for agreements that are more in line with his own interests of a newly strengthened great power russia .

" the federation of german industries ' head klaus bräunig also said thursday that if china has n't surpassed germany yet , it will happen by the end of the year - despite the 2.8 percent growth the federation expects to come from germany this year .

" a market for german exports germany could benefit from the overall strength of china 's economy , which expanded by 11.5 percent in the first half of 2007 , according to allianz and dresdner bank head analyst michael heise . " we should see this as a chance to develop a larger sales market for german products , " he told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper , adding that according to his calculations , china would have to wait until at least next year before its gdp is larger than germany 's . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing said it will take steps to keep its economy in balance discrepancies in the calculations are mainly due to varying exchange rates banks and other groups use to calculate an economy 's size .
but rather than looking at their international rank , china should be concerned with its economy overheating , according to several analysts . crash on the horizon ? " it 's stunning , " tim condon , head of asia research at dutch bank ing in singapore told reuters .
" we should expect them to raise interest rates or reserve requirements at any moment . " china national statistics bureau spokesman li xiaochao said a series of cooling measures this year , which included two interest rate hikes , had already had some impact but the government needed to do more . " we will continue to strengthen and improve macro-control measures , " li said at a press conference .
" we will continue to enhance the adjustment of the industrial structure to change the growth pattern and to enable the economy to grow healthily and quickly . " china surpassed britain to become the world 's fourth largest economy in 2005 and has been at germany 's heels since .

the new harry potter book comes out in english in germany on saturday and german fans will not be waiting for the translated version . while there has been some discussion about doing away with what some conservatives call " unnecessary " usage of the english language in germany , the germans have not gone as far as the french in making a stand to protect their mother tongue .
many germans bemoan the fact that a hybrid commonly known as " denglish " has crept into their society , but there has yet to be a concerted effort to establish any german equivalent to france 's protectionist institution , the académie française .
those thinking of pushing for the creation of such an institution and the eventual eradication of anglicisms in germany may yet have their day , but they continue to bide their time - and wisely so .
why ?
because had they managed to beat back the english incursion between the publication of 2005 's " harry potter and the half-blood prince " and the final installment , " the deathly hallows " - the english version of which goes on sale in germany on saturday - they would have been left at the mercy of tens of thousands of would-be wizards and witches calling for their muggle heads .
nothing stands in the way of a potter fix bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're a dedicated bunch these harry potter fans language purists , however , are clever enough to know that turning germany into a land where an english book would be held back for publication until the german one had been launched is simply too premature .
nobody wants to be responsible for wand-waving pandemonium across the nation .
and who would want to be forced to quiver behind barricades and huddle behind locked doors for purely linguistic reasons ?
such is the demand for the seventh and final book in the phenomenally successful harry potter series that german fans are laying in wait to snap up the first run of the english publication despite some readers having only a limited understanding of the language in its written in .
the expectation over how the boy wizard 's story comes to its conclusion is so intense that potter nuts across germany are refusing to wait the three months until the german translation is released .

some stores are even throwing special midnight harry potter parties for those fans who plan to storm the shelves once the clock passes the witching hour .
literary observers believe that the popularity in germany of the harry potter books in their original language has much to do with the fact that many fans have grown up with the series , reading each book as it came out and improving their english along the way .

the new harry potter book comes out in english in germany on saturday and german fans will not be waiting for the translated version . while there has been some discussion about doing away with what some conservatives call " unnecessary " usage of the english language in germany , the germans have not gone as far as the french in making a stand to protect their mother tongue .
many germans bemoan the fact that a hybrid commonly known as " denglish " has crept into their society , but there has yet to be a concerted effort to establish any german equivalent to france 's protectionist institution , the académie française .
those thinking of pushing for the creation of such an institution and the eventual eradication of anglicisms in germany may yet have their day , but they continue to bide their time - and wisely so .
why ?
because had they managed to beat back the english incursion between the publication of 2005 's " harry potter and the half-blood prince " and the final installment , " the deathly hallows " - the english version of which goes on sale in germany on saturday - they would have been left at the mercy of tens of thousands of would-be wizards and witches calling for their muggle heads .
nothing stands in the way of a potter fix bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're a dedicated bunch these harry potter fans language purists , however , are clever enough to know that turning germany into a land where an english book would be held back for publication until the german one had been launched is simply too premature .
nobody wants to be responsible for wand-waving pandemonium across the nation .
and who would want to be forced to quiver behind barricades and huddle behind locked doors for purely linguistic reasons ?
such is the demand for the seventh and final book in the phenomenally successful harry potter series that german fans are laying in wait to snap up the first run of the english publication despite some readers having only a limited understanding of the language in its written in .
the expectation over how the boy wizard 's story comes to its conclusion is so intense that potter nuts across germany are refusing to wait the three months until the german translation is released .
" anyone with a reasonable command of english does n't want to wait until oct .
27 when the german version is due to appear , " heinrich riethmüller , manager of the osiander chain of book stores , told reporters .
fans waiting for the witching hour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will grab a copy regardless of their english skills online orders of the english version of " harry potter and the deathly hallows " have passed the 170,000 mark in germany while many thousands of fans are preparing for a night on the streets waiting for the bookshops to open as the chimes strike twelve .
some stores are even throwing special midnight harry potter parties for those fans who plan to storm the shelves once the clock passes the witching hour .
literary observers believe that the popularity in germany of the harry potter books in their original language has much to do with the fact that many fans have grown up with the series , reading each book as it came out and improving their english along the way .
sixth book made history in germany the first real sign of the clamor for harry , ron , hermione and friends in english came with the release of the " half-blood prince . "

" the seventh book will do even better , " said riethmüller .
" it 's bound to enter the best-seller list . "
dealers estimate that total sales of " harry potter and the deathly hallows " will top the three-million mark in germany .

blocked by a russian veto threat , supporters of a un plan to grant independence to the serb province of kosovo ended their bid in the security council on friday . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called on friday for serbia and the political leaders of kosovo to be included in talks on the future of the breakaway serb republic .
although approval of a united nations security council resolution on the future status of the territory , remained the main priority , steinmeier said after talks in berlin with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov . shortly after the minister spoke , however , the united states envoy at the un said negotiations at the world body on a draft resolution for kosovo had failed . us ambassador zalmay khalilzad said washington would seek a non-un resolution to the dispute over kosovo 's political future because russia has blocked security council efforts to settle that issue .
" we 'll move outside the security council process and the contact group will take the lead and move forward during the process of negotiations , " he told reporters . russia blocks resolution on kosovo 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khalilzad said the issue would go to the contact group western nations have been trying to push a draft resolution in the un security council to implement key provisions of un mediator martti ahtissari 's plan to grant " supervised independence " to the breakaway albanian-majority serbian province . but they have hurtled into opposition from moscow , belgrade 's key ally , which has repeatedly threatened to veto a security council resolution under discussion . the contact group is composed of the us , russia , france , britain , italy and germany .

" this is a logical consequence of our active policy , " a russian foreign ministry spokesman said , according to interfax .
" we want to lay the foundations for a continuation of the dialogue with the aim of reaching an agreement between pristina and belgrade . " and while serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica hailed the dropped kosovo independence bid as " an important victory in the un security council " for serbia and its traditional ally russia in their attempts to defend " the sovereignty and territorial integrity of serbia , " kosovo ethnic albanian prime minister agim ceku said it would be " better to seek new alternatives " to resolve the future status of the province . the kosovo daily express reported that ceku had proposed to other kosovo albanian politicians to proclaim independence on nov .
28 - the independence day in neighboring albania . " this was initially an idea how to get out of a situation that has been blocked in the security council , " ceku told reporters after meeting the chief un administrator of kosovo joachim rücker .

" we will therefore put on hold discussions of a new resolution . "

" the people of kosovo should be given the opportunity to realize their political and economic development , ” the french envoy continued .
“ we are determined to assist them in that aim in the period ahead . "
" a timely resolving of kosovo 's status will also enable serbia to move beyond the conflicts of the 1990s and toward a brighter european and euro-atlantic future .

russia , however , made it clear it would veto the latest compromise draft introduced to the un security council by belgium , britain , france , germany , italy and the united states .
eu 's solana claims talks will go ahead on tuesday , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said serbia and kosovo were likely to hold new talks on the province 's future even without a un security council resolution , probably under the aegis of the contact group .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 20.07.2007 european music rocks the summer festival scene großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people do n't care if it 's the red hot chili peppers or an unsigned icelandic yodeler us and british bands usually steal the headlines at europe 's most important summer music festivals .
yet in recent years musicians from small european countries have begun rocking festival lineups and winning over fans . most festivalgoers have been partying for a day or two by the time zzz gets its 30-minute shot at fame .
" it 's very compact , " björn ottenheim , zzz 's drummer and singer said about playing such a short set . " it 's like you can make love to a woman all night long or you can also make it quick and dirty , which can also be very beautiful . "
the " wham-bam , thank you ma 'am " of their short festival set is not the only sleazy factor of zzz 's current act .
you can definitely hear the funky porn soundtrack influence and the heady dope and sex atmosphere from the red light district running as a lusty undercurrent in this amsterdam duo 's organ-fueled dance music .
playing to the people who have yet to be introduced to their sound is something zzz are getting used to .
however , they 've been working hard to spread the word this summer as the dutch duo found itself playing to large enthusiastic crowds at major music festivals in great britain , slovenia and belgium .
it 's an on-going mission .
last summer , it was much of the same as they trawled through festivals in italy , france and spain as well as getting booked at popkomm , a festival associated with a large trade show for the music and entertainment industry held in berlin .
it 's not easy being european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn ottenheim , left , and daan schinkel of zzz bands from non-english-speaking european countries have always had to contend with getting a lot less media attention and air time than their american and british counterparts .
" when you do n't come from the us or uk , it 's already pretty hard , " said ottenheim in a phone interview from the dour festival in belgium .
" being from holland , you have to have that extra bit of luck that people take some time to check us out .
and then most of the time they 're stuck immediately when they hear us . "
for many years , festival promoters did n't book european bands because they simply had no way of finding out about them .
but things have been getting better .
the situation began to change for the musical minnows in 2003 , when the european talent exchange program -lrb- etep -rrb- launched an effort to bring together festival promoters and potential talent .
etep-sponsored bands will play 200 shows in festivals this summer , up from 50 in the first year .
until recently , part of the funding came from the european commission .
" we think it 's working very well , " etep founder peter smidt said of the program .
" but it 's definitely not yet the case that a german or a dutch or a french act automatically have access to the european market .
it 's still very difficult . "
summer soundtrack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festivals dot europe 's summer landscape summer music festivals are big business in europe . about 144,000 alternative music fans showed up for the four-day dour festival .
" we love playing festivals of this caliber , " ottenheim said of the dour festival .
" to have a whole tent of people freaking out on my music is a pretty immense feeling .
it 's rewarding and it 's very sexy . "
with record sales stagnating , the summer festivals have become an essential way for bands to get exposure outside their home countries , said christof huber , of the swiss-based european festival association yourope .
" i think the people want to explore new bands .
if the quality of the live act is there , bands from europe can be headliners right now , " huber said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many festivals are multi-day events while most bands sing in english regardless of where they are from , some have had success singing in their native language .
the german band wir sind helden -lrb- we are heroes -rrb- have been selling out shows across europe , as have norwegian outfit kaizers orchestra .
icelandic trance-rockers sigur ros are also a big draw on the european circuit despite the fact that most people do n't have a clue what they 're singing about .
the diversity and quality of european bands is at an all-time high , smidt believes .
" that 's the nice thing about european culture , that it has this diversity and it 's not like one sound , " he said . big in japan bands from small european countries like the netherlands " need to go abroad to survive , " smidt said . which explains zzz 's relentless touring , which has included stops in places as diverse as japan and the south by southwest music event in austin , texas - considered to be a must for any band wanting to break into the us market .
ottenheim and bandmate daan schinkel will head back to britain in august to play the summer sundae weekender festival .
despite the odds , zzz has every intention of making it big in the music business , ottenheim said .
that 's a bold statement .
it 's been 33 years since the dutch band golden earring showed up on us charts with its hit " radar love . "

dw-world.de spoke to his eldest son , retired major general berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg , about the plot and its significance . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , a colonel in hitler 's army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power .
stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's hideaway .
miraculously , the dictator survived the blast and stauffenberg and others involved in the plot were executed . a movie about the events of july 20 , 1944 , is currently being filmed in berlin starring hollywood actor and prominent scientologist tom cruise , and it has stirred controversy .
over the years , some have raised questions about the attack itself , with debate about the motives and the political per suasion of stauffenberg .
dw-world.de talked to his eldest son about the assassination plot and its consequences for the family and germany as a whole .
dw-world.de : you were only 10 years old when your father died .
did you know anything about his oppositional activities ?
what about the rest of your family ?
berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg : i did n't know anything naturally .
everything had to be kept secret .
if children find out about something like that there is always the danger that they 're going to spill the beans .
my mother knew something about it and also approved , but we did n't get wind of any of that .
when did your mother find out what was happening ?
she noticed there was something going on relatively early and brought it up with my father .
i do n't know how much he told her .
she knew that he was going to do something .
what she did n't know was that he was going to plant the bomb himself .
when and how did you find out about attack ?
i heard in the radio that there had been an assassination attempt .
but it was not until the following day that my mother told me and my next-youngest brother that our father had carried it out .
it was a big shock for us .
after this lengthy conversation , she was picked up at night .
we did n't see her again until june ' 45 .
you talked about shock .
were you shocked because this was the first time that you 'd heard your father was dead or the fact that he was involved in the resistance ?
or both ?
both .
people today might not be able to believe it , but death was nothing unusual at that time .
a third of my classmates had lost their fathers and the threat was always there .
you could also be killed in different ways as a result of bombing raids and so on .
it was , of course , the fact that he had committed this act against the head of state .
that did n't fit into our world view .
we asked how he could do something like that to the führer .
our mother told us that he believed that he had to do it for germany .
were you brought up in a way that was typical of the time ? we were not brought up to be out-and-out nazis , but we encountered it in our surroundings .
as i said , my parents did not make critical remarks , but they also did n't express any enthusiasm either .
but there was nazi indoctrination in the school .
how did things proceed after your mother was picked up ?
the family was torn apart .
most of the adults were then sent to concentration camps , including those who were obviously not involved .
under the nazis there was a practice of punishing family members as well as the perpetrator .
my mother and my aunt were , of course , held for questioning for a long time .
we were then taken to a children 's home that had been especially cleared out to take us .
and we stayed there until after the invasion - in this case by the americans .
was your later career shaped by the attack ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg was executed for his act shaped is perhaps not the right expression .
however , it was strongly influenced .
if you have a well-known name and , of course , we had become well-known among those people who were against the attack - some because they were nazis and some because they rejected violence as a matter of principle , and it 's a bit different living under those circumstances than if you can live anonymously .
but it is like that in almost any profession when you go into the same profession as your father .
i did it because i thought i would enjoy it .
not because i wanted to follow in a family tradition , or because of my father .
rather in spite of my father .
are there any misapprehensions about your father that particularly upset you ? well , there is one theory .
it is always said that he was a nazi at the start and that this only changed later .
that sounds good to those people who were themselves nazis .
and i would n't object if that was how things were , but that is not factually correct .
at the start , my father was neither pro- nor anti-nazi .
he just wanted to see how things developed and then judge things for himself .
it may have been that at the time he disagreed with nazi supporters and nazi opponents .
independence was something that he always valued highly .
what do feel is missing from the conventional image of your father ?
of course , i ca n't really judge that properly because i did n't know him well enough .
it does n't serve him well to be made into a superman , or a superstar , as people would say today .
but he also was n't just any ordinary person .
i do believe that he was especially talented .
there have been around seven films , including documentary films on the topic , and now hollywood and tom cruise are tackling the subject .
do you feel that your family history has become public pro per ty ?
my father 's story has quite clearly become public property .
apart from the films that are , on the whole , benevolent , there has also been literature that was deprecatory or base . but your family has , nevertheless , not shut out the public . no , we think that it is not the business of the family to honor my father or not .
it should not interfere there .
that does n't mean we are against it , or that we do n't give our support when we are asked .
but we do n't pursue it actively . what about your comments on tom cruise ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise as stauffenberg : filming began thursday none of us has taken active steps .
i was contacted by the -lsb- daily -rsb- süddeutsche zeitung and asked to give an interview .
i stated my opinion .
in a democracy you should be able to express your opinions , your personal opinion , without intending to make any demands .
i never called for the film to be stopped .
i also never said that tom cruise should n't act the part or that it should n't be permitted .
i said that i did n't like it .
and i think that is legitimate .
over the years the historical reception of the resistance led by your father has changed significantly .
do you think the more recent interpretations get any closer to the truth ?
sixty years is a long time .
there are only few people left alive who were active in the war .
even their children are old people now .
it 's natural that the image that we have should change .
it has shifted from being first-hand experience and has become history .
of course , a lot of mistakes have also crept in .
however things were , the history that we know definitely contains a lot of mistakes that we do n't know about and that we are no longer in a position to recognize .
what is the significance , in your opinion , of the events of july 20 for germany and the world - and for you per sonally ?
i do n't want to draw any lessons for the german people or the whole world .
but perhaps you can say one thing .
if you feel a sense of moral duty then you have to act upon that .
this is n't a political issue .
it also is n't about whether you are a democrat or not .
it 's a question of morality .
if you have the opportunity to do something about it , can you allow a people to be governed by criminals - even if they have been elected by the people ? julie gregson interviewed berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it may have been that at the time he disagreed with nazi supporters and nazi opponents .
independence was something that he always valued highly .
what do feel is missing from the conventional image of your father ?
of course , i ca n't really judge that properly because i did n't know him well enough .
it does n't serve him well to be made into a superman , or a superstar , as people would say today .
but he also was n't just any ordinary person .
i do believe that he was especially talented .
there have been around seven films , including documentary films on the topic , and now hollywood and tom cruise are tackling the subject .
do you feel that your family history has become public pro per ty ?
my father 's story has quite clearly become public property .
apart from the films that are , on the whole , benevolent , there has also been literature that was deprecatory or base . but your family has , nevertheless , not shut out the public . no , we think that it is not the business of the family to honor my father or not .
it should not interfere there .
that does n't mean we are against it , or that we do n't give our support when we are asked .
but we do n't pursue it actively . what about your comments on tom cruise ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise as stauffenberg : filming began thursday none of us has taken active steps .
i was contacted by the -lsb- daily -rsb- süddeutsche zeitung and asked to give an interview .
i stated my opinion .
in a democracy you should be able to express your opinions , your personal opinion , without intending to make any demands .
i never called for the film to be stopped .
i also never said that tom cruise should n't act the part or that it should n't be permitted .
i said that i did n't like it .
and i think that is legitimate .
over the years the historical reception of the resistance led by your father has changed significantly .
do you think the more recent interpretations get any closer to the truth ?
sixty years is a long time .
there are only few people left alive who were active in the war .
even their children are old people now .
it 's natural that the image that we have should change .
it has shifted from being first-hand experience and has become history .
of course , a lot of mistakes have also crept in .
however things were , the history that we know definitely contains a lot of mistakes that we do n't know about and that we are no longer in a position to recognize .
what is the significance , in your opinion , of the events of july 20 for germany and the world - and for you per sonally ?
i do n't want to draw any lessons for the german people or the whole world .
but perhaps you can say one thing .
if you feel a sense of moral duty then you have to act upon that .
this is n't a political issue .
it also is n't about whether you are a democrat or not .
it 's a question of morality .
if you have the opportunity to do something about it , can you allow a people to be governed by criminals - even if they have been elected by the people ? julie gregson interviewed berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.07.2007 " if you feel a sense of moral duty , you have to act upon it " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg 's family was torn apart following the attack graf von stauffenberg attempted to assassinate hitler 63 years ago on friday .
dw-world.de spoke to his eldest son , retired major general berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg , about the plot and its significance . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , a colonel in hitler 's army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power .
stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's hideaway .
miraculously , the dictator survived the blast and stauffenberg and others involved in the plot were executed . a movie about the events of july 20 , 1944 , is currently being filmed in berlin starring hollywood actor and prominent scientologist tom cruise , and it has stirred controversy .
over the years , some have raised questions about the attack itself , with debate about the motives and the political per suasion of stauffenberg .
dw-world.de talked to his eldest son about the assassination plot and its consequences for the family and germany as a whole .
dw-world.de : you were only 10 years old when your father died .
did you know anything about his oppositional activities ?
what about the rest of your family ?
berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg : i did n't know anything naturally .
everything had to be kept secret .
if children find out about something like that there is always the danger that they 're going to spill the beans .
my mother knew something about it and also approved , but we did n't get wind of any of that .
when did your mother find out what was happening ?
she noticed there was something going on relatively early and brought it up with my father .
i do n't know how much he told her .
she knew that he was going to do something .
what she did n't know was that he was going to plant the bomb himself .
when and how did you find out about attack ?
i heard in the radio that there had been an assassination attempt .
but it was not until the following day that my mother told me and my next-youngest brother that our father had carried it out .
it was a big shock for us .
after this lengthy conversation , she was picked up at night .
we did n't see her again until june ' 45 .
you talked about shock .
were you shocked because this was the first time that you 'd heard your father was dead or the fact that he was involved in the resistance ?
or both ?
both .
people today might not be able to believe it , but death was nothing unusual at that time .
a third of my classmates had lost their fathers and the threat was always there .
you could also be killed in different ways as a result of bombing raids and so on .
it was , of course , the fact that he had committed this act against the head of state .
that did n't fit into our world view .
we asked how he could do something like that to the führer .
our mother told us that he believed that he had to do it for germany .
were you brought up in a way that was typical of the time ? we were not brought up to be out-and-out nazis , but we encountered it in our surroundings .
as i said , my parents did not make critical remarks , but they also did n't express any enthusiasm either .
but there was nazi indoctrination in the school .
how did things proceed after your mother was picked up ?
the family was torn apart .
most of the adults were then sent to concentration camps , including those who were obviously not involved .
under the nazis there was a practice of punishing family members as well as the perpetrator .
my mother and my aunt were , of course , held for questioning for a long time .
we were then taken to a children 's home that had been especially cleared out to take us .
and we stayed there until after the invasion - in this case by the americans .
was your later career shaped by the attack ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg was executed for his act shaped is perhaps not the right expression .
however , it was strongly influenced .
if you have a well-known name and , of course , we had become well-known among those people who were against the attack - some because they were nazis and some because they rejected violence as a matter of principle , and it 's a bit different living under those circumstances than if you can live anonymously .
but it is like that in almost any profession when you go into the same profession as your father .
i did it because i thought i would enjoy it .
not because i wanted to follow in a family tradition , or because of my father .
rather in spite of my father .
are there any misapprehensions about your father that particularly upset you ? well , there is one theory .
it is always said that he was a nazi at the start and that this only changed later .
that sounds good to those people who were themselves nazis .
and i would n't object if that was how things were , but that is not factually correct .
at the start , my father was neither pro- nor anti-nazi .
he just wanted to see how things developed and then judge things for himself .
it may have been that at the time he disagreed with nazi supporters and nazi opponents .
independence was something that he always valued highly .
what do feel is missing from the conventional image of your father ?
of course , i ca n't really judge that properly because i did n't know him well enough .
it does n't serve him well to be made into a superman , or a superstar , as people would say today .
but he also was n't just any ordinary person .
i do believe that he was especially talented .
there have been around seven films , including documentary films on the topic , and now hollywood and tom cruise are tackling the subject .
do you feel that your family history has become public pro per ty ?
my father 's story has quite clearly become public property .
apart from the films that are , on the whole , benevolent , there has also been literature that was deprecatory or base . but your family has , nevertheless , not shut out the public . no , we think that it is not the business of the family to honor my father or not .
it should not interfere there .
that does n't mean we are against it , or that we do n't give our support when we are asked .
but we do n't pursue it actively . what about your comments on tom cruise ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise as stauffenberg : filming began thursday none of us has taken active steps .
i was contacted by the -lsb- daily -rsb- süddeutsche zeitung and asked to give an interview .
i stated my opinion .
in a democracy you should be able to express your opinions , your personal opinion , without intending to make any demands .
i never called for the film to be stopped .
i also never said that tom cruise should n't act the part or that it should n't be permitted .
i said that i did n't like it .
and i think that is legitimate .
over the years the historical reception of the resistance led by your father has changed significantly .
do you think the more recent interpretations get any closer to the truth ?
sixty years is a long time .
there are only few people left alive who were active in the war .
even their children are old people now .
it 's natural that the image that we have should change .
it has shifted from being first-hand experience and has become history .
of course , a lot of mistakes have also crept in .
however things were , the history that we know definitely contains a lot of mistakes that we do n't know about and that we are no longer in a position to recognize .
what is the significance , in your opinion , of the events of july 20 for germany and the world - and for you per sonally ?
i do n't want to draw any lessons for the german people or the whole world .
but perhaps you can say one thing .
if you feel a sense of moral duty then you have to act upon that .
this is n't a political issue .
it also is n't about whether you are a democrat or not .
it 's a question of morality .
if you have the opportunity to do something about it , can you allow a people to be governed by criminals - even if they have been elected by the people ? julie gregson interviewed berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the project , which lists 22 partner organizations , companies and universities on its web site , aims to create a multimedia search engine , a set of tools for translating text and identifying and indexing images , sound and text .
" theseus will make it possible for all internet users to have easy access to global knowledge , " siemens ' vice president of corporate technology hartmut raffler said in a statement .
" the technology theseus will develop will generate new knowledge from knowledge . "
subsidies flow to large corporations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants theseus to be with google among the world 's top internet technologies the companies and institutes involved in the research will also provide an additional 90 million euros .
the government aid will be initially paid to large companies , including sap , siemens and deutsche thompson , as " icebreakers " to later allow smaller businesses to expand on early ideas .
" new forms of acquiring , searching for and evaluating internet-based information have are of strategic importance for the german government , " economics minister michael glos said in a statement .
" with theseus we want to improve germany and europe 's ability to compete and reach a top position in it and communications technology . "
named after a character in greek mythology who uses thread to navigate king minos ' maze , the theseus project was born out of quaero , a joint french-german internet search initiative that then french president jacques chirac once called " the answer to the global competitors of google and yahoo . "
but after seeing that quaero 's german and french researchers were working in different directions , the project split in december 2006 , with the french continuing to work on quaero and the germans focused on theseus .
managers from both projects have , however , said they will meet regularly to form synergies when possible . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 20.07.2007 german fans under the spell of harry potter in english großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are ready to snap up " harry potter and the deathly hallows " in its original form for those purists wanting to protect the german language , turn away now .
the new harry potter book comes out in english in germany on saturday and german fans will not be waiting for the translated version . while there has been some discussion about doing away with what some conservatives call " unnecessary " usage of the english language in germany , the germans have not gone as far as the french in making a stand to protect their mother tongue .
many germans bemoan the fact that a hybrid commonly known as " denglish " has crept into their society , but there has yet to be a concerted effort to establish any german equivalent to france 's protectionist institution , the académie française .
those thinking of pushing for the creation of such an institution and the eventual eradication of anglicisms in germany may yet have their day , but they continue to bide their time - and wisely so .
why ?
because had they managed to beat back the english incursion between the publication of 2005 's " harry potter and the half-blood prince " and the final installment , " the deathly hallows " - the english version of which goes on sale in germany on saturday - they would have been left at the mercy of tens of thousands of would-be wizards and witches calling for their muggle heads .
nothing stands in the way of a potter fix bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're a dedicated bunch these harry potter fans language purists , however , are clever enough to know that turning germany into a land where an english book would be held back for publication until the german one had been launched is simply too premature .
nobody wants to be responsible for wand-waving pandemonium across the nation .
and who would want to be forced to quiver behind barricades and huddle behind locked doors for purely linguistic reasons ?
such is the demand for the seventh and final book in the phenomenally successful harry potter series that german fans are laying in wait to snap up the first run of the english publication despite some readers having only a limited understanding of the language in its written in .
the expectation over how the boy wizard 's story comes to its conclusion is so intense that potter nuts across germany are refusing to wait the three months until the german translation is released .
" anyone with a reasonable command of english does n't want to wait until oct .
27 when the german version is due to appear , " heinrich riethmüller , manager of the osiander chain of book stores , told reporters .
fans waiting for the witching hour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will grab a copy regardless of their english skills online orders of the english version of " harry potter and the deathly hallows " have passed the 170,000 mark in germany while many thousands of fans are preparing for a night on the streets waiting for the bookshops to open as the chimes strike twelve .
some stores are even throwing special midnight harry potter parties for those fans who plan to storm the shelves once the clock passes the witching hour .
literary observers believe that the popularity in germany of the harry potter books in their original language has much to do with the fact that many fans have grown up with the series , reading each book as it came out and improving their english along the way .
sixth book made history in germany the first real sign of the clamor for harry , ron , hermione and friends in english came with the release of the " half-blood prince . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : j.k. rowling 's sixth book broke records in germany the sixth book became the first english-language book ever to make it into the german best-seller list .
" the seventh book will do even better , " said riethmüller .
" it 's bound to enter the best-seller list . "
dealers estimate that total sales of " harry potter and the deathly hallows " will top the three-million mark in germany .
the defenders of the german language may be rubbing their hands over the fact that j.k. rowling has now completed her odyssey .
they may now feel free to slowly squeeze the english language out of germany without magical reprisals .
but time will tell .
harry 's story may have come to an end but it is unlikely the spell of reading in english will be broken for a generation who followed his adventures in a foreign tongue . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ten additional nations rotate through the body with two-year terms . many un member countries have accused the security council of no longer representing the international community and called for the council 's reform . " the status quo is not acceptable to an overwhelming majority of the member states , " a un report released in june said .
" there have been years of discussions , without substantial results .
the time has come to bring the process closer to decision-making . " a previous suggestion tabled by the g-4 called for enlarging the council by six permanent and four non-permanent seats , but the proposal did not receive the two-thirds majority necessary in the un general assembly . another group of medium-sized countries , including pakistan and italy , said the council needed to be expanded by 10 non-permanent seats set up for varying terms . german goals unchanged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder had a temporary council seat but wanted more begun by then chancellor gerhard schröder in 2005 , germany 's push for a permanent seat languished after failing to get necessary support from the african union and being openly opposed by china and the united states . matussek 's reform suggestion calls for germany and other nations to be voted onto the security council for a limited 12-year term .
the german envoy added that berlin would only agree to such a deal if it were guaranteed one of the initial interim spots . " we would not agree to any solution which did not hold out this possibility for germany , " matussek told afp , adding that the interim members would then become candidates for permanent status with veto rights on the council .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.07.2007 " if you feel a sense of moral duty , you have to act upon it " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg 's family was torn apart following the attack graf von stauffenberg attempted to assassinate hitler 63 years ago on friday .
dw-world.de spoke to his eldest son , retired major general berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg , about the plot and its significance . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , a colonel in hitler 's army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power .
stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's hideaway .
miraculously , the dictator survived the blast and stauffenberg and others involved in the plot were executed . a movie about the events of july 20 , 1944 , is currently being filmed in berlin starring hollywood actor and prominent scientologist tom cruise , and it has stirred controversy .
over the years , some have raised questions about the attack itself , with debate about the motives and the political per suasion of stauffenberg .
dw-world.de talked to his eldest son about the assassination plot and its consequences for the family and germany as a whole .
dw-world.de : you were only 10 years old when your father died .
did you know anything about his oppositional activities ?
what about the rest of your family ?
berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg : i did n't know anything naturally .
everything had to be kept secret .
if children find out about something like that there is always the danger that they 're going to spill the beans .
my mother knew something about it and also approved , but we did n't get wind of any of that .
when did your mother find out what was happening ?
she noticed there was something going on relatively early and brought it up with my father .
i do n't know how much he told her .
she knew that he was going to do something .
what she did n't know was that he was going to plant the bomb himself .
when and how did you find out about attack ?
i heard in the radio that there had been an assassination attempt .
but it was not until the following day that my mother told me and my next-youngest brother that our father had carried it out .
it was a big shock for us .
after this lengthy conversation , she was picked up at night .
we did n't see her again until june ' 45 .
you talked about shock .
were you shocked because this was the first time that you 'd heard your father was dead or the fact that he was involved in the resistance ?
or both ?
both .
people today might not be able to believe it , but death was nothing unusual at that time .
a third of my classmates had lost their fathers and the threat was always there .
you could also be killed in different ways as a result of bombing raids and so on .
it was , of course , the fact that he had committed this act against the head of state .
that did n't fit into our world view .
we asked how he could do something like that to the führer .
our mother told us that he believed that he had to do it for germany .
were you brought up in a way that was typical of the time ? we were not brought up to be out-and-out nazis , but we encountered it in our surroundings .
as i said , my parents did not make critical remarks , but they also did n't express any enthusiasm either .
but there was nazi indoctrination in the school .
how did things proceed after your mother was picked up ?
the family was torn apart .
most of the adults were then sent to concentration camps , including those who were obviously not involved .
under the nazis there was a practice of punishing family members as well as the perpetrator .
my mother and my aunt were , of course , held for questioning for a long time .
we were then taken to a children 's home that had been especially cleared out to take us .
and we stayed there until after the invasion - in this case by the americans .
was your later career shaped by the attack ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg was executed for his act shaped is perhaps not the right expression .
however , it was strongly influenced .
if you have a well-known name and , of course , we had become well-known among those people who were against the attack - some because they were nazis and some because they rejected violence as a matter of principle , and it 's a bit different living under those circumstances than if you can live anonymously .
but it is like that in almost any profession when you go into the same profession as your father .
i did it because i thought i would enjoy it .
not because i wanted to follow in a family tradition , or because of my father .
rather in spite of my father .
are there any misapprehensions about your father that particularly upset you ? well , there is one theory .
it is always said that he was a nazi at the start and that this only changed later .
that sounds good to those people who were themselves nazis .
and i would n't object if that was how things were , but that is not factually correct .
at the start , my father was neither pro- nor anti-nazi .
he just wanted to see how things developed and then judge things for himself .
it may have been that at the time he disagreed with nazi supporters and nazi opponents .
independence was something that he always valued highly .
what do feel is missing from the conventional image of your father ?
of course , i ca n't really judge that properly because i did n't know him well enough .
it does n't serve him well to be made into a superman , or a superstar , as people would say today .
but he also was n't just any ordinary person .
i do believe that he was especially talented .
there have been around seven films , including documentary films on the topic , and now hollywood and tom cruise are tackling the subject .
do you feel that your family history has become public pro per ty ?
my father 's story has quite clearly become public property .
apart from the films that are , on the whole , benevolent , there has also been literature that was deprecatory or base . but your family has , nevertheless , not shut out the public . no , we think that it is not the business of the family to honor my father or not .
it should not interfere there .
that does n't mean we are against it , or that we do n't give our support when we are asked .
but we do n't pursue it actively . what about your comments on tom cruise ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise as stauffenberg : filming began thursday none of us has taken active steps .
i was contacted by the -lsb- daily -rsb- süddeutsche zeitung and asked to give an interview .
i stated my opinion .
in a democracy you should be able to express your opinions , your personal opinion , without intending to make any demands .
i never called for the film to be stopped .
i also never said that tom cruise should n't act the part or that it should n't be permitted .
i said that i did n't like it .
and i think that is legitimate .
over the years the historical reception of the resistance led by your father has changed significantly .
do you think the more recent interpretations get any closer to the truth ?
sixty years is a long time .
there are only few people left alive who were active in the war .
even their children are old people now .
it 's natural that the image that we have should change .
it has shifted from being first-hand experience and has become history .
of course , a lot of mistakes have also crept in .
however things were , the history that we know definitely contains a lot of mistakes that we do n't know about and that we are no longer in a position to recognize .
what is the significance , in your opinion , of the events of july 20 for germany and the world - and for you per sonally ?
i do n't want to draw any lessons for the german people or the whole world .
but perhaps you can say one thing .
if you feel a sense of moral duty then you have to act upon that .
this is n't a political issue .
it also is n't about whether you are a democrat or not .
it 's a question of morality .
if you have the opportunity to do something about it , can you allow a people to be governed by criminals - even if they have been elected by the people ? julie gregson interviewed berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 20.07.2007 german fans under the spell of harry potter in english großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are ready to snap up " harry potter and the deathly hallows " in its original form for those purists wanting to protect the german language , turn away now .
the new harry potter book comes out in english in germany on saturday and german fans will not be waiting for the translated version . while there has been some discussion about doing away with what some conservatives call " unnecessary " usage of the english language in germany , the germans have not gone as far as the french in making a stand to protect their mother tongue .
many germans bemoan the fact that a hybrid commonly known as " denglish " has crept into their society , but there has yet to be a concerted effort to establish any german equivalent to france 's protectionist institution , the académie française .
those thinking of pushing for the creation of such an institution and the eventual eradication of anglicisms in germany may yet have their day , but they continue to bide their time - and wisely so .
why ?
because had they managed to beat back the english incursion between the publication of 2005 's " harry potter and the half-blood prince " and the final installment , " the deathly hallows " - the english version of which goes on sale in germany on saturday - they would have been left at the mercy of tens of thousands of would-be wizards and witches calling for their muggle heads .
nothing stands in the way of a potter fix bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're a dedicated bunch these harry potter fans language purists , however , are clever enough to know that turning germany into a land where an english book would be held back for publication until the german one had been launched is simply too premature .
nobody wants to be responsible for wand-waving pandemonium across the nation .
and who would want to be forced to quiver behind barricades and huddle behind locked doors for purely linguistic reasons ?
such is the demand for the seventh and final book in the phenomenally successful harry potter series that german fans are laying in wait to snap up the first run of the english publication despite some readers having only a limited understanding of the language in its written in .
the expectation over how the boy wizard 's story comes to its conclusion is so intense that potter nuts across germany are refusing to wait the three months until the german translation is released .
" anyone with a reasonable command of english does n't want to wait until oct .
27 when the german version is due to appear , " heinrich riethmüller , manager of the osiander chain of book stores , told reporters .
fans waiting for the witching hour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will grab a copy regardless of their english skills online orders of the english version of " harry potter and the deathly hallows " have passed the 170,000 mark in germany while many thousands of fans are preparing for a night on the streets waiting for the bookshops to open as the chimes strike twelve .
some stores are even throwing special midnight harry potter parties for those fans who plan to storm the shelves once the clock passes the witching hour .
literary observers believe that the popularity in germany of the harry potter books in their original language has much to do with the fact that many fans have grown up with the series , reading each book as it came out and improving their english along the way .
sixth book made history in germany the first real sign of the clamor for harry , ron , hermione and friends in english came with the release of the " half-blood prince . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : j.k. rowling 's sixth book broke records in germany the sixth book became the first english-language book ever to make it into the german best-seller list .
" the seventh book will do even better , " said riethmüller .
" it 's bound to enter the best-seller list . "
dealers estimate that total sales of " harry potter and the deathly hallows " will top the three-million mark in germany .
the defenders of the german language may be rubbing their hands over the fact that j.k. rowling has now completed her odyssey .

germany 's foreign ministry friday played down reports that the taliban were behind the abduction of two german engineers and were demanding the withdrawal of all germans from afghanistan in return for their release . spokesman martin jäger referred to " contradictions " between two separate claims that came more than a day after the two civil engineers were abducted on wednesday some 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- south-west of kabul in wardak province . the foreign ministry crisis team working on the case had " taken cognizance " of the reports jäger said . according to reports in germany , the unnamed engineers were working for a kabul-based company when they were seized while traveling with an afghan driver and four police officials . on thursday , the taliban 's purported spokesman , zabeeullah mujahid , said that they were not aware of any foreign nationals seized by their fighters . " i have contacted all our forces in the area but no one knows about it , " mujahid told dpa news service by phone from an undisclosed location . taliban in control ? but another taliban spokesman , yousuf ahmadi , told afp news service that his group had taken control of the germans .
" the taliban have decided to free the german nationals if german troops pull out of afghanistan and all the taliban prisoners in afghan prisons are released , " he said , adding that the germans were " alive and in good health . " the governor of neighboring ghazni province , mirajuddin pathan , also said that the german engineers had " definitely been kidnapped by the taliban . " south koreans abducted ahmadi also said that the taliban had abducted 18 south koreans - three men and 15 women .
the christian evangelical group was traveling through southern afghanistan .
" they are with the taliban now and they are safe and sound , " the taliban said .
" they are under investigation and once the investigation is over , the taliban leading council will make a final decision about their fate . "

because had they managed to beat back the english incursion between the publication of 2005 's " harry potter and the half-blood prince " and the final installment , " the deathly hallows " - the english version of which goes on sale in germany on saturday - they would have been left at the mercy of tens of thousands of would-be wizards and witches calling for their muggle heads .

and who would want to be forced to quiver behind barricades and huddle behind locked doors for purely linguistic reasons ?
such is the demand for the seventh and final book in the phenomenally successful harry potter series that german fans are laying in wait to snap up the first run of the english publication despite some readers having only a limited understanding of the language in its written in .
the expectation over how the boy wizard 's story comes to its conclusion is so intense that potter nuts across germany are refusing to wait the three months until the german translation is released .

some stores are even throwing special midnight harry potter parties for those fans who plan to storm the shelves once the clock passes the witching hour .

"
it was proved half right .
blocked by a russian veto threat , supporters of a un plan to grant independence to the serb province of kosovo ended their bid in the security council on friday . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called on friday for serbia and the political leaders of kosovo to be included in talks on the future of the breakaway serb republic .
although approval of a united nations security council resolution on the future status of the territory , remained the main priority , steinmeier said after talks in berlin with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov . shortly after the minister spoke , however , the united states envoy at the un said negotiations at the world body on a draft resolution for kosovo had failed . us ambassador zalmay khalilzad said washington would seek a non-un resolution to the dispute over kosovo 's political future because russia has blocked security council efforts to settle that issue .
" we 'll move outside the security council process and the contact group will take the lead and move forward during the process of negotiations , " he told reporters . russia blocks resolution on kosovo 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khalilzad said the issue would go to the contact group western nations have been trying to push a draft resolution in the un security council to implement key provisions of un mediator martti ahtissari 's plan to grant " supervised independence " to the breakaway albanian-majority serbian province . but they have hurtled into opposition from moscow , belgrade 's key ally , which has repeatedly threatened to veto a security council resolution under discussion . the contact group is composed of the us , russia , france , britain , italy and germany .
in this political body , however , russia has no veto power . russia , serbia welcome the decision later on friday , russia welcomed as " logical " the decision at the united nations in new york to refer the kosovo independence issue to the contact group . " this is a logical consequence of our active policy , " a russian foreign ministry spokesman said , according to interfax .
" we want to lay the foundations for a continuation of the dialogue with the aim of reaching an agreement between pristina and belgrade . " and while serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica hailed the dropped kosovo independence bid as " an important victory in the un security council " for serbia and its traditional ally russia in their attempts to defend " the sovereignty and territorial integrity of serbia , " kosovo ethnic albanian prime minister agim ceku said it would be " better to seek new alternatives " to resolve the future status of the province . the kosovo daily express reported that ceku had proposed to other kosovo albanian politicians to proclaim independence on nov .
28 - the independence day in neighboring albania . " this was initially an idea how to get out of a situation that has been blocked in the security council , " ceku told reporters after meeting the chief un administrator of kosovo joachim rücker .
french envoy calls for fast solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de la sabliere wants a solution sooner rather than later france 's un ambassador to the un jean-marc de la sabliere echoed zalmay khalilzad ’ s comments .
" we regret that it has been impossible to secure such a resolution in the un security council , " sabliere said .
" we will therefore put on hold discussions of a new resolution . "
" we have decided to renew discussions within the contact group and with the parties along these lines , " he added .
" the people of kosovo should be given the opportunity to realize their political and economic development , ” the french envoy continued .
“ we are determined to assist them in that aim in the period ahead . "
" a timely resolving of kosovo 's status will also enable serbia to move beyond the conflicts of the 1990s and toward a brighter european and euro-atlantic future .
we believe that resolving kosovo 's status must be achieved as soon as possible . "
de la sabliere concluded by saying that european union foreign ministers would discuss kosovo at a meeting in brussels on monday .
run by the un bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has been in charge in kosovo for eight years kosovo has been run by the un since 1999 , after a nato bombing campaign helped drive out serb forces carrying out a brutal crackdown on ethnic albanians , who make up 90 percent of the population in the province .
the western compromise draft would have turned over administration of the province from the united nations to the eu while maintaining a nato presence .
russia , however , made it clear it would veto the latest compromise draft introduced to the un security council by belgium , britain , france , germany , italy and the united states .
eu 's solana claims talks will go ahead on tuesday , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said serbia and kosovo were likely to hold new talks on the province 's future even without a un security council resolution , probably under the aegis of the contact group .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice warned on thursday that washington was fully committed to achieving independence for kosovo , despite russia 's opposition .
" we will get there one way or another , " she told journalists on a flight to lisbon , but she did not say whether washington was prepared to unilaterally recognize an independent kosovo . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
it was proved half right .
blocked by a russian veto threat , supporters of a un plan to grant independence to the serb province of kosovo ended their bid in the security council on friday . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called on friday for serbia and the political leaders of kosovo to be included in talks on the future of the breakaway serb republic .
although approval of a united nations security council resolution on the future status of the territory , remained the main priority , steinmeier said after talks in berlin with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov . shortly after the minister spoke , however , the united states envoy at the un said negotiations at the world body on a draft resolution for kosovo had failed . us ambassador zalmay khalilzad said washington would seek a non-un resolution to the dispute over kosovo 's political future because russia has blocked security council efforts to settle that issue .
" we 'll move outside the security council process and the contact group will take the lead and move forward during the process of negotiations , " he told reporters . russia blocks resolution on kosovo 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khalilzad said the issue would go to the contact group western nations have been trying to push a draft resolution in the un security council to implement key provisions of un mediator martti ahtissari 's plan to grant " supervised independence " to the breakaway albanian-majority serbian province . but they have hurtled into opposition from moscow , belgrade 's key ally , which has repeatedly threatened to veto a security council resolution under discussion . the contact group is composed of the us , russia , france , britain , italy and germany .
in this political body , however , russia has no veto power . russia , serbia welcome the decision later on friday , russia welcomed as " logical " the decision at the united nations in new york to refer the kosovo independence issue to the contact group . " this is a logical consequence of our active policy , " a russian foreign ministry spokesman said , according to interfax .
" we want to lay the foundations for a continuation of the dialogue with the aim of reaching an agreement between pristina and belgrade . " and while serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica hailed the dropped kosovo independence bid as " an important victory in the un security council " for serbia and its traditional ally russia in their attempts to defend " the sovereignty and territorial integrity of serbia , " kosovo ethnic albanian prime minister agim ceku said it would be " better to seek new alternatives " to resolve the future status of the province . the kosovo daily express reported that ceku had proposed to other kosovo albanian politicians to proclaim independence on nov .
28 - the independence day in neighboring albania . " this was initially an idea how to get out of a situation that has been blocked in the security council , " ceku told reporters after meeting the chief un administrator of kosovo joachim rücker .
french envoy calls for fast solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de la sabliere wants a solution sooner rather than later france 's un ambassador to the un jean-marc de la sabliere echoed zalmay khalilzad ’ s comments .
" we regret that it has been impossible to secure such a resolution in the un security council , " sabliere said .
" we will therefore put on hold discussions of a new resolution . "
" we have decided to renew discussions within the contact group and with the parties along these lines , " he added .
" the people of kosovo should be given the opportunity to realize their political and economic development , ” the french envoy continued .
“ we are determined to assist them in that aim in the period ahead . "
" a timely resolving of kosovo 's status will also enable serbia to move beyond the conflicts of the 1990s and toward a brighter european and euro-atlantic future .
we believe that resolving kosovo 's status must be achieved as soon as possible . "
de la sabliere concluded by saying that european union foreign ministers would discuss kosovo at a meeting in brussels on monday .
run by the un bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has been in charge in kosovo for eight years kosovo has been run by the un since 1999 , after a nato bombing campaign helped drive out serb forces carrying out a brutal crackdown on ethnic albanians , who make up 90 percent of the population in the province .
the western compromise draft would have turned over administration of the province from the united nations to the eu while maintaining a nato presence .
russia , however , made it clear it would veto the latest compromise draft introduced to the un security council by belgium , britain , france , germany , italy and the united states .
eu 's solana claims talks will go ahead on tuesday , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said serbia and kosovo were likely to hold new talks on the province 's future even without a un security council resolution , probably under the aegis of the contact group .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice warned on thursday that washington was fully committed to achieving independence for kosovo , despite russia 's opposition .
" we will get there one way or another , " she told journalists on a flight to lisbon , but she did not say whether washington was prepared to unilaterally recognize an independent kosovo . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to his eldest son , retired major general berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg , about the plot and its significance . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , a colonel in hitler 's army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power .
stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's hideaway .
miraculously , the dictator survived the blast and stauffenberg and others involved in the plot were executed . a movie about the events of july 20 , 1944 , is currently being filmed in berlin starring hollywood actor and prominent scientologist tom cruise , and it has stirred controversy .
over the years , some have raised questions about the attack itself , with debate about the motives and the political per suasion of stauffenberg .
dw-world.de talked to his eldest son about the assassination plot and its consequences for the family and germany as a whole .
dw-world.de : you were only 10 years old when your father died .
did you know anything about his oppositional activities ?
what about the rest of your family ?
berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg : i did n't know anything naturally .
everything had to be kept secret .
if children find out about something like that there is always the danger that they 're going to spill the beans .
my mother knew something about it and also approved , but we did n't get wind of any of that .
when did your mother find out what was happening ?
she noticed there was something going on relatively early and brought it up with my father .
i do n't know how much he told her .
she knew that he was going to do something .
what she did n't know was that he was going to plant the bomb himself .
when and how did you find out about attack ?
i heard in the radio that there had been an assassination attempt .
but it was not until the following day that my mother told me and my next-youngest brother that our father had carried it out .
it was a big shock for us .
after this lengthy conversation , she was picked up at night .
we did n't see her again until june ' 45 .
you talked about shock .
were you shocked because this was the first time that you 'd heard your father was dead or the fact that he was involved in the resistance ?
or both ?
both .
people today might not be able to believe it , but death was nothing unusual at that time .
a third of my classmates had lost their fathers and the threat was always there .
you could also be killed in different ways as a result of bombing raids and so on .
it was , of course , the fact that he had committed this act against the head of state .
that did n't fit into our world view .
we asked how he could do something like that to the führer .
our mother told us that he believed that he had to do it for germany .
were you brought up in a way that was typical of the time ? we were not brought up to be out-and-out nazis , but we encountered it in our surroundings .
as i said , my parents did not make critical remarks , but they also did n't express any enthusiasm either .
but there was nazi indoctrination in the school .
how did things proceed after your mother was picked up ?
the family was torn apart .
most of the adults were then sent to concentration camps , including those who were obviously not involved .
under the nazis there was a practice of punishing family members as well as the perpetrator .
my mother and my aunt were , of course , held for questioning for a long time .
we were then taken to a children 's home that had been especially cleared out to take us .
and we stayed there until after the invasion - in this case by the americans .
was your later career shaped by the attack ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg was executed for his act shaped is perhaps not the right expression .
however , it was strongly influenced .
if you have a well-known name and , of course , we had become well-known among those people who were against the attack - some because they were nazis and some because they rejected violence as a matter of principle , and it 's a bit different living under those circumstances than if you can live anonymously .
but it is like that in almost any profession when you go into the same profession as your father .
i did it because i thought i would enjoy it .
not because i wanted to follow in a family tradition , or because of my father .
rather in spite of my father .
are there any misapprehensions about your father that particularly upset you ? well , there is one theory .
it is always said that he was a nazi at the start and that this only changed later .
that sounds good to those people who were themselves nazis .
and i would n't object if that was how things were , but that is not factually correct .
at the start , my father was neither pro- nor anti-nazi .
he just wanted to see how things developed and then judge things for himself .
it may have been that at the time he disagreed with nazi supporters and nazi opponents .
independence was something that he always valued highly .
what do feel is missing from the conventional image of your father ?
of course , i ca n't really judge that properly because i did n't know him well enough .
it does n't serve him well to be made into a superman , or a superstar , as people would say today .
but he also was n't just any ordinary person .
i do believe that he was especially talented .
there have been around seven films , including documentary films on the topic , and now hollywood and tom cruise are tackling the subject .
do you feel that your family history has become public pro per ty ?
my father 's story has quite clearly become public property .
apart from the films that are , on the whole , benevolent , there has also been literature that was deprecatory or base . but your family has , nevertheless , not shut out the public . no , we think that it is not the business of the family to honor my father or not .
it should not interfere there .
that does n't mean we are against it , or that we do n't give our support when we are asked .
but we do n't pursue it actively . what about your comments on tom cruise ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise as stauffenberg : filming began thursday none of us has taken active steps .
i was contacted by the -lsb- daily -rsb- süddeutsche zeitung and asked to give an interview .
i stated my opinion .
in a democracy you should be able to express your opinions , your personal opinion , without intending to make any demands .
i never called for the film to be stopped .
i also never said that tom cruise should n't act the part or that it should n't be permitted .
i said that i did n't like it .
and i think that is legitimate .
over the years the historical reception of the resistance led by your father has changed significantly .
do you think the more recent interpretations get any closer to the truth ?
sixty years is a long time .
there are only few people left alive who were active in the war .
even their children are old people now .
it 's natural that the image that we have should change .
it has shifted from being first-hand experience and has become history .
of course , a lot of mistakes have also crept in .
however things were , the history that we know definitely contains a lot of mistakes that we do n't know about and that we are no longer in a position to recognize .
what is the significance , in your opinion , of the events of july 20 for germany and the world - and for you per sonally ?
i do n't want to draw any lessons for the german people or the whole world .
but perhaps you can say one thing .
if you feel a sense of moral duty then you have to act upon that .
this is n't a political issue .
it also is n't about whether you are a democrat or not .
it 's a question of morality .
if you have the opportunity to do something about it , can you allow a people to be governed by criminals - even if they have been elected by the people ? julie gregson interviewed berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new harry potter book comes out in english in germany on saturday and german fans will not be waiting for the translated version . while there has been some discussion about doing away with what some conservatives call " unnecessary " usage of the english language in germany , the germans have not gone as far as the french in making a stand to protect their mother tongue .
many germans bemoan the fact that a hybrid commonly known as " denglish " has crept into their society , but there has yet to be a concerted effort to establish any german equivalent to france 's protectionist institution , the académie française .
those thinking of pushing for the creation of such an institution and the eventual eradication of anglicisms in germany may yet have their day , but they continue to bide their time - and wisely so .
why ?
because had they managed to beat back the english incursion between the publication of 2005 's " harry potter and the half-blood prince " and the final installment , " the deathly hallows " - the english version of which goes on sale in germany on saturday - they would have been left at the mercy of tens of thousands of would-be wizards and witches calling for their muggle heads .
nothing stands in the way of a potter fix bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're a dedicated bunch these harry potter fans language purists , however , are clever enough to know that turning germany into a land where an english book would be held back for publication until the german one had been launched is simply too premature .
nobody wants to be responsible for wand-waving pandemonium across the nation .
and who would want to be forced to quiver behind barricades and huddle behind locked doors for purely linguistic reasons ?
such is the demand for the seventh and final book in the phenomenally successful harry potter series that german fans are laying in wait to snap up the first run of the english publication despite some readers having only a limited understanding of the language in its written in .
the expectation over how the boy wizard 's story comes to its conclusion is so intense that potter nuts across germany are refusing to wait the three months until the german translation is released .
" anyone with a reasonable command of english does n't want to wait until oct .
27 when the german version is due to appear , " heinrich riethmüller , manager of the osiander chain of book stores , told reporters .
fans waiting for the witching hour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will grab a copy regardless of their english skills online orders of the english version of " harry potter and the deathly hallows " have passed the 170,000 mark in germany while many thousands of fans are preparing for a night on the streets waiting for the bookshops to open as the chimes strike twelve .
some stores are even throwing special midnight harry potter parties for those fans who plan to storm the shelves once the clock passes the witching hour .
literary observers believe that the popularity in germany of the harry potter books in their original language has much to do with the fact that many fans have grown up with the series , reading each book as it came out and improving their english along the way .
sixth book made history in germany the first real sign of the clamor for harry , ron , hermione and friends in english came with the release of the " half-blood prince . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : j.k. rowling 's sixth book broke records in germany the sixth book became the first english-language book ever to make it into the german best-seller list .
" the seventh book will do even better , " said riethmüller .
" it 's bound to enter the best-seller list . "
dealers estimate that total sales of " harry potter and the deathly hallows " will top the three-million mark in germany .
the defenders of the german language may be rubbing their hands over the fact that j.k. rowling has now completed her odyssey .
they may now feel free to slowly squeeze the english language out of germany without magical reprisals .
but time will tell .
harry 's story may have come to an end but it is unlikely the spell of reading in english will be broken for a generation who followed his adventures in a foreign tongue . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to his eldest son , retired major general berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg , about the plot and its significance . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , a colonel in hitler 's army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power .
stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's hideaway .
miraculously , the dictator survived the blast and stauffenberg and others involved in the plot were executed . a movie about the events of july 20 , 1944 , is currently being filmed in berlin starring hollywood actor and prominent scientologist tom cruise , and it has stirred controversy .
over the years , some have raised questions about the attack itself , with debate about the motives and the political per suasion of stauffenberg .
dw-world.de talked to his eldest son about the assassination plot and its consequences for the family and germany as a whole .
dw-world.de : you were only 10 years old when your father died .
did you know anything about his oppositional activities ?
what about the rest of your family ?
berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg : i did n't know anything naturally .
everything had to be kept secret .
if children find out about something like that there is always the danger that they 're going to spill the beans .
my mother knew something about it and also approved , but we did n't get wind of any of that .
when did your mother find out what was happening ?
she noticed there was something going on relatively early and brought it up with my father .
i do n't know how much he told her .
she knew that he was going to do something .
what she did n't know was that he was going to plant the bomb himself .
when and how did you find out about attack ?
i heard in the radio that there had been an assassination attempt .
but it was not until the following day that my mother told me and my next-youngest brother that our father had carried it out .
it was a big shock for us .
after this lengthy conversation , she was picked up at night .
we did n't see her again until june ' 45 .
you talked about shock .
were you shocked because this was the first time that you 'd heard your father was dead or the fact that he was involved in the resistance ?
or both ?
both .
people today might not be able to believe it , but death was nothing unusual at that time .
a third of my classmates had lost their fathers and the threat was always there .
you could also be killed in different ways as a result of bombing raids and so on .
it was , of course , the fact that he had committed this act against the head of state .
that did n't fit into our world view .
we asked how he could do something like that to the führer .
our mother told us that he believed that he had to do it for germany .
were you brought up in a way that was typical of the time ? we were not brought up to be out-and-out nazis , but we encountered it in our surroundings .
as i said , my parents did not make critical remarks , but they also did n't express any enthusiasm either .
but there was nazi indoctrination in the school .
how did things proceed after your mother was picked up ?
the family was torn apart .
most of the adults were then sent to concentration camps , including those who were obviously not involved .
under the nazis there was a practice of punishing family members as well as the perpetrator .
my mother and my aunt were , of course , held for questioning for a long time .
we were then taken to a children 's home that had been especially cleared out to take us .
and we stayed there until after the invasion - in this case by the americans .

yet in recent years musicians from small european countries have begun rocking festival lineups and winning over fans . most festivalgoers have been partying for a day or two by the time zzz gets its 30-minute shot at fame .
" it 's very compact , " björn ottenheim , zzz 's drummer and singer said about playing such a short set . " it 's like you can make love to a woman all night long or you can also make it quick and dirty , which can also be very beautiful . "
the " wham-bam , thank you ma 'am " of their short festival set is not the only sleazy factor of zzz 's current act .
you can definitely hear the funky porn soundtrack influence and the heady dope and sex atmosphere from the red light district running as a lusty undercurrent in this amsterdam duo 's organ-fueled dance music .
playing to the people who have yet to be introduced to their sound is something zzz are getting used to .
however , they 've been working hard to spread the word this summer as the dutch duo found itself playing to large enthusiastic crowds at major music festivals in great britain , slovenia and belgium .
it 's an on-going mission .
last summer , it was much of the same as they trawled through festivals in italy , france and spain as well as getting booked at popkomm , a festival associated with a large trade show for the music and entertainment industry held in berlin .
it 's not easy being european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn ottenheim , left , and daan schinkel of zzz bands from non-english-speaking european countries have always had to contend with getting a lot less media attention and air time than their american and british counterparts .
" when you do n't come from the us or uk , it 's already pretty hard , " said ottenheim in a phone interview from the dour festival in belgium .
" being from holland , you have to have that extra bit of luck that people take some time to check us out .
and then most of the time they 're stuck immediately when they hear us . "
for many years , festival promoters did n't book european bands because they simply had no way of finding out about them .
but things have been getting better .
the situation began to change for the musical minnows in 2003 , when the european talent exchange program -lrb- etep -rrb- launched an effort to bring together festival promoters and potential talent .
etep-sponsored bands will play 200 shows in festivals this summer , up from 50 in the first year .
until recently , part of the funding came from the european commission .
" we think it 's working very well , " etep founder peter smidt said of the program .
" but it 's definitely not yet the case that a german or a dutch or a french act automatically have access to the european market .
it 's still very difficult . "
summer soundtrack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festivals dot europe 's summer landscape summer music festivals are big business in europe . about 144,000 alternative music fans showed up for the four-day dour festival .
" we love playing festivals of this caliber , " ottenheim said of the dour festival .
" to have a whole tent of people freaking out on my music is a pretty immense feeling .
it 's rewarding and it 's very sexy . "
with record sales stagnating , the summer festivals have become an essential way for bands to get exposure outside their home countries , said christof huber , of the swiss-based european festival association yourope .
" i think the people want to explore new bands .
if the quality of the live act is there , bands from europe can be headliners right now , " huber said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many festivals are multi-day events while most bands sing in english regardless of where they are from , some have had success singing in their native language .
the german band wir sind helden -lrb- we are heroes -rrb- have been selling out shows across europe , as have norwegian outfit kaizers orchestra .
icelandic trance-rockers sigur ros are also a big draw on the european circuit despite the fact that most people do n't have a clue what they 're singing about .
the diversity and quality of european bands is at an all-time high , smidt believes .
" that 's the nice thing about european culture , that it has this diversity and it 's not like one sound , " he said . big in japan bands from small european countries like the netherlands " need to go abroad to survive , " smidt said . which explains zzz 's relentless touring , which has included stops in places as diverse as japan and the south by southwest music event in austin , texas - considered to be a must for any band wanting to break into the us market .

yet in recent years musicians from small european countries have begun rocking festival lineups and winning over fans . most festivalgoers have been partying for a day or two by the time zzz gets its 30-minute shot at fame .
" it 's very compact , " björn ottenheim , zzz 's drummer and singer said about playing such a short set . " it 's like you can make love to a woman all night long or you can also make it quick and dirty , which can also be very beautiful . "
the " wham-bam , thank you ma 'am " of their short festival set is not the only sleazy factor of zzz 's current act .
you can definitely hear the funky porn soundtrack influence and the heady dope and sex atmosphere from the red light district running as a lusty undercurrent in this amsterdam duo 's organ-fueled dance music .
playing to the people who have yet to be introduced to their sound is something zzz are getting used to .
however , they 've been working hard to spread the word this summer as the dutch duo found itself playing to large enthusiastic crowds at major music festivals in great britain , slovenia and belgium .

some talk about a repeat of the east-west conflict .
that 's wrong .
there 's the threat of an adversarial climate , but not of a cold war , says dw-world.de 's ingo mannteufel . relations between russia and the west are getting worse - both in terms of rhetoric and actions - especially since the list of controversial issues seems to get longer every day : the planned us defense missile shield in poland and the czech republic ; the un resolution on kosovo ; actual , alleged or planned russian arms deliveries to syria , iran or venezuela ; the iranian nuclear program ; estonia 's attitude towards soviet memorials ; the investigation of the murder of former intelligence agent and emigrant alexander litvinenko ; and finally russia 's decision to pull out of the conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel in principle , differences of opinion and interests between states are nothing unusual in international politics , and luckily they do n't lead to war most of the time .
when russia , the us and european states are feuding to such an extent , it immediately reminds people of the 40-year cold war that took place in the second half of the last century .
putin 's decision to pull out of the cfe treaty could be considered final proof for this since the 1990 agreement is seen as a symbol of the end of the east-west conflict .
despite this , there wo n't be a new version of the cold war - first and foremost because today 's russia , even as the important global energy supplier that it is , is far from having the political and economic power of a soviet union .
what 's decisive is that the philosophical and ideological undertone is missing in the current dispute between russia and the west .
in the confrontation between world communism and liberal democracy , soviet leaders - from a marxist-leninist viewpoint - saw themselves on the side of history that would end in the victory of the international proletariat in the communist world revolution .
even if people can only laugh about this today , they should n't underestimate this decisive motive for the east-west conflict , as cold war historians have shown in recent years .
it was this opposition of systems that created the impression of a lasting confrontation that engulfed all aspects of life .
neither a functioning liberal democracy nor a market economy governed by rule of law have developed in russia .
but the current russian system is not based on a carefully devised counter-ideology to western democracy .
quite to the contrary : president putin is personally insulted when people do n't see him as a clear-cut democrat or refuse to treat russia on a par with g8 democracies , which are considered the club of global capitalism by many .
the lacking ideological component in the current dispute between russia and the west has yet another consequence : russia has more trouble finding allies in the world as it no longer possesses the global power of attraction of a different political and economical system .
anti-colonial liberation movements in developing countries or anti-american regimes no longer see their own future in the russian role model .
that 's why moscow has lost the opportunity to turn its own disputes with the us and europe into a global confrontation in the sense of the historic cold war .
in the wake of russia 's post-soviet weakness , president putin now thinks the time has come for a new all-encompassing arrangement with the us and europe .
he is aiming for agreements that are more in line with his own interests of a newly strengthened great power russia .
this makes russia 's foreign policy appear aggressive , especially since it is presented in a brusque way .
it 's necessary to be prepared for a new and not completely harmless climate of animosity in relations between russia and the west - at least to the us and a few important european nato states .
but there wo n't be a return to a bipolar world of two different societal systems as in the old east-west conflict .

when russia , the us and european states are feuding to such an extent , it immediately reminds people of the 40-year cold war that took place in the second half of the last century .
putin 's decision to pull out of the cfe treaty could be considered final proof for this since the 1990 agreement is seen as a symbol of the end of the east-west conflict .
despite this , there wo n't be a new version of the cold war - first and foremost because today 's russia , even as the important global energy supplier that it is , is far from having the political and economic power of a soviet union .
what 's decisive is that the philosophical and ideological undertone is missing in the current dispute between russia and the west .
in the confrontation between world communism and liberal democracy , soviet leaders - from a marxist-leninist viewpoint - saw themselves on the side of history that would end in the victory of the international proletariat in the communist world revolution .
even if people can only laugh about this today , they should n't underestimate this decisive motive for the east-west conflict , as cold war historians have shown in recent years .
it was this opposition of systems that created the impression of a lasting confrontation that engulfed all aspects of life .
neither a functioning liberal democracy nor a market economy governed by rule of law have developed in russia .
but the current russian system is not based on a carefully devised counter-ideology to western democracy .
quite to the contrary : president putin is personally insulted when people do n't see him as a clear-cut democrat or refuse to treat russia on a par with g8 democracies , which are considered the club of global capitalism by many .
the lacking ideological component in the current dispute between russia and the west has yet another consequence : russia has more trouble finding allies in the world as it no longer possesses the global power of attraction of a different political and economical system .
anti-colonial liberation movements in developing countries or anti-american regimes no longer see their own future in the russian role model .
that 's why moscow has lost the opportunity to turn its own disputes with the us and europe into a global confrontation in the sense of the historic cold war .
in the wake of russia 's post-soviet weakness , president putin now thinks the time has come for a new all-encompassing arrangement with the us and europe .
he is aiming for agreements that are more in line with his own interests of a newly strengthened great power russia .
this makes russia 's foreign policy appear aggressive , especially since it is presented in a brusque way .
it 's necessary to be prepared for a new and not completely harmless climate of animosity in relations between russia and the west - at least to the us and a few important european nato states .
but there wo n't be a return to a bipolar world of two different societal systems as in the old east-west conflict .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 20.07.2007 european music rocks the summer festival scene großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people do n't care if it 's the red hot chili peppers or an unsigned icelandic yodeler us and british bands usually steal the headlines at europe 's most important summer music festivals .
yet in recent years musicians from small european countries have begun rocking festival lineups and winning over fans . most festivalgoers have been partying for a day or two by the time zzz gets its 30-minute shot at fame .
" it 's very compact , " björn ottenheim , zzz 's drummer and singer said about playing such a short set . " it 's like you can make love to a woman all night long or you can also make it quick and dirty , which can also be very beautiful . "
the " wham-bam , thank you ma 'am " of their short festival set is not the only sleazy factor of zzz 's current act .
you can definitely hear the funky porn soundtrack influence and the heady dope and sex atmosphere from the red light district running as a lusty undercurrent in this amsterdam duo 's organ-fueled dance music .
playing to the people who have yet to be introduced to their sound is something zzz are getting used to .
however , they 've been working hard to spread the word this summer as the dutch duo found itself playing to large enthusiastic crowds at major music festivals in great britain , slovenia and belgium .
it 's an on-going mission .
last summer , it was much of the same as they trawled through festivals in italy , france and spain as well as getting booked at popkomm , a festival associated with a large trade show for the music and entertainment industry held in berlin .
it 's not easy being european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn ottenheim , left , and daan schinkel of zzz bands from non-english-speaking european countries have always had to contend with getting a lot less media attention and air time than their american and british counterparts .
" when you do n't come from the us or uk , it 's already pretty hard , " said ottenheim in a phone interview from the dour festival in belgium .
" being from holland , you have to have that extra bit of luck that people take some time to check us out .
and then most of the time they 're stuck immediately when they hear us . "
for many years , festival promoters did n't book european bands because they simply had no way of finding out about them .
but things have been getting better .
the situation began to change for the musical minnows in 2003 , when the european talent exchange program -lrb- etep -rrb- launched an effort to bring together festival promoters and potential talent .
etep-sponsored bands will play 200 shows in festivals this summer , up from 50 in the first year .
until recently , part of the funding came from the european commission .
" we think it 's working very well , " etep founder peter smidt said of the program .
" but it 's definitely not yet the case that a german or a dutch or a french act automatically have access to the european market .
it 's still very difficult . "
summer soundtrack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festivals dot europe 's summer landscape summer music festivals are big business in europe . about 144,000 alternative music fans showed up for the four-day dour festival .
" we love playing festivals of this caliber , " ottenheim said of the dour festival .
" to have a whole tent of people freaking out on my music is a pretty immense feeling .
it 's rewarding and it 's very sexy . "
with record sales stagnating , the summer festivals have become an essential way for bands to get exposure outside their home countries , said christof huber , of the swiss-based european festival association yourope .
" i think the people want to explore new bands .

playing to the people who have yet to be introduced to their sound is something zzz are getting used to .
however , they 've been working hard to spread the word this summer as the dutch duo found itself playing to large enthusiastic crowds at major music festivals in great britain , slovenia and belgium .

" these numbers show that china 's growth actually accelerated in the second quarter , " standard chartered economist stephen green told ap .
" the key question is , how sustainable is all this ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has china 's economy already grown past germany 's ?
though some economists have said china will only replace germany behind the usa and japan in the list of the world 's largest economies , earlier this week green said that " probably happened a few months ago . " the federation of german industries ' head klaus bräunig also said thursday that if china has n't surpassed germany yet , it will happen by the end of the year - despite the 2.8 percent growth the federation expects to come from germany this year . " in comparison with china we 're a small country , " bräunig said .
" what 's important is that we are growing in comparison with our competitors . " a market for german exports germany could benefit from the overall strength of china 's economy , which expanded by 11.5 percent in the first half of 2007 , according to allianz and dresdner bank head analyst michael heise . " we should see this as a chance to develop a larger sales market for german products , " he told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper , adding that according to his calculations , china would have to wait until at least next year before its gdp is larger than germany 's . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing said it will take steps to keep its economy in balance discrepancies in the calculations are mainly due to varying exchange rates banks and other groups use to calculate an economy 's size .
but rather than looking at their international rank , china should be concerned with its economy overheating , according to several analysts . crash on the horizon ? " it 's stunning , " tim condon , head of asia research at dutch bank ing in singapore told reuters .
" we should expect them to raise interest rates or reserve requirements at any moment . " china national statistics bureau spokesman li xiaochao said a series of cooling measures this year , which included two interest rate hikes , had already had some impact but the government needed to do more . " we will continue to strengthen and improve macro-control measures , " li said at a press conference .
" we will continue to enhance the adjustment of the industrial structure to change the growth pattern and to enable the economy to grow healthily and quickly . " china surpassed britain to become the world 's fourth largest economy in 2005 and has been at germany 's heels since .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 20.07.2007 european music rocks the summer festival scene großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people do n't care if it 's the red hot chili peppers or an unsigned icelandic yodeler us and british bands usually steal the headlines at europe 's most important summer music festivals .
yet in recent years musicians from small european countries have begun rocking festival lineups and winning over fans . most festivalgoers have been partying for a day or two by the time zzz gets its 30-minute shot at fame .
" it 's very compact , " björn ottenheim , zzz 's drummer and singer said about playing such a short set . " it 's like you can make love to a woman all night long or you can also make it quick and dirty , which can also be very beautiful . "
the " wham-bam , thank you ma 'am " of their short festival set is not the only sleazy factor of zzz 's current act .
you can definitely hear the funky porn soundtrack influence and the heady dope and sex atmosphere from the red light district running as a lusty undercurrent in this amsterdam duo 's organ-fueled dance music .
playing to the people who have yet to be introduced to their sound is something zzz are getting used to .
however , they 've been working hard to spread the word this summer as the dutch duo found itself playing to large enthusiastic crowds at major music festivals in great britain , slovenia and belgium .
it 's an on-going mission .
last summer , it was much of the same as they trawled through festivals in italy , france and spain as well as getting booked at popkomm , a festival associated with a large trade show for the music and entertainment industry held in berlin .
it 's not easy being european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn ottenheim , left , and daan schinkel of zzz bands from non-english-speaking european countries have always had to contend with getting a lot less media attention and air time than their american and british counterparts .
" when you do n't come from the us or uk , it 's already pretty hard , " said ottenheim in a phone interview from the dour festival in belgium .
" being from holland , you have to have that extra bit of luck that people take some time to check us out .
and then most of the time they 're stuck immediately when they hear us . "
for many years , festival promoters did n't book european bands because they simply had no way of finding out about them .
but things have been getting better .
the situation began to change for the musical minnows in 2003 , when the european talent exchange program -lrb- etep -rrb- launched an effort to bring together festival promoters and potential talent .
etep-sponsored bands will play 200 shows in festivals this summer , up from 50 in the first year .
until recently , part of the funding came from the european commission .
" we think it 's working very well , " etep founder peter smidt said of the program .
" but it 's definitely not yet the case that a german or a dutch or a french act automatically have access to the european market .
it 's still very difficult . "
summer soundtrack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festivals dot europe 's summer landscape summer music festivals are big business in europe . about 144,000 alternative music fans showed up for the four-day dour festival .
" we love playing festivals of this caliber , " ottenheim said of the dour festival .
" to have a whole tent of people freaking out on my music is a pretty immense feeling .
it 's rewarding and it 's very sexy . "
with record sales stagnating , the summer festivals have become an essential way for bands to get exposure outside their home countries , said christof huber , of the swiss-based european festival association yourope .
" i think the people want to explore new bands .
if the quality of the live act is there , bands from europe can be headliners right now , " huber said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many festivals are multi-day events while most bands sing in english regardless of where they are from , some have had success singing in their native language .
the german band wir sind helden -lrb- we are heroes -rrb- have been selling out shows across europe , as have norwegian outfit kaizers orchestra .
icelandic trance-rockers sigur ros are also a big draw on the european circuit despite the fact that most people do n't have a clue what they 're singing about .
the diversity and quality of european bands is at an all-time high , smidt believes .
" that 's the nice thing about european culture , that it has this diversity and it 's not like one sound , " he said . big in japan bands from small european countries like the netherlands " need to go abroad to survive , " smidt said . which explains zzz 's relentless touring , which has included stops in places as diverse as japan and the south by southwest music event in austin , texas - considered to be a must for any band wanting to break into the us market .
ottenheim and bandmate daan schinkel will head back to britain in august to play the summer sundae weekender festival .
despite the odds , zzz has every intention of making it big in the music business , ottenheim said .
that 's a bold statement .
it 's been 33 years since the dutch band golden earring showed up on us charts with its hit " radar love . "
" i would n't mind kicking it even further than golden earring , " ottenheim said .
" we 're doing pretty good in japan .
we 're just working as hard as we can on the music we make and the shows we do . " trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 20.07.2007 german fans under the spell of harry potter in english großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are ready to snap up " harry potter and the deathly hallows " in its original form for those purists wanting to protect the german language , turn away now .
the new harry potter book comes out in english in germany on saturday and german fans will not be waiting for the translated version . while there has been some discussion about doing away with what some conservatives call " unnecessary " usage of the english language in germany , the germans have not gone as far as the french in making a stand to protect their mother tongue .
many germans bemoan the fact that a hybrid commonly known as " denglish " has crept into their society , but there has yet to be a concerted effort to establish any german equivalent to france 's protectionist institution , the académie française .
those thinking of pushing for the creation of such an institution and the eventual eradication of anglicisms in germany may yet have their day , but they continue to bide their time - and wisely so .
why ?
because had they managed to beat back the english incursion between the publication of 2005 's " harry potter and the half-blood prince " and the final installment , " the deathly hallows " - the english version of which goes on sale in germany on saturday - they would have been left at the mercy of tens of thousands of would-be wizards and witches calling for their muggle heads .
nothing stands in the way of a potter fix bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're a dedicated bunch these harry potter fans language purists , however , are clever enough to know that turning germany into a land where an english book would be held back for publication until the german one had been launched is simply too premature .
nobody wants to be responsible for wand-waving pandemonium across the nation .
and who would want to be forced to quiver behind barricades and huddle behind locked doors for purely linguistic reasons ?
such is the demand for the seventh and final book in the phenomenally successful harry potter series that german fans are laying in wait to snap up the first run of the english publication despite some readers having only a limited understanding of the language in its written in .
the expectation over how the boy wizard 's story comes to its conclusion is so intense that potter nuts across germany are refusing to wait the three months until the german translation is released .
" anyone with a reasonable command of english does n't want to wait until oct .
27 when the german version is due to appear , " heinrich riethmüller , manager of the osiander chain of book stores , told reporters .
fans waiting for the witching hour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will grab a copy regardless of their english skills online orders of the english version of " harry potter and the deathly hallows " have passed the 170,000 mark in germany while many thousands of fans are preparing for a night on the streets waiting for the bookshops to open as the chimes strike twelve .
some stores are even throwing special midnight harry potter parties for those fans who plan to storm the shelves once the clock passes the witching hour .
literary observers believe that the popularity in germany of the harry potter books in their original language has much to do with the fact that many fans have grown up with the series , reading each book as it came out and improving their english along the way .
sixth book made history in germany the first real sign of the clamor for harry , ron , hermione and friends in english came with the release of the " half-blood prince . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : j.k. rowling 's sixth book broke records in germany the sixth book became the first english-language book ever to make it into the german best-seller list .
" the seventh book will do even better , " said riethmüller .
" it 's bound to enter the best-seller list . "
dealers estimate that total sales of " harry potter and the deathly hallows " will top the three-million mark in germany .
the defenders of the german language may be rubbing their hands over the fact that j.k. rowling has now completed her odyssey .
they may now feel free to slowly squeeze the english language out of germany without magical reprisals .
but time will tell .
harry 's story may have come to an end but it is unlikely the spell of reading in english will be broken for a generation who followed his adventures in a foreign tongue . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there have been years of discussions , without substantial results .
the time has come to bring the process closer to decision-making .

the german envoy added that berlin would only agree to such a deal if it were guaranteed one of the initial interim spots . " we would not agree to any solution which did not hold out this possibility for germany , " matussek told afp , adding that the interim members would then become candidates for permanent status with veto rights on the council .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.07.2007 " if you feel a sense of moral duty , you have to act upon it " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg 's family was torn apart following the attack graf von stauffenberg attempted to assassinate hitler 63 years ago on friday .
dw-world.de spoke to his eldest son , retired major general berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg , about the plot and its significance . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , a colonel in hitler 's army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power .
stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's hideaway .
miraculously , the dictator survived the blast and stauffenberg and others involved in the plot were executed . a movie about the events of july 20 , 1944 , is currently being filmed in berlin starring hollywood actor and prominent scientologist tom cruise , and it has stirred controversy .
over the years , some have raised questions about the attack itself , with debate about the motives and the political per suasion of stauffenberg .
dw-world.de talked to his eldest son about the assassination plot and its consequences for the family and germany as a whole .
dw-world.de : you were only 10 years old when your father died .
did you know anything about his oppositional activities ?
what about the rest of your family ?
berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg : i did n't know anything naturally .
everything had to be kept secret .
if children find out about something like that there is always the danger that they 're going to spill the beans .
my mother knew something about it and also approved , but we did n't get wind of any of that .
when did your mother find out what was happening ?
she noticed there was something going on relatively early and brought it up with my father .
i do n't know how much he told her .
she knew that he was going to do something .
what she did n't know was that he was going to plant the bomb himself .
when and how did you find out about attack ?
i heard in the radio that there had been an assassination attempt .
but it was not until the following day that my mother told me and my next-youngest brother that our father had carried it out .
it was a big shock for us .
after this lengthy conversation , she was picked up at night .
we did n't see her again until june ' 45 .
you talked about shock .
were you shocked because this was the first time that you 'd heard your father was dead or the fact that he was involved in the resistance ?
or both ?
both .
people today might not be able to believe it , but death was nothing unusual at that time .
a third of my classmates had lost their fathers and the threat was always there .
you could also be killed in different ways as a result of bombing raids and so on .
it was , of course , the fact that he had committed this act against the head of state .
that did n't fit into our world view .
we asked how he could do something like that to the führer .
our mother told us that he believed that he had to do it for germany .
were you brought up in a way that was typical of the time ? we were not brought up to be out-and-out nazis , but we encountered it in our surroundings .
as i said , my parents did not make critical remarks , but they also did n't express any enthusiasm either .
but there was nazi indoctrination in the school .
how did things proceed after your mother was picked up ?
the family was torn apart .
most of the adults were then sent to concentration camps , including those who were obviously not involved .
under the nazis there was a practice of punishing family members as well as the perpetrator .
my mother and my aunt were , of course , held for questioning for a long time .
we were then taken to a children 's home that had been especially cleared out to take us .
and we stayed there until after the invasion - in this case by the americans .
was your later career shaped by the attack ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg was executed for his act shaped is perhaps not the right expression .
however , it was strongly influenced .
if you have a well-known name and , of course , we had become well-known among those people who were against the attack - some because they were nazis and some because they rejected violence as a matter of principle , and it 's a bit different living under those circumstances than if you can live anonymously .
but it is like that in almost any profession when you go into the same profession as your father .
i did it because i thought i would enjoy it .
not because i wanted to follow in a family tradition , or because of my father .
rather in spite of my father .
are there any misapprehensions about your father that particularly upset you ? well , there is one theory .
it is always said that he was a nazi at the start and that this only changed later .
that sounds good to those people who were themselves nazis .
and i would n't object if that was how things were , but that is not factually correct .
at the start , my father was neither pro- nor anti-nazi .
he just wanted to see how things developed and then judge things for himself .
it may have been that at the time he disagreed with nazi supporters and nazi opponents .
independence was something that he always valued highly .
what do feel is missing from the conventional image of your father ?
of course , i ca n't really judge that properly because i did n't know him well enough .
it does n't serve him well to be made into a superman , or a superstar , as people would say today .
but he also was n't just any ordinary person .
i do believe that he was especially talented .
there have been around seven films , including documentary films on the topic , and now hollywood and tom cruise are tackling the subject .
do you feel that your family history has become public pro per ty ?
my father 's story has quite clearly become public property .
apart from the films that are , on the whole , benevolent , there has also been literature that was deprecatory or base . but your family has , nevertheless , not shut out the public . no , we think that it is not the business of the family to honor my father or not .
it should not interfere there .
that does n't mean we are against it , or that we do n't give our support when we are asked .
but we do n't pursue it actively . what about your comments on tom cruise ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise as stauffenberg : filming began thursday none of us has taken active steps .
i was contacted by the -lsb- daily -rsb- süddeutsche zeitung and asked to give an interview .
i stated my opinion .
in a democracy you should be able to express your opinions , your personal opinion , without intending to make any demands .
i never called for the film to be stopped .
i also never said that tom cruise should n't act the part or that it should n't be permitted .
i said that i did n't like it .
and i think that is legitimate .
over the years the historical reception of the resistance led by your father has changed significantly .
do you think the more recent interpretations get any closer to the truth ?
sixty years is a long time .
there are only few people left alive who were active in the war .
even their children are old people now .
it 's natural that the image that we have should change .
it has shifted from being first-hand experience and has become history .
of course , a lot of mistakes have also crept in .
however things were , the history that we know definitely contains a lot of mistakes that we do n't know about and that we are no longer in a position to recognize .
what is the significance , in your opinion , of the events of july 20 for germany and the world - and for you per sonally ?
i do n't want to draw any lessons for the german people or the whole world .
but perhaps you can say one thing .
if you feel a sense of moral duty then you have to act upon that .
this is n't a political issue .
it also is n't about whether you are a democrat or not .
it 's a question of morality .
if you have the opportunity to do something about it , can you allow a people to be governed by criminals - even if they have been elected by the people ? julie gregson interviewed berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " wham-bam , thank you ma 'am " of their short festival set is not the only sleazy factor of zzz 's current act .
you can definitely hear the funky porn soundtrack influence and the heady dope and sex atmosphere from the red light district running as a lusty undercurrent in this amsterdam duo 's organ-fueled dance music .
playing to the people who have yet to be introduced to their sound is something zzz are getting used to .
however , they 've been working hard to spread the word this summer as the dutch duo found itself playing to large enthusiastic crowds at major music festivals in great britain , slovenia and belgium .
it 's an on-going mission .

yet in recent years musicians from small european countries have begun rocking festival lineups and winning over fans . most festivalgoers have been partying for a day or two by the time zzz gets its 30-minute shot at fame .
" it 's very compact , " björn ottenheim , zzz 's drummer and singer said about playing such a short set . " it 's like you can make love to a woman all night long or you can also make it quick and dirty , which can also be very beautiful . "
the " wham-bam , thank you ma 'am " of their short festival set is not the only sleazy factor of zzz 's current act .
you can definitely hear the funky porn soundtrack influence and the heady dope and sex atmosphere from the red light district running as a lusty undercurrent in this amsterdam duo 's organ-fueled dance music .
playing to the people who have yet to be introduced to their sound is something zzz are getting used to .
however , they 've been working hard to spread the word this summer as the dutch duo found itself playing to large enthusiastic crowds at major music festivals in great britain , slovenia and belgium .
it 's an on-going mission .
last summer , it was much of the same as they trawled through festivals in italy , france and spain as well as getting booked at popkomm , a festival associated with a large trade show for the music and entertainment industry held in berlin .
it 's not easy being european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn ottenheim , left , and daan schinkel of zzz bands from non-english-speaking european countries have always had to contend with getting a lot less media attention and air time than their american and british counterparts .
" when you do n't come from the us or uk , it 's already pretty hard , " said ottenheim in a phone interview from the dour festival in belgium .
" being from holland , you have to have that extra bit of luck that people take some time to check us out .
and then most of the time they 're stuck immediately when they hear us . "
for many years , festival promoters did n't book european bands because they simply had no way of finding out about them .
but things have been getting better .
the situation began to change for the musical minnows in 2003 , when the european talent exchange program -lrb- etep -rrb- launched an effort to bring together festival promoters and potential talent .
etep-sponsored bands will play 200 shows in festivals this summer , up from 50 in the first year .
until recently , part of the funding came from the european commission .
" we think it 's working very well , " etep founder peter smidt said of the program .
" but it 's definitely not yet the case that a german or a dutch or a french act automatically have access to the european market .
it 's still very difficult . "
summer soundtrack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festivals dot europe 's summer landscape summer music festivals are big business in europe . about 144,000 alternative music fans showed up for the four-day dour festival .
" we love playing festivals of this caliber , " ottenheim said of the dour festival .
" to have a whole tent of people freaking out on my music is a pretty immense feeling .
it 's rewarding and it 's very sexy . "
with record sales stagnating , the summer festivals have become an essential way for bands to get exposure outside their home countries , said christof huber , of the swiss-based european festival association yourope .
" i think the people want to explore new bands .
if the quality of the live act is there , bands from europe can be headliners right now , " huber said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many festivals are multi-day events while most bands sing in english regardless of where they are from , some have had success singing in their native language .
the german band wir sind helden -lrb- we are heroes -rrb- have been selling out shows across europe , as have norwegian outfit kaizers orchestra .
icelandic trance-rockers sigur ros are also a big draw on the european circuit despite the fact that most people do n't have a clue what they 're singing about .
the diversity and quality of european bands is at an all-time high , smidt believes .
" that 's the nice thing about european culture , that it has this diversity and it 's not like one sound , " he said . big in japan bands from small european countries like the netherlands " need to go abroad to survive , " smidt said . which explains zzz 's relentless touring , which has included stops in places as diverse as japan and the south by southwest music event in austin , texas - considered to be a must for any band wanting to break into the us market .
ottenheim and bandmate daan schinkel will head back to britain in august to play the summer sundae weekender festival .
despite the odds , zzz has every intention of making it big in the music business , ottenheim said .
that 's a bold statement .

but things have been getting better .
the situation began to change for the musical minnows in 2003 , when the european talent exchange program -lrb- etep -rrb- launched an effort to bring together festival promoters and potential talent .
etep-sponsored bands will play 200 shows in festivals this summer , up from 50 in the first year .
until recently , part of the funding came from the european commission .
" we think it 's working very well , " etep founder peter smidt said of the program .
" but it 's definitely not yet the case that a german or a dutch or a french act automatically have access to the european market .
it 's still very difficult . "
summer soundtrack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festivals dot europe 's summer landscape summer music festivals are big business in europe . about 144,000 alternative music fans showed up for the four-day dour festival .
" we love playing festivals of this caliber , " ottenheim said of the dour festival .
" to have a whole tent of people freaking out on my music is a pretty immense feeling .
it 's rewarding and it 's very sexy . "
with record sales stagnating , the summer festivals have become an essential way for bands to get exposure outside their home countries , said christof huber , of the swiss-based european festival association yourope .
" i think the people want to explore new bands .
if the quality of the live act is there , bands from europe can be headliners right now , " huber said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many festivals are multi-day events while most bands sing in english regardless of where they are from , some have had success singing in their native language .
the german band wir sind helden -lrb- we are heroes -rrb- have been selling out shows across europe , as have norwegian outfit kaizers orchestra .
icelandic trance-rockers sigur ros are also a big draw on the european circuit despite the fact that most people do n't have a clue what they 're singing about .
the diversity and quality of european bands is at an all-time high , smidt believes .
" that 's the nice thing about european culture , that it has this diversity and it 's not like one sound , " he said . big in japan bands from small european countries like the netherlands " need to go abroad to survive , " smidt said . which explains zzz 's relentless touring , which has included stops in places as diverse as japan and the south by southwest music event in austin , texas - considered to be a must for any band wanting to break into the us market .
ottenheim and bandmate daan schinkel will head back to britain in august to play the summer sundae weekender festival .
despite the odds , zzz has every intention of making it big in the music business , ottenheim said .
that 's a bold statement .
it 's been 33 years since the dutch band golden earring showed up on us charts with its hit " radar love . "
" i would n't mind kicking it even further than golden earring , " ottenheim said .
" we 're doing pretty good in japan .
we 're just working as hard as we can on the music we make and the shows we do . " trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new harry potter book comes out in english in germany on saturday and german fans will not be waiting for the translated version . while there has been some discussion about doing away with what some conservatives call " unnecessary " usage of the english language in germany , the germans have not gone as far as the french in making a stand to protect their mother tongue .

those thinking of pushing for the creation of such an institution and the eventual eradication of anglicisms in germany may yet have their day , but they continue to bide their time - and wisely so .
why ?
because had they managed to beat back the english incursion between the publication of 2005 's " harry potter and the half-blood prince " and the final installment , " the deathly hallows " - the english version of which goes on sale in germany on saturday - they would have been left at the mercy of tens of thousands of would-be wizards and witches calling for their muggle heads .

such is the demand for the seventh and final book in the phenomenally successful harry potter series that german fans are laying in wait to snap up the first run of the english publication despite some readers having only a limited understanding of the language in its written in .
the expectation over how the boy wizard 's story comes to its conclusion is so intense that potter nuts across germany are refusing to wait the three months until the german translation is released .

the new harry potter book comes out in english in germany on saturday and german fans will not be waiting for the translated version . while there has been some discussion about doing away with what some conservatives call " unnecessary " usage of the english language in germany , the germans have not gone as far as the french in making a stand to protect their mother tongue .
many germans bemoan the fact that a hybrid commonly known as " denglish " has crept into their society , but there has yet to be a concerted effort to establish any german equivalent to france 's protectionist institution , the académie française .
those thinking of pushing for the creation of such an institution and the eventual eradication of anglicisms in germany may yet have their day , but they continue to bide their time - and wisely so .
why ?
because had they managed to beat back the english incursion between the publication of 2005 's " harry potter and the half-blood prince " and the final installment , " the deathly hallows " - the english version of which goes on sale in germany on saturday - they would have been left at the mercy of tens of thousands of would-be wizards and witches calling for their muggle heads .
nothing stands in the way of a potter fix bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're a dedicated bunch these harry potter fans language purists , however , are clever enough to know that turning germany into a land where an english book would be held back for publication until the german one had been launched is simply too premature .
nobody wants to be responsible for wand-waving pandemonium across the nation .
and who would want to be forced to quiver behind barricades and huddle behind locked doors for purely linguistic reasons ?
such is the demand for the seventh and final book in the phenomenally successful harry potter series that german fans are laying in wait to snap up the first run of the english publication despite some readers having only a limited understanding of the language in its written in .
the expectation over how the boy wizard 's story comes to its conclusion is so intense that potter nuts across germany are refusing to wait the three months until the german translation is released .
" anyone with a reasonable command of english does n't want to wait until oct .

some stores are even throwing special midnight harry potter parties for those fans who plan to storm the shelves once the clock passes the witching hour .
literary observers believe that the popularity in germany of the harry potter books in their original language has much to do with the fact that many fans have grown up with the series , reading each book as it came out and improving their english along the way .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.07.2007 " if you feel a sense of moral duty , you have to act upon it " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg 's family was torn apart following the attack graf von stauffenberg attempted to assassinate hitler 63 years ago on friday .
dw-world.de spoke to his eldest son , retired major general berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg , about the plot and its significance . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , a colonel in hitler 's army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power .
stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's hideaway .
miraculously , the dictator survived the blast and stauffenberg and others involved in the plot were executed . a movie about the events of july 20 , 1944 , is currently being filmed in berlin starring hollywood actor and prominent scientologist tom cruise , and it has stirred controversy .
over the years , some have raised questions about the attack itself , with debate about the motives and the political per suasion of stauffenberg .
dw-world.de talked to his eldest son about the assassination plot and its consequences for the family and germany as a whole .
dw-world.de : you were only 10 years old when your father died .
did you know anything about his oppositional activities ?
what about the rest of your family ?
berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg : i did n't know anything naturally .
everything had to be kept secret .
if children find out about something like that there is always the danger that they 're going to spill the beans .
my mother knew something about it and also approved , but we did n't get wind of any of that .
when did your mother find out what was happening ?
she noticed there was something going on relatively early and brought it up with my father .
i do n't know how much he told her .
she knew that he was going to do something .
what she did n't know was that he was going to plant the bomb himself .
when and how did you find out about attack ?
i heard in the radio that there had been an assassination attempt .
but it was not until the following day that my mother told me and my next-youngest brother that our father had carried it out .
it was a big shock for us .
after this lengthy conversation , she was picked up at night .
we did n't see her again until june ' 45 .
you talked about shock .
were you shocked because this was the first time that you 'd heard your father was dead or the fact that he was involved in the resistance ?
or both ?
both .
people today might not be able to believe it , but death was nothing unusual at that time .
a third of my classmates had lost their fathers and the threat was always there .
you could also be killed in different ways as a result of bombing raids and so on .
it was , of course , the fact that he had committed this act against the head of state .
that did n't fit into our world view .
we asked how he could do something like that to the führer .
our mother told us that he believed that he had to do it for germany .
were you brought up in a way that was typical of the time ? we were not brought up to be out-and-out nazis , but we encountered it in our surroundings .
as i said , my parents did not make critical remarks , but they also did n't express any enthusiasm either .
but there was nazi indoctrination in the school .
how did things proceed after your mother was picked up ?
the family was torn apart .
most of the adults were then sent to concentration camps , including those who were obviously not involved .
under the nazis there was a practice of punishing family members as well as the perpetrator .
my mother and my aunt were , of course , held for questioning for a long time .
we were then taken to a children 's home that had been especially cleared out to take us .
and we stayed there until after the invasion - in this case by the americans .
was your later career shaped by the attack ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg was executed for his act shaped is perhaps not the right expression .
however , it was strongly influenced .
if you have a well-known name and , of course , we had become well-known among those people who were against the attack - some because they were nazis and some because they rejected violence as a matter of principle , and it 's a bit different living under those circumstances than if you can live anonymously .
but it is like that in almost any profession when you go into the same profession as your father .
i did it because i thought i would enjoy it .
not because i wanted to follow in a family tradition , or because of my father .
rather in spite of my father .
are there any misapprehensions about your father that particularly upset you ? well , there is one theory .
it is always said that he was a nazi at the start and that this only changed later .
that sounds good to those people who were themselves nazis .
and i would n't object if that was how things were , but that is not factually correct .
at the start , my father was neither pro- nor anti-nazi .
he just wanted to see how things developed and then judge things for himself .
it may have been that at the time he disagreed with nazi supporters and nazi opponents .
independence was something that he always valued highly .
what do feel is missing from the conventional image of your father ?
of course , i ca n't really judge that properly because i did n't know him well enough .
it does n't serve him well to be made into a superman , or a superstar , as people would say today .
but he also was n't just any ordinary person .
i do believe that he was especially talented .
there have been around seven films , including documentary films on the topic , and now hollywood and tom cruise are tackling the subject .
do you feel that your family history has become public pro per ty ?
my father 's story has quite clearly become public property .
apart from the films that are , on the whole , benevolent , there has also been literature that was deprecatory or base . but your family has , nevertheless , not shut out the public . no , we think that it is not the business of the family to honor my father or not .
it should not interfere there .
that does n't mean we are against it , or that we do n't give our support when we are asked .
but we do n't pursue it actively . what about your comments on tom cruise ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise as stauffenberg : filming began thursday none of us has taken active steps .
i was contacted by the -lsb- daily -rsb- süddeutsche zeitung and asked to give an interview .
i stated my opinion .
in a democracy you should be able to express your opinions , your personal opinion , without intending to make any demands .
i never called for the film to be stopped .
i also never said that tom cruise should n't act the part or that it should n't be permitted .
i said that i did n't like it .
and i think that is legitimate .
over the years the historical reception of the resistance led by your father has changed significantly .
do you think the more recent interpretations get any closer to the truth ?
sixty years is a long time .
there are only few people left alive who were active in the war .
even their children are old people now .
it 's natural that the image that we have should change .
it has shifted from being first-hand experience and has become history .
of course , a lot of mistakes have also crept in .
however things were , the history that we know definitely contains a lot of mistakes that we do n't know about and that we are no longer in a position to recognize .
what is the significance , in your opinion , of the events of july 20 for germany and the world - and for you per sonally ?
i do n't want to draw any lessons for the german people or the whole world .
but perhaps you can say one thing .
if you feel a sense of moral duty then you have to act upon that .
this is n't a political issue .
it also is n't about whether you are a democrat or not .
it 's a question of morality .
if you have the opportunity to do something about it , can you allow a people to be governed by criminals - even if they have been elected by the people ? julie gregson interviewed berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that does n't mean we are against it , or that we do n't give our support when we are asked .
but we do n't pursue it actively . what about your comments on tom cruise ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise as stauffenberg : filming began thursday none of us has taken active steps .
i was contacted by the -lsb- daily -rsb- süddeutsche zeitung and asked to give an interview .
i stated my opinion .
in a democracy you should be able to express your opinions , your personal opinion , without intending to make any demands .
i never called for the film to be stopped .
i also never said that tom cruise should n't act the part or that it should n't be permitted .
i said that i did n't like it .
and i think that is legitimate .
over the years the historical reception of the resistance led by your father has changed significantly .
do you think the more recent interpretations get any closer to the truth ?
sixty years is a long time .
there are only few people left alive who were active in the war .
even their children are old people now .
it 's natural that the image that we have should change .
it has shifted from being first-hand experience and has become history .
of course , a lot of mistakes have also crept in .
however things were , the history that we know definitely contains a lot of mistakes that we do n't know about and that we are no longer in a position to recognize .
what is the significance , in your opinion , of the events of july 20 for germany and the world - and for you per sonally ?
i do n't want to draw any lessons for the german people or the whole world .
but perhaps you can say one thing .
if you feel a sense of moral duty then you have to act upon that .
this is n't a political issue .
it also is n't about whether you are a democrat or not .
it 's a question of morality .
if you have the opportunity to do something about it , can you allow a people to be governed by criminals - even if they have been elected by the people ? julie gregson interviewed berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

blocked by a russian veto threat , supporters of a un plan to grant independence to the serb province of kosovo ended their bid in the security council on friday . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called on friday for serbia and the political leaders of kosovo to be included in talks on the future of the breakaway serb republic .
although approval of a united nations security council resolution on the future status of the territory , remained the main priority , steinmeier said after talks in berlin with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov . shortly after the minister spoke , however , the united states envoy at the un said negotiations at the world body on a draft resolution for kosovo had failed . us ambassador zalmay khalilzad said washington would seek a non-un resolution to the dispute over kosovo 's political future because russia has blocked security council efforts to settle that issue .
" we 'll move outside the security council process and the contact group will take the lead and move forward during the process of negotiations , " he told reporters . russia blocks resolution on kosovo 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khalilzad said the issue would go to the contact group western nations have been trying to push a draft resolution in the un security council to implement key provisions of un mediator martti ahtissari 's plan to grant " supervised independence " to the breakaway albanian-majority serbian province . but they have hurtled into opposition from moscow , belgrade 's key ally , which has repeatedly threatened to veto a security council resolution under discussion . the contact group is composed of the us , russia , france , britain , italy and germany .

" this is a logical consequence of our active policy , " a russian foreign ministry spokesman said , according to interfax .
" we want to lay the foundations for a continuation of the dialogue with the aim of reaching an agreement between pristina and belgrade . " and while serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica hailed the dropped kosovo independence bid as " an important victory in the un security council " for serbia and its traditional ally russia in their attempts to defend " the sovereignty and territorial integrity of serbia , " kosovo ethnic albanian prime minister agim ceku said it would be " better to seek new alternatives " to resolve the future status of the province . the kosovo daily express reported that ceku had proposed to other kosovo albanian politicians to proclaim independence on nov .
28 - the independence day in neighboring albania . " this was initially an idea how to get out of a situation that has been blocked in the security council , " ceku told reporters after meeting the chief un administrator of kosovo joachim rücker .
french envoy calls for fast solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de la sabliere wants a solution sooner rather than later france 's un ambassador to the un jean-marc de la sabliere echoed zalmay khalilzad ’ s comments .
" we regret that it has been impossible to secure such a resolution in the un security council , " sabliere said .
" we will therefore put on hold discussions of a new resolution . "
" we have decided to renew discussions within the contact group and with the parties along these lines , " he added .
" the people of kosovo should be given the opportunity to realize their political and economic development , ” the french envoy continued .
“ we are determined to assist them in that aim in the period ahead . "
" a timely resolving of kosovo 's status will also enable serbia to move beyond the conflicts of the 1990s and toward a brighter european and euro-atlantic future .
we believe that resolving kosovo 's status must be achieved as soon as possible . "
de la sabliere concluded by saying that european union foreign ministers would discuss kosovo at a meeting in brussels on monday .
run by the un bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has been in charge in kosovo for eight years kosovo has been run by the un since 1999 , after a nato bombing campaign helped drive out serb forces carrying out a brutal crackdown on ethnic albanians , who make up 90 percent of the population in the province .
the western compromise draft would have turned over administration of the province from the united nations to the eu while maintaining a nato presence .
russia , however , made it clear it would veto the latest compromise draft introduced to the un security council by belgium , britain , france , germany , italy and the united states .
eu 's solana claims talks will go ahead on tuesday , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said serbia and kosovo were likely to hold new talks on the province 's future even without a un security council resolution , probably under the aegis of the contact group .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice warned on thursday that washington was fully committed to achieving independence for kosovo , despite russia 's opposition .

although approval of a united nations security council resolution on the future status of the territory , remained the main priority , steinmeier said after talks in berlin with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov . shortly after the minister spoke , however , the united states envoy at the un said negotiations at the world body on a draft resolution for kosovo had failed . us ambassador zalmay khalilzad said washington would seek a non-un resolution to the dispute over kosovo 's political future because russia has blocked security council efforts to settle that issue .
" we 'll move outside the security council process and the contact group will take the lead and move forward during the process of negotiations , " he told reporters . russia blocks resolution on kosovo 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khalilzad said the issue would go to the contact group western nations have been trying to push a draft resolution in the un security council to implement key provisions of un mediator martti ahtissari 's plan to grant " supervised independence " to the breakaway albanian-majority serbian province . but they have hurtled into opposition from moscow , belgrade 's key ally , which has repeatedly threatened to veto a security council resolution under discussion . the contact group is composed of the us , russia , france , britain , italy and germany .
in this political body , however , russia has no veto power . russia , serbia welcome the decision later on friday , russia welcomed as " logical " the decision at the united nations in new york to refer the kosovo independence issue to the contact group . " this is a logical consequence of our active policy , " a russian foreign ministry spokesman said , according to interfax .
" we want to lay the foundations for a continuation of the dialogue with the aim of reaching an agreement between pristina and belgrade . " and while serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica hailed the dropped kosovo independence bid as " an important victory in the un security council " for serbia and its traditional ally russia in their attempts to defend " the sovereignty and territorial integrity of serbia , " kosovo ethnic albanian prime minister agim ceku said it would be " better to seek new alternatives " to resolve the future status of the province . the kosovo daily express reported that ceku had proposed to other kosovo albanian politicians to proclaim independence on nov .
28 - the independence day in neighboring albania . " this was initially an idea how to get out of a situation that has been blocked in the security council , " ceku told reporters after meeting the chief un administrator of kosovo joachim rücker .
french envoy calls for fast solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de la sabliere wants a solution sooner rather than later france 's un ambassador to the un jean-marc de la sabliere echoed zalmay khalilzad ’ s comments .
" we regret that it has been impossible to secure such a resolution in the un security council , " sabliere said .
" we will therefore put on hold discussions of a new resolution . "
" we have decided to renew discussions within the contact group and with the parties along these lines , " he added .
" the people of kosovo should be given the opportunity to realize their political and economic development , ” the french envoy continued .
“ we are determined to assist them in that aim in the period ahead . "
" a timely resolving of kosovo 's status will also enable serbia to move beyond the conflicts of the 1990s and toward a brighter european and euro-atlantic future .
we believe that resolving kosovo 's status must be achieved as soon as possible . "
de la sabliere concluded by saying that european union foreign ministers would discuss kosovo at a meeting in brussels on monday .
run by the un bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has been in charge in kosovo for eight years kosovo has been run by the un since 1999 , after a nato bombing campaign helped drive out serb forces carrying out a brutal crackdown on ethnic albanians , who make up 90 percent of the population in the province .
the western compromise draft would have turned over administration of the province from the united nations to the eu while maintaining a nato presence .
russia , however , made it clear it would veto the latest compromise draft introduced to the un security council by belgium , britain , france , germany , italy and the united states .
eu 's solana claims talks will go ahead on tuesday , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said serbia and kosovo were likely to hold new talks on the province 's future even without a un security council resolution , probably under the aegis of the contact group .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice warned on thursday that washington was fully committed to achieving independence for kosovo , despite russia 's opposition .
" we will get there one way or another , " she told journalists on a flight to lisbon , but she did not say whether washington was prepared to unilaterally recognize an independent kosovo . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to his eldest son , retired major general berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg , about the plot and its significance . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , a colonel in hitler 's army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power .
stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's hideaway .
miraculously , the dictator survived the blast and stauffenberg and others involved in the plot were executed . a movie about the events of july 20 , 1944 , is currently being filmed in berlin starring hollywood actor and prominent scientologist tom cruise , and it has stirred controversy .
over the years , some have raised questions about the attack itself , with debate about the motives and the political per suasion of stauffenberg .
dw-world.de talked to his eldest son about the assassination plot and its consequences for the family and germany as a whole .
dw-world.de : you were only 10 years old when your father died .
did you know anything about his oppositional activities ?
what about the rest of your family ?
berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg : i did n't know anything naturally .
everything had to be kept secret .
if children find out about something like that there is always the danger that they 're going to spill the beans .
my mother knew something about it and also approved , but we did n't get wind of any of that .
when did your mother find out what was happening ?
she noticed there was something going on relatively early and brought it up with my father .
i do n't know how much he told her .
she knew that he was going to do something .
what she did n't know was that he was going to plant the bomb himself .
when and how did you find out about attack ?
i heard in the radio that there had been an assassination attempt .
but it was not until the following day that my mother told me and my next-youngest brother that our father had carried it out .
it was a big shock for us .
after this lengthy conversation , she was picked up at night .
we did n't see her again until june ' 45 .
you talked about shock .
were you shocked because this was the first time that you 'd heard your father was dead or the fact that he was involved in the resistance ?
or both ?
both .
people today might not be able to believe it , but death was nothing unusual at that time .
a third of my classmates had lost their fathers and the threat was always there .
you could also be killed in different ways as a result of bombing raids and so on .
it was , of course , the fact that he had committed this act against the head of state .
that did n't fit into our world view .
we asked how he could do something like that to the führer .
our mother told us that he believed that he had to do it for germany .
were you brought up in a way that was typical of the time ? we were not brought up to be out-and-out nazis , but we encountered it in our surroundings .
as i said , my parents did not make critical remarks , but they also did n't express any enthusiasm either .
but there was nazi indoctrination in the school .
how did things proceed after your mother was picked up ?
the family was torn apart .
most of the adults were then sent to concentration camps , including those who were obviously not involved .
under the nazis there was a practice of punishing family members as well as the perpetrator .
my mother and my aunt were , of course , held for questioning for a long time .
we were then taken to a children 's home that had been especially cleared out to take us .
and we stayed there until after the invasion - in this case by the americans .
was your later career shaped by the attack ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg was executed for his act shaped is perhaps not the right expression .
however , it was strongly influenced .
if you have a well-known name and , of course , we had become well-known among those people who were against the attack - some because they were nazis and some because they rejected violence as a matter of principle , and it 's a bit different living under those circumstances than if you can live anonymously .
but it is like that in almost any profession when you go into the same profession as your father .
i did it because i thought i would enjoy it .
not because i wanted to follow in a family tradition , or because of my father .
rather in spite of my father .
are there any misapprehensions about your father that particularly upset you ? well , there is one theory .
it is always said that he was a nazi at the start and that this only changed later .
that sounds good to those people who were themselves nazis .
and i would n't object if that was how things were , but that is not factually correct .
at the start , my father was neither pro- nor anti-nazi .
he just wanted to see how things developed and then judge things for himself .
it may have been that at the time he disagreed with nazi supporters and nazi opponents .
independence was something that he always valued highly .
what do feel is missing from the conventional image of your father ?
of course , i ca n't really judge that properly because i did n't know him well enough .
it does n't serve him well to be made into a superman , or a superstar , as people would say today .
but he also was n't just any ordinary person .
i do believe that he was especially talented .
there have been around seven films , including documentary films on the topic , and now hollywood and tom cruise are tackling the subject .
do you feel that your family history has become public pro per ty ?
my father 's story has quite clearly become public property .
apart from the films that are , on the whole , benevolent , there has also been literature that was deprecatory or base . but your family has , nevertheless , not shut out the public . no , we think that it is not the business of the family to honor my father or not .
it should not interfere there .
that does n't mean we are against it , or that we do n't give our support when we are asked .
but we do n't pursue it actively . what about your comments on tom cruise ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise as stauffenberg : filming began thursday none of us has taken active steps .
i was contacted by the -lsb- daily -rsb- süddeutsche zeitung and asked to give an interview .
i stated my opinion .
in a democracy you should be able to express your opinions , your personal opinion , without intending to make any demands .
i never called for the film to be stopped .
i also never said that tom cruise should n't act the part or that it should n't be permitted .
i said that i did n't like it .
and i think that is legitimate .
over the years the historical reception of the resistance led by your father has changed significantly .
do you think the more recent interpretations get any closer to the truth ?
sixty years is a long time .
there are only few people left alive who were active in the war .
even their children are old people now .
it 's natural that the image that we have should change .
it has shifted from being first-hand experience and has become history .
of course , a lot of mistakes have also crept in .
however things were , the history that we know definitely contains a lot of mistakes that we do n't know about and that we are no longer in a position to recognize .
what is the significance , in your opinion , of the events of july 20 for germany and the world - and for you per sonally ?
i do n't want to draw any lessons for the german people or the whole world .
but perhaps you can say one thing .
if you feel a sense of moral duty then you have to act upon that .
this is n't a political issue .
it also is n't about whether you are a democrat or not .
it 's a question of morality .
if you have the opportunity to do something about it , can you allow a people to be governed by criminals - even if they have been elected by the people ? julie gregson interviewed berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over the years , some have raised questions about the attack itself , with debate about the motives and the political per suasion of stauffenberg .
dw-world.de talked to his eldest son about the assassination plot and its consequences for the family and germany as a whole .
dw-world.de : you were only 10 years old when your father died .
did you know anything about his oppositional activities ?
what about the rest of your family ?
berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg : i did n't know anything naturally .
everything had to be kept secret .
if children find out about something like that there is always the danger that they 're going to spill the beans .
my mother knew something about it and also approved , but we did n't get wind of any of that .
when did your mother find out what was happening ?
she noticed there was something going on relatively early and brought it up with my father .
i do n't know how much he told her .
she knew that he was going to do something .
what she did n't know was that he was going to plant the bomb himself .
when and how did you find out about attack ?
i heard in the radio that there had been an assassination attempt .
but it was not until the following day that my mother told me and my next-youngest brother that our father had carried it out .
it was a big shock for us .
after this lengthy conversation , she was picked up at night .
we did n't see her again until june ' 45 .
you talked about shock .
were you shocked because this was the first time that you 'd heard your father was dead or the fact that he was involved in the resistance ?
or both ?
both .
people today might not be able to believe it , but death was nothing unusual at that time .
a third of my classmates had lost their fathers and the threat was always there .
you could also be killed in different ways as a result of bombing raids and so on .
it was , of course , the fact that he had committed this act against the head of state .
that did n't fit into our world view .
we asked how he could do something like that to the führer .
our mother told us that he believed that he had to do it for germany .
were you brought up in a way that was typical of the time ? we were not brought up to be out-and-out nazis , but we encountered it in our surroundings .
as i said , my parents did not make critical remarks , but they also did n't express any enthusiasm either .
but there was nazi indoctrination in the school .
how did things proceed after your mother was picked up ?
the family was torn apart .
most of the adults were then sent to concentration camps , including those who were obviously not involved .
under the nazis there was a practice of punishing family members as well as the perpetrator .
my mother and my aunt were , of course , held for questioning for a long time .
we were then taken to a children 's home that had been especially cleared out to take us .
and we stayed there until after the invasion - in this case by the americans .
was your later career shaped by the attack ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg was executed for his act shaped is perhaps not the right expression .
however , it was strongly influenced .
if you have a well-known name and , of course , we had become well-known among those people who were against the attack - some because they were nazis and some because they rejected violence as a matter of principle , and it 's a bit different living under those circumstances than if you can live anonymously .
but it is like that in almost any profession when you go into the same profession as your father .
i did it because i thought i would enjoy it .
not because i wanted to follow in a family tradition , or because of my father .
rather in spite of my father .
are there any misapprehensions about your father that particularly upset you ? well , there is one theory .
it is always said that he was a nazi at the start and that this only changed later .
that sounds good to those people who were themselves nazis .
and i would n't object if that was how things were , but that is not factually correct .
at the start , my father was neither pro- nor anti-nazi .
he just wanted to see how things developed and then judge things for himself .
it may have been that at the time he disagreed with nazi supporters and nazi opponents .
independence was something that he always valued highly .
what do feel is missing from the conventional image of your father ?
of course , i ca n't really judge that properly because i did n't know him well enough .
it does n't serve him well to be made into a superman , or a superstar , as people would say today .
but he also was n't just any ordinary person .
i do believe that he was especially talented .
there have been around seven films , including documentary films on the topic , and now hollywood and tom cruise are tackling the subject .
do you feel that your family history has become public pro per ty ?
my father 's story has quite clearly become public property .
apart from the films that are , on the whole , benevolent , there has also been literature that was deprecatory or base . but your family has , nevertheless , not shut out the public . no , we think that it is not the business of the family to honor my father or not .
it should not interfere there .
that does n't mean we are against it , or that we do n't give our support when we are asked .
but we do n't pursue it actively . what about your comments on tom cruise ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise as stauffenberg : filming began thursday none of us has taken active steps .
i was contacted by the -lsb- daily -rsb- süddeutsche zeitung and asked to give an interview .
i stated my opinion .
in a democracy you should be able to express your opinions , your personal opinion , without intending to make any demands .
i never called for the film to be stopped .
i also never said that tom cruise should n't act the part or that it should n't be permitted .
i said that i did n't like it .
and i think that is legitimate .
over the years the historical reception of the resistance led by your father has changed significantly .
do you think the more recent interpretations get any closer to the truth ?
sixty years is a long time .
there are only few people left alive who were active in the war .
even their children are old people now .
it 's natural that the image that we have should change .
it has shifted from being first-hand experience and has become history .
of course , a lot of mistakes have also crept in .
however things were , the history that we know definitely contains a lot of mistakes that we do n't know about and that we are no longer in a position to recognize .
what is the significance , in your opinion , of the events of july 20 for germany and the world - and for you per sonally ?
i do n't want to draw any lessons for the german people or the whole world .
but perhaps you can say one thing .
if you feel a sense of moral duty then you have to act upon that .
this is n't a political issue .
it also is n't about whether you are a democrat or not .
it 's a question of morality .

some talk about a repeat of the east-west conflict .
that 's wrong .
there 's the threat of an adversarial climate , but not of a cold war , says dw-world.de 's ingo mannteufel . relations between russia and the west are getting worse - both in terms of rhetoric and actions - especially since the list of controversial issues seems to get longer every day : the planned us defense missile shield in poland and the czech republic ; the un resolution on kosovo ; actual , alleged or planned russian arms deliveries to syria , iran or venezuela ; the iranian nuclear program ; estonia 's attitude towards soviet memorials ; the investigation of the murder of former intelligence agent and emigrant alexander litvinenko ; and finally russia 's decision to pull out of the conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel in principle , differences of opinion and interests between states are nothing unusual in international politics , and luckily they do n't lead to war most of the time .
when russia , the us and european states are feuding to such an extent , it immediately reminds people of the 40-year cold war that took place in the second half of the last century .
putin 's decision to pull out of the cfe treaty could be considered final proof for this since the 1990 agreement is seen as a symbol of the end of the east-west conflict .
despite this , there wo n't be a new version of the cold war - first and foremost because today 's russia , even as the important global energy supplier that it is , is far from having the political and economic power of a soviet union .
what 's decisive is that the philosophical and ideological undertone is missing in the current dispute between russia and the west .
in the confrontation between world communism and liberal democracy , soviet leaders - from a marxist-leninist viewpoint - saw themselves on the side of history that would end in the victory of the international proletariat in the communist world revolution .
even if people can only laugh about this today , they should n't underestimate this decisive motive for the east-west conflict , as cold war historians have shown in recent years .
it was this opposition of systems that created the impression of a lasting confrontation that engulfed all aspects of life .
neither a functioning liberal democracy nor a market economy governed by rule of law have developed in russia .
but the current russian system is not based on a carefully devised counter-ideology to western democracy .
quite to the contrary : president putin is personally insulted when people do n't see him as a clear-cut democrat or refuse to treat russia on a par with g8 democracies , which are considered the club of global capitalism by many .
the lacking ideological component in the current dispute between russia and the west has yet another consequence : russia has more trouble finding allies in the world as it no longer possesses the global power of attraction of a different political and economical system .
anti-colonial liberation movements in developing countries or anti-american regimes no longer see their own future in the russian role model .
that 's why moscow has lost the opportunity to turn its own disputes with the us and europe into a global confrontation in the sense of the historic cold war .
in the wake of russia 's post-soviet weakness , president putin now thinks the time has come for a new all-encompassing arrangement with the us and europe .
he is aiming for agreements that are more in line with his own interests of a newly strengthened great power russia .
this makes russia 's foreign policy appear aggressive , especially since it is presented in a brusque way .
it 's necessary to be prepared for a new and not completely harmless climate of animosity in relations between russia and the west - at least to the us and a few important european nato states .
but there wo n't be a return to a bipolar world of two different societal systems as in the old east-west conflict .

some talk about a repeat of the east-west conflict .
that 's wrong .
there 's the threat of an adversarial climate , but not of a cold war , says dw-world.de 's ingo mannteufel . relations between russia and the west are getting worse - both in terms of rhetoric and actions - especially since the list of controversial issues seems to get longer every day : the planned us defense missile shield in poland and the czech republic ; the un resolution on kosovo ; actual , alleged or planned russian arms deliveries to syria , iran or venezuela ; the iranian nuclear program ; estonia 's attitude towards soviet memorials ; the investigation of the murder of former intelligence agent and emigrant alexander litvinenko ; and finally russia 's decision to pull out of the conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel in principle , differences of opinion and interests between states are nothing unusual in international politics , and luckily they do n't lead to war most of the time .
when russia , the us and european states are feuding to such an extent , it immediately reminds people of the 40-year cold war that took place in the second half of the last century .
putin 's decision to pull out of the cfe treaty could be considered final proof for this since the 1990 agreement is seen as a symbol of the end of the east-west conflict .
despite this , there wo n't be a new version of the cold war - first and foremost because today 's russia , even as the important global energy supplier that it is , is far from having the political and economic power of a soviet union .
what 's decisive is that the philosophical and ideological undertone is missing in the current dispute between russia and the west .
in the confrontation between world communism and liberal democracy , soviet leaders - from a marxist-leninist viewpoint - saw themselves on the side of history that would end in the victory of the international proletariat in the communist world revolution .
even if people can only laugh about this today , they should n't underestimate this decisive motive for the east-west conflict , as cold war historians have shown in recent years .
it was this opposition of systems that created the impression of a lasting confrontation that engulfed all aspects of life .
neither a functioning liberal democracy nor a market economy governed by rule of law have developed in russia .
but the current russian system is not based on a carefully devised counter-ideology to western democracy .
quite to the contrary : president putin is personally insulted when people do n't see him as a clear-cut democrat or refuse to treat russia on a par with g8 democracies , which are considered the club of global capitalism by many .
the lacking ideological component in the current dispute between russia and the west has yet another consequence : russia has more trouble finding allies in the world as it no longer possesses the global power of attraction of a different political and economical system .
anti-colonial liberation movements in developing countries or anti-american regimes no longer see their own future in the russian role model .
that 's why moscow has lost the opportunity to turn its own disputes with the us and europe into a global confrontation in the sense of the historic cold war .
in the wake of russia 's post-soviet weakness , president putin now thinks the time has come for a new all-encompassing arrangement with the us and europe .
he is aiming for agreements that are more in line with his own interests of a newly strengthened great power russia .
this makes russia 's foreign policy appear aggressive , especially since it is presented in a brusque way .
it 's necessary to be prepared for a new and not completely harmless climate of animosity in relations between russia and the west - at least to the us and a few important european nato states .
but there wo n't be a return to a bipolar world of two different societal systems as in the old east-west conflict .

ten additional nations rotate through the body with two-year terms . many un member countries have accused the security council of no longer representing the international community and called for the council 's reform . " the status quo is not acceptable to an overwhelming majority of the member states , " a un report released in june said .
" there have been years of discussions , without substantial results .
the time has come to bring the process closer to decision-making . " a previous suggestion tabled by the g-4 called for enlarging the council by six permanent and four non-permanent seats , but the proposal did not receive the two-thirds majority necessary in the un general assembly . another group of medium-sized countries , including pakistan and italy , said the council needed to be expanded by 10 non-permanent seats set up for varying terms . german goals unchanged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder had a temporary council seat but wanted more begun by then chancellor gerhard schröder in 2005 , germany 's push for a permanent seat languished after failing to get necessary support from the african union and being openly opposed by china and the united states . matussek 's reform suggestion calls for germany and other nations to be voted onto the security council for a limited 12-year term .
the german envoy added that berlin would only agree to such a deal if it were guaranteed one of the initial interim spots . " we would not agree to any solution which did not hold out this possibility for germany , " matussek told afp , adding that the interim members would then become candidates for permanent status with veto rights on the council .

some talk about a repeat of the east-west conflict .
that 's wrong .
there 's the threat of an adversarial climate , but not of a cold war , says dw-world.de 's ingo mannteufel . relations between russia and the west are getting worse - both in terms of rhetoric and actions - especially since the list of controversial issues seems to get longer every day : the planned us defense missile shield in poland and the czech republic ; the un resolution on kosovo ; actual , alleged or planned russian arms deliveries to syria , iran or venezuela ; the iranian nuclear program ; estonia 's attitude towards soviet memorials ; the investigation of the murder of former intelligence agent and emigrant alexander litvinenko ; and finally russia 's decision to pull out of the conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel in principle , differences of opinion and interests between states are nothing unusual in international politics , and luckily they do n't lead to war most of the time .
when russia , the us and european states are feuding to such an extent , it immediately reminds people of the 40-year cold war that took place in the second half of the last century .
putin 's decision to pull out of the cfe treaty could be considered final proof for this since the 1990 agreement is seen as a symbol of the end of the east-west conflict .
despite this , there wo n't be a new version of the cold war - first and foremost because today 's russia , even as the important global energy supplier that it is , is far from having the political and economic power of a soviet union .
what 's decisive is that the philosophical and ideological undertone is missing in the current dispute between russia and the west .
in the confrontation between world communism and liberal democracy , soviet leaders - from a marxist-leninist viewpoint - saw themselves on the side of history that would end in the victory of the international proletariat in the communist world revolution .
even if people can only laugh about this today , they should n't underestimate this decisive motive for the east-west conflict , as cold war historians have shown in recent years .
it was this opposition of systems that created the impression of a lasting confrontation that engulfed all aspects of life .
neither a functioning liberal democracy nor a market economy governed by rule of law have developed in russia .
but the current russian system is not based on a carefully devised counter-ideology to western democracy .
quite to the contrary : president putin is personally insulted when people do n't see him as a clear-cut democrat or refuse to treat russia on a par with g8 democracies , which are considered the club of global capitalism by many .
the lacking ideological component in the current dispute between russia and the west has yet another consequence : russia has more trouble finding allies in the world as it no longer possesses the global power of attraction of a different political and economical system .
anti-colonial liberation movements in developing countries or anti-american regimes no longer see their own future in the russian role model .
that 's why moscow has lost the opportunity to turn its own disputes with the us and europe into a global confrontation in the sense of the historic cold war .
in the wake of russia 's post-soviet weakness , president putin now thinks the time has come for a new all-encompassing arrangement with the us and europe .
he is aiming for agreements that are more in line with his own interests of a newly strengthened great power russia .
this makes russia 's foreign policy appear aggressive , especially since it is presented in a brusque way .
it 's necessary to be prepared for a new and not completely harmless climate of animosity in relations between russia and the west - at least to the us and a few important european nato states .
but there wo n't be a return to a bipolar world of two different societal systems as in the old east-west conflict .

ten additional nations rotate through the body with two-year terms . many un member countries have accused the security council of no longer representing the international community and called for the council 's reform . " the status quo is not acceptable to an overwhelming majority of the member states , " a un report released in june said .
" there have been years of discussions , without substantial results .
the time has come to bring the process closer to decision-making . " a previous suggestion tabled by the g-4 called for enlarging the council by six permanent and four non-permanent seats , but the proposal did not receive the two-thirds majority necessary in the un general assembly . another group of medium-sized countries , including pakistan and italy , said the council needed to be expanded by 10 non-permanent seats set up for varying terms . german goals unchanged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder had a temporary council seat but wanted more begun by then chancellor gerhard schröder in 2005 , germany 's push for a permanent seat languished after failing to get necessary support from the african union and being openly opposed by china and the united states . matussek 's reform suggestion calls for germany and other nations to be voted onto the security council for a limited 12-year term .
the german envoy added that berlin would only agree to such a deal if it were guaranteed one of the initial interim spots . " we would not agree to any solution which did not hold out this possibility for germany , " matussek told afp , adding that the interim members would then become candidates for permanent status with veto rights on the council .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 20.07.2007 opinion : no cold war sequel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west 's relationship with russia is worsening .
some talk about a repeat of the east-west conflict .
that 's wrong .
there 's the threat of an adversarial climate , but not of a cold war , says dw-world.de 's ingo mannteufel . relations between russia and the west are getting worse - both in terms of rhetoric and actions - especially since the list of controversial issues seems to get longer every day : the planned us defense missile shield in poland and the czech republic ; the un resolution on kosovo ; actual , alleged or planned russian arms deliveries to syria , iran or venezuela ; the iranian nuclear program ; estonia 's attitude towards soviet memorials ; the investigation of the murder of former intelligence agent and emigrant alexander litvinenko ; and finally russia 's decision to pull out of the conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel in principle , differences of opinion and interests between states are nothing unusual in international politics , and luckily they do n't lead to war most of the time .
when russia , the us and european states are feuding to such an extent , it immediately reminds people of the 40-year cold war that took place in the second half of the last century .
putin 's decision to pull out of the cfe treaty could be considered final proof for this since the 1990 agreement is seen as a symbol of the end of the east-west conflict .
despite this , there wo n't be a new version of the cold war - first and foremost because today 's russia , even as the important global energy supplier that it is , is far from having the political and economic power of a soviet union .
what 's decisive is that the philosophical and ideological undertone is missing in the current dispute between russia and the west .
in the confrontation between world communism and liberal democracy , soviet leaders - from a marxist-leninist viewpoint - saw themselves on the side of history that would end in the victory of the international proletariat in the communist world revolution .
even if people can only laugh about this today , they should n't underestimate this decisive motive for the east-west conflict , as cold war historians have shown in recent years .
it was this opposition of systems that created the impression of a lasting confrontation that engulfed all aspects of life .
neither a functioning liberal democracy nor a market economy governed by rule of law have developed in russia .
but the current russian system is not based on a carefully devised counter-ideology to western democracy .
quite to the contrary : president putin is personally insulted when people do n't see him as a clear-cut democrat or refuse to treat russia on a par with g8 democracies , which are considered the club of global capitalism by many .
the lacking ideological component in the current dispute between russia and the west has yet another consequence : russia has more trouble finding allies in the world as it no longer possesses the global power of attraction of a different political and economical system .
anti-colonial liberation movements in developing countries or anti-american regimes no longer see their own future in the russian role model .
that 's why moscow has lost the opportunity to turn its own disputes with the us and europe into a global confrontation in the sense of the historic cold war .
in the wake of russia 's post-soviet weakness , president putin now thinks the time has come for a new all-encompassing arrangement with the us and europe .
he is aiming for agreements that are more in line with his own interests of a newly strengthened great power russia .
this makes russia 's foreign policy appear aggressive , especially since it is presented in a brusque way .
it 's necessary to be prepared for a new and not completely harmless climate of animosity in relations between russia and the west - at least to the us and a few important european nato states .
but there wo n't be a return to a bipolar world of two different societal systems as in the old east-west conflict .

yet in recent years musicians from small european countries have begun rocking festival lineups and winning over fans . most festivalgoers have been partying for a day or two by the time zzz gets its 30-minute shot at fame .
" it 's very compact , " björn ottenheim , zzz 's drummer and singer said about playing such a short set . " it 's like you can make love to a woman all night long or you can also make it quick and dirty , which can also be very beautiful . "
the " wham-bam , thank you ma 'am " of their short festival set is not the only sleazy factor of zzz 's current act .
you can definitely hear the funky porn soundtrack influence and the heady dope and sex atmosphere from the red light district running as a lusty undercurrent in this amsterdam duo 's organ-fueled dance music .
playing to the people who have yet to be introduced to their sound is something zzz are getting used to .
however , they 've been working hard to spread the word this summer as the dutch duo found itself playing to large enthusiastic crowds at major music festivals in great britain , slovenia and belgium .
it 's an on-going mission .
last summer , it was much of the same as they trawled through festivals in italy , france and spain as well as getting booked at popkomm , a festival associated with a large trade show for the music and entertainment industry held in berlin .
it 's not easy being european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn ottenheim , left , and daan schinkel of zzz bands from non-english-speaking european countries have always had to contend with getting a lot less media attention and air time than their american and british counterparts .
" when you do n't come from the us or uk , it 's already pretty hard , " said ottenheim in a phone interview from the dour festival in belgium .
" being from holland , you have to have that extra bit of luck that people take some time to check us out .
and then most of the time they 're stuck immediately when they hear us . "
for many years , festival promoters did n't book european bands because they simply had no way of finding out about them .
but things have been getting better .
the situation began to change for the musical minnows in 2003 , when the european talent exchange program -lrb- etep -rrb- launched an effort to bring together festival promoters and potential talent .
etep-sponsored bands will play 200 shows in festivals this summer , up from 50 in the first year .
until recently , part of the funding came from the european commission .
" we think it 's working very well , " etep founder peter smidt said of the program .
" but it 's definitely not yet the case that a german or a dutch or a french act automatically have access to the european market .

ten additional nations rotate through the body with two-year terms . many un member countries have accused the security council of no longer representing the international community and called for the council 's reform . " the status quo is not acceptable to an overwhelming majority of the member states , " a un report released in june said .
" there have been years of discussions , without substantial results .
the time has come to bring the process closer to decision-making . " a previous suggestion tabled by the g-4 called for enlarging the council by six permanent and four non-permanent seats , but the proposal did not receive the two-thirds majority necessary in the un general assembly . another group of medium-sized countries , including pakistan and italy , said the council needed to be expanded by 10 non-permanent seats set up for varying terms . german goals unchanged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder had a temporary council seat but wanted more begun by then chancellor gerhard schröder in 2005 , germany 's push for a permanent seat languished after failing to get necessary support from the african union and being openly opposed by china and the united states . matussek 's reform suggestion calls for germany and other nations to be voted onto the security council for a limited 12-year term .
the german envoy added that berlin would only agree to such a deal if it were guaranteed one of the initial interim spots . " we would not agree to any solution which did not hold out this possibility for germany , " matussek told afp , adding that the interim members would then become candidates for permanent status with veto rights on the council .

dw-world.de spoke to his eldest son , retired major general berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg , about the plot and its significance . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , a colonel in hitler 's army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power .
stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's hideaway .
miraculously , the dictator survived the blast and stauffenberg and others involved in the plot were executed . a movie about the events of july 20 , 1944 , is currently being filmed in berlin starring hollywood actor and prominent scientologist tom cruise , and it has stirred controversy .
over the years , some have raised questions about the attack itself , with debate about the motives and the political per suasion of stauffenberg .
dw-world.de talked to his eldest son about the assassination plot and its consequences for the family and germany as a whole .
dw-world.de : you were only 10 years old when your father died .
did you know anything about his oppositional activities ?
what about the rest of your family ?
berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg : i did n't know anything naturally .
everything had to be kept secret .
if children find out about something like that there is always the danger that they 're going to spill the beans .
my mother knew something about it and also approved , but we did n't get wind of any of that .
when did your mother find out what was happening ?
she noticed there was something going on relatively early and brought it up with my father .
i do n't know how much he told her .
she knew that he was going to do something .
what she did n't know was that he was going to plant the bomb himself .
when and how did you find out about attack ?
i heard in the radio that there had been an assassination attempt .
but it was not until the following day that my mother told me and my next-youngest brother that our father had carried it out .
it was a big shock for us .
after this lengthy conversation , she was picked up at night .
we did n't see her again until june ' 45 .
you talked about shock .
were you shocked because this was the first time that you 'd heard your father was dead or the fact that he was involved in the resistance ?
or both ?
both .
people today might not be able to believe it , but death was nothing unusual at that time .
a third of my classmates had lost their fathers and the threat was always there .
you could also be killed in different ways as a result of bombing raids and so on .
it was , of course , the fact that he had committed this act against the head of state .
that did n't fit into our world view .
we asked how he could do something like that to the führer .
our mother told us that he believed that he had to do it for germany .
were you brought up in a way that was typical of the time ? we were not brought up to be out-and-out nazis , but we encountered it in our surroundings .
as i said , my parents did not make critical remarks , but they also did n't express any enthusiasm either .
but there was nazi indoctrination in the school .
how did things proceed after your mother was picked up ?
the family was torn apart .
most of the adults were then sent to concentration camps , including those who were obviously not involved .
under the nazis there was a practice of punishing family members as well as the perpetrator .
my mother and my aunt were , of course , held for questioning for a long time .
we were then taken to a children 's home that had been especially cleared out to take us .
and we stayed there until after the invasion - in this case by the americans .
was your later career shaped by the attack ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg was executed for his act shaped is perhaps not the right expression .
however , it was strongly influenced .
if you have a well-known name and , of course , we had become well-known among those people who were against the attack - some because they were nazis and some because they rejected violence as a matter of principle , and it 's a bit different living under those circumstances than if you can live anonymously .
but it is like that in almost any profession when you go into the same profession as your father .
i did it because i thought i would enjoy it .
not because i wanted to follow in a family tradition , or because of my father .
rather in spite of my father .
are there any misapprehensions about your father that particularly upset you ? well , there is one theory .
it is always said that he was a nazi at the start and that this only changed later .
that sounds good to those people who were themselves nazis .
and i would n't object if that was how things were , but that is not factually correct .
at the start , my father was neither pro- nor anti-nazi .
he just wanted to see how things developed and then judge things for himself .
it may have been that at the time he disagreed with nazi supporters and nazi opponents .
independence was something that he always valued highly .
what do feel is missing from the conventional image of your father ?
of course , i ca n't really judge that properly because i did n't know him well enough .
it does n't serve him well to be made into a superman , or a superstar , as people would say today .
but he also was n't just any ordinary person .
i do believe that he was especially talented .
there have been around seven films , including documentary films on the topic , and now hollywood and tom cruise are tackling the subject .
do you feel that your family history has become public pro per ty ?
my father 's story has quite clearly become public property .
apart from the films that are , on the whole , benevolent , there has also been literature that was deprecatory or base . but your family has , nevertheless , not shut out the public . no , we think that it is not the business of the family to honor my father or not .
it should not interfere there .
that does n't mean we are against it , or that we do n't give our support when we are asked .
but we do n't pursue it actively . what about your comments on tom cruise ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise as stauffenberg : filming began thursday none of us has taken active steps .
i was contacted by the -lsb- daily -rsb- süddeutsche zeitung and asked to give an interview .
i stated my opinion .
in a democracy you should be able to express your opinions , your personal opinion , without intending to make any demands .
i never called for the film to be stopped .
i also never said that tom cruise should n't act the part or that it should n't be permitted .
i said that i did n't like it .
and i think that is legitimate .
over the years the historical reception of the resistance led by your father has changed significantly .
do you think the more recent interpretations get any closer to the truth ?
sixty years is a long time .
there are only few people left alive who were active in the war .
even their children are old people now .
it 's natural that the image that we have should change .
it has shifted from being first-hand experience and has become history .
of course , a lot of mistakes have also crept in .
however things were , the history that we know definitely contains a lot of mistakes that we do n't know about and that we are no longer in a position to recognize .
what is the significance , in your opinion , of the events of july 20 for germany and the world - and for you per sonally ?
i do n't want to draw any lessons for the german people or the whole world .
but perhaps you can say one thing .
if you feel a sense of moral duty then you have to act upon that .
this is n't a political issue .
it also is n't about whether you are a democrat or not .
it 's a question of morality .
if you have the opportunity to do something about it , can you allow a people to be governed by criminals - even if they have been elected by the people ? julie gregson interviewed berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to his eldest son , retired major general berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg , about the plot and its significance . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , a colonel in hitler 's army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power .
stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's hideaway .
miraculously , the dictator survived the blast and stauffenberg and others involved in the plot were executed . a movie about the events of july 20 , 1944 , is currently being filmed in berlin starring hollywood actor and prominent scientologist tom cruise , and it has stirred controversy .
over the years , some have raised questions about the attack itself , with debate about the motives and the political per suasion of stauffenberg .
dw-world.de talked to his eldest son about the assassination plot and its consequences for the family and germany as a whole .
dw-world.de : you were only 10 years old when your father died .
did you know anything about his oppositional activities ?
what about the rest of your family ?
berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg : i did n't know anything naturally .
everything had to be kept secret .
if children find out about something like that there is always the danger that they 're going to spill the beans .
my mother knew something about it and also approved , but we did n't get wind of any of that .
when did your mother find out what was happening ?
she noticed there was something going on relatively early and brought it up with my father .
i do n't know how much he told her .
she knew that he was going to do something .
what she did n't know was that he was going to plant the bomb himself .
when and how did you find out about attack ?
i heard in the radio that there had been an assassination attempt .
but it was not until the following day that my mother told me and my next-youngest brother that our father had carried it out .
it was a big shock for us .
after this lengthy conversation , she was picked up at night .
we did n't see her again until june ' 45 .
you talked about shock .
were you shocked because this was the first time that you 'd heard your father was dead or the fact that he was involved in the resistance ?
or both ?
both .
people today might not be able to believe it , but death was nothing unusual at that time .
a third of my classmates had lost their fathers and the threat was always there .
you could also be killed in different ways as a result of bombing raids and so on .
it was , of course , the fact that he had committed this act against the head of state .
that did n't fit into our world view .
we asked how he could do something like that to the führer .
our mother told us that he believed that he had to do it for germany .
were you brought up in a way that was typical of the time ? we were not brought up to be out-and-out nazis , but we encountered it in our surroundings .
as i said , my parents did not make critical remarks , but they also did n't express any enthusiasm either .
but there was nazi indoctrination in the school .
how did things proceed after your mother was picked up ?
the family was torn apart .
most of the adults were then sent to concentration camps , including those who were obviously not involved .
under the nazis there was a practice of punishing family members as well as the perpetrator .
my mother and my aunt were , of course , held for questioning for a long time .
we were then taken to a children 's home that had been especially cleared out to take us .
and we stayed there until after the invasion - in this case by the americans .
was your later career shaped by the attack ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg was executed for his act shaped is perhaps not the right expression .
however , it was strongly influenced .
if you have a well-known name and , of course , we had become well-known among those people who were against the attack - some because they were nazis and some because they rejected violence as a matter of principle , and it 's a bit different living under those circumstances than if you can live anonymously .
but it is like that in almost any profession when you go into the same profession as your father .
i did it because i thought i would enjoy it .
not because i wanted to follow in a family tradition , or because of my father .
rather in spite of my father .
are there any misapprehensions about your father that particularly upset you ? well , there is one theory .
it is always said that he was a nazi at the start and that this only changed later .
that sounds good to those people who were themselves nazis .
and i would n't object if that was how things were , but that is not factually correct .
at the start , my father was neither pro- nor anti-nazi .
he just wanted to see how things developed and then judge things for himself .
it may have been that at the time he disagreed with nazi supporters and nazi opponents .
independence was something that he always valued highly .
what do feel is missing from the conventional image of your father ?
of course , i ca n't really judge that properly because i did n't know him well enough .
it does n't serve him well to be made into a superman , or a superstar , as people would say today .
but he also was n't just any ordinary person .
i do believe that he was especially talented .
there have been around seven films , including documentary films on the topic , and now hollywood and tom cruise are tackling the subject .
do you feel that your family history has become public pro per ty ?
my father 's story has quite clearly become public property .
apart from the films that are , on the whole , benevolent , there has also been literature that was deprecatory or base . but your family has , nevertheless , not shut out the public . no , we think that it is not the business of the family to honor my father or not .
it should not interfere there .
that does n't mean we are against it , or that we do n't give our support when we are asked .
but we do n't pursue it actively . what about your comments on tom cruise ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise as stauffenberg : filming began thursday none of us has taken active steps .
i was contacted by the -lsb- daily -rsb- süddeutsche zeitung and asked to give an interview .
i stated my opinion .
in a democracy you should be able to express your opinions , your personal opinion , without intending to make any demands .
i never called for the film to be stopped .
i also never said that tom cruise should n't act the part or that it should n't be permitted .
i said that i did n't like it .
and i think that is legitimate .
over the years the historical reception of the resistance led by your father has changed significantly .
do you think the more recent interpretations get any closer to the truth ?
sixty years is a long time .
there are only few people left alive who were active in the war .
even their children are old people now .
it 's natural that the image that we have should change .
it has shifted from being first-hand experience and has become history .
of course , a lot of mistakes have also crept in .
however things were , the history that we know definitely contains a lot of mistakes that we do n't know about and that we are no longer in a position to recognize .
what is the significance , in your opinion , of the events of july 20 for germany and the world - and for you per sonally ?
i do n't want to draw any lessons for the german people or the whole world .
but perhaps you can say one thing .
if you feel a sense of moral duty then you have to act upon that .
this is n't a political issue .
it also is n't about whether you are a democrat or not .
it 's a question of morality .
if you have the opportunity to do something about it , can you allow a people to be governed by criminals - even if they have been elected by the people ? julie gregson interviewed berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 20.07.2007 european music rocks the summer festival scene großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people do n't care if it 's the red hot chili peppers or an unsigned icelandic yodeler us and british bands usually steal the headlines at europe 's most important summer music festivals .
yet in recent years musicians from small european countries have begun rocking festival lineups and winning over fans . most festivalgoers have been partying for a day or two by the time zzz gets its 30-minute shot at fame .
" it 's very compact , " björn ottenheim , zzz 's drummer and singer said about playing such a short set . " it 's like you can make love to a woman all night long or you can also make it quick and dirty , which can also be very beautiful . "
the " wham-bam , thank you ma 'am " of their short festival set is not the only sleazy factor of zzz 's current act .
you can definitely hear the funky porn soundtrack influence and the heady dope and sex atmosphere from the red light district running as a lusty undercurrent in this amsterdam duo 's organ-fueled dance music .
playing to the people who have yet to be introduced to their sound is something zzz are getting used to .
however , they 've been working hard to spread the word this summer as the dutch duo found itself playing to large enthusiastic crowds at major music festivals in great britain , slovenia and belgium .
it 's an on-going mission .
last summer , it was much of the same as they trawled through festivals in italy , france and spain as well as getting booked at popkomm , a festival associated with a large trade show for the music and entertainment industry held in berlin .
it 's not easy being european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn ottenheim , left , and daan schinkel of zzz bands from non-english-speaking european countries have always had to contend with getting a lot less media attention and air time than their american and british counterparts .
" when you do n't come from the us or uk , it 's already pretty hard , " said ottenheim in a phone interview from the dour festival in belgium .
" being from holland , you have to have that extra bit of luck that people take some time to check us out .
and then most of the time they 're stuck immediately when they hear us . "
for many years , festival promoters did n't book european bands because they simply had no way of finding out about them .
but things have been getting better .
the situation began to change for the musical minnows in 2003 , when the european talent exchange program -lrb- etep -rrb- launched an effort to bring together festival promoters and potential talent .
etep-sponsored bands will play 200 shows in festivals this summer , up from 50 in the first year .
until recently , part of the funding came from the european commission .
" we think it 's working very well , " etep founder peter smidt said of the program .
" but it 's definitely not yet the case that a german or a dutch or a french act automatically have access to the european market .
it 's still very difficult . "
summer soundtrack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festivals dot europe 's summer landscape summer music festivals are big business in europe . about 144,000 alternative music fans showed up for the four-day dour festival .
" we love playing festivals of this caliber , " ottenheim said of the dour festival .
" to have a whole tent of people freaking out on my music is a pretty immense feeling .
it 's rewarding and it 's very sexy . "
with record sales stagnating , the summer festivals have become an essential way for bands to get exposure outside their home countries , said christof huber , of the swiss-based european festival association yourope .
" i think the people want to explore new bands .
if the quality of the live act is there , bands from europe can be headliners right now , " huber said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many festivals are multi-day events while most bands sing in english regardless of where they are from , some have had success singing in their native language .
the german band wir sind helden -lrb- we are heroes -rrb- have been selling out shows across europe , as have norwegian outfit kaizers orchestra .
icelandic trance-rockers sigur ros are also a big draw on the european circuit despite the fact that most people do n't have a clue what they 're singing about .
the diversity and quality of european bands is at an all-time high , smidt believes .
" that 's the nice thing about european culture , that it has this diversity and it 's not like one sound , " he said . big in japan bands from small european countries like the netherlands " need to go abroad to survive , " smidt said . which explains zzz 's relentless touring , which has included stops in places as diverse as japan and the south by southwest music event in austin , texas - considered to be a must for any band wanting to break into the us market .
ottenheim and bandmate daan schinkel will head back to britain in august to play the summer sundae weekender festival .
despite the odds , zzz has every intention of making it big in the music business , ottenheim said .
that 's a bold statement .
it 's been 33 years since the dutch band golden earring showed up on us charts with its hit " radar love . "
" i would n't mind kicking it even further than golden earring , " ottenheim said .
" we 're doing pretty good in japan .
we 're just working as hard as we can on the music we make and the shows we do . " trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the project , which lists 22 partner organizations , companies and universities on its web site , aims to create a multimedia search engine , a set of tools for translating text and identifying and indexing images , sound and text .
" theseus will make it possible for all internet users to have easy access to global knowledge , " siemens ' vice president of corporate technology hartmut raffler said in a statement .
" the technology theseus will develop will generate new knowledge from knowledge . "
subsidies flow to large corporations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants theseus to be with google among the world 's top internet technologies the companies and institutes involved in the research will also provide an additional 90 million euros .
the government aid will be initially paid to large companies , including sap , siemens and deutsche thompson , as " icebreakers " to later allow smaller businesses to expand on early ideas .
" new forms of acquiring , searching for and evaluating internet-based information have are of strategic importance for the german government , " economics minister michael glos said in a statement .
" with theseus we want to improve germany and europe 's ability to compete and reach a top position in it and communications technology . "
named after a character in greek mythology who uses thread to navigate king minos ' maze , the theseus project was born out of quaero , a joint french-german internet search initiative that then french president jacques chirac once called " the answer to the global competitors of google and yahoo . "
but after seeing that quaero 's german and french researchers were working in different directions , the project split in december 2006 , with the french continuing to work on quaero and the germans focused on theseus .
managers from both projects have , however , said they will meet regularly to form synergies when possible . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there have been years of discussions , without substantial results .
the time has come to bring the process closer to decision-making .

the german envoy added that berlin would only agree to such a deal if it were guaranteed one of the initial interim spots . " we would not agree to any solution which did not hold out this possibility for germany , " matussek told afp , adding that the interim members would then become candidates for permanent status with veto rights on the council .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.07.2007 " if you feel a sense of moral duty , you have to act upon it " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg 's family was torn apart following the attack graf von stauffenberg attempted to assassinate hitler 63 years ago on friday .
dw-world.de spoke to his eldest son , retired major general berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg , about the plot and its significance . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , a colonel in hitler 's army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power .
stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's hideaway .
miraculously , the dictator survived the blast and stauffenberg and others involved in the plot were executed . a movie about the events of july 20 , 1944 , is currently being filmed in berlin starring hollywood actor and prominent scientologist tom cruise , and it has stirred controversy .
over the years , some have raised questions about the attack itself , with debate about the motives and the political per suasion of stauffenberg .
dw-world.de talked to his eldest son about the assassination plot and its consequences for the family and germany as a whole .
dw-world.de : you were only 10 years old when your father died .
did you know anything about his oppositional activities ?
what about the rest of your family ?
berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg : i did n't know anything naturally .
everything had to be kept secret .
if children find out about something like that there is always the danger that they 're going to spill the beans .
my mother knew something about it and also approved , but we did n't get wind of any of that .
when did your mother find out what was happening ?
she noticed there was something going on relatively early and brought it up with my father .
i do n't know how much he told her .
she knew that he was going to do something .
what she did n't know was that he was going to plant the bomb himself .
when and how did you find out about attack ?
i heard in the radio that there had been an assassination attempt .
but it was not until the following day that my mother told me and my next-youngest brother that our father had carried it out .
it was a big shock for us .
after this lengthy conversation , she was picked up at night .
we did n't see her again until june ' 45 .
you talked about shock .
were you shocked because this was the first time that you 'd heard your father was dead or the fact that he was involved in the resistance ?
or both ?
both .
people today might not be able to believe it , but death was nothing unusual at that time .
a third of my classmates had lost their fathers and the threat was always there .
you could also be killed in different ways as a result of bombing raids and so on .
it was , of course , the fact that he had committed this act against the head of state .
that did n't fit into our world view .
we asked how he could do something like that to the führer .
our mother told us that he believed that he had to do it for germany .
were you brought up in a way that was typical of the time ? we were not brought up to be out-and-out nazis , but we encountered it in our surroundings .
as i said , my parents did not make critical remarks , but they also did n't express any enthusiasm either .
but there was nazi indoctrination in the school .
how did things proceed after your mother was picked up ?
the family was torn apart .
most of the adults were then sent to concentration camps , including those who were obviously not involved .
under the nazis there was a practice of punishing family members as well as the perpetrator .
my mother and my aunt were , of course , held for questioning for a long time .
we were then taken to a children 's home that had been especially cleared out to take us .
and we stayed there until after the invasion - in this case by the americans .
was your later career shaped by the attack ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg was executed for his act shaped is perhaps not the right expression .
however , it was strongly influenced .
if you have a well-known name and , of course , we had become well-known among those people who were against the attack - some because they were nazis and some because they rejected violence as a matter of principle , and it 's a bit different living under those circumstances than if you can live anonymously .
but it is like that in almost any profession when you go into the same profession as your father .
i did it because i thought i would enjoy it .
not because i wanted to follow in a family tradition , or because of my father .
rather in spite of my father .
are there any misapprehensions about your father that particularly upset you ? well , there is one theory .
it is always said that he was a nazi at the start and that this only changed later .
that sounds good to those people who were themselves nazis .
and i would n't object if that was how things were , but that is not factually correct .
at the start , my father was neither pro- nor anti-nazi .
he just wanted to see how things developed and then judge things for himself .
it may have been that at the time he disagreed with nazi supporters and nazi opponents .
independence was something that he always valued highly .
what do feel is missing from the conventional image of your father ?
of course , i ca n't really judge that properly because i did n't know him well enough .
it does n't serve him well to be made into a superman , or a superstar , as people would say today .
but he also was n't just any ordinary person .
i do believe that he was especially talented .
there have been around seven films , including documentary films on the topic , and now hollywood and tom cruise are tackling the subject .
do you feel that your family history has become public pro per ty ?
my father 's story has quite clearly become public property .
apart from the films that are , on the whole , benevolent , there has also been literature that was deprecatory or base . but your family has , nevertheless , not shut out the public . no , we think that it is not the business of the family to honor my father or not .
it should not interfere there .
that does n't mean we are against it , or that we do n't give our support when we are asked .
but we do n't pursue it actively . what about your comments on tom cruise ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise as stauffenberg : filming began thursday none of us has taken active steps .
i was contacted by the -lsb- daily -rsb- süddeutsche zeitung and asked to give an interview .
i stated my opinion .
in a democracy you should be able to express your opinions , your personal opinion , without intending to make any demands .
i never called for the film to be stopped .
i also never said that tom cruise should n't act the part or that it should n't be permitted .
i said that i did n't like it .
and i think that is legitimate .
over the years the historical reception of the resistance led by your father has changed significantly .
do you think the more recent interpretations get any closer to the truth ?
sixty years is a long time .
there are only few people left alive who were active in the war .
even their children are old people now .
it 's natural that the image that we have should change .
it has shifted from being first-hand experience and has become history .
of course , a lot of mistakes have also crept in .
however things were , the history that we know definitely contains a lot of mistakes that we do n't know about and that we are no longer in a position to recognize .
what is the significance , in your opinion , of the events of july 20 for germany and the world - and for you per sonally ?
i do n't want to draw any lessons for the german people or the whole world .
but perhaps you can say one thing .
if you feel a sense of moral duty then you have to act upon that .
this is n't a political issue .
it also is n't about whether you are a democrat or not .
it 's a question of morality .
if you have the opportunity to do something about it , can you allow a people to be governed by criminals - even if they have been elected by the people ? julie gregson interviewed berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
it was proved half right .
blocked by a russian veto threat , supporters of a un plan to grant independence to the serb province of kosovo ended their bid in the security council on friday . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called on friday for serbia and the political leaders of kosovo to be included in talks on the future of the breakaway serb republic .
although approval of a united nations security council resolution on the future status of the territory , remained the main priority , steinmeier said after talks in berlin with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov . shortly after the minister spoke , however , the united states envoy at the un said negotiations at the world body on a draft resolution for kosovo had failed . us ambassador zalmay khalilzad said washington would seek a non-un resolution to the dispute over kosovo 's political future because russia has blocked security council efforts to settle that issue .
" we 'll move outside the security council process and the contact group will take the lead and move forward during the process of negotiations , " he told reporters . russia blocks resolution on kosovo 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khalilzad said the issue would go to the contact group western nations have been trying to push a draft resolution in the un security council to implement key provisions of un mediator martti ahtissari 's plan to grant " supervised independence " to the breakaway albanian-majority serbian province . but they have hurtled into opposition from moscow , belgrade 's key ally , which has repeatedly threatened to veto a security council resolution under discussion . the contact group is composed of the us , russia , france , britain , italy and germany .
in this political body , however , russia has no veto power . russia , serbia welcome the decision later on friday , russia welcomed as " logical " the decision at the united nations in new york to refer the kosovo independence issue to the contact group . " this is a logical consequence of our active policy , " a russian foreign ministry spokesman said , according to interfax .
" we want to lay the foundations for a continuation of the dialogue with the aim of reaching an agreement between pristina and belgrade . " and while serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica hailed the dropped kosovo independence bid as " an important victory in the un security council " for serbia and its traditional ally russia in their attempts to defend " the sovereignty and territorial integrity of serbia , " kosovo ethnic albanian prime minister agim ceku said it would be " better to seek new alternatives " to resolve the future status of the province . the kosovo daily express reported that ceku had proposed to other kosovo albanian politicians to proclaim independence on nov .
28 - the independence day in neighboring albania . " this was initially an idea how to get out of a situation that has been blocked in the security council , " ceku told reporters after meeting the chief un administrator of kosovo joachim rücker .
french envoy calls for fast solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de la sabliere wants a solution sooner rather than later france 's un ambassador to the un jean-marc de la sabliere echoed zalmay khalilzad ’ s comments .
" we regret that it has been impossible to secure such a resolution in the un security council , " sabliere said .
" we will therefore put on hold discussions of a new resolution . "
" we have decided to renew discussions within the contact group and with the parties along these lines , " he added .
" the people of kosovo should be given the opportunity to realize their political and economic development , ” the french envoy continued .
“ we are determined to assist them in that aim in the period ahead . "
" a timely resolving of kosovo 's status will also enable serbia to move beyond the conflicts of the 1990s and toward a brighter european and euro-atlantic future .
we believe that resolving kosovo 's status must be achieved as soon as possible . "
de la sabliere concluded by saying that european union foreign ministers would discuss kosovo at a meeting in brussels on monday .
run by the un bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has been in charge in kosovo for eight years kosovo has been run by the un since 1999 , after a nato bombing campaign helped drive out serb forces carrying out a brutal crackdown on ethnic albanians , who make up 90 percent of the population in the province .
the western compromise draft would have turned over administration of the province from the united nations to the eu while maintaining a nato presence .
russia , however , made it clear it would veto the latest compromise draft introduced to the un security council by belgium , britain , france , germany , italy and the united states .
eu 's solana claims talks will go ahead on tuesday , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said serbia and kosovo were likely to hold new talks on the province 's future even without a un security council resolution , probably under the aegis of the contact group .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice warned on thursday that washington was fully committed to achieving independence for kosovo , despite russia 's opposition .

the new harry potter book comes out in english in germany on saturday and german fans will not be waiting for the translated version . while there has been some discussion about doing away with what some conservatives call " unnecessary " usage of the english language in germany , the germans have not gone as far as the french in making a stand to protect their mother tongue .

such is the demand for the seventh and final book in the phenomenally successful harry potter series that german fans are laying in wait to snap up the first run of the english publication despite some readers having only a limited understanding of the language in its written in .

such is the demand for the seventh and final book in the phenomenally successful harry potter series that german fans are laying in wait to snap up the first run of the english publication despite some readers having only a limited understanding of the language in its written in .
the expectation over how the boy wizard 's story comes to its conclusion is so intense that potter nuts across germany are refusing to wait the three months until the german translation is released .
" anyone with a reasonable command of english does n't want to wait until oct .
27 when the german version is due to appear , " heinrich riethmüller , manager of the osiander chain of book stores , told reporters .
fans waiting for the witching hour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will grab a copy regardless of their english skills online orders of the english version of " harry potter and the deathly hallows " have passed the 170,000 mark in germany while many thousands of fans are preparing for a night on the streets waiting for the bookshops to open as the chimes strike twelve .
some stores are even throwing special midnight harry potter parties for those fans who plan to storm the shelves once the clock passes the witching hour .
literary observers believe that the popularity in germany of the harry potter books in their original language has much to do with the fact that many fans have grown up with the series , reading each book as it came out and improving their english along the way .
sixth book made history in germany the first real sign of the clamor for harry , ron , hermione and friends in english came with the release of the " half-blood prince . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : j.k. rowling 's sixth book broke records in germany the sixth book became the first english-language book ever to make it into the german best-seller list .
" the seventh book will do even better , " said riethmüller .
" it 's bound to enter the best-seller list . "
dealers estimate that total sales of " harry potter and the deathly hallows " will top the three-million mark in germany .
the defenders of the german language may be rubbing their hands over the fact that j.k. rowling has now completed her odyssey .
they may now feel free to slowly squeeze the english language out of germany without magical reprisals .
but time will tell .
harry 's story may have come to an end but it is unlikely the spell of reading in english will be broken for a generation who followed his adventures in a foreign tongue . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
it was proved half right .
blocked by a russian veto threat , supporters of a un plan to grant independence to the serb province of kosovo ended their bid in the security council on friday . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called on friday for serbia and the political leaders of kosovo to be included in talks on the future of the breakaway serb republic .
although approval of a united nations security council resolution on the future status of the territory , remained the main priority , steinmeier said after talks in berlin with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov . shortly after the minister spoke , however , the united states envoy at the un said negotiations at the world body on a draft resolution for kosovo had failed . us ambassador zalmay khalilzad said washington would seek a non-un resolution to the dispute over kosovo 's political future because russia has blocked security council efforts to settle that issue .
" we 'll move outside the security council process and the contact group will take the lead and move forward during the process of negotiations , " he told reporters . russia blocks resolution on kosovo 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khalilzad said the issue would go to the contact group western nations have been trying to push a draft resolution in the un security council to implement key provisions of un mediator martti ahtissari 's plan to grant " supervised independence " to the breakaway albanian-majority serbian province . but they have hurtled into opposition from moscow , belgrade 's key ally , which has repeatedly threatened to veto a security council resolution under discussion . the contact group is composed of the us , russia , france , britain , italy and germany .
in this political body , however , russia has no veto power . russia , serbia welcome the decision later on friday , russia welcomed as " logical " the decision at the united nations in new york to refer the kosovo independence issue to the contact group . " this is a logical consequence of our active policy , " a russian foreign ministry spokesman said , according to interfax .
" we want to lay the foundations for a continuation of the dialogue with the aim of reaching an agreement between pristina and belgrade . " and while serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica hailed the dropped kosovo independence bid as " an important victory in the un security council " for serbia and its traditional ally russia in their attempts to defend " the sovereignty and territorial integrity of serbia , " kosovo ethnic albanian prime minister agim ceku said it would be " better to seek new alternatives " to resolve the future status of the province . the kosovo daily express reported that ceku had proposed to other kosovo albanian politicians to proclaim independence on nov .
28 - the independence day in neighboring albania . " this was initially an idea how to get out of a situation that has been blocked in the security council , " ceku told reporters after meeting the chief un administrator of kosovo joachim rücker .
french envoy calls for fast solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de la sabliere wants a solution sooner rather than later france 's un ambassador to the un jean-marc de la sabliere echoed zalmay khalilzad ’ s comments .
" we regret that it has been impossible to secure such a resolution in the un security council , " sabliere said .
" we will therefore put on hold discussions of a new resolution . "
" we have decided to renew discussions within the contact group and with the parties along these lines , " he added .
" the people of kosovo should be given the opportunity to realize their political and economic development , ” the french envoy continued .
“ we are determined to assist them in that aim in the period ahead . "
" a timely resolving of kosovo 's status will also enable serbia to move beyond the conflicts of the 1990s and toward a brighter european and euro-atlantic future .
we believe that resolving kosovo 's status must be achieved as soon as possible . "
de la sabliere concluded by saying that european union foreign ministers would discuss kosovo at a meeting in brussels on monday .
run by the un bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has been in charge in kosovo for eight years kosovo has been run by the un since 1999 , after a nato bombing campaign helped drive out serb forces carrying out a brutal crackdown on ethnic albanians , who make up 90 percent of the population in the province .
the western compromise draft would have turned over administration of the province from the united nations to the eu while maintaining a nato presence .
russia , however , made it clear it would veto the latest compromise draft introduced to the un security council by belgium , britain , france , germany , italy and the united states .
eu 's solana claims talks will go ahead on tuesday , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said serbia and kosovo were likely to hold new talks on the province 's future even without a un security council resolution , probably under the aegis of the contact group .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice warned on thursday that washington was fully committed to achieving independence for kosovo , despite russia 's opposition .

dw-world.de spoke to his eldest son , retired major general berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg , about the plot and its significance . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , a colonel in hitler 's army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power .
stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's hideaway .
miraculously , the dictator survived the blast and stauffenberg and others involved in the plot were executed . a movie about the events of july 20 , 1944 , is currently being filmed in berlin starring hollywood actor and prominent scientologist tom cruise , and it has stirred controversy .
over the years , some have raised questions about the attack itself , with debate about the motives and the political per suasion of stauffenberg .
dw-world.de talked to his eldest son about the assassination plot and its consequences for the family and germany as a whole .
dw-world.de : you were only 10 years old when your father died .
did you know anything about his oppositional activities ?
what about the rest of your family ?
berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg : i did n't know anything naturally .
everything had to be kept secret .
if children find out about something like that there is always the danger that they 're going to spill the beans .
my mother knew something about it and also approved , but we did n't get wind of any of that .
when did your mother find out what was happening ?
she noticed there was something going on relatively early and brought it up with my father .
i do n't know how much he told her .
she knew that he was going to do something .
what she did n't know was that he was going to plant the bomb himself .
when and how did you find out about attack ?
i heard in the radio that there had been an assassination attempt .
but it was not until the following day that my mother told me and my next-youngest brother that our father had carried it out .
it was a big shock for us .
after this lengthy conversation , she was picked up at night .
we did n't see her again until june ' 45 .
you talked about shock .
were you shocked because this was the first time that you 'd heard your father was dead or the fact that he was involved in the resistance ?
or both ?
both .
people today might not be able to believe it , but death was nothing unusual at that time .
a third of my classmates had lost their fathers and the threat was always there .
you could also be killed in different ways as a result of bombing raids and so on .
it was , of course , the fact that he had committed this act against the head of state .
that did n't fit into our world view .
we asked how he could do something like that to the führer .
our mother told us that he believed that he had to do it for germany .
were you brought up in a way that was typical of the time ? we were not brought up to be out-and-out nazis , but we encountered it in our surroundings .
as i said , my parents did not make critical remarks , but they also did n't express any enthusiasm either .
but there was nazi indoctrination in the school .
how did things proceed after your mother was picked up ?
the family was torn apart .
most of the adults were then sent to concentration camps , including those who were obviously not involved .
under the nazis there was a practice of punishing family members as well as the perpetrator .
my mother and my aunt were , of course , held for questioning for a long time .
we were then taken to a children 's home that had been especially cleared out to take us .
and we stayed there until after the invasion - in this case by the americans .
was your later career shaped by the attack ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg was executed for his act shaped is perhaps not the right expression .
however , it was strongly influenced .
if you have a well-known name and , of course , we had become well-known among those people who were against the attack - some because they were nazis and some because they rejected violence as a matter of principle , and it 's a bit different living under those circumstances than if you can live anonymously .
but it is like that in almost any profession when you go into the same profession as your father .
i did it because i thought i would enjoy it .
not because i wanted to follow in a family tradition , or because of my father .
rather in spite of my father .
are there any misapprehensions about your father that particularly upset you ? well , there is one theory .
it is always said that he was a nazi at the start and that this only changed later .
that sounds good to those people who were themselves nazis .
and i would n't object if that was how things were , but that is not factually correct .
at the start , my father was neither pro- nor anti-nazi .
he just wanted to see how things developed and then judge things for himself .
it may have been that at the time he disagreed with nazi supporters and nazi opponents .
independence was something that he always valued highly .
what do feel is missing from the conventional image of your father ?
of course , i ca n't really judge that properly because i did n't know him well enough .
it does n't serve him well to be made into a superman , or a superstar , as people would say today .
but he also was n't just any ordinary person .
i do believe that he was especially talented .
there have been around seven films , including documentary films on the topic , and now hollywood and tom cruise are tackling the subject .
do you feel that your family history has become public pro per ty ?
my father 's story has quite clearly become public property .
apart from the films that are , on the whole , benevolent , there has also been literature that was deprecatory or base . but your family has , nevertheless , not shut out the public . no , we think that it is not the business of the family to honor my father or not .
it should not interfere there .
that does n't mean we are against it , or that we do n't give our support when we are asked .
but we do n't pursue it actively . what about your comments on tom cruise ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise as stauffenberg : filming began thursday none of us has taken active steps .
i was contacted by the -lsb- daily -rsb- süddeutsche zeitung and asked to give an interview .
i stated my opinion .
in a democracy you should be able to express your opinions , your personal opinion , without intending to make any demands .
i never called for the film to be stopped .
i also never said that tom cruise should n't act the part or that it should n't be permitted .
i said that i did n't like it .
and i think that is legitimate .
over the years the historical reception of the resistance led by your father has changed significantly .
do you think the more recent interpretations get any closer to the truth ?
sixty years is a long time .
there are only few people left alive who were active in the war .
even their children are old people now .
it 's natural that the image that we have should change .
it has shifted from being first-hand experience and has become history .
of course , a lot of mistakes have also crept in .
however things were , the history that we know definitely contains a lot of mistakes that we do n't know about and that we are no longer in a position to recognize .
what is the significance , in your opinion , of the events of july 20 for germany and the world - and for you per sonally ?
i do n't want to draw any lessons for the german people or the whole world .
but perhaps you can say one thing .
if you feel a sense of moral duty then you have to act upon that .
this is n't a political issue .
it also is n't about whether you are a democrat or not .
it 's a question of morality .
if you have the opportunity to do something about it , can you allow a people to be governed by criminals - even if they have been elected by the people ? julie gregson interviewed berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

blocked by a russian veto threat , supporters of a un plan to grant independence to the serb province of kosovo ended their bid in the security council on friday . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called on friday for serbia and the political leaders of kosovo to be included in talks on the future of the breakaway serb republic .

germany 's foreign ministry friday played down reports that the taliban were behind the abduction of two german engineers and were demanding the withdrawal of all germans from afghanistan in return for their release . spokesman martin jäger referred to " contradictions " between two separate claims that came more than a day after the two civil engineers were abducted on wednesday some 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- south-west of kabul in wardak province . the foreign ministry crisis team working on the case had " taken cognizance " of the reports jäger said . according to reports in germany , the unnamed engineers were working for a kabul-based company when they were seized while traveling with an afghan driver and four police officials . on thursday , the taliban 's purported spokesman , zabeeullah mujahid , said that they were not aware of any foreign nationals seized by their fighters . " i have contacted all our forces in the area but no one knows about it , " mujahid told dpa news service by phone from an undisclosed location . taliban in control ? but another taliban spokesman , yousuf ahmadi , told afp news service that his group had taken control of the germans .
" the taliban have decided to free the german nationals if german troops pull out of afghanistan and all the taliban prisoners in afghan prisons are released , " he said , adding that the germans were " alive and in good health . " the governor of neighboring ghazni province , mirajuddin pathan , also said that the german engineers had " definitely been kidnapped by the taliban . " south koreans abducted ahmadi also said that the taliban had abducted 18 south koreans - three men and 15 women .
the christian evangelical group was traveling through southern afghanistan .
" they are with the taliban now and they are safe and sound , " the taliban said .
" they are under investigation and once the investigation is over , the taliban leading council will make a final decision about their fate . "

some talk about a repeat of the east-west conflict .
that 's wrong .
there 's the threat of an adversarial climate , but not of a cold war , says dw-world.de 's ingo mannteufel . relations between russia and the west are getting worse - both in terms of rhetoric and actions - especially since the list of controversial issues seems to get longer every day : the planned us defense missile shield in poland and the czech republic ; the un resolution on kosovo ; actual , alleged or planned russian arms deliveries to syria , iran or venezuela ; the iranian nuclear program ; estonia 's attitude towards soviet memorials ; the investigation of the murder of former intelligence agent and emigrant alexander litvinenko ; and finally russia 's decision to pull out of the conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel in principle , differences of opinion and interests between states are nothing unusual in international politics , and luckily they do n't lead to war most of the time .
when russia , the us and european states are feuding to such an extent , it immediately reminds people of the 40-year cold war that took place in the second half of the last century .
putin 's decision to pull out of the cfe treaty could be considered final proof for this since the 1990 agreement is seen as a symbol of the end of the east-west conflict .
despite this , there wo n't be a new version of the cold war - first and foremost because today 's russia , even as the important global energy supplier that it is , is far from having the political and economic power of a soviet union .
what 's decisive is that the philosophical and ideological undertone is missing in the current dispute between russia and the west .
in the confrontation between world communism and liberal democracy , soviet leaders - from a marxist-leninist viewpoint - saw themselves on the side of history that would end in the victory of the international proletariat in the communist world revolution .
even if people can only laugh about this today , they should n't underestimate this decisive motive for the east-west conflict , as cold war historians have shown in recent years .
it was this opposition of systems that created the impression of a lasting confrontation that engulfed all aspects of life .
neither a functioning liberal democracy nor a market economy governed by rule of law have developed in russia .
but the current russian system is not based on a carefully devised counter-ideology to western democracy .
quite to the contrary : president putin is personally insulted when people do n't see him as a clear-cut democrat or refuse to treat russia on a par with g8 democracies , which are considered the club of global capitalism by many .
the lacking ideological component in the current dispute between russia and the west has yet another consequence : russia has more trouble finding allies in the world as it no longer possesses the global power of attraction of a different political and economical system .
anti-colonial liberation movements in developing countries or anti-american regimes no longer see their own future in the russian role model .
that 's why moscow has lost the opportunity to turn its own disputes with the us and europe into a global confrontation in the sense of the historic cold war .
in the wake of russia 's post-soviet weakness , president putin now thinks the time has come for a new all-encompassing arrangement with the us and europe .
he is aiming for agreements that are more in line with his own interests of a newly strengthened great power russia .
this makes russia 's foreign policy appear aggressive , especially since it is presented in a brusque way .
it 's necessary to be prepared for a new and not completely harmless climate of animosity in relations between russia and the west - at least to the us and a few important european nato states .
but there wo n't be a return to a bipolar world of two different societal systems as in the old east-west conflict .

in the wake of russia 's post-soviet weakness , president putin now thinks the time has come for a new all-encompassing arrangement with the us and europe .
he is aiming for agreements that are more in line with his own interests of a newly strengthened great power russia .
this makes russia 's foreign policy appear aggressive , especially since it is presented in a brusque way .
it 's necessary to be prepared for a new and not completely harmless climate of animosity in relations between russia and the west - at least to the us and a few important european nato states .
but there wo n't be a return to a bipolar world of two different societal systems as in the old east-west conflict .

ten additional nations rotate through the body with two-year terms . many un member countries have accused the security council of no longer representing the international community and called for the council 's reform . " the status quo is not acceptable to an overwhelming majority of the member states , " a un report released in june said .
" there have been years of discussions , without substantial results .
the time has come to bring the process closer to decision-making . " a previous suggestion tabled by the g-4 called for enlarging the council by six permanent and four non-permanent seats , but the proposal did not receive the two-thirds majority necessary in the un general assembly . another group of medium-sized countries , including pakistan and italy , said the council needed to be expanded by 10 non-permanent seats set up for varying terms . german goals unchanged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder had a temporary council seat but wanted more begun by then chancellor gerhard schröder in 2005 , germany 's push for a permanent seat languished after failing to get necessary support from the african union and being openly opposed by china and the united states . matussek 's reform suggestion calls for germany and other nations to be voted onto the security council for a limited 12-year term .
the german envoy added that berlin would only agree to such a deal if it were guaranteed one of the initial interim spots . " we would not agree to any solution which did not hold out this possibility for germany , " matussek told afp , adding that the interim members would then become candidates for permanent status with veto rights on the council .

yet in recent years musicians from small european countries have begun rocking festival lineups and winning over fans . most festivalgoers have been partying for a day or two by the time zzz gets its 30-minute shot at fame .
" it 's very compact , " björn ottenheim , zzz 's drummer and singer said about playing such a short set . " it 's like you can make love to a woman all night long or you can also make it quick and dirty , which can also be very beautiful . "
the " wham-bam , thank you ma 'am " of their short festival set is not the only sleazy factor of zzz 's current act .
you can definitely hear the funky porn soundtrack influence and the heady dope and sex atmosphere from the red light district running as a lusty undercurrent in this amsterdam duo 's organ-fueled dance music .
playing to the people who have yet to be introduced to their sound is something zzz are getting used to .
however , they 've been working hard to spread the word this summer as the dutch duo found itself playing to large enthusiastic crowds at major music festivals in great britain , slovenia and belgium .
it 's an on-going mission .
last summer , it was much of the same as they trawled through festivals in italy , france and spain as well as getting booked at popkomm , a festival associated with a large trade show for the music and entertainment industry held in berlin .
it 's not easy being european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn ottenheim , left , and daan schinkel of zzz bands from non-english-speaking european countries have always had to contend with getting a lot less media attention and air time than their american and british counterparts .
" when you do n't come from the us or uk , it 's already pretty hard , " said ottenheim in a phone interview from the dour festival in belgium .
" being from holland , you have to have that extra bit of luck that people take some time to check us out .
and then most of the time they 're stuck immediately when they hear us . "
for many years , festival promoters did n't book european bands because they simply had no way of finding out about them .
but things have been getting better .
the situation began to change for the musical minnows in 2003 , when the european talent exchange program -lrb- etep -rrb- launched an effort to bring together festival promoters and potential talent .
etep-sponsored bands will play 200 shows in festivals this summer , up from 50 in the first year .
until recently , part of the funding came from the european commission .
" we think it 's working very well , " etep founder peter smidt said of the program .
" but it 's definitely not yet the case that a german or a dutch or a french act automatically have access to the european market .
it 's still very difficult . "
summer soundtrack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festivals dot europe 's summer landscape summer music festivals are big business in europe . about 144,000 alternative music fans showed up for the four-day dour festival .
" we love playing festivals of this caliber , " ottenheim said of the dour festival .
" to have a whole tent of people freaking out on my music is a pretty immense feeling .
it 's rewarding and it 's very sexy . "
with record sales stagnating , the summer festivals have become an essential way for bands to get exposure outside their home countries , said christof huber , of the swiss-based european festival association yourope .
" i think the people want to explore new bands .
if the quality of the live act is there , bands from europe can be headliners right now , " huber said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many festivals are multi-day events while most bands sing in english regardless of where they are from , some have had success singing in their native language .
the german band wir sind helden -lrb- we are heroes -rrb- have been selling out shows across europe , as have norwegian outfit kaizers orchestra .
icelandic trance-rockers sigur ros are also a big draw on the european circuit despite the fact that most people do n't have a clue what they 're singing about .
the diversity and quality of european bands is at an all-time high , smidt believes .
" that 's the nice thing about european culture , that it has this diversity and it 's not like one sound , " he said . big in japan bands from small european countries like the netherlands " need to go abroad to survive , " smidt said . which explains zzz 's relentless touring , which has included stops in places as diverse as japan and the south by southwest music event in austin , texas - considered to be a must for any band wanting to break into the us market .
ottenheim and bandmate daan schinkel will head back to britain in august to play the summer sundae weekender festival .
despite the odds , zzz has every intention of making it big in the music business , ottenheim said .
that 's a bold statement .
it 's been 33 years since the dutch band golden earring showed up on us charts with its hit " radar love . "
" i would n't mind kicking it even further than golden earring , " ottenheim said .

" it 's very compact , " björn ottenheim , zzz 's drummer and singer said about playing such a short set . " it 's like you can make love to a woman all night long or you can also make it quick and dirty , which can also be very beautiful . "
the " wham-bam , thank you ma 'am " of their short festival set is not the only sleazy factor of zzz 's current act .
you can definitely hear the funky porn soundtrack influence and the heady dope and sex atmosphere from the red light district running as a lusty undercurrent in this amsterdam duo 's organ-fueled dance music .
playing to the people who have yet to be introduced to their sound is something zzz are getting used to .
however , they 've been working hard to spread the word this summer as the dutch duo found itself playing to large enthusiastic crowds at major music festivals in great britain , slovenia and belgium .

the new harry potter book comes out in english in germany on saturday and german fans will not be waiting for the translated version . while there has been some discussion about doing away with what some conservatives call " unnecessary " usage of the english language in germany , the germans have not gone as far as the french in making a stand to protect their mother tongue .
many germans bemoan the fact that a hybrid commonly known as " denglish " has crept into their society , but there has yet to be a concerted effort to establish any german equivalent to france 's protectionist institution , the académie française .
those thinking of pushing for the creation of such an institution and the eventual eradication of anglicisms in germany may yet have their day , but they continue to bide their time - and wisely so .
why ?
because had they managed to beat back the english incursion between the publication of 2005 's " harry potter and the half-blood prince " and the final installment , " the deathly hallows " - the english version of which goes on sale in germany on saturday - they would have been left at the mercy of tens of thousands of would-be wizards and witches calling for their muggle heads .
nothing stands in the way of a potter fix bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're a dedicated bunch these harry potter fans language purists , however , are clever enough to know that turning germany into a land where an english book would be held back for publication until the german one had been launched is simply too premature .
nobody wants to be responsible for wand-waving pandemonium across the nation .
and who would want to be forced to quiver behind barricades and huddle behind locked doors for purely linguistic reasons ?
such is the demand for the seventh and final book in the phenomenally successful harry potter series that german fans are laying in wait to snap up the first run of the english publication despite some readers having only a limited understanding of the language in its written in .
the expectation over how the boy wizard 's story comes to its conclusion is so intense that potter nuts across germany are refusing to wait the three months until the german translation is released .
" anyone with a reasonable command of english does n't want to wait until oct .
27 when the german version is due to appear , " heinrich riethmüller , manager of the osiander chain of book stores , told reporters .
fans waiting for the witching hour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will grab a copy regardless of their english skills online orders of the english version of " harry potter and the deathly hallows " have passed the 170,000 mark in germany while many thousands of fans are preparing for a night on the streets waiting for the bookshops to open as the chimes strike twelve .
some stores are even throwing special midnight harry potter parties for those fans who plan to storm the shelves once the clock passes the witching hour .
literary observers believe that the popularity in germany of the harry potter books in their original language has much to do with the fact that many fans have grown up with the series , reading each book as it came out and improving their english along the way .
sixth book made history in germany the first real sign of the clamor for harry , ron , hermione and friends in english came with the release of the " half-blood prince . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : j.k. rowling 's sixth book broke records in germany the sixth book became the first english-language book ever to make it into the german best-seller list .
" the seventh book will do even better , " said riethmüller .
" it 's bound to enter the best-seller list . "
dealers estimate that total sales of " harry potter and the deathly hallows " will top the three-million mark in germany .
the defenders of the german language may be rubbing their hands over the fact that j.k. rowling has now completed her odyssey .
they may now feel free to slowly squeeze the english language out of germany without magical reprisals .
but time will tell .
harry 's story may have come to an end but it is unlikely the spell of reading in english will be broken for a generation who followed his adventures in a foreign tongue . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new harry potter book comes out in english in germany on saturday and german fans will not be waiting for the translated version . while there has been some discussion about doing away with what some conservatives call " unnecessary " usage of the english language in germany , the germans have not gone as far as the french in making a stand to protect their mother tongue .
many germans bemoan the fact that a hybrid commonly known as " denglish " has crept into their society , but there has yet to be a concerted effort to establish any german equivalent to france 's protectionist institution , the académie française .
those thinking of pushing for the creation of such an institution and the eventual eradication of anglicisms in germany may yet have their day , but they continue to bide their time - and wisely so .
why ?
because had they managed to beat back the english incursion between the publication of 2005 's " harry potter and the half-blood prince " and the final installment , " the deathly hallows " - the english version of which goes on sale in germany on saturday - they would have been left at the mercy of tens of thousands of would-be wizards and witches calling for their muggle heads .
nothing stands in the way of a potter fix bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're a dedicated bunch these harry potter fans language purists , however , are clever enough to know that turning germany into a land where an english book would be held back for publication until the german one had been launched is simply too premature .
nobody wants to be responsible for wand-waving pandemonium across the nation .
and who would want to be forced to quiver behind barricades and huddle behind locked doors for purely linguistic reasons ?
such is the demand for the seventh and final book in the phenomenally successful harry potter series that german fans are laying in wait to snap up the first run of the english publication despite some readers having only a limited understanding of the language in its written in .
the expectation over how the boy wizard 's story comes to its conclusion is so intense that potter nuts across germany are refusing to wait the three months until the german translation is released .

some stores are even throwing special midnight harry potter parties for those fans who plan to storm the shelves once the clock passes the witching hour .
literary observers believe that the popularity in germany of the harry potter books in their original language has much to do with the fact that many fans have grown up with the series , reading each book as it came out and improving their english along the way .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 20.07.2007 european music rocks the summer festival scene großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people do n't care if it 's the red hot chili peppers or an unsigned icelandic yodeler us and british bands usually steal the headlines at europe 's most important summer music festivals .
yet in recent years musicians from small european countries have begun rocking festival lineups and winning over fans . most festivalgoers have been partying for a day or two by the time zzz gets its 30-minute shot at fame .
" it 's very compact , " björn ottenheim , zzz 's drummer and singer said about playing such a short set . " it 's like you can make love to a woman all night long or you can also make it quick and dirty , which can also be very beautiful . "
the " wham-bam , thank you ma 'am " of their short festival set is not the only sleazy factor of zzz 's current act .
you can definitely hear the funky porn soundtrack influence and the heady dope and sex atmosphere from the red light district running as a lusty undercurrent in this amsterdam duo 's organ-fueled dance music .
playing to the people who have yet to be introduced to their sound is something zzz are getting used to .
however , they 've been working hard to spread the word this summer as the dutch duo found itself playing to large enthusiastic crowds at major music festivals in great britain , slovenia and belgium .
it 's an on-going mission .
last summer , it was much of the same as they trawled through festivals in italy , france and spain as well as getting booked at popkomm , a festival associated with a large trade show for the music and entertainment industry held in berlin .
it 's not easy being european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn ottenheim , left , and daan schinkel of zzz bands from non-english-speaking european countries have always had to contend with getting a lot less media attention and air time than their american and british counterparts .
" when you do n't come from the us or uk , it 's already pretty hard , " said ottenheim in a phone interview from the dour festival in belgium .
" being from holland , you have to have that extra bit of luck that people take some time to check us out .
and then most of the time they 're stuck immediately when they hear us . "
for many years , festival promoters did n't book european bands because they simply had no way of finding out about them .
but things have been getting better .
the situation began to change for the musical minnows in 2003 , when the european talent exchange program -lrb- etep -rrb- launched an effort to bring together festival promoters and potential talent .
etep-sponsored bands will play 200 shows in festivals this summer , up from 50 in the first year .
until recently , part of the funding came from the european commission .
" we think it 's working very well , " etep founder peter smidt said of the program .
" but it 's definitely not yet the case that a german or a dutch or a french act automatically have access to the european market .
it 's still very difficult . "
summer soundtrack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festivals dot europe 's summer landscape summer music festivals are big business in europe . about 144,000 alternative music fans showed up for the four-day dour festival .
" we love playing festivals of this caliber , " ottenheim said of the dour festival .
" to have a whole tent of people freaking out on my music is a pretty immense feeling .
it 's rewarding and it 's very sexy . "
with record sales stagnating , the summer festivals have become an essential way for bands to get exposure outside their home countries , said christof huber , of the swiss-based european festival association yourope .
" i think the people want to explore new bands .
if the quality of the live act is there , bands from europe can be headliners right now , " huber said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many festivals are multi-day events while most bands sing in english regardless of where they are from , some have had success singing in their native language .
the german band wir sind helden -lrb- we are heroes -rrb- have been selling out shows across europe , as have norwegian outfit kaizers orchestra .
icelandic trance-rockers sigur ros are also a big draw on the european circuit despite the fact that most people do n't have a clue what they 're singing about .
the diversity and quality of european bands is at an all-time high , smidt believes .
" that 's the nice thing about european culture , that it has this diversity and it 's not like one sound , " he said . big in japan bands from small european countries like the netherlands " need to go abroad to survive , " smidt said . which explains zzz 's relentless touring , which has included stops in places as diverse as japan and the south by southwest music event in austin , texas - considered to be a must for any band wanting to break into the us market .
ottenheim and bandmate daan schinkel will head back to britain in august to play the summer sundae weekender festival .
despite the odds , zzz has every intention of making it big in the music business , ottenheim said .
that 's a bold statement .
it 's been 33 years since the dutch band golden earring showed up on us charts with its hit " radar love . "
" i would n't mind kicking it even further than golden earring , " ottenheim said .
" we 're doing pretty good in japan .
we 're just working as hard as we can on the music we make and the shows we do . " trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 20.07.2007 opinion : no cold war sequel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west 's relationship with russia is worsening .
some talk about a repeat of the east-west conflict .
that 's wrong .
there 's the threat of an adversarial climate , but not of a cold war , says dw-world.de 's ingo mannteufel . relations between russia and the west are getting worse - both in terms of rhetoric and actions - especially since the list of controversial issues seems to get longer every day : the planned us defense missile shield in poland and the czech republic ; the un resolution on kosovo ; actual , alleged or planned russian arms deliveries to syria , iran or venezuela ; the iranian nuclear program ; estonia 's attitude towards soviet memorials ; the investigation of the murder of former intelligence agent and emigrant alexander litvinenko ; and finally russia 's decision to pull out of the conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel in principle , differences of opinion and interests between states are nothing unusual in international politics , and luckily they do n't lead to war most of the time .
when russia , the us and european states are feuding to such an extent , it immediately reminds people of the 40-year cold war that took place in the second half of the last century .
putin 's decision to pull out of the cfe treaty could be considered final proof for this since the 1990 agreement is seen as a symbol of the end of the east-west conflict .
despite this , there wo n't be a new version of the cold war - first and foremost because today 's russia , even as the important global energy supplier that it is , is far from having the political and economic power of a soviet union .
what 's decisive is that the philosophical and ideological undertone is missing in the current dispute between russia and the west .
in the confrontation between world communism and liberal democracy , soviet leaders - from a marxist-leninist viewpoint - saw themselves on the side of history that would end in the victory of the international proletariat in the communist world revolution .
even if people can only laugh about this today , they should n't underestimate this decisive motive for the east-west conflict , as cold war historians have shown in recent years .
it was this opposition of systems that created the impression of a lasting confrontation that engulfed all aspects of life .
neither a functioning liberal democracy nor a market economy governed by rule of law have developed in russia .
but the current russian system is not based on a carefully devised counter-ideology to western democracy .
quite to the contrary : president putin is personally insulted when people do n't see him as a clear-cut democrat or refuse to treat russia on a par with g8 democracies , which are considered the club of global capitalism by many .
the lacking ideological component in the current dispute between russia and the west has yet another consequence : russia has more trouble finding allies in the world as it no longer possesses the global power of attraction of a different political and economical system .
anti-colonial liberation movements in developing countries or anti-american regimes no longer see their own future in the russian role model .
that 's why moscow has lost the opportunity to turn its own disputes with the us and europe into a global confrontation in the sense of the historic cold war .
in the wake of russia 's post-soviet weakness , president putin now thinks the time has come for a new all-encompassing arrangement with the us and europe .
he is aiming for agreements that are more in line with his own interests of a newly strengthened great power russia .
this makes russia 's foreign policy appear aggressive , especially since it is presented in a brusque way .
it 's necessary to be prepared for a new and not completely harmless climate of animosity in relations between russia and the west - at least to the us and a few important european nato states .
but there wo n't be a return to a bipolar world of two different societal systems as in the old east-west conflict .

some talk about a repeat of the east-west conflict .
that 's wrong .
there 's the threat of an adversarial climate , but not of a cold war , says dw-world.de 's ingo mannteufel . relations between russia and the west are getting worse - both in terms of rhetoric and actions - especially since the list of controversial issues seems to get longer every day : the planned us defense missile shield in poland and the czech republic ; the un resolution on kosovo ; actual , alleged or planned russian arms deliveries to syria , iran or venezuela ; the iranian nuclear program ; estonia 's attitude towards soviet memorials ; the investigation of the murder of former intelligence agent and emigrant alexander litvinenko ; and finally russia 's decision to pull out of the conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel in principle , differences of opinion and interests between states are nothing unusual in international politics , and luckily they do n't lead to war most of the time .
when russia , the us and european states are feuding to such an extent , it immediately reminds people of the 40-year cold war that took place in the second half of the last century .
putin 's decision to pull out of the cfe treaty could be considered final proof for this since the 1990 agreement is seen as a symbol of the end of the east-west conflict .
despite this , there wo n't be a new version of the cold war - first and foremost because today 's russia , even as the important global energy supplier that it is , is far from having the political and economic power of a soviet union .
what 's decisive is that the philosophical and ideological undertone is missing in the current dispute between russia and the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 20.07.2007 german fans under the spell of harry potter in english großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are ready to snap up " harry potter and the deathly hallows " in its original form for those purists wanting to protect the german language , turn away now .
the new harry potter book comes out in english in germany on saturday and german fans will not be waiting for the translated version . while there has been some discussion about doing away with what some conservatives call " unnecessary " usage of the english language in germany , the germans have not gone as far as the french in making a stand to protect their mother tongue .
many germans bemoan the fact that a hybrid commonly known as " denglish " has crept into their society , but there has yet to be a concerted effort to establish any german equivalent to france 's protectionist institution , the académie française .
those thinking of pushing for the creation of such an institution and the eventual eradication of anglicisms in germany may yet have their day , but they continue to bide their time - and wisely so .
why ?
because had they managed to beat back the english incursion between the publication of 2005 's " harry potter and the half-blood prince " and the final installment , " the deathly hallows " - the english version of which goes on sale in germany on saturday - they would have been left at the mercy of tens of thousands of would-be wizards and witches calling for their muggle heads .
nothing stands in the way of a potter fix bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're a dedicated bunch these harry potter fans language purists , however , are clever enough to know that turning germany into a land where an english book would be held back for publication until the german one had been launched is simply too premature .
nobody wants to be responsible for wand-waving pandemonium across the nation .
and who would want to be forced to quiver behind barricades and huddle behind locked doors for purely linguistic reasons ?
such is the demand for the seventh and final book in the phenomenally successful harry potter series that german fans are laying in wait to snap up the first run of the english publication despite some readers having only a limited understanding of the language in its written in .
the expectation over how the boy wizard 's story comes to its conclusion is so intense that potter nuts across germany are refusing to wait the three months until the german translation is released .
" anyone with a reasonable command of english does n't want to wait until oct .
27 when the german version is due to appear , " heinrich riethmüller , manager of the osiander chain of book stores , told reporters .
fans waiting for the witching hour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will grab a copy regardless of their english skills online orders of the english version of " harry potter and the deathly hallows " have passed the 170,000 mark in germany while many thousands of fans are preparing for a night on the streets waiting for the bookshops to open as the chimes strike twelve .
some stores are even throwing special midnight harry potter parties for those fans who plan to storm the shelves once the clock passes the witching hour .
literary observers believe that the popularity in germany of the harry potter books in their original language has much to do with the fact that many fans have grown up with the series , reading each book as it came out and improving their english along the way .
sixth book made history in germany the first real sign of the clamor for harry , ron , hermione and friends in english came with the release of the " half-blood prince . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : j.k. rowling 's sixth book broke records in germany the sixth book became the first english-language book ever to make it into the german best-seller list .
" the seventh book will do even better , " said riethmüller .
" it 's bound to enter the best-seller list . "
dealers estimate that total sales of " harry potter and the deathly hallows " will top the three-million mark in germany .
the defenders of the german language may be rubbing their hands over the fact that j.k. rowling has now completed her odyssey .
they may now feel free to slowly squeeze the english language out of germany without magical reprisals .
but time will tell .
harry 's story may have come to an end but it is unlikely the spell of reading in english will be broken for a generation who followed his adventures in a foreign tongue . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.07.2007 " if you feel a sense of moral duty , you have to act upon it " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg 's family was torn apart following the attack graf von stauffenberg attempted to assassinate hitler 63 years ago on friday .
dw-world.de spoke to his eldest son , retired major general berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg , about the plot and its significance . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , a colonel in hitler 's army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power .
stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's hideaway .
miraculously , the dictator survived the blast and stauffenberg and others involved in the plot were executed . a movie about the events of july 20 , 1944 , is currently being filmed in berlin starring hollywood actor and prominent scientologist tom cruise , and it has stirred controversy .
over the years , some have raised questions about the attack itself , with debate about the motives and the political per suasion of stauffenberg .
dw-world.de talked to his eldest son about the assassination plot and its consequences for the family and germany as a whole .
dw-world.de : you were only 10 years old when your father died .
did you know anything about his oppositional activities ?
what about the rest of your family ?
berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg : i did n't know anything naturally .
everything had to be kept secret .
if children find out about something like that there is always the danger that they 're going to spill the beans .
my mother knew something about it and also approved , but we did n't get wind of any of that .
when did your mother find out what was happening ?
she noticed there was something going on relatively early and brought it up with my father .
i do n't know how much he told her .
she knew that he was going to do something .
what she did n't know was that he was going to plant the bomb himself .
when and how did you find out about attack ?
i heard in the radio that there had been an assassination attempt .
but it was not until the following day that my mother told me and my next-youngest brother that our father had carried it out .
it was a big shock for us .
after this lengthy conversation , she was picked up at night .
we did n't see her again until june ' 45 .
you talked about shock .
were you shocked because this was the first time that you 'd heard your father was dead or the fact that he was involved in the resistance ?
or both ?
both .
people today might not be able to believe it , but death was nothing unusual at that time .
a third of my classmates had lost their fathers and the threat was always there .
you could also be killed in different ways as a result of bombing raids and so on .
it was , of course , the fact that he had committed this act against the head of state .
that did n't fit into our world view .
we asked how he could do something like that to the führer .
our mother told us that he believed that he had to do it for germany .
were you brought up in a way that was typical of the time ? we were not brought up to be out-and-out nazis , but we encountered it in our surroundings .
as i said , my parents did not make critical remarks , but they also did n't express any enthusiasm either .
but there was nazi indoctrination in the school .
how did things proceed after your mother was picked up ?
the family was torn apart .
most of the adults were then sent to concentration camps , including those who were obviously not involved .
under the nazis there was a practice of punishing family members as well as the perpetrator .
my mother and my aunt were , of course , held for questioning for a long time .
we were then taken to a children 's home that had been especially cleared out to take us .
and we stayed there until after the invasion - in this case by the americans .
was your later career shaped by the attack ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg was executed for his act shaped is perhaps not the right expression .
however , it was strongly influenced .
if you have a well-known name and , of course , we had become well-known among those people who were against the attack - some because they were nazis and some because they rejected violence as a matter of principle , and it 's a bit different living under those circumstances than if you can live anonymously .
but it is like that in almost any profession when you go into the same profession as your father .
i did it because i thought i would enjoy it .
not because i wanted to follow in a family tradition , or because of my father .
rather in spite of my father .
are there any misapprehensions about your father that particularly upset you ? well , there is one theory .
it is always said that he was a nazi at the start and that this only changed later .
that sounds good to those people who were themselves nazis .
and i would n't object if that was how things were , but that is not factually correct .
at the start , my father was neither pro- nor anti-nazi .
he just wanted to see how things developed and then judge things for himself .
it may have been that at the time he disagreed with nazi supporters and nazi opponents .
independence was something that he always valued highly .
what do feel is missing from the conventional image of your father ?
of course , i ca n't really judge that properly because i did n't know him well enough .
it does n't serve him well to be made into a superman , or a superstar , as people would say today .
but he also was n't just any ordinary person .
i do believe that he was especially talented .
there have been around seven films , including documentary films on the topic , and now hollywood and tom cruise are tackling the subject .
do you feel that your family history has become public pro per ty ?
my father 's story has quite clearly become public property .
apart from the films that are , on the whole , benevolent , there has also been literature that was deprecatory or base . but your family has , nevertheless , not shut out the public . no , we think that it is not the business of the family to honor my father or not .
it should not interfere there .
that does n't mean we are against it , or that we do n't give our support when we are asked .
but we do n't pursue it actively . what about your comments on tom cruise ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise as stauffenberg : filming began thursday none of us has taken active steps .
i was contacted by the -lsb- daily -rsb- süddeutsche zeitung and asked to give an interview .
i stated my opinion .
in a democracy you should be able to express your opinions , your personal opinion , without intending to make any demands .
i never called for the film to be stopped .
i also never said that tom cruise should n't act the part or that it should n't be permitted .
i said that i did n't like it .
and i think that is legitimate .
over the years the historical reception of the resistance led by your father has changed significantly .
do you think the more recent interpretations get any closer to the truth ?
sixty years is a long time .
there are only few people left alive who were active in the war .
even their children are old people now .
it 's natural that the image that we have should change .
it has shifted from being first-hand experience and has become history .
of course , a lot of mistakes have also crept in .
however things were , the history that we know definitely contains a lot of mistakes that we do n't know about and that we are no longer in a position to recognize .
what is the significance , in your opinion , of the events of july 20 for germany and the world - and for you per sonally ?
i do n't want to draw any lessons for the german people or the whole world .
but perhaps you can say one thing .
if you feel a sense of moral duty then you have to act upon that .
this is n't a political issue .
it also is n't about whether you are a democrat or not .
it 's a question of morality .
if you have the opportunity to do something about it , can you allow a people to be governed by criminals - even if they have been elected by the people ? julie gregson interviewed berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power .
stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's hideaway .
miraculously , the dictator survived the blast and stauffenberg and others involved in the plot were executed . a movie about the events of july 20 , 1944 , is currently being filmed in berlin starring hollywood actor and prominent scientologist tom cruise , and it has stirred controversy .
over the years , some have raised questions about the attack itself , with debate about the motives and the political per suasion of stauffenberg .
dw-world.de talked to his eldest son about the assassination plot and its consequences for the family and germany as a whole .
dw-world.de : you were only 10 years old when your father died .
did you know anything about his oppositional activities ?
what about the rest of your family ?
berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg : i did n't know anything naturally .
everything had to be kept secret .
if children find out about something like that there is always the danger that they 're going to spill the beans .
my mother knew something about it and also approved , but we did n't get wind of any of that .
when did your mother find out what was happening ?
she noticed there was something going on relatively early and brought it up with my father .
i do n't know how much he told her .
she knew that he was going to do something .
what she did n't know was that he was going to plant the bomb himself .
when and how did you find out about attack ?
i heard in the radio that there had been an assassination attempt .
but it was not until the following day that my mother told me and my next-youngest brother that our father had carried it out .
it was a big shock for us .
after this lengthy conversation , she was picked up at night .
we did n't see her again until june ' 45 .
you talked about shock .
were you shocked because this was the first time that you 'd heard your father was dead or the fact that he was involved in the resistance ?
or both ?
both .
people today might not be able to believe it , but death was nothing unusual at that time .
a third of my classmates had lost their fathers and the threat was always there .
you could also be killed in different ways as a result of bombing raids and so on .
it was , of course , the fact that he had committed this act against the head of state .
that did n't fit into our world view .
we asked how he could do something like that to the führer .
our mother told us that he believed that he had to do it for germany .
were you brought up in a way that was typical of the time ? we were not brought up to be out-and-out nazis , but we encountered it in our surroundings .
as i said , my parents did not make critical remarks , but they also did n't express any enthusiasm either .
but there was nazi indoctrination in the school .
how did things proceed after your mother was picked up ?
the family was torn apart .
most of the adults were then sent to concentration camps , including those who were obviously not involved .
under the nazis there was a practice of punishing family members as well as the perpetrator .
my mother and my aunt were , of course , held for questioning for a long time .
we were then taken to a children 's home that had been especially cleared out to take us .
and we stayed there until after the invasion - in this case by the americans .
was your later career shaped by the attack ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg was executed for his act shaped is perhaps not the right expression .
however , it was strongly influenced .
if you have a well-known name and , of course , we had become well-known among those people who were against the attack - some because they were nazis and some because they rejected violence as a matter of principle , and it 's a bit different living under those circumstances than if you can live anonymously .
but it is like that in almost any profession when you go into the same profession as your father .
i did it because i thought i would enjoy it .
not because i wanted to follow in a family tradition , or because of my father .
rather in spite of my father .
are there any misapprehensions about your father that particularly upset you ? well , there is one theory .
it is always said that he was a nazi at the start and that this only changed later .
that sounds good to those people who were themselves nazis .
and i would n't object if that was how things were , but that is not factually correct .
at the start , my father was neither pro- nor anti-nazi .
he just wanted to see how things developed and then judge things for himself .
it may have been that at the time he disagreed with nazi supporters and nazi opponents .
independence was something that he always valued highly .
what do feel is missing from the conventional image of your father ?
of course , i ca n't really judge that properly because i did n't know him well enough .
it does n't serve him well to be made into a superman , or a superstar , as people would say today .
but he also was n't just any ordinary person .
i do believe that he was especially talented .
there have been around seven films , including documentary films on the topic , and now hollywood and tom cruise are tackling the subject .
do you feel that your family history has become public pro per ty ?
my father 's story has quite clearly become public property .
apart from the films that are , on the whole , benevolent , there has also been literature that was deprecatory or base . but your family has , nevertheless , not shut out the public . no , we think that it is not the business of the family to honor my father or not .
it should not interfere there .
that does n't mean we are against it , or that we do n't give our support when we are asked .
but we do n't pursue it actively . what about your comments on tom cruise ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise as stauffenberg : filming began thursday none of us has taken active steps .
i was contacted by the -lsb- daily -rsb- süddeutsche zeitung and asked to give an interview .
i stated my opinion .
in a democracy you should be able to express your opinions , your personal opinion , without intending to make any demands .
i never called for the film to be stopped .
i also never said that tom cruise should n't act the part or that it should n't be permitted .
i said that i did n't like it .
and i think that is legitimate .
over the years the historical reception of the resistance led by your father has changed significantly .
do you think the more recent interpretations get any closer to the truth ?
sixty years is a long time .
there are only few people left alive who were active in the war .
even their children are old people now .
it 's natural that the image that we have should change .
it has shifted from being first-hand experience and has become history .
of course , a lot of mistakes have also crept in .
however things were , the history that we know definitely contains a lot of mistakes that we do n't know about and that we are no longer in a position to recognize .
what is the significance , in your opinion , of the events of july 20 for germany and the world - and for you per sonally ?
i do n't want to draw any lessons for the german people or the whole world .
but perhaps you can say one thing .
if you feel a sense of moral duty then you have to act upon that .
this is n't a political issue .
it also is n't about whether you are a democrat or not .
it 's a question of morality .
if you have the opportunity to do something about it , can you allow a people to be governed by criminals - even if they have been elected by the people ? julie gregson interviewed berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

though some economists have said china will only replace germany behind the usa and japan in the list of the world 's largest economies , earlier this week green said that " probably happened a few months ago . " the federation of german industries ' head klaus bräunig also said thursday that if china has n't surpassed germany yet , it will happen by the end of the year - despite the 2.8 percent growth the federation expects to come from germany this year . " in comparison with china we 're a small country , " bräunig said .

" we should see this as a chance to develop a larger sales market for german products , " he told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper , adding that according to his calculations , china would have to wait until at least next year before its gdp is larger than germany 's . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing said it will take steps to keep its economy in balance discrepancies in the calculations are mainly due to varying exchange rates banks and other groups use to calculate an economy 's size .
but rather than looking at their international rank , china should be concerned with its economy overheating , according to several analysts . crash on the horizon ? " it 's stunning , " tim condon , head of asia research at dutch bank ing in singapore told reuters .

" we will continue to strengthen and improve macro-control measures , " li said at a press conference .
" we will continue to enhance the adjustment of the industrial structure to change the growth pattern and to enable the economy to grow healthily and quickly . " china surpassed britain to become the world 's fourth largest economy in 2005 and has been at germany 's heels since .

ten additional nations rotate through the body with two-year terms . many un member countries have accused the security council of no longer representing the international community and called for the council 's reform . " the status quo is not acceptable to an overwhelming majority of the member states , " a un report released in june said .
" there have been years of discussions , without substantial results .
the time has come to bring the process closer to decision-making . " a previous suggestion tabled by the g-4 called for enlarging the council by six permanent and four non-permanent seats , but the proposal did not receive the two-thirds majority necessary in the un general assembly . another group of medium-sized countries , including pakistan and italy , said the council needed to be expanded by 10 non-permanent seats set up for varying terms . german goals unchanged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder had a temporary council seat but wanted more begun by then chancellor gerhard schröder in 2005 , germany 's push for a permanent seat languished after failing to get necessary support from the african union and being openly opposed by china and the united states . matussek 's reform suggestion calls for germany and other nations to be voted onto the security council for a limited 12-year term .
the german envoy added that berlin would only agree to such a deal if it were guaranteed one of the initial interim spots . " we would not agree to any solution which did not hold out this possibility for germany , " matussek told afp , adding that the interim members would then become candidates for permanent status with veto rights on the council .

dw-world.de spoke to his eldest son , retired major general berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg , about the plot and its significance . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , a colonel in hitler 's army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power .
stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's hideaway .
miraculously , the dictator survived the blast and stauffenberg and others involved in the plot were executed . a movie about the events of july 20 , 1944 , is currently being filmed in berlin starring hollywood actor and prominent scientologist tom cruise , and it has stirred controversy .
over the years , some have raised questions about the attack itself , with debate about the motives and the political per suasion of stauffenberg .
dw-world.de talked to his eldest son about the assassination plot and its consequences for the family and germany as a whole .
dw-world.de : you were only 10 years old when your father died .
did you know anything about his oppositional activities ?
what about the rest of your family ?
berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg : i did n't know anything naturally .
everything had to be kept secret .
if children find out about something like that there is always the danger that they 're going to spill the beans .
my mother knew something about it and also approved , but we did n't get wind of any of that .
when did your mother find out what was happening ?
she noticed there was something going on relatively early and brought it up with my father .
i do n't know how much he told her .
she knew that he was going to do something .
what she did n't know was that he was going to plant the bomb himself .
when and how did you find out about attack ?
i heard in the radio that there had been an assassination attempt .
but it was not until the following day that my mother told me and my next-youngest brother that our father had carried it out .
it was a big shock for us .
after this lengthy conversation , she was picked up at night .
we did n't see her again until june ' 45 .
you talked about shock .
were you shocked because this was the first time that you 'd heard your father was dead or the fact that he was involved in the resistance ?
or both ?
both .
people today might not be able to believe it , but death was nothing unusual at that time .
a third of my classmates had lost their fathers and the threat was always there .
you could also be killed in different ways as a result of bombing raids and so on .
it was , of course , the fact that he had committed this act against the head of state .
that did n't fit into our world view .
we asked how he could do something like that to the führer .
our mother told us that he believed that he had to do it for germany .
were you brought up in a way that was typical of the time ? we were not brought up to be out-and-out nazis , but we encountered it in our surroundings .
as i said , my parents did not make critical remarks , but they also did n't express any enthusiasm either .
but there was nazi indoctrination in the school .
how did things proceed after your mother was picked up ?
the family was torn apart .
most of the adults were then sent to concentration camps , including those who were obviously not involved .
under the nazis there was a practice of punishing family members as well as the perpetrator .
my mother and my aunt were , of course , held for questioning for a long time .
we were then taken to a children 's home that had been especially cleared out to take us .
and we stayed there until after the invasion - in this case by the americans .
was your later career shaped by the attack ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg was executed for his act shaped is perhaps not the right expression .
however , it was strongly influenced .
if you have a well-known name and , of course , we had become well-known among those people who were against the attack - some because they were nazis and some because they rejected violence as a matter of principle , and it 's a bit different living under those circumstances than if you can live anonymously .
but it is like that in almost any profession when you go into the same profession as your father .
i did it because i thought i would enjoy it .
not because i wanted to follow in a family tradition , or because of my father .
rather in spite of my father .
are there any misapprehensions about your father that particularly upset you ? well , there is one theory .
it is always said that he was a nazi at the start and that this only changed later .
that sounds good to those people who were themselves nazis .
and i would n't object if that was how things were , but that is not factually correct .
at the start , my father was neither pro- nor anti-nazi .
he just wanted to see how things developed and then judge things for himself .
it may have been that at the time he disagreed with nazi supporters and nazi opponents .
independence was something that he always valued highly .
what do feel is missing from the conventional image of your father ?
of course , i ca n't really judge that properly because i did n't know him well enough .
it does n't serve him well to be made into a superman , or a superstar , as people would say today .
but he also was n't just any ordinary person .
i do believe that he was especially talented .
there have been around seven films , including documentary films on the topic , and now hollywood and tom cruise are tackling the subject .
do you feel that your family history has become public pro per ty ?
my father 's story has quite clearly become public property .
apart from the films that are , on the whole , benevolent , there has also been literature that was deprecatory or base . but your family has , nevertheless , not shut out the public . no , we think that it is not the business of the family to honor my father or not .
it should not interfere there .
that does n't mean we are against it , or that we do n't give our support when we are asked .
but we do n't pursue it actively . what about your comments on tom cruise ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise as stauffenberg : filming began thursday none of us has taken active steps .
i was contacted by the -lsb- daily -rsb- süddeutsche zeitung and asked to give an interview .
i stated my opinion .
in a democracy you should be able to express your opinions , your personal opinion , without intending to make any demands .
i never called for the film to be stopped .
i also never said that tom cruise should n't act the part or that it should n't be permitted .
i said that i did n't like it .
and i think that is legitimate .
over the years the historical reception of the resistance led by your father has changed significantly .
do you think the more recent interpretations get any closer to the truth ?
sixty years is a long time .
there are only few people left alive who were active in the war .
even their children are old people now .
it 's natural that the image that we have should change .
it has shifted from being first-hand experience and has become history .
of course , a lot of mistakes have also crept in .
however things were , the history that we know definitely contains a lot of mistakes that we do n't know about and that we are no longer in a position to recognize .
what is the significance , in your opinion , of the events of july 20 for germany and the world - and for you per sonally ?
i do n't want to draw any lessons for the german people or the whole world .
but perhaps you can say one thing .
if you feel a sense of moral duty then you have to act upon that .
this is n't a political issue .
it also is n't about whether you are a democrat or not .
it 's a question of morality .
if you have the opportunity to do something about it , can you allow a people to be governed by criminals - even if they have been elected by the people ? julie gregson interviewed berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ten additional nations rotate through the body with two-year terms . many un member countries have accused the security council of no longer representing the international community and called for the council 's reform . " the status quo is not acceptable to an overwhelming majority of the member states , " a un report released in june said .
" there have been years of discussions , without substantial results .
the time has come to bring the process closer to decision-making . " a previous suggestion tabled by the g-4 called for enlarging the council by six permanent and four non-permanent seats , but the proposal did not receive the two-thirds majority necessary in the un general assembly . another group of medium-sized countries , including pakistan and italy , said the council needed to be expanded by 10 non-permanent seats set up for varying terms . german goals unchanged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder had a temporary council seat but wanted more begun by then chancellor gerhard schröder in 2005 , germany 's push for a permanent seat languished after failing to get necessary support from the african union and being openly opposed by china and the united states . matussek 's reform suggestion calls for germany and other nations to be voted onto the security council for a limited 12-year term .
the german envoy added that berlin would only agree to such a deal if it were guaranteed one of the initial interim spots . " we would not agree to any solution which did not hold out this possibility for germany , " matussek told afp , adding that the interim members would then become candidates for permanent status with veto rights on the council .

"
it was proved half right .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.07.2007 " if you feel a sense of moral duty , you have to act upon it " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg 's family was torn apart following the attack graf von stauffenberg attempted to assassinate hitler 63 years ago on friday .
dw-world.de spoke to his eldest son , retired major general berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg , about the plot and its significance . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , a colonel in hitler 's army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power .
stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's hideaway .
miraculously , the dictator survived the blast and stauffenberg and others involved in the plot were executed . a movie about the events of july 20 , 1944 , is currently being filmed in berlin starring hollywood actor and prominent scientologist tom cruise , and it has stirred controversy .
over the years , some have raised questions about the attack itself , with debate about the motives and the political per suasion of stauffenberg .
dw-world.de talked to his eldest son about the assassination plot and its consequences for the family and germany as a whole .
dw-world.de : you were only 10 years old when your father died .
did you know anything about his oppositional activities ?
what about the rest of your family ?
berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg : i did n't know anything naturally .
everything had to be kept secret .
if children find out about something like that there is always the danger that they 're going to spill the beans .
my mother knew something about it and also approved , but we did n't get wind of any of that .
when did your mother find out what was happening ?
she noticed there was something going on relatively early and brought it up with my father .
i do n't know how much he told her .
she knew that he was going to do something .
what she did n't know was that he was going to plant the bomb himself .
when and how did you find out about attack ?
i heard in the radio that there had been an assassination attempt .
but it was not until the following day that my mother told me and my next-youngest brother that our father had carried it out .
it was a big shock for us .
after this lengthy conversation , she was picked up at night .
we did n't see her again until june ' 45 .
you talked about shock .
were you shocked because this was the first time that you 'd heard your father was dead or the fact that he was involved in the resistance ?
or both ?
both .
people today might not be able to believe it , but death was nothing unusual at that time .
a third of my classmates had lost their fathers and the threat was always there .
you could also be killed in different ways as a result of bombing raids and so on .
it was , of course , the fact that he had committed this act against the head of state .
that did n't fit into our world view .
we asked how he could do something like that to the führer .
our mother told us that he believed that he had to do it for germany .
were you brought up in a way that was typical of the time ? we were not brought up to be out-and-out nazis , but we encountered it in our surroundings .
as i said , my parents did not make critical remarks , but they also did n't express any enthusiasm either .
but there was nazi indoctrination in the school .
how did things proceed after your mother was picked up ?
the family was torn apart .
most of the adults were then sent to concentration camps , including those who were obviously not involved .
under the nazis there was a practice of punishing family members as well as the perpetrator .
my mother and my aunt were , of course , held for questioning for a long time .
we were then taken to a children 's home that had been especially cleared out to take us .
and we stayed there until after the invasion - in this case by the americans .
was your later career shaped by the attack ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg was executed for his act shaped is perhaps not the right expression .
however , it was strongly influenced .
if you have a well-known name and , of course , we had become well-known among those people who were against the attack - some because they were nazis and some because they rejected violence as a matter of principle , and it 's a bit different living under those circumstances than if you can live anonymously .
but it is like that in almost any profession when you go into the same profession as your father .
i did it because i thought i would enjoy it .
not because i wanted to follow in a family tradition , or because of my father .
rather in spite of my father .
are there any misapprehensions about your father that particularly upset you ? well , there is one theory .
it is always said that he was a nazi at the start and that this only changed later .
that sounds good to those people who were themselves nazis .
and i would n't object if that was how things were , but that is not factually correct .
at the start , my father was neither pro- nor anti-nazi .
he just wanted to see how things developed and then judge things for himself .
it may have been that at the time he disagreed with nazi supporters and nazi opponents .
independence was something that he always valued highly .
what do feel is missing from the conventional image of your father ?
of course , i ca n't really judge that properly because i did n't know him well enough .
it does n't serve him well to be made into a superman , or a superstar , as people would say today .
but he also was n't just any ordinary person .
i do believe that he was especially talented .
there have been around seven films , including documentary films on the topic , and now hollywood and tom cruise are tackling the subject .
do you feel that your family history has become public pro per ty ?
my father 's story has quite clearly become public property .
apart from the films that are , on the whole , benevolent , there has also been literature that was deprecatory or base . but your family has , nevertheless , not shut out the public . no , we think that it is not the business of the family to honor my father or not .
it should not interfere there .
that does n't mean we are against it , or that we do n't give our support when we are asked .
but we do n't pursue it actively . what about your comments on tom cruise ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise as stauffenberg : filming began thursday none of us has taken active steps .
i was contacted by the -lsb- daily -rsb- süddeutsche zeitung and asked to give an interview .
i stated my opinion .
in a democracy you should be able to express your opinions , your personal opinion , without intending to make any demands .
i never called for the film to be stopped .
i also never said that tom cruise should n't act the part or that it should n't be permitted .
i said that i did n't like it .
and i think that is legitimate .
over the years the historical reception of the resistance led by your father has changed significantly .
do you think the more recent interpretations get any closer to the truth ?
sixty years is a long time .
there are only few people left alive who were active in the war .
even their children are old people now .
it 's natural that the image that we have should change .
it has shifted from being first-hand experience and has become history .
of course , a lot of mistakes have also crept in .
however things were , the history that we know definitely contains a lot of mistakes that we do n't know about and that we are no longer in a position to recognize .
what is the significance , in your opinion , of the events of july 20 for germany and the world - and for you per sonally ?
i do n't want to draw any lessons for the german people or the whole world .
but perhaps you can say one thing .
if you feel a sense of moral duty then you have to act upon that .
this is n't a political issue .
it also is n't about whether you are a democrat or not .
it 's a question of morality .
if you have the opportunity to do something about it , can you allow a people to be governed by criminals - even if they have been elected by the people ? julie gregson interviewed berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " wham-bam , thank you ma 'am " of their short festival set is not the only sleazy factor of zzz 's current act .
you can definitely hear the funky porn soundtrack influence and the heady dope and sex atmosphere from the red light district running as a lusty undercurrent in this amsterdam duo 's organ-fueled dance music .

however , they 've been working hard to spread the word this summer as the dutch duo found itself playing to large enthusiastic crowds at major music festivals in great britain , slovenia and belgium .

the new harry potter book comes out in english in germany on saturday and german fans will not be waiting for the translated version . while there has been some discussion about doing away with what some conservatives call " unnecessary " usage of the english language in germany , the germans have not gone as far as the french in making a stand to protect their mother tongue .
many germans bemoan the fact that a hybrid commonly known as " denglish " has crept into their society , but there has yet to be a concerted effort to establish any german equivalent to france 's protectionist institution , the académie française .
those thinking of pushing for the creation of such an institution and the eventual eradication of anglicisms in germany may yet have their day , but they continue to bide their time - and wisely so .
why ?
because had they managed to beat back the english incursion between the publication of 2005 's " harry potter and the half-blood prince " and the final installment , " the deathly hallows " - the english version of which goes on sale in germany on saturday - they would have been left at the mercy of tens of thousands of would-be wizards and witches calling for their muggle heads .

yet in recent years musicians from small european countries have begun rocking festival lineups and winning over fans . most festivalgoers have been partying for a day or two by the time zzz gets its 30-minute shot at fame .
" it 's very compact , " björn ottenheim , zzz 's drummer and singer said about playing such a short set . " it 's like you can make love to a woman all night long or you can also make it quick and dirty , which can also be very beautiful . "
the " wham-bam , thank you ma 'am " of their short festival set is not the only sleazy factor of zzz 's current act .
you can definitely hear the funky porn soundtrack influence and the heady dope and sex atmosphere from the red light district running as a lusty undercurrent in this amsterdam duo 's organ-fueled dance music .
playing to the people who have yet to be introduced to their sound is something zzz are getting used to .
however , they 've been working hard to spread the word this summer as the dutch duo found itself playing to large enthusiastic crowds at major music festivals in great britain , slovenia and belgium .
it 's an on-going mission .
last summer , it was much of the same as they trawled through festivals in italy , france and spain as well as getting booked at popkomm , a festival associated with a large trade show for the music and entertainment industry held in berlin .
it 's not easy being european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn ottenheim , left , and daan schinkel of zzz bands from non-english-speaking european countries have always had to contend with getting a lot less media attention and air time than their american and british counterparts .
" when you do n't come from the us or uk , it 's already pretty hard , " said ottenheim in a phone interview from the dour festival in belgium .
" being from holland , you have to have that extra bit of luck that people take some time to check us out .
and then most of the time they 're stuck immediately when they hear us . "
for many years , festival promoters did n't book european bands because they simply had no way of finding out about them .
but things have been getting better .
the situation began to change for the musical minnows in 2003 , when the european talent exchange program -lrb- etep -rrb- launched an effort to bring together festival promoters and potential talent .
etep-sponsored bands will play 200 shows in festivals this summer , up from 50 in the first year .
until recently , part of the funding came from the european commission .
" we think it 's working very well , " etep founder peter smidt said of the program .
" but it 's definitely not yet the case that a german or a dutch or a french act automatically have access to the european market .
it 's still very difficult . "
summer soundtrack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festivals dot europe 's summer landscape summer music festivals are big business in europe . about 144,000 alternative music fans showed up for the four-day dour festival .
" we love playing festivals of this caliber , " ottenheim said of the dour festival .
" to have a whole tent of people freaking out on my music is a pretty immense feeling .
it 's rewarding and it 's very sexy . "
with record sales stagnating , the summer festivals have become an essential way for bands to get exposure outside their home countries , said christof huber , of the swiss-based european festival association yourope .
" i think the people want to explore new bands .
if the quality of the live act is there , bands from europe can be headliners right now , " huber said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many festivals are multi-day events while most bands sing in english regardless of where they are from , some have had success singing in their native language .
the german band wir sind helden -lrb- we are heroes -rrb- have been selling out shows across europe , as have norwegian outfit kaizers orchestra .
icelandic trance-rockers sigur ros are also a big draw on the european circuit despite the fact that most people do n't have a clue what they 're singing about .
the diversity and quality of european bands is at an all-time high , smidt believes .
" that 's the nice thing about european culture , that it has this diversity and it 's not like one sound , " he said . big in japan bands from small european countries like the netherlands " need to go abroad to survive , " smidt said . which explains zzz 's relentless touring , which has included stops in places as diverse as japan and the south by southwest music event in austin , texas - considered to be a must for any band wanting to break into the us market .
ottenheim and bandmate daan schinkel will head back to britain in august to play the summer sundae weekender festival .
despite the odds , zzz has every intention of making it big in the music business , ottenheim said .
that 's a bold statement .
it 's been 33 years since the dutch band golden earring showed up on us charts with its hit " radar love . "
" i would n't mind kicking it even further than golden earring , " ottenheim said .

" it 's very compact , " björn ottenheim , zzz 's drummer and singer said about playing such a short set . " it 's like you can make love to a woman all night long or you can also make it quick and dirty , which can also be very beautiful . "
the " wham-bam , thank you ma 'am " of their short festival set is not the only sleazy factor of zzz 's current act .
you can definitely hear the funky porn soundtrack influence and the heady dope and sex atmosphere from the red light district running as a lusty undercurrent in this amsterdam duo 's organ-fueled dance music .

germany 's foreign ministry friday played down reports that the taliban were behind the abduction of two german engineers and were demanding the withdrawal of all germans from afghanistan in return for their release . spokesman martin jäger referred to " contradictions " between two separate claims that came more than a day after the two civil engineers were abducted on wednesday some 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- south-west of kabul in wardak province . the foreign ministry crisis team working on the case had " taken cognizance " of the reports jäger said . according to reports in germany , the unnamed engineers were working for a kabul-based company when they were seized while traveling with an afghan driver and four police officials . on thursday , the taliban 's purported spokesman , zabeeullah mujahid , said that they were not aware of any foreign nationals seized by their fighters . " i have contacted all our forces in the area but no one knows about it , " mujahid told dpa news service by phone from an undisclosed location . taliban in control ? but another taliban spokesman , yousuf ahmadi , told afp news service that his group had taken control of the germans .
" the taliban have decided to free the german nationals if german troops pull out of afghanistan and all the taliban prisoners in afghan prisons are released , " he said , adding that the germans were " alive and in good health . " the governor of neighboring ghazni province , mirajuddin pathan , also said that the german engineers had " definitely been kidnapped by the taliban . " south koreans abducted ahmadi also said that the taliban had abducted 18 south koreans - three men and 15 women .
the christian evangelical group was traveling through southern afghanistan .
" they are with the taliban now and they are safe and sound , " the taliban said .
" they are under investigation and once the investigation is over , the taliban leading council will make a final decision about their fate . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 20.07.2007 german fans under the spell of harry potter in english großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are ready to snap up " harry potter and the deathly hallows " in its original form for those purists wanting to protect the german language , turn away now .
the new harry potter book comes out in english in germany on saturday and german fans will not be waiting for the translated version . while there has been some discussion about doing away with what some conservatives call " unnecessary " usage of the english language in germany , the germans have not gone as far as the french in making a stand to protect their mother tongue .
many germans bemoan the fact that a hybrid commonly known as " denglish " has crept into their society , but there has yet to be a concerted effort to establish any german equivalent to france 's protectionist institution , the académie française .
those thinking of pushing for the creation of such an institution and the eventual eradication of anglicisms in germany may yet have their day , but they continue to bide their time - and wisely so .
why ?
because had they managed to beat back the english incursion between the publication of 2005 's " harry potter and the half-blood prince " and the final installment , " the deathly hallows " - the english version of which goes on sale in germany on saturday - they would have been left at the mercy of tens of thousands of would-be wizards and witches calling for their muggle heads .
nothing stands in the way of a potter fix bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're a dedicated bunch these harry potter fans language purists , however , are clever enough to know that turning germany into a land where an english book would be held back for publication until the german one had been launched is simply too premature .
nobody wants to be responsible for wand-waving pandemonium across the nation .
and who would want to be forced to quiver behind barricades and huddle behind locked doors for purely linguistic reasons ?
such is the demand for the seventh and final book in the phenomenally successful harry potter series that german fans are laying in wait to snap up the first run of the english publication despite some readers having only a limited understanding of the language in its written in .
the expectation over how the boy wizard 's story comes to its conclusion is so intense that potter nuts across germany are refusing to wait the three months until the german translation is released .

"
it was proved half right .
blocked by a russian veto threat , supporters of a un plan to grant independence to the serb province of kosovo ended their bid in the security council on friday . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called on friday for serbia and the political leaders of kosovo to be included in talks on the future of the breakaway serb republic .
although approval of a united nations security council resolution on the future status of the territory , remained the main priority , steinmeier said after talks in berlin with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov . shortly after the minister spoke , however , the united states envoy at the un said negotiations at the world body on a draft resolution for kosovo had failed . us ambassador zalmay khalilzad said washington would seek a non-un resolution to the dispute over kosovo 's political future because russia has blocked security council efforts to settle that issue .
" we 'll move outside the security council process and the contact group will take the lead and move forward during the process of negotiations , " he told reporters . russia blocks resolution on kosovo 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khalilzad said the issue would go to the contact group western nations have been trying to push a draft resolution in the un security council to implement key provisions of un mediator martti ahtissari 's plan to grant " supervised independence " to the breakaway albanian-majority serbian province . but they have hurtled into opposition from moscow , belgrade 's key ally , which has repeatedly threatened to veto a security council resolution under discussion . the contact group is composed of the us , russia , france , britain , italy and germany .
in this political body , however , russia has no veto power . russia , serbia welcome the decision later on friday , russia welcomed as " logical " the decision at the united nations in new york to refer the kosovo independence issue to the contact group . " this is a logical consequence of our active policy , " a russian foreign ministry spokesman said , according to interfax .
" we want to lay the foundations for a continuation of the dialogue with the aim of reaching an agreement between pristina and belgrade . " and while serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica hailed the dropped kosovo independence bid as " an important victory in the un security council " for serbia and its traditional ally russia in their attempts to defend " the sovereignty and territorial integrity of serbia , " kosovo ethnic albanian prime minister agim ceku said it would be " better to seek new alternatives " to resolve the future status of the province . the kosovo daily express reported that ceku had proposed to other kosovo albanian politicians to proclaim independence on nov .
28 - the independence day in neighboring albania . " this was initially an idea how to get out of a situation that has been blocked in the security council , " ceku told reporters after meeting the chief un administrator of kosovo joachim rücker .
french envoy calls for fast solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de la sabliere wants a solution sooner rather than later france 's un ambassador to the un jean-marc de la sabliere echoed zalmay khalilzad ’ s comments .
" we regret that it has been impossible to secure such a resolution in the un security council , " sabliere said .
" we will therefore put on hold discussions of a new resolution . "
" we have decided to renew discussions within the contact group and with the parties along these lines , " he added .
" the people of kosovo should be given the opportunity to realize their political and economic development , ” the french envoy continued .
“ we are determined to assist them in that aim in the period ahead . "
" a timely resolving of kosovo 's status will also enable serbia to move beyond the conflicts of the 1990s and toward a brighter european and euro-atlantic future .
we believe that resolving kosovo 's status must be achieved as soon as possible . "
de la sabliere concluded by saying that european union foreign ministers would discuss kosovo at a meeting in brussels on monday .
run by the un bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has been in charge in kosovo for eight years kosovo has been run by the un since 1999 , after a nato bombing campaign helped drive out serb forces carrying out a brutal crackdown on ethnic albanians , who make up 90 percent of the population in the province .
the western compromise draft would have turned over administration of the province from the united nations to the eu while maintaining a nato presence .
russia , however , made it clear it would veto the latest compromise draft introduced to the un security council by belgium , britain , france , germany , italy and the united states .
eu 's solana claims talks will go ahead on tuesday , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said serbia and kosovo were likely to hold new talks on the province 's future even without a un security council resolution , probably under the aegis of the contact group .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice warned on thursday that washington was fully committed to achieving independence for kosovo , despite russia 's opposition .

"
it was proved half right .
blocked by a russian veto threat , supporters of a un plan to grant independence to the serb province of kosovo ended their bid in the security council on friday . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called on friday for serbia and the political leaders of kosovo to be included in talks on the future of the breakaway serb republic .
although approval of a united nations security council resolution on the future status of the territory , remained the main priority , steinmeier said after talks in berlin with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov . shortly after the minister spoke , however , the united states envoy at the un said negotiations at the world body on a draft resolution for kosovo had failed . us ambassador zalmay khalilzad said washington would seek a non-un resolution to the dispute over kosovo 's political future because russia has blocked security council efforts to settle that issue .
" we 'll move outside the security council process and the contact group will take the lead and move forward during the process of negotiations , " he told reporters . russia blocks resolution on kosovo 's future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khalilzad said the issue would go to the contact group western nations have been trying to push a draft resolution in the un security council to implement key provisions of un mediator martti ahtissari 's plan to grant " supervised independence " to the breakaway albanian-majority serbian province . but they have hurtled into opposition from moscow , belgrade 's key ally , which has repeatedly threatened to veto a security council resolution under discussion . the contact group is composed of the us , russia , france , britain , italy and germany .
in this political body , however , russia has no veto power . russia , serbia welcome the decision later on friday , russia welcomed as " logical " the decision at the united nations in new york to refer the kosovo independence issue to the contact group . " this is a logical consequence of our active policy , " a russian foreign ministry spokesman said , according to interfax .
" we want to lay the foundations for a continuation of the dialogue with the aim of reaching an agreement between pristina and belgrade . " and while serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica hailed the dropped kosovo independence bid as " an important victory in the un security council " for serbia and its traditional ally russia in their attempts to defend " the sovereignty and territorial integrity of serbia , " kosovo ethnic albanian prime minister agim ceku said it would be " better to seek new alternatives " to resolve the future status of the province . the kosovo daily express reported that ceku had proposed to other kosovo albanian politicians to proclaim independence on nov .
28 - the independence day in neighboring albania . " this was initially an idea how to get out of a situation that has been blocked in the security council , " ceku told reporters after meeting the chief un administrator of kosovo joachim rücker .
french envoy calls for fast solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de la sabliere wants a solution sooner rather than later france 's un ambassador to the un jean-marc de la sabliere echoed zalmay khalilzad ’ s comments .
" we regret that it has been impossible to secure such a resolution in the un security council , " sabliere said .
" we will therefore put on hold discussions of a new resolution . "
" we have decided to renew discussions within the contact group and with the parties along these lines , " he added .
" the people of kosovo should be given the opportunity to realize their political and economic development , ” the french envoy continued .
“ we are determined to assist them in that aim in the period ahead . "
" a timely resolving of kosovo 's status will also enable serbia to move beyond the conflicts of the 1990s and toward a brighter european and euro-atlantic future .
we believe that resolving kosovo 's status must be achieved as soon as possible . "
de la sabliere concluded by saying that european union foreign ministers would discuss kosovo at a meeting in brussels on monday .
run by the un bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has been in charge in kosovo for eight years kosovo has been run by the un since 1999 , after a nato bombing campaign helped drive out serb forces carrying out a brutal crackdown on ethnic albanians , who make up 90 percent of the population in the province .
the western compromise draft would have turned over administration of the province from the united nations to the eu while maintaining a nato presence .
russia , however , made it clear it would veto the latest compromise draft introduced to the un security council by belgium , britain , france , germany , italy and the united states .
eu 's solana claims talks will go ahead on tuesday , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said serbia and kosovo were likely to hold new talks on the province 's future even without a un security council resolution , probably under the aegis of the contact group .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice warned on thursday that washington was fully committed to achieving independence for kosovo , despite russia 's opposition .
" we will get there one way or another , " she told journalists on a flight to lisbon , but she did not say whether washington was prepared to unilaterally recognize an independent kosovo . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to his eldest son , retired major general berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg , about the plot and its significance . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , a colonel in hitler 's army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power .
stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's hideaway .
miraculously , the dictator survived the blast and stauffenberg and others involved in the plot were executed . a movie about the events of july 20 , 1944 , is currently being filmed in berlin starring hollywood actor and prominent scientologist tom cruise , and it has stirred controversy .
over the years , some have raised questions about the attack itself , with debate about the motives and the political per suasion of stauffenberg .
dw-world.de talked to his eldest son about the assassination plot and its consequences for the family and germany as a whole .
dw-world.de : you were only 10 years old when your father died .
did you know anything about his oppositional activities ?
what about the rest of your family ?
berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg : i did n't know anything naturally .
everything had to be kept secret .
if children find out about something like that there is always the danger that they 're going to spill the beans .
my mother knew something about it and also approved , but we did n't get wind of any of that .
when did your mother find out what was happening ?
she noticed there was something going on relatively early and brought it up with my father .
i do n't know how much he told her .
she knew that he was going to do something .
what she did n't know was that he was going to plant the bomb himself .
when and how did you find out about attack ?
i heard in the radio that there had been an assassination attempt .
but it was not until the following day that my mother told me and my next-youngest brother that our father had carried it out .
it was a big shock for us .
after this lengthy conversation , she was picked up at night .
we did n't see her again until june ' 45 .
you talked about shock .
were you shocked because this was the first time that you 'd heard your father was dead or the fact that he was involved in the resistance ?
or both ?
both .
people today might not be able to believe it , but death was nothing unusual at that time .
a third of my classmates had lost their fathers and the threat was always there .
you could also be killed in different ways as a result of bombing raids and so on .
it was , of course , the fact that he had committed this act against the head of state .
that did n't fit into our world view .
we asked how he could do something like that to the führer .
our mother told us that he believed that he had to do it for germany .
were you brought up in a way that was typical of the time ? we were not brought up to be out-and-out nazis , but we encountered it in our surroundings .
as i said , my parents did not make critical remarks , but they also did n't express any enthusiasm either .
but there was nazi indoctrination in the school .
how did things proceed after your mother was picked up ?
the family was torn apart .
most of the adults were then sent to concentration camps , including those who were obviously not involved .
under the nazis there was a practice of punishing family members as well as the perpetrator .
my mother and my aunt were , of course , held for questioning for a long time .
we were then taken to a children 's home that had been especially cleared out to take us .
and we stayed there until after the invasion - in this case by the americans .
was your later career shaped by the attack ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg was executed for his act shaped is perhaps not the right expression .
however , it was strongly influenced .
if you have a well-known name and , of course , we had become well-known among those people who were against the attack - some because they were nazis and some because they rejected violence as a matter of principle , and it 's a bit different living under those circumstances than if you can live anonymously .
but it is like that in almost any profession when you go into the same profession as your father .
i did it because i thought i would enjoy it .
not because i wanted to follow in a family tradition , or because of my father .
rather in spite of my father .
are there any misapprehensions about your father that particularly upset you ? well , there is one theory .
it is always said that he was a nazi at the start and that this only changed later .
that sounds good to those people who were themselves nazis .
and i would n't object if that was how things were , but that is not factually correct .
at the start , my father was neither pro- nor anti-nazi .
he just wanted to see how things developed and then judge things for himself .
it may have been that at the time he disagreed with nazi supporters and nazi opponents .
independence was something that he always valued highly .
what do feel is missing from the conventional image of your father ?
of course , i ca n't really judge that properly because i did n't know him well enough .
it does n't serve him well to be made into a superman , or a superstar , as people would say today .
but he also was n't just any ordinary person .
i do believe that he was especially talented .
there have been around seven films , including documentary films on the topic , and now hollywood and tom cruise are tackling the subject .
do you feel that your family history has become public pro per ty ?
my father 's story has quite clearly become public property .
apart from the films that are , on the whole , benevolent , there has also been literature that was deprecatory or base . but your family has , nevertheless , not shut out the public . no , we think that it is not the business of the family to honor my father or not .
it should not interfere there .
that does n't mean we are against it , or that we do n't give our support when we are asked .
but we do n't pursue it actively . what about your comments on tom cruise ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise as stauffenberg : filming began thursday none of us has taken active steps .
i was contacted by the -lsb- daily -rsb- süddeutsche zeitung and asked to give an interview .
i stated my opinion .
in a democracy you should be able to express your opinions , your personal opinion , without intending to make any demands .
i never called for the film to be stopped .
i also never said that tom cruise should n't act the part or that it should n't be permitted .
i said that i did n't like it .
and i think that is legitimate .
over the years the historical reception of the resistance led by your father has changed significantly .
do you think the more recent interpretations get any closer to the truth ?
sixty years is a long time .
there are only few people left alive who were active in the war .
even their children are old people now .
it 's natural that the image that we have should change .
it has shifted from being first-hand experience and has become history .
of course , a lot of mistakes have also crept in .
however things were , the history that we know definitely contains a lot of mistakes that we do n't know about and that we are no longer in a position to recognize .
what is the significance , in your opinion , of the events of july 20 for germany and the world - and for you per sonally ?
i do n't want to draw any lessons for the german people or the whole world .
but perhaps you can say one thing .
if you feel a sense of moral duty then you have to act upon that .
this is n't a political issue .
it also is n't about whether you are a democrat or not .
it 's a question of morality .
if you have the opportunity to do something about it , can you allow a people to be governed by criminals - even if they have been elected by the people ? julie gregson interviewed berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.07.2007 " if you feel a sense of moral duty , you have to act upon it " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg 's family was torn apart following the attack graf von stauffenberg attempted to assassinate hitler 63 years ago on friday .
dw-world.de spoke to his eldest son , retired major general berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg , about the plot and its significance . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , a colonel in hitler 's army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power .
stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's hideaway .
miraculously , the dictator survived the blast and stauffenberg and others involved in the plot were executed . a movie about the events of july 20 , 1944 , is currently being filmed in berlin starring hollywood actor and prominent scientologist tom cruise , and it has stirred controversy .
over the years , some have raised questions about the attack itself , with debate about the motives and the political per suasion of stauffenberg .
dw-world.de talked to his eldest son about the assassination plot and its consequences for the family and germany as a whole .
dw-world.de : you were only 10 years old when your father died .
did you know anything about his oppositional activities ?
what about the rest of your family ?
berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg : i did n't know anything naturally .
everything had to be kept secret .
if children find out about something like that there is always the danger that they 're going to spill the beans .
my mother knew something about it and also approved , but we did n't get wind of any of that .
when did your mother find out what was happening ?
she noticed there was something going on relatively early and brought it up with my father .
i do n't know how much he told her .
she knew that he was going to do something .
what she did n't know was that he was going to plant the bomb himself .
when and how did you find out about attack ?
i heard in the radio that there had been an assassination attempt .
but it was not until the following day that my mother told me and my next-youngest brother that our father had carried it out .
it was a big shock for us .
after this lengthy conversation , she was picked up at night .
we did n't see her again until june ' 45 .
you talked about shock .
were you shocked because this was the first time that you 'd heard your father was dead or the fact that he was involved in the resistance ?
or both ?
both .
people today might not be able to believe it , but death was nothing unusual at that time .
a third of my classmates had lost their fathers and the threat was always there .
you could also be killed in different ways as a result of bombing raids and so on .
it was , of course , the fact that he had committed this act against the head of state .
that did n't fit into our world view .
we asked how he could do something like that to the führer .
our mother told us that he believed that he had to do it for germany .
were you brought up in a way that was typical of the time ? we were not brought up to be out-and-out nazis , but we encountered it in our surroundings .
as i said , my parents did not make critical remarks , but they also did n't express any enthusiasm either .
but there was nazi indoctrination in the school .
how did things proceed after your mother was picked up ?
the family was torn apart .
most of the adults were then sent to concentration camps , including those who were obviously not involved .
under the nazis there was a practice of punishing family members as well as the perpetrator .
my mother and my aunt were , of course , held for questioning for a long time .
we were then taken to a children 's home that had been especially cleared out to take us .
and we stayed there until after the invasion - in this case by the americans .
was your later career shaped by the attack ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg was executed for his act shaped is perhaps not the right expression .
however , it was strongly influenced .
if you have a well-known name and , of course , we had become well-known among those people who were against the attack - some because they were nazis and some because they rejected violence as a matter of principle , and it 's a bit different living under those circumstances than if you can live anonymously .
but it is like that in almost any profession when you go into the same profession as your father .
i did it because i thought i would enjoy it .
not because i wanted to follow in a family tradition , or because of my father .
rather in spite of my father .
are there any misapprehensions about your father that particularly upset you ? well , there is one theory .
it is always said that he was a nazi at the start and that this only changed later .
that sounds good to those people who were themselves nazis .
and i would n't object if that was how things were , but that is not factually correct .
at the start , my father was neither pro- nor anti-nazi .
he just wanted to see how things developed and then judge things for himself .
it may have been that at the time he disagreed with nazi supporters and nazi opponents .
independence was something that he always valued highly .
what do feel is missing from the conventional image of your father ?
of course , i ca n't really judge that properly because i did n't know him well enough .
it does n't serve him well to be made into a superman , or a superstar , as people would say today .
but he also was n't just any ordinary person .
i do believe that he was especially talented .
there have been around seven films , including documentary films on the topic , and now hollywood and tom cruise are tackling the subject .
do you feel that your family history has become public pro per ty ?
my father 's story has quite clearly become public property .
apart from the films that are , on the whole , benevolent , there has also been literature that was deprecatory or base . but your family has , nevertheless , not shut out the public . no , we think that it is not the business of the family to honor my father or not .
it should not interfere there .
that does n't mean we are against it , or that we do n't give our support when we are asked .
but we do n't pursue it actively . what about your comments on tom cruise ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise as stauffenberg : filming began thursday none of us has taken active steps .
i was contacted by the -lsb- daily -rsb- süddeutsche zeitung and asked to give an interview .
i stated my opinion .
in a democracy you should be able to express your opinions , your personal opinion , without intending to make any demands .
i never called for the film to be stopped .
i also never said that tom cruise should n't act the part or that it should n't be permitted .
i said that i did n't like it .
and i think that is legitimate .
over the years the historical reception of the resistance led by your father has changed significantly .
do you think the more recent interpretations get any closer to the truth ?
sixty years is a long time .
there are only few people left alive who were active in the war .
even their children are old people now .
it 's natural that the image that we have should change .
it has shifted from being first-hand experience and has become history .
of course , a lot of mistakes have also crept in .
however things were , the history that we know definitely contains a lot of mistakes that we do n't know about and that we are no longer in a position to recognize .
what is the significance , in your opinion , of the events of july 20 for germany and the world - and for you per sonally ?
i do n't want to draw any lessons for the german people or the whole world .
but perhaps you can say one thing .
if you feel a sense of moral duty then you have to act upon that .
this is n't a political issue .
it also is n't about whether you are a democrat or not .
it 's a question of morality .
if you have the opportunity to do something about it , can you allow a people to be governed by criminals - even if they have been elected by the people ? julie gregson interviewed berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 20.07.2007 opinion : no cold war sequel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west 's relationship with russia is worsening .
some talk about a repeat of the east-west conflict .
that 's wrong .
there 's the threat of an adversarial climate , but not of a cold war , says dw-world.de 's ingo mannteufel . relations between russia and the west are getting worse - both in terms of rhetoric and actions - especially since the list of controversial issues seems to get longer every day : the planned us defense missile shield in poland and the czech republic ; the un resolution on kosovo ; actual , alleged or planned russian arms deliveries to syria , iran or venezuela ; the iranian nuclear program ; estonia 's attitude towards soviet memorials ; the investigation of the murder of former intelligence agent and emigrant alexander litvinenko ; and finally russia 's decision to pull out of the conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel in principle , differences of opinion and interests between states are nothing unusual in international politics , and luckily they do n't lead to war most of the time .
when russia , the us and european states are feuding to such an extent , it immediately reminds people of the 40-year cold war that took place in the second half of the last century .
putin 's decision to pull out of the cfe treaty could be considered final proof for this since the 1990 agreement is seen as a symbol of the end of the east-west conflict .
despite this , there wo n't be a new version of the cold war - first and foremost because today 's russia , even as the important global energy supplier that it is , is far from having the political and economic power of a soviet union .
what 's decisive is that the philosophical and ideological undertone is missing in the current dispute between russia and the west .
in the confrontation between world communism and liberal democracy , soviet leaders - from a marxist-leninist viewpoint - saw themselves on the side of history that would end in the victory of the international proletariat in the communist world revolution .
even if people can only laugh about this today , they should n't underestimate this decisive motive for the east-west conflict , as cold war historians have shown in recent years .
it was this opposition of systems that created the impression of a lasting confrontation that engulfed all aspects of life .
neither a functioning liberal democracy nor a market economy governed by rule of law have developed in russia .
but the current russian system is not based on a carefully devised counter-ideology to western democracy .
quite to the contrary : president putin is personally insulted when people do n't see him as a clear-cut democrat or refuse to treat russia on a par with g8 democracies , which are considered the club of global capitalism by many .
the lacking ideological component in the current dispute between russia and the west has yet another consequence : russia has more trouble finding allies in the world as it no longer possesses the global power of attraction of a different political and economical system .
anti-colonial liberation movements in developing countries or anti-american regimes no longer see their own future in the russian role model .
that 's why moscow has lost the opportunity to turn its own disputes with the us and europe into a global confrontation in the sense of the historic cold war .
in the wake of russia 's post-soviet weakness , president putin now thinks the time has come for a new all-encompassing arrangement with the us and europe .
he is aiming for agreements that are more in line with his own interests of a newly strengthened great power russia .
this makes russia 's foreign policy appear aggressive , especially since it is presented in a brusque way .
it 's necessary to be prepared for a new and not completely harmless climate of animosity in relations between russia and the west - at least to the us and a few important european nato states .
but there wo n't be a return to a bipolar world of two different societal systems as in the old east-west conflict .

dw-world.de spoke to his eldest son , retired major general berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg , about the plot and its significance . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , a colonel in hitler 's army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power .
stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's hideaway .
miraculously , the dictator survived the blast and stauffenberg and others involved in the plot were executed . a movie about the events of july 20 , 1944 , is currently being filmed in berlin starring hollywood actor and prominent scientologist tom cruise , and it has stirred controversy .
over the years , some have raised questions about the attack itself , with debate about the motives and the political per suasion of stauffenberg .
dw-world.de talked to his eldest son about the assassination plot and its consequences for the family and germany as a whole .
dw-world.de : you were only 10 years old when your father died .
did you know anything about his oppositional activities ?
what about the rest of your family ?
berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg : i did n't know anything naturally .
everything had to be kept secret .
if children find out about something like that there is always the danger that they 're going to spill the beans .
my mother knew something about it and also approved , but we did n't get wind of any of that .
when did your mother find out what was happening ?
she noticed there was something going on relatively early and brought it up with my father .
i do n't know how much he told her .
she knew that he was going to do something .
what she did n't know was that he was going to plant the bomb himself .
when and how did you find out about attack ?
i heard in the radio that there had been an assassination attempt .
but it was not until the following day that my mother told me and my next-youngest brother that our father had carried it out .
it was a big shock for us .
after this lengthy conversation , she was picked up at night .
we did n't see her again until june ' 45 .
you talked about shock .
were you shocked because this was the first time that you 'd heard your father was dead or the fact that he was involved in the resistance ?
or both ?
both .
people today might not be able to believe it , but death was nothing unusual at that time .
a third of my classmates had lost their fathers and the threat was always there .
you could also be killed in different ways as a result of bombing raids and so on .
it was , of course , the fact that he had committed this act against the head of state .
that did n't fit into our world view .
we asked how he could do something like that to the führer .
our mother told us that he believed that he had to do it for germany .
were you brought up in a way that was typical of the time ? we were not brought up to be out-and-out nazis , but we encountered it in our surroundings .
as i said , my parents did not make critical remarks , but they also did n't express any enthusiasm either .
but there was nazi indoctrination in the school .
how did things proceed after your mother was picked up ?
the family was torn apart .
most of the adults were then sent to concentration camps , including those who were obviously not involved .
under the nazis there was a practice of punishing family members as well as the perpetrator .
my mother and my aunt were , of course , held for questioning for a long time .
we were then taken to a children 's home that had been especially cleared out to take us .
and we stayed there until after the invasion - in this case by the americans .
was your later career shaped by the attack ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg was executed for his act shaped is perhaps not the right expression .
however , it was strongly influenced .
if you have a well-known name and , of course , we had become well-known among those people who were against the attack - some because they were nazis and some because they rejected violence as a matter of principle , and it 's a bit different living under those circumstances than if you can live anonymously .
but it is like that in almost any profession when you go into the same profession as your father .
i did it because i thought i would enjoy it .
not because i wanted to follow in a family tradition , or because of my father .
rather in spite of my father .
are there any misapprehensions about your father that particularly upset you ? well , there is one theory .
it is always said that he was a nazi at the start and that this only changed later .
that sounds good to those people who were themselves nazis .
and i would n't object if that was how things were , but that is not factually correct .
at the start , my father was neither pro- nor anti-nazi .
he just wanted to see how things developed and then judge things for himself .
it may have been that at the time he disagreed with nazi supporters and nazi opponents .
independence was something that he always valued highly .
what do feel is missing from the conventional image of your father ?
of course , i ca n't really judge that properly because i did n't know him well enough .
it does n't serve him well to be made into a superman , or a superstar , as people would say today .
but he also was n't just any ordinary person .
i do believe that he was especially talented .
there have been around seven films , including documentary films on the topic , and now hollywood and tom cruise are tackling the subject .
do you feel that your family history has become public pro per ty ?
my father 's story has quite clearly become public property .
apart from the films that are , on the whole , benevolent , there has also been literature that was deprecatory or base . but your family has , nevertheless , not shut out the public . no , we think that it is not the business of the family to honor my father or not .
it should not interfere there .
that does n't mean we are against it , or that we do n't give our support when we are asked .
but we do n't pursue it actively . what about your comments on tom cruise ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise as stauffenberg : filming began thursday none of us has taken active steps .
i was contacted by the -lsb- daily -rsb- süddeutsche zeitung and asked to give an interview .
i stated my opinion .
in a democracy you should be able to express your opinions , your personal opinion , without intending to make any demands .
i never called for the film to be stopped .
i also never said that tom cruise should n't act the part or that it should n't be permitted .
i said that i did n't like it .
and i think that is legitimate .
over the years the historical reception of the resistance led by your father has changed significantly .
do you think the more recent interpretations get any closer to the truth ?
sixty years is a long time .
there are only few people left alive who were active in the war .
even their children are old people now .
it 's natural that the image that we have should change .
it has shifted from being first-hand experience and has become history .
of course , a lot of mistakes have also crept in .
however things were , the history that we know definitely contains a lot of mistakes that we do n't know about and that we are no longer in a position to recognize .
what is the significance , in your opinion , of the events of july 20 for germany and the world - and for you per sonally ?
i do n't want to draw any lessons for the german people or the whole world .
but perhaps you can say one thing .
if you feel a sense of moral duty then you have to act upon that .
this is n't a political issue .
it also is n't about whether you are a democrat or not .
it 's a question of morality .
if you have the opportunity to do something about it , can you allow a people to be governed by criminals - even if they have been elected by the people ? julie gregson interviewed berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some talk about a repeat of the east-west conflict .
that 's wrong .
there 's the threat of an adversarial climate , but not of a cold war , says dw-world.de 's ingo mannteufel . relations between russia and the west are getting worse - both in terms of rhetoric and actions - especially since the list of controversial issues seems to get longer every day : the planned us defense missile shield in poland and the czech republic ; the un resolution on kosovo ; actual , alleged or planned russian arms deliveries to syria , iran or venezuela ; the iranian nuclear program ; estonia 's attitude towards soviet memorials ; the investigation of the murder of former intelligence agent and emigrant alexander litvinenko ; and finally russia 's decision to pull out of the conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel in principle , differences of opinion and interests between states are nothing unusual in international politics , and luckily they do n't lead to war most of the time .
when russia , the us and european states are feuding to such an extent , it immediately reminds people of the 40-year cold war that took place in the second half of the last century .
putin 's decision to pull out of the cfe treaty could be considered final proof for this since the 1990 agreement is seen as a symbol of the end of the east-west conflict .
despite this , there wo n't be a new version of the cold war - first and foremost because today 's russia , even as the important global energy supplier that it is , is far from having the political and economic power of a soviet union .
what 's decisive is that the philosophical and ideological undertone is missing in the current dispute between russia and the west .
in the confrontation between world communism and liberal democracy , soviet leaders - from a marxist-leninist viewpoint - saw themselves on the side of history that would end in the victory of the international proletariat in the communist world revolution .
even if people can only laugh about this today , they should n't underestimate this decisive motive for the east-west conflict , as cold war historians have shown in recent years .
it was this opposition of systems that created the impression of a lasting confrontation that engulfed all aspects of life .
neither a functioning liberal democracy nor a market economy governed by rule of law have developed in russia .
but the current russian system is not based on a carefully devised counter-ideology to western democracy .
quite to the contrary : president putin is personally insulted when people do n't see him as a clear-cut democrat or refuse to treat russia on a par with g8 democracies , which are considered the club of global capitalism by many .
the lacking ideological component in the current dispute between russia and the west has yet another consequence : russia has more trouble finding allies in the world as it no longer possesses the global power of attraction of a different political and economical system .
anti-colonial liberation movements in developing countries or anti-american regimes no longer see their own future in the russian role model .
that 's why moscow has lost the opportunity to turn its own disputes with the us and europe into a global confrontation in the sense of the historic cold war .
in the wake of russia 's post-soviet weakness , president putin now thinks the time has come for a new all-encompassing arrangement with the us and europe .
he is aiming for agreements that are more in line with his own interests of a newly strengthened great power russia .
this makes russia 's foreign policy appear aggressive , especially since it is presented in a brusque way .
it 's necessary to be prepared for a new and not completely harmless climate of animosity in relations between russia and the west - at least to the us and a few important european nato states .
but there wo n't be a return to a bipolar world of two different societal systems as in the old east-west conflict .

some talk about a repeat of the east-west conflict .
that 's wrong .
there 's the threat of an adversarial climate , but not of a cold war , says dw-world.de 's ingo mannteufel . relations between russia and the west are getting worse - both in terms of rhetoric and actions - especially since the list of controversial issues seems to get longer every day : the planned us defense missile shield in poland and the czech republic ; the un resolution on kosovo ; actual , alleged or planned russian arms deliveries to syria , iran or venezuela ; the iranian nuclear program ; estonia 's attitude towards soviet memorials ; the investigation of the murder of former intelligence agent and emigrant alexander litvinenko ; and finally russia 's decision to pull out of the conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel in principle , differences of opinion and interests between states are nothing unusual in international politics , and luckily they do n't lead to war most of the time .
when russia , the us and european states are feuding to such an extent , it immediately reminds people of the 40-year cold war that took place in the second half of the last century .
putin 's decision to pull out of the cfe treaty could be considered final proof for this since the 1990 agreement is seen as a symbol of the end of the east-west conflict .
despite this , there wo n't be a new version of the cold war - first and foremost because today 's russia , even as the important global energy supplier that it is , is far from having the political and economic power of a soviet union .
what 's decisive is that the philosophical and ideological undertone is missing in the current dispute between russia and the west .
in the confrontation between world communism and liberal democracy , soviet leaders - from a marxist-leninist viewpoint - saw themselves on the side of history that would end in the victory of the international proletariat in the communist world revolution .
even if people can only laugh about this today , they should n't underestimate this decisive motive for the east-west conflict , as cold war historians have shown in recent years .
it was this opposition of systems that created the impression of a lasting confrontation that engulfed all aspects of life .
neither a functioning liberal democracy nor a market economy governed by rule of law have developed in russia .
but the current russian system is not based on a carefully devised counter-ideology to western democracy .
quite to the contrary : president putin is personally insulted when people do n't see him as a clear-cut democrat or refuse to treat russia on a par with g8 democracies , which are considered the club of global capitalism by many .
the lacking ideological component in the current dispute between russia and the west has yet another consequence : russia has more trouble finding allies in the world as it no longer possesses the global power of attraction of a different political and economical system .
anti-colonial liberation movements in developing countries or anti-american regimes no longer see their own future in the russian role model .
that 's why moscow has lost the opportunity to turn its own disputes with the us and europe into a global confrontation in the sense of the historic cold war .
in the wake of russia 's post-soviet weakness , president putin now thinks the time has come for a new all-encompassing arrangement with the us and europe .
he is aiming for agreements that are more in line with his own interests of a newly strengthened great power russia .
this makes russia 's foreign policy appear aggressive , especially since it is presented in a brusque way .
it 's necessary to be prepared for a new and not completely harmless climate of animosity in relations between russia and the west - at least to the us and a few important european nato states .
but there wo n't be a return to a bipolar world of two different societal systems as in the old east-west conflict .

ten additional nations rotate through the body with two-year terms . many un member countries have accused the security council of no longer representing the international community and called for the council 's reform . " the status quo is not acceptable to an overwhelming majority of the member states , " a un report released in june said .
" there have been years of discussions , without substantial results .
the time has come to bring the process closer to decision-making . " a previous suggestion tabled by the g-4 called for enlarging the council by six permanent and four non-permanent seats , but the proposal did not receive the two-thirds majority necessary in the un general assembly . another group of medium-sized countries , including pakistan and italy , said the council needed to be expanded by 10 non-permanent seats set up for varying terms . german goals unchanged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder had a temporary council seat but wanted more begun by then chancellor gerhard schröder in 2005 , germany 's push for a permanent seat languished after failing to get necessary support from the african union and being openly opposed by china and the united states . matussek 's reform suggestion calls for germany and other nations to be voted onto the security council for a limited 12-year term .
the german envoy added that berlin would only agree to such a deal if it were guaranteed one of the initial interim spots . " we would not agree to any solution which did not hold out this possibility for germany , " matussek told afp , adding that the interim members would then become candidates for permanent status with veto rights on the council .

dw-world.de spoke to his eldest son , retired major general berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg , about the plot and its significance . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , a colonel in hitler 's army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power .
stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's hideaway .
miraculously , the dictator survived the blast and stauffenberg and others involved in the plot were executed . a movie about the events of july 20 , 1944 , is currently being filmed in berlin starring hollywood actor and prominent scientologist tom cruise , and it has stirred controversy .
over the years , some have raised questions about the attack itself , with debate about the motives and the political per suasion of stauffenberg .
dw-world.de talked to his eldest son about the assassination plot and its consequences for the family and germany as a whole .
dw-world.de : you were only 10 years old when your father died .
did you know anything about his oppositional activities ?
what about the rest of your family ?
berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg : i did n't know anything naturally .
everything had to be kept secret .
if children find out about something like that there is always the danger that they 're going to spill the beans .
my mother knew something about it and also approved , but we did n't get wind of any of that .
when did your mother find out what was happening ?
she noticed there was something going on relatively early and brought it up with my father .
i do n't know how much he told her .
she knew that he was going to do something .
what she did n't know was that he was going to plant the bomb himself .
when and how did you find out about attack ?
i heard in the radio that there had been an assassination attempt .
but it was not until the following day that my mother told me and my next-youngest brother that our father had carried it out .
it was a big shock for us .
after this lengthy conversation , she was picked up at night .
we did n't see her again until june ' 45 .
you talked about shock .
were you shocked because this was the first time that you 'd heard your father was dead or the fact that he was involved in the resistance ?
or both ?
both .
people today might not be able to believe it , but death was nothing unusual at that time .
a third of my classmates had lost their fathers and the threat was always there .
you could also be killed in different ways as a result of bombing raids and so on .
it was , of course , the fact that he had committed this act against the head of state .
that did n't fit into our world view .
we asked how he could do something like that to the führer .
our mother told us that he believed that he had to do it for germany .
were you brought up in a way that was typical of the time ? we were not brought up to be out-and-out nazis , but we encountered it in our surroundings .
as i said , my parents did not make critical remarks , but they also did n't express any enthusiasm either .
but there was nazi indoctrination in the school .
how did things proceed after your mother was picked up ?
the family was torn apart .
most of the adults were then sent to concentration camps , including those who were obviously not involved .
under the nazis there was a practice of punishing family members as well as the perpetrator .
my mother and my aunt were , of course , held for questioning for a long time .
we were then taken to a children 's home that had been especially cleared out to take us .
and we stayed there until after the invasion - in this case by the americans .
was your later career shaped by the attack ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg was executed for his act shaped is perhaps not the right expression .
however , it was strongly influenced .
if you have a well-known name and , of course , we had become well-known among those people who were against the attack - some because they were nazis and some because they rejected violence as a matter of principle , and it 's a bit different living under those circumstances than if you can live anonymously .
but it is like that in almost any profession when you go into the same profession as your father .
i did it because i thought i would enjoy it .
not because i wanted to follow in a family tradition , or because of my father .
rather in spite of my father .
are there any misapprehensions about your father that particularly upset you ? well , there is one theory .
it is always said that he was a nazi at the start and that this only changed later .
that sounds good to those people who were themselves nazis .
and i would n't object if that was how things were , but that is not factually correct .
at the start , my father was neither pro- nor anti-nazi .
he just wanted to see how things developed and then judge things for himself .
it may have been that at the time he disagreed with nazi supporters and nazi opponents .
independence was something that he always valued highly .
what do feel is missing from the conventional image of your father ?
of course , i ca n't really judge that properly because i did n't know him well enough .
it does n't serve him well to be made into a superman , or a superstar , as people would say today .
but he also was n't just any ordinary person .
i do believe that he was especially talented .
there have been around seven films , including documentary films on the topic , and now hollywood and tom cruise are tackling the subject .
do you feel that your family history has become public pro per ty ?
my father 's story has quite clearly become public property .
apart from the films that are , on the whole , benevolent , there has also been literature that was deprecatory or base . but your family has , nevertheless , not shut out the public . no , we think that it is not the business of the family to honor my father or not .
it should not interfere there .
that does n't mean we are against it , or that we do n't give our support when we are asked .
but we do n't pursue it actively . what about your comments on tom cruise ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise as stauffenberg : filming began thursday none of us has taken active steps .
i was contacted by the -lsb- daily -rsb- süddeutsche zeitung and asked to give an interview .
i stated my opinion .
in a democracy you should be able to express your opinions , your personal opinion , without intending to make any demands .
i never called for the film to be stopped .
i also never said that tom cruise should n't act the part or that it should n't be permitted .
i said that i did n't like it .
and i think that is legitimate .
over the years the historical reception of the resistance led by your father has changed significantly .
do you think the more recent interpretations get any closer to the truth ?
sixty years is a long time .
there are only few people left alive who were active in the war .
even their children are old people now .
it 's natural that the image that we have should change .
it has shifted from being first-hand experience and has become history .
of course , a lot of mistakes have also crept in .
however things were , the history that we know definitely contains a lot of mistakes that we do n't know about and that we are no longer in a position to recognize .
what is the significance , in your opinion , of the events of july 20 for germany and the world - and for you per sonally ?
i do n't want to draw any lessons for the german people or the whole world .
but perhaps you can say one thing .
if you feel a sense of moral duty then you have to act upon that .
this is n't a political issue .
it also is n't about whether you are a democrat or not .
it 's a question of morality .
if you have the opportunity to do something about it , can you allow a people to be governed by criminals - even if they have been elected by the people ? julie gregson interviewed berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 20.07.2007 opinion : no cold war sequel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west 's relationship with russia is worsening .
some talk about a repeat of the east-west conflict .
that 's wrong .
there 's the threat of an adversarial climate , but not of a cold war , says dw-world.de 's ingo mannteufel . relations between russia and the west are getting worse - both in terms of rhetoric and actions - especially since the list of controversial issues seems to get longer every day : the planned us defense missile shield in poland and the czech republic ; the un resolution on kosovo ; actual , alleged or planned russian arms deliveries to syria , iran or venezuela ; the iranian nuclear program ; estonia 's attitude towards soviet memorials ; the investigation of the murder of former intelligence agent and emigrant alexander litvinenko ; and finally russia 's decision to pull out of the conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel in principle , differences of opinion and interests between states are nothing unusual in international politics , and luckily they do n't lead to war most of the time .
when russia , the us and european states are feuding to such an extent , it immediately reminds people of the 40-year cold war that took place in the second half of the last century .
putin 's decision to pull out of the cfe treaty could be considered final proof for this since the 1990 agreement is seen as a symbol of the end of the east-west conflict .
despite this , there wo n't be a new version of the cold war - first and foremost because today 's russia , even as the important global energy supplier that it is , is far from having the political and economic power of a soviet union .
what 's decisive is that the philosophical and ideological undertone is missing in the current dispute between russia and the west .
in the confrontation between world communism and liberal democracy , soviet leaders - from a marxist-leninist viewpoint - saw themselves on the side of history that would end in the victory of the international proletariat in the communist world revolution .
even if people can only laugh about this today , they should n't underestimate this decisive motive for the east-west conflict , as cold war historians have shown in recent years .
it was this opposition of systems that created the impression of a lasting confrontation that engulfed all aspects of life .
neither a functioning liberal democracy nor a market economy governed by rule of law have developed in russia .
but the current russian system is not based on a carefully devised counter-ideology to western democracy .
quite to the contrary : president putin is personally insulted when people do n't see him as a clear-cut democrat or refuse to treat russia on a par with g8 democracies , which are considered the club of global capitalism by many .
the lacking ideological component in the current dispute between russia and the west has yet another consequence : russia has more trouble finding allies in the world as it no longer possesses the global power of attraction of a different political and economical system .
anti-colonial liberation movements in developing countries or anti-american regimes no longer see their own future in the russian role model .
that 's why moscow has lost the opportunity to turn its own disputes with the us and europe into a global confrontation in the sense of the historic cold war .
in the wake of russia 's post-soviet weakness , president putin now thinks the time has come for a new all-encompassing arrangement with the us and europe .
he is aiming for agreements that are more in line with his own interests of a newly strengthened great power russia .
this makes russia 's foreign policy appear aggressive , especially since it is presented in a brusque way .
it 's necessary to be prepared for a new and not completely harmless climate of animosity in relations between russia and the west - at least to the us and a few important european nato states .
but there wo n't be a return to a bipolar world of two different societal systems as in the old east-west conflict .

dw-world.de spoke to his eldest son , retired major general berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg , about the plot and its significance . on july 20 , 1944 , claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , a colonel in hitler 's army , took the fate of the german people into his own hands .
increasingly disillusioned with adolf hitler , stauffenberg and numerous other co-conspirators within the german military plotted to assassinate the dictator and seize the reins of power .
stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's hideaway .
miraculously , the dictator survived the blast and stauffenberg and others involved in the plot were executed . a movie about the events of july 20 , 1944 , is currently being filmed in berlin starring hollywood actor and prominent scientologist tom cruise , and it has stirred controversy .
over the years , some have raised questions about the attack itself , with debate about the motives and the political per suasion of stauffenberg .
dw-world.de talked to his eldest son about the assassination plot and its consequences for the family and germany as a whole .
dw-world.de : you were only 10 years old when your father died .
did you know anything about his oppositional activities ?
what about the rest of your family ?
berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg : i did n't know anything naturally .
everything had to be kept secret .
if children find out about something like that there is always the danger that they 're going to spill the beans .
my mother knew something about it and also approved , but we did n't get wind of any of that .
when did your mother find out what was happening ?
she noticed there was something going on relatively early and brought it up with my father .
i do n't know how much he told her .
she knew that he was going to do something .
what she did n't know was that he was going to plant the bomb himself .
when and how did you find out about attack ?
i heard in the radio that there had been an assassination attempt .
but it was not until the following day that my mother told me and my next-youngest brother that our father had carried it out .
it was a big shock for us .
after this lengthy conversation , she was picked up at night .
we did n't see her again until june ' 45 .
you talked about shock .
were you shocked because this was the first time that you 'd heard your father was dead or the fact that he was involved in the resistance ?
or both ?
both .
people today might not be able to believe it , but death was nothing unusual at that time .
a third of my classmates had lost their fathers and the threat was always there .
you could also be killed in different ways as a result of bombing raids and so on .
it was , of course , the fact that he had committed this act against the head of state .
that did n't fit into our world view .
we asked how he could do something like that to the führer .
our mother told us that he believed that he had to do it for germany .
were you brought up in a way that was typical of the time ? we were not brought up to be out-and-out nazis , but we encountered it in our surroundings .
as i said , my parents did not make critical remarks , but they also did n't express any enthusiasm either .
but there was nazi indoctrination in the school .
how did things proceed after your mother was picked up ?
the family was torn apart .
most of the adults were then sent to concentration camps , including those who were obviously not involved .
under the nazis there was a practice of punishing family members as well as the perpetrator .
my mother and my aunt were , of course , held for questioning for a long time .
we were then taken to a children 's home that had been especially cleared out to take us .
and we stayed there until after the invasion - in this case by the americans .
was your later career shaped by the attack ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg was executed for his act shaped is perhaps not the right expression .
however , it was strongly influenced .
if you have a well-known name and , of course , we had become well-known among those people who were against the attack - some because they were nazis and some because they rejected violence as a matter of principle , and it 's a bit different living under those circumstances than if you can live anonymously .
but it is like that in almost any profession when you go into the same profession as your father .
i did it because i thought i would enjoy it .
not because i wanted to follow in a family tradition , or because of my father .
rather in spite of my father .
are there any misapprehensions about your father that particularly upset you ? well , there is one theory .
it is always said that he was a nazi at the start and that this only changed later .
that sounds good to those people who were themselves nazis .
and i would n't object if that was how things were , but that is not factually correct .
at the start , my father was neither pro- nor anti-nazi .
he just wanted to see how things developed and then judge things for himself .
it may have been that at the time he disagreed with nazi supporters and nazi opponents .
independence was something that he always valued highly .
what do feel is missing from the conventional image of your father ?
of course , i ca n't really judge that properly because i did n't know him well enough .
it does n't serve him well to be made into a superman , or a superstar , as people would say today .
but he also was n't just any ordinary person .
i do believe that he was especially talented .
there have been around seven films , including documentary films on the topic , and now hollywood and tom cruise are tackling the subject .
do you feel that your family history has become public pro per ty ?
my father 's story has quite clearly become public property .
apart from the films that are , on the whole , benevolent , there has also been literature that was deprecatory or base . but your family has , nevertheless , not shut out the public . no , we think that it is not the business of the family to honor my father or not .
it should not interfere there .
that does n't mean we are against it , or that we do n't give our support when we are asked .
but we do n't pursue it actively . what about your comments on tom cruise ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise as stauffenberg : filming began thursday none of us has taken active steps .
i was contacted by the -lsb- daily -rsb- süddeutsche zeitung and asked to give an interview .
i stated my opinion .
in a democracy you should be able to express your opinions , your personal opinion , without intending to make any demands .
i never called for the film to be stopped .
i also never said that tom cruise should n't act the part or that it should n't be permitted .
i said that i did n't like it .
and i think that is legitimate .
over the years the historical reception of the resistance led by your father has changed significantly .
do you think the more recent interpretations get any closer to the truth ?
sixty years is a long time .
there are only few people left alive who were active in the war .
even their children are old people now .
it 's natural that the image that we have should change .
it has shifted from being first-hand experience and has become history .
of course , a lot of mistakes have also crept in .
however things were , the history that we know definitely contains a lot of mistakes that we do n't know about and that we are no longer in a position to recognize .
what is the significance , in your opinion , of the events of july 20 for germany and the world - and for you per sonally ?
i do n't want to draw any lessons for the german people or the whole world .
but perhaps you can say one thing .
if you feel a sense of moral duty then you have to act upon that .
this is n't a political issue .
it also is n't about whether you are a democrat or not .
it 's a question of morality .
if you have the opportunity to do something about it , can you allow a people to be governed by criminals - even if they have been elected by the people ? julie gregson interviewed berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 20.07.2007 opinion : no cold war sequel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west 's relationship with russia is worsening .
some talk about a repeat of the east-west conflict .
that 's wrong .
there 's the threat of an adversarial climate , but not of a cold war , says dw-world.de 's ingo mannteufel . relations between russia and the west are getting worse - both in terms of rhetoric and actions - especially since the list of controversial issues seems to get longer every day : the planned us defense missile shield in poland and the czech republic ; the un resolution on kosovo ; actual , alleged or planned russian arms deliveries to syria , iran or venezuela ; the iranian nuclear program ; estonia 's attitude towards soviet memorials ; the investigation of the murder of former intelligence agent and emigrant alexander litvinenko ; and finally russia 's decision to pull out of the conventional armed forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel in principle , differences of opinion and interests between states are nothing unusual in international politics , and luckily they do n't lead to war most of the time .
when russia , the us and european states are feuding to such an extent , it immediately reminds people of the 40-year cold war that took place in the second half of the last century .
putin 's decision to pull out of the cfe treaty could be considered final proof for this since the 1990 agreement is seen as a symbol of the end of the east-west conflict .
despite this , there wo n't be a new version of the cold war - first and foremost because today 's russia , even as the important global energy supplier that it is , is far from having the political and economic power of a soviet union .
what 's decisive is that the philosophical and ideological undertone is missing in the current dispute between russia and the west .
in the confrontation between world communism and liberal democracy , soviet leaders - from a marxist-leninist viewpoint - saw themselves on the side of history that would end in the victory of the international proletariat in the communist world revolution .
even if people can only laugh about this today , they should n't underestimate this decisive motive for the east-west conflict , as cold war historians have shown in recent years .
it was this opposition of systems that created the impression of a lasting confrontation that engulfed all aspects of life .
neither a functioning liberal democracy nor a market economy governed by rule of law have developed in russia .
but the current russian system is not based on a carefully devised counter-ideology to western democracy .
quite to the contrary : president putin is personally insulted when people do n't see him as a clear-cut democrat or refuse to treat russia on a par with g8 democracies , which are considered the club of global capitalism by many .
the lacking ideological component in the current dispute between russia and the west has yet another consequence : russia has more trouble finding allies in the world as it no longer possesses the global power of attraction of a different political and economical system .
anti-colonial liberation movements in developing countries or anti-american regimes no longer see their own future in the russian role model .
that 's why moscow has lost the opportunity to turn its own disputes with the us and europe into a global confrontation in the sense of the historic cold war .
in the wake of russia 's post-soviet weakness , president putin now thinks the time has come for a new all-encompassing arrangement with the us and europe .
he is aiming for agreements that are more in line with his own interests of a newly strengthened great power russia .
this makes russia 's foreign policy appear aggressive , especially since it is presented in a brusque way .
it 's necessary to be prepared for a new and not completely harmless climate of animosity in relations between russia and the west - at least to the us and a few important european nato states .
but there wo n't be a return to a bipolar world of two different societal systems as in the old east-west conflict .

yet in recent years musicians from small european countries have begun rocking festival lineups and winning over fans . most festivalgoers have been partying for a day or two by the time zzz gets its 30-minute shot at fame .
" it 's very compact , " björn ottenheim , zzz 's drummer and singer said about playing such a short set . " it 's like you can make love to a woman all night long or you can also make it quick and dirty , which can also be very beautiful . "
the " wham-bam , thank you ma 'am " of their short festival set is not the only sleazy factor of zzz 's current act .
you can definitely hear the funky porn soundtrack influence and the heady dope and sex atmosphere from the red light district running as a lusty undercurrent in this amsterdam duo 's organ-fueled dance music .
playing to the people who have yet to be introduced to their sound is something zzz are getting used to .
however , they 've been working hard to spread the word this summer as the dutch duo found itself playing to large enthusiastic crowds at major music festivals in great britain , slovenia and belgium .
it 's an on-going mission .
last summer , it was much of the same as they trawled through festivals in italy , france and spain as well as getting booked at popkomm , a festival associated with a large trade show for the music and entertainment industry held in berlin .
it 's not easy being european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn ottenheim , left , and daan schinkel of zzz bands from non-english-speaking european countries have always had to contend with getting a lot less media attention and air time than their american and british counterparts .
" when you do n't come from the us or uk , it 's already pretty hard , " said ottenheim in a phone interview from the dour festival in belgium .
" being from holland , you have to have that extra bit of luck that people take some time to check us out .
and then most of the time they 're stuck immediately when they hear us . "
for many years , festival promoters did n't book european bands because they simply had no way of finding out about them .
but things have been getting better .
the situation began to change for the musical minnows in 2003 , when the european talent exchange program -lrb- etep -rrb- launched an effort to bring together festival promoters and potential talent .
etep-sponsored bands will play 200 shows in festivals this summer , up from 50 in the first year .
until recently , part of the funding came from the european commission .
" we think it 's working very well , " etep founder peter smidt said of the program .
" but it 's definitely not yet the case that a german or a dutch or a french act automatically have access to the european market .
it 's still very difficult . "
summer soundtrack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festivals dot europe 's summer landscape summer music festivals are big business in europe . about 144,000 alternative music fans showed up for the four-day dour festival .
" we love playing festivals of this caliber , " ottenheim said of the dour festival .
" to have a whole tent of people freaking out on my music is a pretty immense feeling .
it 's rewarding and it 's very sexy . "
with record sales stagnating , the summer festivals have become an essential way for bands to get exposure outside their home countries , said christof huber , of the swiss-based european festival association yourope .
" i think the people want to explore new bands .
if the quality of the live act is there , bands from europe can be headliners right now , " huber said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many festivals are multi-day events while most bands sing in english regardless of where they are from , some have had success singing in their native language .
the german band wir sind helden -lrb- we are heroes -rrb- have been selling out shows across europe , as have norwegian outfit kaizers orchestra .
icelandic trance-rockers sigur ros are also a big draw on the european circuit despite the fact that most people do n't have a clue what they 're singing about .
the diversity and quality of european bands is at an all-time high , smidt believes .
" that 's the nice thing about european culture , that it has this diversity and it 's not like one sound , " he said . big in japan bands from small european countries like the netherlands " need to go abroad to survive , " smidt said . which explains zzz 's relentless touring , which has included stops in places as diverse as japan and the south by southwest music event in austin , texas - considered to be a must for any band wanting to break into the us market .
ottenheim and bandmate daan schinkel will head back to britain in august to play the summer sundae weekender festival .
despite the odds , zzz has every intention of making it big in the music business , ottenheim said .
that 's a bold statement .
it 's been 33 years since the dutch band golden earring showed up on us charts with its hit " radar love . "
" i would n't mind kicking it even further than golden earring , " ottenheim said .
" we 're doing pretty good in japan .

the new harry potter book comes out in english in germany on saturday and german fans will not be waiting for the translated version . while there has been some discussion about doing away with what some conservatives call " unnecessary " usage of the english language in germany , the germans have not gone as far as the french in making a stand to protect their mother tongue .
many germans bemoan the fact that a hybrid commonly known as " denglish " has crept into their society , but there has yet to be a concerted effort to establish any german equivalent to france 's protectionist institution , the académie française .
those thinking of pushing for the creation of such an institution and the eventual eradication of anglicisms in germany may yet have their day , but they continue to bide their time - and wisely so .
why ?
because had they managed to beat back the english incursion between the publication of 2005 's " harry potter and the half-blood prince " and the final installment , " the deathly hallows " - the english version of which goes on sale in germany on saturday - they would have been left at the mercy of tens of thousands of would-be wizards and witches calling for their muggle heads .
nothing stands in the way of a potter fix bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're a dedicated bunch these harry potter fans language purists , however , are clever enough to know that turning germany into a land where an english book would be held back for publication until the german one had been launched is simply too premature .
nobody wants to be responsible for wand-waving pandemonium across the nation .
and who would want to be forced to quiver behind barricades and huddle behind locked doors for purely linguistic reasons ?
such is the demand for the seventh and final book in the phenomenally successful harry potter series that german fans are laying in wait to snap up the first run of the english publication despite some readers having only a limited understanding of the language in its written in .
the expectation over how the boy wizard 's story comes to its conclusion is so intense that potter nuts across germany are refusing to wait the three months until the german translation is released .
" anyone with a reasonable command of english does n't want to wait until oct .
27 when the german version is due to appear , " heinrich riethmüller , manager of the osiander chain of book stores , told reporters .
fans waiting for the witching hour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many will grab a copy regardless of their english skills online orders of the english version of " harry potter and the deathly hallows " have passed the 170,000 mark in germany while many thousands of fans are preparing for a night on the streets waiting for the bookshops to open as the chimes strike twelve .
some stores are even throwing special midnight harry potter parties for those fans who plan to storm the shelves once the clock passes the witching hour .
literary observers believe that the popularity in germany of the harry potter books in their original language has much to do with the fact that many fans have grown up with the series , reading each book as it came out and improving their english along the way .
sixth book made history in germany the first real sign of the clamor for harry , ron , hermione and friends in english came with the release of the " half-blood prince . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : j.k. rowling 's sixth book broke records in germany the sixth book became the first english-language book ever to make it into the german best-seller list .
" the seventh book will do even better , " said riethmüller .
" it 's bound to enter the best-seller list . "
dealers estimate that total sales of " harry potter and the deathly hallows " will top the three-million mark in germany .
the defenders of the german language may be rubbing their hands over the fact that j.k. rowling has now completed her odyssey .
they may now feel free to slowly squeeze the english language out of germany without magical reprisals .
but time will tell .
harry 's story may have come to an end but it is unlikely the spell of reading in english will be broken for a generation who followed his adventures in a foreign tongue . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

stauffenberg smuggled an explosives-filled briefcase into a meeting at hitler 's hideaway .
miraculously , the dictator survived the blast and stauffenberg and others involved in the plot were executed . a movie about the events of july 20 , 1944 , is currently being filmed in berlin starring hollywood actor and prominent scientologist tom cruise , and it has stirred controversy .
over the years , some have raised questions about the attack itself , with debate about the motives and the political per suasion of stauffenberg .
dw-world.de talked to his eldest son about the assassination plot and its consequences for the family and germany as a whole .
dw-world.de : you were only 10 years old when your father died .
did you know anything about his oppositional activities ?
what about the rest of your family ?
berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg : i did n't know anything naturally .
everything had to be kept secret .
if children find out about something like that there is always the danger that they 're going to spill the beans .
my mother knew something about it and also approved , but we did n't get wind of any of that .
when did your mother find out what was happening ?
she noticed there was something going on relatively early and brought it up with my father .
i do n't know how much he told her .
she knew that he was going to do something .
what she did n't know was that he was going to plant the bomb himself .
when and how did you find out about attack ?
i heard in the radio that there had been an assassination attempt .
but it was not until the following day that my mother told me and my next-youngest brother that our father had carried it out .
it was a big shock for us .
after this lengthy conversation , she was picked up at night .
we did n't see her again until june ' 45 .
you talked about shock .
were you shocked because this was the first time that you 'd heard your father was dead or the fact that he was involved in the resistance ?
or both ?
both .
people today might not be able to believe it , but death was nothing unusual at that time .
a third of my classmates had lost their fathers and the threat was always there .
you could also be killed in different ways as a result of bombing raids and so on .
it was , of course , the fact that he had committed this act against the head of state .
that did n't fit into our world view .
we asked how he could do something like that to the führer .
our mother told us that he believed that he had to do it for germany .
were you brought up in a way that was typical of the time ? we were not brought up to be out-and-out nazis , but we encountered it in our surroundings .
as i said , my parents did not make critical remarks , but they also did n't express any enthusiasm either .
but there was nazi indoctrination in the school .
how did things proceed after your mother was picked up ?
the family was torn apart .
most of the adults were then sent to concentration camps , including those who were obviously not involved .
under the nazis there was a practice of punishing family members as well as the perpetrator .
my mother and my aunt were , of course , held for questioning for a long time .
we were then taken to a children 's home that had been especially cleared out to take us .
and we stayed there until after the invasion - in this case by the americans .
was your later career shaped by the attack ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg was executed for his act shaped is perhaps not the right expression .
however , it was strongly influenced .
if you have a well-known name and , of course , we had become well-known among those people who were against the attack - some because they were nazis and some because they rejected violence as a matter of principle , and it 's a bit different living under those circumstances than if you can live anonymously .
but it is like that in almost any profession when you go into the same profession as your father .
i did it because i thought i would enjoy it .
not because i wanted to follow in a family tradition , or because of my father .
rather in spite of my father .
are there any misapprehensions about your father that particularly upset you ? well , there is one theory .
it is always said that he was a nazi at the start and that this only changed later .
that sounds good to those people who were themselves nazis .
and i would n't object if that was how things were , but that is not factually correct .
at the start , my father was neither pro- nor anti-nazi .
he just wanted to see how things developed and then judge things for himself .
it may have been that at the time he disagreed with nazi supporters and nazi opponents .
independence was something that he always valued highly .
what do feel is missing from the conventional image of your father ?
of course , i ca n't really judge that properly because i did n't know him well enough .
it does n't serve him well to be made into a superman , or a superstar , as people would say today .
but he also was n't just any ordinary person .
i do believe that he was especially talented .
there have been around seven films , including documentary films on the topic , and now hollywood and tom cruise are tackling the subject .
do you feel that your family history has become public pro per ty ?
my father 's story has quite clearly become public property .
apart from the films that are , on the whole , benevolent , there has also been literature that was deprecatory or base . but your family has , nevertheless , not shut out the public . no , we think that it is not the business of the family to honor my father or not .
it should not interfere there .
that does n't mean we are against it , or that we do n't give our support when we are asked .
but we do n't pursue it actively . what about your comments on tom cruise ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise as stauffenberg : filming began thursday none of us has taken active steps .
i was contacted by the -lsb- daily -rsb- süddeutsche zeitung and asked to give an interview .
i stated my opinion .
in a democracy you should be able to express your opinions , your personal opinion , without intending to make any demands .
i never called for the film to be stopped .
i also never said that tom cruise should n't act the part or that it should n't be permitted .
i said that i did n't like it .
and i think that is legitimate .
over the years the historical reception of the resistance led by your father has changed significantly .
do you think the more recent interpretations get any closer to the truth ?
sixty years is a long time .
there are only few people left alive who were active in the war .
even their children are old people now .
it 's natural that the image that we have should change .
it has shifted from being first-hand experience and has become history .
of course , a lot of mistakes have also crept in .
however things were , the history that we know definitely contains a lot of mistakes that we do n't know about and that we are no longer in a position to recognize .
what is the significance , in your opinion , of the events of july 20 for germany and the world - and for you per sonally ?
i do n't want to draw any lessons for the german people or the whole world .
but perhaps you can say one thing .
if you feel a sense of moral duty then you have to act upon that .
this is n't a political issue .
it also is n't about whether you are a democrat or not .
it 's a question of morality .
if you have the opportunity to do something about it , can you allow a people to be governed by criminals - even if they have been elected by the people ? julie gregson interviewed berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

why was this necessary and what happens already ?
why is party political funding under scrutiny ?
all parties need money to run campaigns , but during 2006 there were concerns that , at least with the three largest parties , they were too dependent on a handful of wealthy donors .
what has propelled the issue into the news ?
it emerged in 2006 that to fund their 2005 general election campaign , labour was secretly loaned nearly £ 14m and the conservatives £ 16m .
the liberal democrats said they borrowed £ 850,000 from three backers .
the review was ordered into the issue of funding at the height of the " cash for honours " furore which followed the loans ' revelation .
how are parties funded ?
all parties receive membership subs .
but that is not enough to pay for modern campaigning - especially with the general decline in membership over recent decades .
the conservatives rely mainly on donations from individuals and companies .
labour also receives these , but a large chunk of its income comes from trade unions .
lib dem coffers have also been boosted by large donations in recent years .
so , the uk does n't have state funding for parties , then ?
actually , yes it does .
opposition parties receive money to pay for administration and other costs .
otherwise , the ruling party - with its access to the instruments of government , such as the civil service - would have an unfair advantage , it is argued .
in the second quarter of 2006 , the tories were given £ 1.15m by the state and the lib dems got £ 456,000 .
how open is the whole funding process ?
under rules drawn up by the current government , donations worth £ 5,000 or more to national parties have to be declared , as well as those worth £ 2,000 or more to local associations .
what about loans then ?
a loophole in the rules used to mean that loans did not have to be declared .
as a result of this becoming public knowledge that loophole has been closed .
what was the inquiry into party funding ?
an inquiry , run by the former senior civil servant sir hayden phillips , was set up in march 2006 to come up with proposals for reform .
it reported a year later .
what did sir hayden recommend ?
he recommended capping spending for political campaigns as well as capping individual donations .
he also suggested increasing state funding by £ 25m a year , linked to public support - he proposed that eligible parties receive 50p each year for every vote cast for them in the most recent general election and 25p for every vote in the most recent ballots for the scottish parliament , welsh assembly and european parliament .
he also recommended cutting spending by the largest parties between elections by £ 20m each ; and what do the parties themselves want ?
labour wants a small increase in state funding , stringent caps on spending and voluntary caps to be placed on donations by each party .
the tories are calling for a large increase in state funding for all parties with more than two commons seats , a cap of £ 50,000 on all donations , the phasing out of corporate donations - including from trade unions , and tax relief for donations .
the lib dems want limited state funding for parties , national caps on annual donations and a lower cap on general election spending .
so , are big changes definitely ahead ?
not necessarily .
sir hayden 's other option is " minimal change " to the current system .
in his report he said uk politics has usually been " remarkably free of corruption and abuse " .
realistically , there is little chance of any changes if the big parties do not agree .
sir hayden is to chair talks with labour , the conservatives and the liberal democrats about changes , and has said there was " broad agreement " about most issues , but " obstacles " remained when it came to capping spending and donations .

why is party political funding under scrutiny ?
all parties need money to run campaigns , but during 2006 there were concerns that , at least with the three largest parties , they were too dependent on a handful of wealthy donors .
what has propelled the issue into the news ?
it emerged in 2006 that to fund their 2005 general election campaign , labour was secretly loaned nearly £ 14m and the conservatives £ 16m .
the liberal democrats said they borrowed £ 850,000 from three backers .
the review was ordered into the issue of funding at the height of the " cash for honours " furore which followed the loans ' revelation .
how are parties funded ?
all parties receive membership subs .
but that is not enough to pay for modern campaigning - especially with the general decline in membership over recent decades .
the conservatives rely mainly on donations from individuals and companies .
labour also receives these , but a large chunk of its income comes from trade unions .
lib dem coffers have also been boosted by large donations in recent years .

opposition parties receive money to pay for administration and other costs .
otherwise , the ruling party - with its access to the instruments of government , such as the civil service - would have an unfair advantage , it is argued .
in the second quarter of 2006 , the tories were given £ 1.15m by the state and the lib dems got £ 456,000 .
how open is the whole funding process ?
under rules drawn up by the current government , donations worth £ 5,000 or more to national parties have to be declared , as well as those worth £ 2,000 or more to local associations .

why was this necessary and what happens already ?
why is party political funding under scrutiny ?
all parties need money to run campaigns , but during 2006 there were concerns that , at least with the three largest parties , they were too dependent on a handful of wealthy donors .
what has propelled the issue into the news ?
it emerged in 2006 that to fund their 2005 general election campaign , labour was secretly loaned nearly £ 14m and the conservatives £ 16m .
the liberal democrats said they borrowed £ 850,000 from three backers .
the review was ordered into the issue of funding at the height of the " cash for honours " furore which followed the loans ' revelation .
how are parties funded ?
all parties receive membership subs .
but that is not enough to pay for modern campaigning - especially with the general decline in membership over recent decades .
the conservatives rely mainly on donations from individuals and companies .
labour also receives these , but a large chunk of its income comes from trade unions .
lib dem coffers have also been boosted by large donations in recent years .
so , the uk does n't have state funding for parties , then ?
actually , yes it does .
opposition parties receive money to pay for administration and other costs .
otherwise , the ruling party - with its access to the instruments of government , such as the civil service - would have an unfair advantage , it is argued .
in the second quarter of 2006 , the tories were given £ 1.15m by the state and the lib dems got £ 456,000 .
how open is the whole funding process ?
under rules drawn up by the current government , donations worth £ 5,000 or more to national parties have to be declared , as well as those worth £ 2,000 or more to local associations .
what about loans then ?
a loophole in the rules used to mean that loans did not have to be declared .
as a result of this becoming public knowledge that loophole has been closed .
what was the inquiry into party funding ?
an inquiry , run by the former senior civil servant sir hayden phillips , was set up in march 2006 to come up with proposals for reform .
it reported a year later .
what did sir hayden recommend ?
he recommended capping spending for political campaigns as well as capping individual donations .
he also suggested increasing state funding by £ 25m a year , linked to public support - he proposed that eligible parties receive 50p each year for every vote cast for them in the most recent general election and 25p for every vote in the most recent ballots for the scottish parliament , welsh assembly and european parliament .
he also recommended cutting spending by the largest parties between elections by £ 20m each ; and what do the parties themselves want ?
labour wants a small increase in state funding , stringent caps on spending and voluntary caps to be placed on donations by each party .
the tories are calling for a large increase in state funding for all parties with more than two commons seats , a cap of £ 50,000 on all donations , the phasing out of corporate donations - including from trade unions , and tax relief for donations .
the lib dems want limited state funding for parties , national caps on annual donations and a lower cap on general election spending .
so , are big changes definitely ahead ?
not necessarily .
sir hayden 's other option is " minimal change " to the current system .
in his report he said uk politics has usually been " remarkably free of corruption and abuse " .
realistically , there is little chance of any changes if the big parties do not agree .
sir hayden is to chair talks with labour , the conservatives and the liberal democrats about changes , and has said there was " broad agreement " about most issues , but " obstacles " remained when it came to capping spending and donations .

plans for raf bentley priory include an education centre and flats " churchill sat in this chair and king george vi in this one " , says flight lieutenant owen burns matter-of-factly .
" along with general eisenhower , they were here at bentley priory monitoring the normandy landings on d-day . "
the chairs in question have pride of place in the office of sir hugh dowding - the mastermind behind the battle of britain , the most important event in raf history .
flt lt " robbie " burns speaks reverentially of the office , or the " holy of holies " as he calls it , and will not dare sit in the late lord dowding 's seat or touch anything on his desk .
the 91-year-old former gunner is one of 15 veterans who have gathered to say goodbye to raf bentley priory , where lord dowding devised his plans to protect britain against aerial attack .
they are 15 of " the few " which the wartime prime minister winston churchill referred to in his now famous quote : " never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few " .
' spiritual home ' set in sumptuous grounds , the priory is a handsome house in stanmore , north west london and , prior to the summer of 1940 , it was already well-known for having been almost totally rebuilt by the great 18th century architect sir john soane .
the raf base at bentley priory is now surplus to requirements and the historic building , subject to planning permission , is to be turned into a museum and apartments .
hearing the battle of britain veterans talk of their " spiritual " home and their " grandfather " lord dowding , it is easy to understand their sadness and anger .
flt lt burns said the closure was a " tragedy of the first order " .
there 's no suggestion of building houses at blenheim palace or trafalgar square , and i think altering this building in any way is entirely wrong veteran kenneth wilkinson " when i walk through the door of this building , there 's something about it , " he said .
" people conducted a war from this building and if it was n't for the battle of britain , all able-bodied englishmen would have been taken to germany as prisoners of war and made to work in the mines . "
squadron leader tony " pick " pickering said lord dowding was " ahead of his time " .
the 86-year-old former fighter pilot from rugby said : " i have been coming here for 50 years for reunions and dinners .
" we meet as a family and we all look up to lord dowding as a grandfather .
we think of him and how his strategy saved this country . "
while they understand the pressures of money , and look forward to the building being opened to the public , they just wish it could be kept as it is .
flying officer kenneth wilkinson , 89 , from solihull , said : " there 's no suggestion of building houses at blenheim palace or trafalgar square , and i think altering this building in any way is entirely wrong . "
' saved the world ' raf bentley priory is due to close in spring 2008 as part of the ministry of defence 's consolidation project for greater london .
retired air chief marshal sir brian burridge is chair of the bentley priory battle of britain trust , set up two years ago to ensure the preservation of key heritage parts of the site .
he estimates they will need at least £ 5 million to turn the " historic heart " into a " visitor 's attraction " .
in addition to funding from the redevelopment of the site , the trust is also hoping to secure lottery funding and a public appeal will be launched in the spring .
he said creating a permanent exhibition would commemorate the sacrifices made and help people understand the historic events which " saved the world " .
tony pickering has been coming to bentley priory for 50 years " bentley priory is the epitome of the command of the battle of britain and if the battle of trafalgar saved great britain , the battle of britain saved the world , " he said .
" it was the decisive battle of the second world war , which enabled britain to dig in for the long haul and defeat the powers of fascism . "
defence minister lord drayson , who also attended the sunset closure ceremony , said it was " vitally important " to maintain the building 's heritage not just for the raf , but for the country .
" the building is no longer required and we have a responsibility to the tax payer to make sure we make best use of resources , " he said .
" we will ensure the heritage is maintained so future generations can understand what " the few " went through . "
but listening to the three veterans , one would think they had n't gone through very much .
the trio are all so stoic , cool even about their experiences .
it was " just a job " , a " challenge " , it was " life " .
ft lt burns summed it up : " it was a great experience for young people and it made men of us . "
after a hectic day of media interviews , tea-drinking and chatting with the " old boys " , they took part in the formal closure ceremony , which included a fly-by and drill display .
they then headed off to reminisce some more over dinner and a pint of battle of britain ale , no less .

there 's no suggestion of building houses at blenheim palace or trafalgar square , and i think altering this building in any way is entirely wrong veteran kenneth wilkinson " when i walk through the door of this building , there 's something about it , " he said .
" people conducted a war from this building and if it was n't for the battle of britain , all able-bodied englishmen would have been taken to germany as prisoners of war and made to work in the mines . "
squadron leader tony " pick " pickering said lord dowding was " ahead of his time " .
the 86-year-old former fighter pilot from rugby said : " i have been coming here for 50 years for reunions and dinners .
" we meet as a family and we all look up to lord dowding as a grandfather .
we think of him and how his strategy saved this country . "
while they understand the pressures of money , and look forward to the building being opened to the public , they just wish it could be kept as it is .
flying officer kenneth wilkinson , 89 , from solihull , said : " there 's no suggestion of building houses at blenheim palace or trafalgar square , and i think altering this building in any way is entirely wrong . "
' saved the world ' raf bentley priory is due to close in spring 2008 as part of the ministry of defence 's consolidation project for greater london .
retired air chief marshal sir brian burridge is chair of the bentley priory battle of britain trust , set up two years ago to ensure the preservation of key heritage parts of the site .
he estimates they will need at least £ 5 million to turn the " historic heart " into a " visitor 's attraction " .
in addition to funding from the redevelopment of the site , the trust is also hoping to secure lottery funding and a public appeal will be launched in the spring .
he said creating a permanent exhibition would commemorate the sacrifices made and help people understand the historic events which " saved the world " .
tony pickering has been coming to bentley priory for 50 years " bentley priory is the epitome of the command of the battle of britain and if the battle of trafalgar saved great britain , the battle of britain saved the world , " he said .
" it was the decisive battle of the second world war , which enabled britain to dig in for the long haul and defeat the powers of fascism . "
defence minister lord drayson , who also attended the sunset closure ceremony , said it was " vitally important " to maintain the building 's heritage not just for the raf , but for the country .
" the building is no longer required and we have a responsibility to the tax payer to make sure we make best use of resources , " he said .
" we will ensure the heritage is maintained so future generations can understand what " the few " went through . "
but listening to the three veterans , one would think they had n't gone through very much .
the trio are all so stoic , cool even about their experiences .
it was " just a job " , a " challenge " , it was " life " .
ft lt burns summed it up : " it was a great experience for young people and it made men of us . "
after a hectic day of media interviews , tea-drinking and chatting with the " old boys " , they took part in the formal closure ceremony , which included a fly-by and drill display .
they then headed off to reminisce some more over dinner and a pint of battle of britain ale , no less .

plans for raf bentley priory include an education centre and flats " churchill sat in this chair and king george vi in this one " , says flight lieutenant owen burns matter-of-factly .
" along with general eisenhower , they were here at bentley priory monitoring the normandy landings on d-day . "
the chairs in question have pride of place in the office of sir hugh dowding - the mastermind behind the battle of britain , the most important event in raf history .
flt lt " robbie " burns speaks reverentially of the office , or the " holy of holies " as he calls it , and will not dare sit in the late lord dowding 's seat or touch anything on his desk .
the 91-year-old former gunner is one of 15 veterans who have gathered to say goodbye to raf bentley priory , where lord dowding devised his plans to protect britain against aerial attack .
they are 15 of " the few " which the wartime prime minister winston churchill referred to in his now famous quote : " never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few " .
' spiritual home ' set in sumptuous grounds , the priory is a handsome house in stanmore , north west london and , prior to the summer of 1940 , it was already well-known for having been almost totally rebuilt by the great 18th century architect sir john soane .
the raf base at bentley priory is now surplus to requirements and the historic building , subject to planning permission , is to be turned into a museum and apartments .
hearing the battle of britain veterans talk of their " spiritual " home and their " grandfather " lord dowding , it is easy to understand their sadness and anger .
flt lt burns said the closure was a " tragedy of the first order " .
there 's no suggestion of building houses at blenheim palace or trafalgar square , and i think altering this building in any way is entirely wrong veteran kenneth wilkinson " when i walk through the door of this building , there 's something about it , " he said .
" people conducted a war from this building and if it was n't for the battle of britain , all able-bodied englishmen would have been taken to germany as prisoners of war and made to work in the mines . "
squadron leader tony " pick " pickering said lord dowding was " ahead of his time " .
the 86-year-old former fighter pilot from rugby said : " i have been coming here for 50 years for reunions and dinners .
" we meet as a family and we all look up to lord dowding as a grandfather .
we think of him and how his strategy saved this country . "
while they understand the pressures of money , and look forward to the building being opened to the public , they just wish it could be kept as it is .
flying officer kenneth wilkinson , 89 , from solihull , said : " there 's no suggestion of building houses at blenheim palace or trafalgar square , and i think altering this building in any way is entirely wrong . "
' saved the world ' raf bentley priory is due to close in spring 2008 as part of the ministry of defence 's consolidation project for greater london .
retired air chief marshal sir brian burridge is chair of the bentley priory battle of britain trust , set up two years ago to ensure the preservation of key heritage parts of the site .
he estimates they will need at least £ 5 million to turn the " historic heart " into a " visitor 's attraction " .
in addition to funding from the redevelopment of the site , the trust is also hoping to secure lottery funding and a public appeal will be launched in the spring .
he said creating a permanent exhibition would commemorate the sacrifices made and help people understand the historic events which " saved the world " .
tony pickering has been coming to bentley priory for 50 years " bentley priory is the epitome of the command of the battle of britain and if the battle of trafalgar saved great britain , the battle of britain saved the world , " he said .
" it was the decisive battle of the second world war , which enabled britain to dig in for the long haul and defeat the powers of fascism . "
defence minister lord drayson , who also attended the sunset closure ceremony , said it was " vitally important " to maintain the building 's heritage not just for the raf , but for the country .
" the building is no longer required and we have a responsibility to the tax payer to make sure we make best use of resources , " he said .
" we will ensure the heritage is maintained so future generations can understand what " the few " went through . "
but listening to the three veterans , one would think they had n't gone through very much .
the trio are all so stoic , cool even about their experiences .
it was " just a job " , a " challenge " , it was " life " .
ft lt burns summed it up : " it was a great experience for young people and it made men of us . "
after a hectic day of media interviews , tea-drinking and chatting with the " old boys " , they took part in the formal closure ceremony , which included a fly-by and drill display .

the raf base at bentley priory is now surplus to requirements and the historic building , subject to planning permission , is to be turned into a museum and apartments .
hearing the battle of britain veterans talk of their " spiritual " home and their " grandfather " lord dowding , it is easy to understand their sadness and anger .

" people conducted a war from this building and if it was n't for the battle of britain , all able-bodied englishmen would have been taken to germany as prisoners of war and made to work in the mines . "
squadron leader tony " pick " pickering said lord dowding was " ahead of his time " .
the 86-year-old former fighter pilot from rugby said : " i have been coming here for 50 years for reunions and dinners .
" we meet as a family and we all look up to lord dowding as a grandfather .
we think of him and how his strategy saved this country . "
while they understand the pressures of money , and look forward to the building being opened to the public , they just wish it could be kept as it is .

' saved the world ' raf bentley priory is due to close in spring 2008 as part of the ministry of defence 's consolidation project for greater london .
retired air chief marshal sir brian burridge is chair of the bentley priory battle of britain trust , set up two years ago to ensure the preservation of key heritage parts of the site .
he estimates they will need at least £ 5 million to turn the " historic heart " into a " visitor 's attraction " .
in addition to funding from the redevelopment of the site , the trust is also hoping to secure lottery funding and a public appeal will be launched in the spring .
he said creating a permanent exhibition would commemorate the sacrifices made and help people understand the historic events which " saved the world " .
tony pickering has been coming to bentley priory for 50 years " bentley priory is the epitome of the command of the battle of britain and if the battle of trafalgar saved great britain , the battle of britain saved the world , " he said .
" it was the decisive battle of the second world war , which enabled britain to dig in for the long haul and defeat the powers of fascism . "
defence minister lord drayson , who also attended the sunset closure ceremony , said it was " vitally important " to maintain the building 's heritage not just for the raf , but for the country .
" the building is no longer required and we have a responsibility to the tax payer to make sure we make best use of resources , " he said .
" we will ensure the heritage is maintained so future generations can understand what " the few " went through . "
but listening to the three veterans , one would think they had n't gone through very much .
the trio are all so stoic , cool even about their experiences .
it was " just a job " , a " challenge " , it was " life " .
ft lt burns summed it up : " it was a great experience for young people and it made men of us . "
after a hectic day of media interviews , tea-drinking and chatting with the " old boys " , they took part in the formal closure ceremony , which included a fly-by and drill display .
they then headed off to reminisce some more over dinner and a pint of battle of britain ale , no less .

in a second day of testimony to congress , mr bernanke said credit losses associated with sub-prime mortgage failures were " significant " .
wall street is nervous about the exposure of banks and other lenders to the riskier sub-prime market .
earlier this month , bear stearns bailed out two sub-prime focused hedge funds .
it has since said one of them has " very little value " and the other is now worthless .
fears have grown in recent weeks that the downturn in the housing market , prompted by more people 's inability to pay their mortgages , will cause instability and retrenchment in the wider economy .
but the june minutes from the federal reserve 's rate-setting committee showed that despite the continued housing slump , inflation remained the central bank 's overriding concern .
the decision to leave interest rates on hold at 5.25 % was underpinned by fears that core inflation , stripping out volatile energy and food prices , would fail to recede .
economists now expect rates to stay at that level for the rest of the year .
downbeat note in two days of testimony before us legislators , mr bernanke has sounded a persistently downbeat note on the state of the housing market and the woes of the sub-prime sector , which have led to the collapse of about 30 lenders .
more than a million americans lost their homes last year senator robert menendez " the credit losses associated with sub-prime have come to light and they are fairly significant , " mr bernanke told a senate committee .
" some estimates are in the order of between $ 50bn and $ 100bn of losses . "
the fed 's handling of the sub-prime market , which it regulates , came under fire from senators , who argued it should have done more to protect vulnerable consumers from inappropriate and improper mortgage practices .
" more than a million americans lost their homes last year , " said senator robert menendez .
" in my mind , this is not just simply a time for suggestions , it is a time for solutions . "
mr bernanke said the fed was reviewing current regulations on lending practices in a " responsible " manner .
wider problems ?
the fed remained " alert " for any signs that housing weakness may destabilise the economy as a whole , mr bernanke added .
it has already acknowledged the impact of reduced activity in the housing market on consumer spending , cutting its forecast for economic growth this year .
the housing market has a cold and it is feared the germs may spread it has also said it expects the unemployment rate to rise from 4.5 % to 4.75 % by year-end .
despite the impact of the crisis in the sub-prime mortgage market , the us economy has performed better in the second quarter of the year than the first .
the economy has continued to create new jobs at a healthy clip while the number of unemployment benefit claimants is now at its lowest since early may .
but the conference board , publishing its latest economic analysis on thursday , said that it expected economic growth to slow in the next few months .
worries over the economic outlook have not daunted investors , with the leading us share index , the dow jones industrial average , closing above 14,000 for the first time .

it has also said it expects the unemployment rate to rise from 4.5 % to 4.75 % by year-end .
despite the impact of the crisis in the sub-prime mortgage market , the us economy has performed better in the second quarter of the year than the first .
the economy has continued to create new jobs at a healthy clip while the number of unemployment benefit claimants is now at its lowest since early may .
but the conference board , publishing its latest economic analysis on thursday , said that it expected economic growth to slow in the next few months .
worries over the economic outlook have not daunted investors , with the leading us share index , the dow jones industrial average , closing above 14,000 for the first time .

scientologist cruise plays colonel claus von stauffenberg , who was executed after plotting against hitler .
rumours circulated that the crew were banned from the former german general staff quarters because of the country 's hostility towards scientology .
but a government spokesman said it was to preserve the building 's " dignity " .

there has been a surge of applications from young people eager to join the courses at the banff and buchan college in fraserburgh .
industry leaders said youngsters were at last seeing a future in fishing .
banff and buchan college had announced last year that it faced ending training due to a lack of students and finance .
the college - which offers training for mates and skippers ' certification and trainee fishermen - is now able to have a full intake of 14 school-leavers . "
we are delighted people are beginning to see a future in the industry , there is a commitment out there " robert sinclair college principal college principal robert sinclair believes two series of the dramatic bbc television series trawlermen , featuring the fishing crews of peterhead at work at sea , have helped give the public an insight into a rewarding job .
the college has also seen an increase in more experienced applicants in their late teens and early 20s applying for skippers and mates courses , and hundreds have also gone through safety courses this year .
mr sinclair believes that while there may never be a return to the boom years of the late 80s and early 90s it bodes well for the future of the industry and the college .
he told the bbc scotland news website : " we are delighted people are beginning to see a future in the industry , there is a commitment out there , all the courses are showing a rise .
" i think the applications are the biggest year since about 2000 , it 's incredible for the college and the industry .
' greater diversity ' he added : " the nature of the work appeals to a lot of young people , it is very physical but very rewarding .
series such as trawlermen are giving an insight . "
mr sinclair said there was the potential for greater diversity in the industry .
he said : " there is not just work for deckhands now but engineers for the hi-tech boats .
" older fisherman coming back is also encouraging .
it is all a huge shot in the arm . "
george mcrae , of the scottish white fish producers ' association -lrb- swfpa -rrb- , said that despite severe cuts in quotas , decommissioning of boats and job losses in recent years , it showed the industry has a future .

twenty five years after the group formed , inside the smiths sees former bassist andy rourke and drummer mike joyce talk about their time in the band famed for their pioneering of indie music , innovative guitar sound and dark , poetic lyrics .
but neither of the group 's more famous former members , singer morrissey and guitarist johnny marr , are directly involved - having been long estranged following the band 's acrimonious break-up in 1987 .
rourke told bbc world service 's on screen programme that the end of the group was too soon , and " still smarts a bit " .
" but you have to get on with your life - i think within a few months , me and mike were on tour with sinead o 'connor ; you just have to move on , " he added .
" although it 's still foremost in your mind that you wish it was still going on , at least our records did n't use any gimmicky sounds and so the tunes stand the test of time .
i think that 's why there 's still the big interest in the smiths . "
sudden fame the smiths formed in 1982 and released hits such as panic and how soon is now .
their rise was swift , with their debut , self-titled album lauded for its fresh sound , it powered to number two in the charts at a time when they were dominated by synth-pop groups .
it was fantastic - but it was non-stop .
that was part of the downfall mike joyce " i think it helped that me and johnny had known each other since we were 11 and had learned guitar together , and been in lots of different bands before the smiths , " rourke recalled .
" me and johnny knew our playing inside out , and what we wanted from each other .
i think that helped a lot .
mike 's a great drummer , and you put morrissey into the mix and the magic was there was from the start . "
joyce said that the sudden rush of pop stardom and fame was " incredible " .
" anyone that joins a band would be a fool not to want success in any form , " he added .
" obviously to achieve the kind of success that the smiths achieved - such a meteoric rise so quickly - and to still be talking about that group 25 years on , as we are , is every player 's dream .
" it was fantastic - but it was non-stop .
that was part of the downfall - if we were n't touring , we were in the studio .
it was relentless . "
the group were last year offered $ 5m -lrb- £ 2.8m -rrb- to reform for the coachella us festival , but turned it down - with morrissey saying that " money does n't come into it " and adding that " i 'd rather have my testicles cut off " .
the dvd offers some insight into the deterioration of the band 's relationships .
nothing to prove although the break-up of the group is primarily attributed to musical differences between morrissey and marr , joyce later fell out with morrissey and marr over royalty payments , resulting in a court case .
joyce stressed , however , that at the time the group were making their final album , none of them knew what was to come .
" i heard people say about strangeways here we come that they can tell the cracks were starting to show , that things obviously were n't going that well in the smiths camp - that 's absolute nonsense , " he said .
" it was one of the best albums that we 'd recorded in the way that we felt about the record and what we 'd done , because we did n't have anything else to prove .
" everything that we 'd done - for me personally , and i think we can speak for the rest of the group - the records got better and better and better .
" when we recorded the last album , that was n't meant to be the last album .
our career in the smiths was cut abruptly short .
i do n't think there was a point where we dried up . "

twenty five years after the group formed , inside the smiths sees former bassist andy rourke and drummer mike joyce talk about their time in the band famed for their pioneering of indie music , innovative guitar sound and dark , poetic lyrics .
but neither of the group 's more famous former members , singer morrissey and guitarist johnny marr , are directly involved - having been long estranged following the band 's acrimonious break-up in 1987 .
rourke told bbc world service 's on screen programme that the end of the group was too soon , and " still smarts a bit " .
" but you have to get on with your life - i think within a few months , me and mike were on tour with sinead o 'connor ; you just have to move on , " he added .
" although it 's still foremost in your mind that you wish it was still going on , at least our records did n't use any gimmicky sounds and so the tunes stand the test of time .
i think that 's why there 's still the big interest in the smiths . "
sudden fame the smiths formed in 1982 and released hits such as panic and how soon is now .
their rise was swift , with their debut , self-titled album lauded for its fresh sound , it powered to number two in the charts at a time when they were dominated by synth-pop groups .
it was fantastic - but it was non-stop .
that was part of the downfall mike joyce " i think it helped that me and johnny had known each other since we were 11 and had learned guitar together , and been in lots of different bands before the smiths , " rourke recalled .
" me and johnny knew our playing inside out , and what we wanted from each other .
i think that helped a lot .
mike 's a great drummer , and you put morrissey into the mix and the magic was there was from the start . "
joyce said that the sudden rush of pop stardom and fame was " incredible " .
" anyone that joins a band would be a fool not to want success in any form , " he added .
" obviously to achieve the kind of success that the smiths achieved - such a meteoric rise so quickly - and to still be talking about that group 25 years on , as we are , is every player 's dream .
" it was fantastic - but it was non-stop .
that was part of the downfall - if we were n't touring , we were in the studio .
it was relentless . "
the group were last year offered $ 5m -lrb- £ 2.8m -rrb- to reform for the coachella us festival , but turned it down - with morrissey saying that " money does n't come into it " and adding that " i 'd rather have my testicles cut off " .
the dvd offers some insight into the deterioration of the band 's relationships .
nothing to prove although the break-up of the group is primarily attributed to musical differences between morrissey and marr , joyce later fell out with morrissey and marr over royalty payments , resulting in a court case .
joyce stressed , however , that at the time the group were making their final album , none of them knew what was to come .
" i heard people say about strangeways here we come that they can tell the cracks were starting to show , that things obviously were n't going that well in the smiths camp - that 's absolute nonsense , " he said .
" it was one of the best albums that we 'd recorded in the way that we felt about the record and what we 'd done , because we did n't have anything else to prove .
" everything that we 'd done - for me personally , and i think we can speak for the rest of the group - the records got better and better and better .
" when we recorded the last album , that was n't meant to be the last album .
our career in the smiths was cut abruptly short .
i do n't think there was a point where we dried up . "

the bird walks into the rs mccoll newsagents in aberdeen when the door is open and makes off with cheese doritos .
the seagull , nicknamed sam , has now become so popular that locals have started paying for his crisps .
shop assistant sriaram nagarajan said : " everyone is amazed by the seagull .
for some reason he only takes that one particular kind of crisps . "
the bird first swooped in aberdeen 's castlegate earlier this month and made off with the 55p crisps , and is now a regular .
once outside , the crisps are ripped open and the seagull is joined by other birds .
' fine art ' mr nagarajan said : " he 's got it down to a fine art .
he waits until there are no customers around and i 'm standing behind the till , then he raids the place .
" at first i did n't believe a seagull was capable of stealing crisps .
but i saw it with my own eyes and i was surprised .
he 's very good at it .
" he 's becoming a bit of a celebrity .
seagulls are usually not that popular but sam is a star because he 's so funny . "
a spokesman for rspb scotland said : " i 've never heard of anything like this before .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- robot to carry out heart surgery bbc news / health graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- health contents : medical notes friday , 20 july 2007 , 10:16 gmt 11:16 uk robot to carry out heart surgery a robotic arm able to carry out an intricate life-saving heart operation is being pioneered by uk surgeons .
the robot is used to guide thin wires through blood vessels in the heart to treat a fast or irregular heartbeat .
doctors at st mary 's hospital in london say it will reduce risk for patients and increase the number of procedures they can carry out .
more than 20 patients have been operated on with the robot , which is only one of four in use in the world . "
in the uk a shortage of expertise means there are too few centres where highly complex cases can be carried out " dr wyn davies during the procedure , known as catheter ablation , several thin wires and tubes are inserted through a vein in the groin and guided into the heart where they deliver an electric current to specific areas of heart muscle .
the electric current destroys tiny portions of heart tissue which are causing the abnormal heartbeat .
with the sensei robot , surgeons use a joystick on a computer console to more accurately position and control the wires , which often need to be placed in locations that are difficult to reach .
in the future the system could be automated so the robot guides the wires to a point in the heart selected by the doctor from images on a computer screen .
poor access when done by hand the operation is highly skilled and a shortage of clinicians able to carry out the surgery means only 10 % of people with the condition , called atrial fibrillation , are treated this way .
tony blair underwent the operation by hand in 2004 .
around 50,000 people develop atrial fibrillation , which is a major cause of strokes and heart failure , every year and it has been calculated to cost the nhs almost 1 % of its entire annual budget .
numbers are expected to increase even more due to an ageing population , a rising number of people with chronic heart disease and better diagnosis .
st mary 's consultant cardiologist , dr wyn davies , said : " in the uk a shortage of expertise means there are too few centres where highly complex cases can be carried out .
" the robot allows accuracy and control of catheter movement which can not currently be achieved without a skill level that usually takes considerable time to acquire . "
" the attraction is the potential for automation - we can get details about the patient 's heart anatomy from ct scans , then on the computer draw where you want the ablation delivered and hit return . "
he added that full automation was a few years away but he could envisage a scenario where a skilled operator could oversee multiple operations happening at once .
trudie lobban , chief executive of the arrhythmia alliance charity said the operation was highly successful and allowed people to lead normal lives .
" it 's like threading cotton through a very fine needle and with this new device it should be much easier and quicker to carry out and to train doctors to do it . "
professor peter weissberg , medical director of the british heart foundation , said : " through research we have learned that abnormal heart rhythms , like atrial fibrillation , are caused by a handful of rogue cells .
" extreme precision is required to track down and deal with these cells without damaging healthy tissue .

the robot is used to guide thin wires through blood vessels in the heart to treat a fast or irregular heartbeat .
doctors at st mary 's hospital in london say it will reduce risk for patients and increase the number of procedures they can carry out .
more than 20 patients have been operated on with the robot , which is only one of four in use in the world .
in the uk a shortage of expertise means there are too few centres where highly complex cases can be carried out dr wyn davies during the procedure , known as catheter ablation , several thin wires and tubes are inserted through a vein in the groin and guided into the heart where they deliver an electric current to specific areas of heart muscle .
the electric current destroys tiny portions of heart tissue which are causing the abnormal heartbeat .
with the sensei robot , surgeons use a joystick on a computer console to more accurately position and control the wires , which often need to be placed in locations that are difficult to reach .
in the future the system could be automated so the robot guides the wires to a point in the heart selected by the doctor from images on a computer screen .
poor access when done by hand the operation is highly skilled and a shortage of clinicians able to carry out the surgery means only 10 % of people with the condition , called atrial fibrillation , are treated this way .
tony blair underwent the operation by hand in 2004 .
around 50,000 people develop atrial fibrillation , which is a major cause of strokes and heart failure , every year and it has been calculated to cost the nhs almost 1 % of its entire annual budget .
numbers are expected to increase even more due to an ageing population , a rising number of people with chronic heart disease and better diagnosis .
st mary 's consultant cardiologist , dr wyn davies , said : " in the uk a shortage of expertise means there are too few centres where highly complex cases can be carried out .
" the robot allows accuracy and control of catheter movement which can not currently be achieved without a skill level that usually takes considerable time to acquire . "
" the attraction is the potential for automation - we can get details about the patient 's heart anatomy from ct scans , then on the computer draw where you want the ablation delivered and hit return . "
he added that full automation was a few years away but he could envisage a scenario where a skilled operator could oversee multiple operations happening at once .
trudie lobban , chief executive of the arrhythmia alliance charity said the operation was highly successful and allowed people to lead normal lives .
" it 's like threading cotton through a very fine needle and with this new device it should be much easier and quicker to carry out and to train doctors to do it . "
professor peter weissberg , medical director of the british heart foundation , said : " through research we have learned that abnormal heart rhythms , like atrial fibrillation , are caused by a handful of rogue cells .
" extreme precision is required to track down and deal with these cells without damaging healthy tissue .
" the early promising results suggest that this approach may greatly improve the treatment of some patients with atrial fibrillation . "

the robot is used to guide thin wires through blood vessels in the heart to treat a fast or irregular heartbeat .
doctors at st mary 's hospital in london say it will reduce risk for patients and increase the number of procedures they can carry out .

the electric current destroys tiny portions of heart tissue which are causing the abnormal heartbeat .
with the sensei robot , surgeons use a joystick on a computer console to more accurately position and control the wires , which often need to be placed in locations that are difficult to reach .
in the future the system could be automated so the robot guides the wires to a point in the heart selected by the doctor from images on a computer screen .

figures from across the political spectrum give their reaction .
angus macneil , snp mp who made complaint we 've had an investigation been going on for the past 16 months .
there have been 6,300 documents at the end of that given by the yard to the crown prosecution service .
the yard liaised with the cps through all this , and now it seems the cps are trying to tell us it 's all a wild goose chase .
it seems quite extraordinary , i have to say .
john mcternan , ex-blair aide who was interviewed a lot of us , particularly my colleague ruth turner , were put under the spotlight and there was a lot of speculation about us which we could n't answer because we were cooperating with the inquiry and not giving a running commentary on what was going on .
and so i think it 's a massive relief for everybody involved in this that at last a line can be drawn under it .
sir menzies campbell , liberal democrat leader if these reports are true and there is no question of criminal charges , there still remain many questions of political responsibility .
this whole affair has diminished politics and politicians in the eyes of the public .
never again must there be any question of any link between preferment and financial support .
sir alistair graham , ex-chairman of standards committee there was a major ethical failure by the previous prime minister in allowing the last general election to be financed on a sea of debt , without declaring that .
and who knows what might have happened in the last general election if everybody had known how each party was funding its election campaign .
denis macshane , labour mp if 12 years ago when i was in opposition i had written to scotland yard making allegations about how the conservative party was raising its money - and there were terrific stories around - i 'd have expected scotland yard to say to me : ' you 're an mp , you have a unique privilege in this nation called privilege , out your case in parliament . '
and what instead did happen was a letter comes in from the scottish nationalists , who 've benefited politically enormously from this , and scotland yard went off down this putting people through the most impossible torture .
ellfyn llwyd , plaid cymru mp who complained to the police about the allegations i said at the beginning that if the met -lsb- metropolitan police -rsb- investigated thoroughly , which they obviously did , i would be satisfied .
in my view , politics has won out , because the happy coincidence of mr a giving lots of money to the party becoming lord a should cease .
we have at least , partially cleaned out the stable .
to those who say a million pounds has been wasted i say it is a tiny amount of money being spent in iraq and afghanistan .
harriet harman , deputy labour leader it would n't be right for ministers to comment because the crown prosecution service is independent and does its job independently , as the police do .
but as far as party funding is concerned , we 've - after the allegations - we did change the law to make sure that loans , as well as donations , have to be disclosed and made public .
we 've got further discussions going on with the other political parties to make further changes in the funding of political parties .
and we 're going to reform the house of lords .
so , i think that a lot of change has come as a result of those allegations .
sir alan sugar , friend of lord levy he -lrb- lord levy -rrb- has been under tremendous stress , aggravated by the newspapers who , obviously , you ca n't keep anything private in this day and age .
but it has been looming over his head , it 's not nice to read in the newspapers every single day of your life that you 're going to get possible criminal prosecution , and i 've not been privy to any of the detail because obviously michael levy has had to keep it all to himself and his lawyers .
but no doubt one day we 'll hear what it was all about , but some say that it should never have got this far .

figures from across the political spectrum give their reaction .
angus macneil , snp mp who made complaint we 've had an investigation been going on for the past 16 months .
there have been 6,300 documents at the end of that given by the yard to the crown prosecution service .
the yard liaised with the cps through all this , and now it seems the cps are trying to tell us it 's all a wild goose chase .
it seems quite extraordinary , i have to say .
john mcternan , ex-blair aide who was interviewed a lot of us , particularly my colleague ruth turner , were put under the spotlight and there was a lot of speculation about us which we could n't answer because we were cooperating with the inquiry and not giving a running commentary on what was going on .
and so i think it 's a massive relief for everybody involved in this that at last a line can be drawn under it .
sir menzies campbell , liberal democrat leader if these reports are true and there is no question of criminal charges , there still remain many questions of political responsibility .
this whole affair has diminished politics and politicians in the eyes of the public .
never again must there be any question of any link between preferment and financial support .
sir alistair graham , ex-chairman of standards committee there was a major ethical failure by the previous prime minister in allowing the last general election to be financed on a sea of debt , without declaring that .
and who knows what might have happened in the last general election if everybody had known how each party was funding its election campaign .
denis macshane , labour mp if 12 years ago when i was in opposition i had written to scotland yard making allegations about how the conservative party was raising its money - and there were terrific stories around - i 'd have expected scotland yard to say to me : ' you 're an mp , you have a unique privilege in this nation called privilege , out your case in parliament . '
and what instead did happen was a letter comes in from the scottish nationalists , who 've benefited politically enormously from this , and scotland yard went off down this putting people through the most impossible torture .
ellfyn llwyd , plaid cymru mp who complained to the police about the allegations i said at the beginning that if the met -lsb- metropolitan police -rsb- investigated thoroughly , which they obviously did , i would be satisfied .
in my view , politics has won out , because the happy coincidence of mr a giving lots of money to the party becoming lord a should cease .
we have at least , partially cleaned out the stable .
to those who say a million pounds has been wasted i say it is a tiny amount of money being spent in iraq and afghanistan .
harriet harman , deputy labour leader it would n't be right for ministers to comment because the crown prosecution service is independent and does its job independently , as the police do .
but as far as party funding is concerned , we 've - after the allegations - we did change the law to make sure that loans , as well as donations , have to be disclosed and made public .
we 've got further discussions going on with the other political parties to make further changes in the funding of political parties .
and we 're going to reform the house of lords .
so , i think that a lot of change has come as a result of those allegations .

figures from across the political spectrum give their reaction .
angus macneil , snp mp who made complaint we 've had an investigation been going on for the past 16 months .
there have been 6,300 documents at the end of that given by the yard to the crown prosecution service .
the yard liaised with the cps through all this , and now it seems the cps are trying to tell us it 's all a wild goose chase .
it seems quite extraordinary , i have to say .
john mcternan , ex-blair aide who was interviewed a lot of us , particularly my colleague ruth turner , were put under the spotlight and there was a lot of speculation about us which we could n't answer because we were cooperating with the inquiry and not giving a running commentary on what was going on .
and so i think it 's a massive relief for everybody involved in this that at last a line can be drawn under it .
sir menzies campbell , liberal democrat leader if these reports are true and there is no question of criminal charges , there still remain many questions of political responsibility .
this whole affair has diminished politics and politicians in the eyes of the public .
never again must there be any question of any link between preferment and financial support .
sir alistair graham , ex-chairman of standards committee there was a major ethical failure by the previous prime minister in allowing the last general election to be financed on a sea of debt , without declaring that .
and who knows what might have happened in the last general election if everybody had known how each party was funding its election campaign .
denis macshane , labour mp if 12 years ago when i was in opposition i had written to scotland yard making allegations about how the conservative party was raising its money - and there were terrific stories around - i 'd have expected scotland yard to say to me : ' you 're an mp , you have a unique privilege in this nation called privilege , out your case in parliament . '
and what instead did happen was a letter comes in from the scottish nationalists , who 've benefited politically enormously from this , and scotland yard went off down this putting people through the most impossible torture .
ellfyn llwyd , plaid cymru mp who complained to the police about the allegations i said at the beginning that if the met -lsb- metropolitan police -rsb- investigated thoroughly , which they obviously did , i would be satisfied .
in my view , politics has won out , because the happy coincidence of mr a giving lots of money to the party becoming lord a should cease .
we have at least , partially cleaned out the stable .
to those who say a million pounds has been wasted i say it is a tiny amount of money being spent in iraq and afghanistan .
harriet harman , deputy labour leader it would n't be right for ministers to comment because the crown prosecution service is independent and does its job independently , as the police do .
but as far as party funding is concerned , we 've - after the allegations - we did change the law to make sure that loans , as well as donations , have to be disclosed and made public .
we 've got further discussions going on with the other political parties to make further changes in the funding of political parties .
and we 're going to reform the house of lords .
so , i think that a lot of change has come as a result of those allegations .
sir alan sugar , friend of lord levy he -lrb- lord levy -rrb- has been under tremendous stress , aggravated by the newspapers who , obviously , you ca n't keep anything private in this day and age .
but it has been looming over his head , it 's not nice to read in the newspapers every single day of your life that you 're going to get possible criminal prosecution , and i 've not been privy to any of the detail because obviously michael levy has had to keep it all to himself and his lawyers .

four people were arrested , including two of tony blair 's aides , during the £ 1m probe into whether honours were given in exchange for party donations .
prime minister gordon brown said it was right that police had investigated the " very serious allegations " .
but he said he hoped the official announcement expected later would bring to an end " months of speculation " .
speaking to reporters in paris , where he is discussing darfur with french president nicolas sarkozy , mr brown said he wanted to " move ahead " with reform of political funding .
former prime minister tony blair and labour fundraiser lord levy are expected to make statements later .
bbc political editor nick robinson says scotland yard is preparing to make a public defence of its officers .
serious allegations assistant commissioner john yates of the metropolitan police - who led the inquiry - has said from the outset his officers were simply doing their jobs by investigating serious allegations .
he was backed by chris fox , a former president of the association of chief police officers , who told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " i 'm confident that john yates and his team will have done everything they possibly could to get to the bottom of the allegations . "
now it seems the cps are trying to tell us it 's all a wild goose chase " angus macneil mp political reaction " when someone makes an allegation like that the police service have to take it seriously . "
the crown prosecution service is set to announce its decision on friday but has so far refused to comment .
but downing street adviser john mcternan , who was among those questioned , told the bbc : " it 's a massive relief for everybody involved in this that at last a line can be drawn under it . "
' a bit murky ' asked if he might consider taking action against the police he said : " the police , in my experience , were scrupulously fair in the way they treated me and i believe they did the same with my colleagues .
i do n't have any question about the way police conducted this investigation .
" i think everybody in politics wishes it had been done faster , because ultimately , for the public , it just looks a bit mucky and murky and i do n't think anybody who 's involved in politics actually genuinely believes that anybody at a senior level in any of the major parties is involved in anything dodgy in relationship to this . "
mr blair 's chief fundraiser lord levy , his director of government relations ruth turner and labour donor sir christopher evans were all arrested as part of the inquiry into whether people were nominated for peerages in return for donations to political parties .
mr blair , who was questioned three times as a potential witness , became the first sitting prime minister to be interviewed by police in the course of a criminal inquiry .
he is expected to make a statement later , as is lord levy .
speaking earlier to reporters outside his london home , a beaming lord levy said : " i think my face says how i feel . "
funding reform deputy labour leader harriet harman said it would not be right to comment on the decision , but said a lot of changes had been made in political funding .

tory leader david cameron said he would wait for the official announcement by the cps before commenting but said it was up to the police to decide what to investigate .
scottish national party mp angus macneil , who made the original complaint to scotland yard , told bbc two 's newsnight the outcome of the investigation was " quite extraordinary " .
he said : " we 've had an investigation going on for the past 16 months , there have been 6,300 documents at the end of that given by the yard to the crown prosecution service .
' politically instigated ' " the yard liaised with the cps through all this , and now it seems the cps are trying to tell us it 's all a wild goose chase . "
labour mp and former minister denis macshane , who has long been critical of the inquiry , said : " this was always a politically instigated investigation , launched by the scottish national party " .
liberal democrat leader sir menzies campbell said the whole affair had " diminished politics and politicians in the eyes of the public " . "
it 's done great damage to our political system " tony wright mp send us your comments " you have to deal with the question of public confidence .
" i think you have got to be totally transparent , you have got to ensure that the regulations that you have are properly enforced , and of course you have to have reform of the house of lords and , in my view , sensible state support for political parties . "
but labour mp tony wright , chairman of the public administration committee , told the bbc the investigation had been a " disaster for the police and a disaster for the political system " .
he added : " it 's done great damage to our political system .
our system is fundamentally clean .
it needs eternal vigilance but basically political issues need to be resolved by the political system . "

four people were arrested , including two of tony blair 's aides , during the £ 1m probe into whether honours were given in exchange for party donations .
prime minister gordon brown said it was right that police had investigated the " very serious allegations " .
but he said he hoped the official announcement expected later would bring to an end " months of speculation " .
speaking to reporters in paris , where he is discussing darfur with french president nicolas sarkozy , mr brown said he wanted to " move ahead " with reform of political funding .
former prime minister tony blair and labour fundraiser lord levy are expected to make statements later .
bbc political editor nick robinson says scotland yard is preparing to make a public defence of its officers .
serious allegations assistant commissioner john yates of the metropolitan police - who led the inquiry - has said from the outset his officers were simply doing their jobs by investigating serious allegations .
he was backed by chris fox , a former president of the association of chief police officers , who told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " i 'm confident that john yates and his team will have done everything they possibly could to get to the bottom of the allegations .
now it seems the cps are trying to tell us it 's all a wild goose chase angus macneil mp nick robinson 's blog political reaction " when someone makes an allegation like that the police service have to take it seriously . "
the crown prosecution service is set to announce its decision on friday but has so far refused to comment .
but downing street adviser john mcternan , who was among those questioned , told the bbc : " it 's a massive relief for everybody involved in this that at last a line can be drawn under it . "
' a bit murky ' asked if he might consider taking action against the police he said : " the police , in my experience , were scrupulously fair in the way they treated me and i believe they did the same with my colleagues .
i do n't have any question about the way police conducted this investigation .
" i think everybody in politics wishes it had been done faster , because ultimately , for the public , it just looks a bit mucky and murky and i do n't think anybody who 's involved in politics actually genuinely believes that anybody at a senior level in any of the major parties is involved in anything dodgy in relationship to this . "
lord levy : ' i think my face says how i feel ' mr blair 's chief fundraiser lord levy , his director of government relations ruth turner and labour donor sir christopher evans were all arrested as part of the inquiry into whether people were nominated for peerages in return for donations to political parties .
mr blair , who was questioned three times as a potential witness , became the first sitting prime minister to be interviewed by police in the course of a criminal inquiry .
he is expected to make a statement later , as is lord levy .
speaking earlier to reporters outside his london home , a beaming lord levy said : " i think my face says how i feel . "
funding reform deputy labour leader harriet harman said it would not be right to comment on the decision , but said a lot of changes had been made in political funding .
" after the allegations , we did change the law to make sure that loans , as well as donations , have to be disclosed and made public .

and we 're going to reform the house of lords . "
tory leader david cameron said he would wait for the official announcement by the cps before commenting but said it was up to the police to decide what to investigate .
scottish national party mp angus macneil , who made the original complaint to scotland yard , told bbc two 's newsnight the outcome of the investigation was " quite extraordinary " .
he said : " we 've had an investigation going on for the past 16 months , there have been 6,300 documents at the end of that given by the yard to the crown prosecution service .
' politically instigated ' " the yard liaised with the cps through all this , and now it seems the cps are trying to tell us it 's all a wild goose chase . "
labour mp and former minister denis macshane , who has long been critical of the inquiry , said : " this was always a politically instigated investigation , launched by the scottish national party " .

he was backed by chris fox , a former president of the association of chief police officers , who told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " i 'm confident that john yates and his team will have done everything they possibly could to get to the bottom of the allegations .
now it seems the cps are trying to tell us it 's all a wild goose chase angus macneil mp nick robinson 's blog political reaction " when someone makes an allegation like that the police service have to take it seriously . "
the crown prosecution service is set to announce its decision on friday but has so far refused to comment .
but downing street adviser john mcternan , who was among those questioned , told the bbc : " it 's a massive relief for everybody involved in this that at last a line can be drawn under it . "
' a bit murky ' asked if he might consider taking action against the police he said : " the police , in my experience , were scrupulously fair in the way they treated me and i believe they did the same with my colleagues .
i do n't have any question about the way police conducted this investigation .
" i think everybody in politics wishes it had been done faster , because ultimately , for the public , it just looks a bit mucky and murky and i do n't think anybody who 's involved in politics actually genuinely believes that anybody at a senior level in any of the major parties is involved in anything dodgy in relationship to this . "
lord levy : ' i think my face says how i feel ' mr blair 's chief fundraiser lord levy , his director of government relations ruth turner and labour donor sir christopher evans were all arrested as part of the inquiry into whether people were nominated for peerages in return for donations to political parties .
mr blair , who was questioned three times as a potential witness , became the first sitting prime minister to be interviewed by police in the course of a criminal inquiry .
he is expected to make a statement later , as is lord levy .
speaking earlier to reporters outside his london home , a beaming lord levy said : " i think my face says how i feel . "
funding reform deputy labour leader harriet harman said it would not be right to comment on the decision , but said a lot of changes had been made in political funding .
" after the allegations , we did change the law to make sure that loans , as well as donations , have to be disclosed and made public .
this whole affair has diminished politics and politicians in the eyes of the public sir menzies campbell liberal democrat leader q & a : cash-for-honours " we 've got further discussions going on with the other political parties to make further changes in the funding of political parties .
and we 're going to reform the house of lords . "
tory leader david cameron said he would wait for the official announcement by the cps before commenting but said it was up to the police to decide what to investigate .
scottish national party mp angus macneil , who made the original complaint to scotland yard , told bbc two 's newsnight the outcome of the investigation was " quite extraordinary " .
he said : " we 've had an investigation going on for the past 16 months , there have been 6,300 documents at the end of that given by the yard to the crown prosecution service .
' politically instigated ' " the yard liaised with the cps through all this , and now it seems the cps are trying to tell us it 's all a wild goose chase . "
labour mp and former minister denis macshane , who has long been critical of the inquiry , said : " this was always a politically instigated investigation , launched by the scottish national party " .
liberal democrat leader sir menzies campbell said the whole affair had " diminished politics and politicians in the eyes of the public " .
it 's done great damage to our political system tony wright mp send us your comments " you have to deal with the question of public confidence .
" i think you have got to be totally transparent , you have got to ensure that the regulations that you have are properly enforced , and of course you have to have reform of the house of lords and , in my view , sensible state support for political parties . "
but labour mp tony wright , chairman of the public administration committee , told the bbc the investigation had been a " disaster for the police and a disaster for the political system " .
he added : " it 's done great damage to our political system .
our system is fundamentally clean .
it needs eternal vigilance but basically political issues need to be resolved by the political system . "

philip walters said the number of deaths in bridgend , rhondda cynon taf and merthyr tydfil had " increased substantially " over the last few years .
over an 11-month period in 2006 , he said he dealt with nearly one case a week .
mr walters , who has been the area 's coroner for 25 years , said of those the vast majority were men under 30 .
latest figures show suicide rates across wales have been going down slightly in recent years , but mr walters said the rise in suicide in young men was a " nationwide phenomenon " .
there does n't appear to be any particular reason why , and it just happens out of the blue philip walters , coroner he said : " i think with young men , you 've got to be desperately concerned .
" it 's quite a high percentage and it seems to be higher in the valleys than in other parts of wales . "
mr walters said the most difficult question was why young men were committing suicide .
" it 's the coroner 's duty to find out how , and that 's not terribly difficult , why is a far more complex situation , " he said .
the coroner explained that in some cases " discussions or arguments " may have occurred prior to the event , but in others there was " no logic " .

anne parry , papyrus " there does n't appear to be any particular reason why , and it just happens out of the blue , and i think that is as great a concern to us as anything . "
the coroner 's comments have been echoed by the samaritans in wales , who are in the process of organising awareness campaign in those communities .
the organisation 's joanna greenslade said : " i 'm not at all surprised .
it is a problem and it 's a very large problem throughout wales .
" we 've looked at figures in neath and port talbot area and again they 're very high .
we do have a major concern for young men .
we 're very worried about it . "
feelings of despair and hopelessness are the main factors in suicide , according to anne parry , chair of papyrus , a charity dedicated to preventing suicide of young people .
she said key to dealing with the issue was encouraging young men to talk about their emotions , adding : " our message is that suicide is not inevitable if you are feeling suicidal .
" we 're trying to tell people that there is hope out there and that they must talk about it and they must seek help and we 're not just talking statutory services , help from friends and family too . "

the people 's bank of china -lrb- pbc -rrb- ordered an increase of 0.27 % of a point in commercial banks ' benchmark one-year deposit and lending rates .
the increases will take effect on 21 july , the bank said .
the one-year benchmark deposit rate will move to 3.33 % from 3.06 % , while the one-year lending rate will rise to 6.84 % from 6.57 % .
the move comes a day after data showing that china 's economy outstripped analysts expectations during the second quarter , growing by 11.9 % from a year before .
on thursday , the government said it would " improve macro controls " to rein in the economy .
the rapid growth has pushed inflation to a 33-month high of 4.4 % for the year to june .
a boom in production , fuelled by strong exports and investment , is contributing to the inflationary risks the country now faces .
' far from enough ' the central bank has now raised interest rates five times since april 2006 .
zhang yongjun , economist at the state information centre in beijing said : " i think the rate rises could curb the rapid investment growth and credit expansion to a certain degree .
" but it 's far from enough .
the current interest rates are still low and real deposit rates are in negative territory . "
others said the move was widely expected , but would not be enough to curb inflation .
lin songli , an analyst at guosen securities in beijing added : " it will not completely ease inflationary pressure in the second half , because current fast cpi growth is mainly due to the short supply of pork and other foodstuffs . "
the pbc said the rate adjustment would help to " guide reasonable growth of credit and investment , adjust and stabilise expectations about inflation and maintain basic stability of general price levels " .

the rapid growth has pushed inflation to a 33-month high of 4.4 % for the year to june .
a boom in production , fuelled by strong exports and investment , is contributing to the inflationary risks the country now faces .
' far from enough ' the central bank has now raised interest rates five times since april 2006 .
zhang yongjun , economist at the state information centre in beijing said : " i think the rate rises could curb the rapid investment growth and credit expansion to a certain degree .
" but it 's far from enough .
the current interest rates are still low and real deposit rates are in negative territory . "
others said the move was widely expected , but would not be enough to curb inflation .
lin songli , an analyst at guosen securities in beijing added : " it will not completely ease inflationary pressure in the second half , because current fast cpi growth is mainly due to the short supply of pork and other foodstuffs . "
the pbc said the rate adjustment would help to " guide reasonable growth of credit and investment , adjust and stabilise expectations about inflation and maintain basic stability of general price levels " .
