program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 24.08.2007 germany to ease restrictions for influx of foreign skilled labor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs more skilled workers in an attempt to resolve shortages of skilled labor in key economic sectors , the german government is planning to ease labor restrictions for foreign skilled workers from central and eastern european eu member states . at a two-day retreat at meseberg palace north of berlin , the german coalition government has agreed to develop a comprehensive plan that would make it significantly easier for qualified foreign workers to get a job in germany .
sources close to the government now said that , in the short term , electrical and mechanic engineers from the 12 newer eu member states could be allowed to start working in germany as early as oct .
1 without having to apply for a work permit .
industry representatives welcomed the government 's decision to open up parts of the labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minimum wage requirements for foreign workers are expected to go down " it 's a good thing that the government in meseberg decided to implement not only short-term measures , but also to develop a master plan that 's a bit more medium-term oriented , " said achim dercks , deputy chief executive of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
comprehensive plan the plan - which will be developed jointly by the ministries of labor and education over the next few months - will also address the issue of reducing the minimum wage requirement for foreign workers , which is currently set at 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 115,000 -rrb- per year .
this issue has been a thorn in the eye of german employers who have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
german education minister annette schavan previously suggested that the wage requirement should be lowered to between 40,000 and 60,000 euros .
additionally , foreign students who complete a course of study at a german university will be able to work without hurdles for three years after graduation .
the government agreed that , in the long term , targeted immigration was " necessary and desirable , " especially in view of germany 's increasingly ageing population .
it also stressed , however , that exhausting the potential of the domestic german labor market was also a priority that could be achieved by training and educating the unemployed .
fundamental rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been struggling with unemployment the free movement of labor is one of the most fundamental rights guaranteed to all eu citizens , but , in reality , not all eu citizens are born equal .
with an eastward expansion of the union , transitional measures were introduced to protect national labor markets . germany - having struggled itself with unemployment for years - was one of the few eu nations which required that citizens from the new member states apply for work permits .
work permits were granted only in those cases in which it could be proved that no qualified german workers could be found for the given position . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

due to its successful stewardship of the eu and the g8 this year , germany felt ready to take a seat at the top table of global politics .
now , however , it believes it is being relegated to the sidelines . if the old adage " a week is a long time in politics " is true , then two months must seem like an eternity .
it certainly appears to be the case for germany .
at the end of june this year , the german government relinquished the reins of the european union 's presidency with applause and platitudes hanging in the balmy berlin air .
the g8 summit in heiligendamm it hosted in early june as this year 's head of the group was seen as a success . but less than eight weeks later , clouds of discontent have settled over the german capital and the chill blowing down its wide streets has more to do with an international cold shoulder than the onset of fall .
the perceived spurn was all the more surprising since in the first six months of 2007 , angela merkel 's government managed to drive a reluctant eu and a stubborn g8 down the road of multilateralism . the notoriously fractious eu states were strapped together in unity around a european climate protection program and were rallied into a series of reforms ; no mean feat by anyone 's standards .
more impressively , germany managed to get the united states to sign on to an international climate accord in heiligendamm .
less publicly , germany worked hard to secure peace in the middle east , the release of hostages in afghanistan and the freedom of bulgarian nurses on death row in libya among other diplomatic efforts around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was no.1 in brussels after her successes at eu level when it came to handing over the power , merkel and her team were satisfied that germany had played a significant role in setting a new multilateral , international agenda , and created diplomatic structures for its successors to build on .
all in all , it had been a successful tenure , as approval ratings and commentaries proved .
but although they once were the ones setting the agenda , merkel and co. now are left to read in the newspapers the outcome of decisions they should have been closely involved in .
blair appointment during its eu presidency , germany was very active in the middle east .
chancellor merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier both made numerous visits to the region , attempting to persuade israel and the palestinians to return to the negotiating table , supporting the fragile democracy in lebanon and maintaining an even-handed eu involvement in the surrounding countries .
merkel had made the middle east her main foreign-affairs focus at the start of the eu presidency , continuing a german belief that a secure middle east meant a secure europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's appointment was reported to germany by the media however , just days before germany 's role as head of the eu came to an end , the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the us , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- announced that former british prime minister tony blair would be its special envoy to the region .
steinmeier 's reaction suggested that it had been less a quartet decision and more the work of a trio , with germany as eu representative cut out of the loop .
his remonstrations with his quartet colleagues were widely reported . despite merkel 's denials of a rift , it was clear that germany had not been consulted on blair 's appointment , which was reportedly first made known to the government in a front page headline . but amelia torres , acting spokesperson for the european commission , said that no german dissatisfaction was registered in brussels . " the commission is not aware of -lrb- the german -rrb- claims and , as far as we are concerned , all the decisions involving the european union were taken in consultation with all eu partners , " she said . still , germany 's leadership , at least in the eyes of berlin , was being challenged and its credibility as a global player undermined .
imf appointment rushed through by france two weeks later , the germans got another surprise .
while the appointment of former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn as the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- had been proposed by recently elected french president nicolas sarkozy , germany had been cautious about his candidacy .
sarkozy 's intentions concerning european financial institutions and policies had caused concern in berlin and a move to install strauss-kahn had increased the jitters .
when it was announced that strauss-kahn had the imf job , it was the media once again who informed germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy aggressively campaigned for strauss-kahn " it 's worth pointing out that germany was by no means the only country that felt ' under-consulted ' on these developments , " said bastian giegerich from the international center for strategic studies .
" french and us activism surprised other partners , such as the british , italians and spaniards just as much .
in the cases of the strauss-kahn and blair decisions , presidents sarkozy and bush chose to push choices aggressively . "
michael link , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp 's faction in the bundestag and his party 's eu expert , insisted that there was no snub over the imf job . " germany was involved , " he said . " and germany has had , at several instances , debated all sorts of critical issues in a very open way with the new french administration . " germany , however , was still convinced it was being pushed further to the sidelines .
sarkozys steal limelight in libya more french-inspired aggravation was to follow .
during his numerous visits to the middle east , steinmeier had been working together with the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner to secure the release of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor accused of infecting children with hiv in libya . steinmeier and ferrero-waldner were campaigning together against the death sentence issued to the six medics up until germany 's eu presidency expired .
it was assumed that the efforts would then be continued by luis amado , the foreign minister of succeeding eu president , portugal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cecilia sarkozy : " really , it was nothing . "
imagine germany 's surprise when president sarkozy 's wife cecilia appeared on the steps of a french aircraft to present the newly free nurses to the world media while her husband shook hands and made deals with libyan dictator moammar gadhafi in tripoli .
while the german foreign ministry once again made calming noises , individual politicians were livid .
some went public with claims that president sarkozy had only made a move to free the nurses to win contracts in libya while others called for france to realign itself with european interests , and not just focus on its own .
" regarding the release of the bulgarian nurses , " giegerich added , " i think the feeling in berlin is that germany had done a lot of very constructive behind-the-scenes work which ultimately contributed to the release and sarkozy stole the limelight , which of course leaves a bitter taste . " " the pictures of the release of the bulgarian nurses fitted the whole image of this libyan justice scandal : théâtre absurde , " the fdp 's michael link added .
" minister steinmeier worked hard for that release .
the real progress was made during the german eu presidency .
that 's what counts .
and everybody in the eu knows that . " in each of these cases , the situation was resolved with a welcome outcome for many .
blair will push for peace in the middle east , strauss-kahn will head the imf with european influence , and the bulgarian nurses have their freedom .
for the german government , it might be a case of credit not given where credit was due .
but was germany really ignored ?
an end to germany 's multilateralist approach ? " while it would not be completely accurate to say that germany was ignored in any of these cases , the way in which these events occurred stands in fairly sharp contrast to the consensus-building and mediating character of current german foreign policy under chancellor merkel 's leadership , " giegerich said . " the question for the future is thus whether merkel 's mode of policy-making , which has been successful so far both domestically and internationally , is sustainable , " he added . but link said he believes that germany has nothing to worry about . " the german government has overcome the shortcomings of the narrow and self-sufficient foreign-policy activities of messrs. schröder and fischer , " he said .
" and germany ’ s role as largest eu member should always be an integrating one , not a polarizing one .
but nothing in international politics is for granted .
our government must work hard in order to increase that role . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

due to its successful stewardship of the eu and the g8 this year , germany felt ready to take a seat at the top table of global politics .
now , however , it believes it is being relegated to the sidelines . if the old adage " a week is a long time in politics " is true , then two months must seem like an eternity .
it certainly appears to be the case for germany .
at the end of june this year , the german government relinquished the reins of the european union 's presidency with applause and platitudes hanging in the balmy berlin air .
the g8 summit in heiligendamm it hosted in early june as this year 's head of the group was seen as a success . but less than eight weeks later , clouds of discontent have settled over the german capital and the chill blowing down its wide streets has more to do with an international cold shoulder than the onset of fall .
the perceived spurn was all the more surprising since in the first six months of 2007 , angela merkel 's government managed to drive a reluctant eu and a stubborn g8 down the road of multilateralism . the notoriously fractious eu states were strapped together in unity around a european climate protection program and were rallied into a series of reforms ; no mean feat by anyone 's standards .
more impressively , germany managed to get the united states to sign on to an international climate accord in heiligendamm .
less publicly , germany worked hard to secure peace in the middle east , the release of hostages in afghanistan and the freedom of bulgarian nurses on death row in libya among other diplomatic efforts around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was no.1 in brussels after her successes at eu level when it came to handing over the power , merkel and her team were satisfied that germany had played a significant role in setting a new multilateral , international agenda , and created diplomatic structures for its successors to build on .
all in all , it had been a successful tenure , as approval ratings and commentaries proved .
but although they once were the ones setting the agenda , merkel and co. now are left to read in the newspapers the outcome of decisions they should have been closely involved in .
blair appointment during its eu presidency , germany was very active in the middle east .
chancellor merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier both made numerous visits to the region , attempting to persuade israel and the palestinians to return to the negotiating table , supporting the fragile democracy in lebanon and maintaining an even-handed eu involvement in the surrounding countries .
merkel had made the middle east her main foreign-affairs focus at the start of the eu presidency , continuing a german belief that a secure middle east meant a secure europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's appointment was reported to germany by the media however , just days before germany 's role as head of the eu came to an end , the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the us , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- announced that former british prime minister tony blair would be its special envoy to the region .
steinmeier 's reaction suggested that it had been less a quartet decision and more the work of a trio , with germany as eu representative cut out of the loop .
his remonstrations with his quartet colleagues were widely reported . despite merkel 's denials of a rift , it was clear that germany had not been consulted on blair 's appointment , which was reportedly first made known to the government in a front page headline . but amelia torres , acting spokesperson for the european commission , said that no german dissatisfaction was registered in brussels . " the commission is not aware of -lrb- the german -rrb- claims and , as far as we are concerned , all the decisions involving the european union were taken in consultation with all eu partners , " she said . still , germany 's leadership , at least in the eyes of berlin , was being challenged and its credibility as a global player undermined .
imf appointment rushed through by france two weeks later , the germans got another surprise .
while the appointment of former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn as the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- had been proposed by recently elected french president nicolas sarkozy , germany had been cautious about his candidacy .
sarkozy 's intentions concerning european financial institutions and policies had caused concern in berlin and a move to install strauss-kahn had increased the jitters .
when it was announced that strauss-kahn had the imf job , it was the media once again who informed germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy aggressively campaigned for strauss-kahn " it 's worth pointing out that germany was by no means the only country that felt ' under-consulted ' on these developments , " said bastian giegerich from the international center for strategic studies .
" french and us activism surprised other partners , such as the british , italians and spaniards just as much .

due to its successful stewardship of the eu and the g8 this year , germany felt ready to take a seat at the top table of global politics .
now , however , it believes it is being relegated to the sidelines . if the old adage " a week is a long time in politics " is true , then two months must seem like an eternity .
it certainly appears to be the case for germany .
at the end of june this year , the german government relinquished the reins of the european union 's presidency with applause and platitudes hanging in the balmy berlin air .
the g8 summit in heiligendamm it hosted in early june as this year 's head of the group was seen as a success . but less than eight weeks later , clouds of discontent have settled over the german capital and the chill blowing down its wide streets has more to do with an international cold shoulder than the onset of fall .
the perceived spurn was all the more surprising since in the first six months of 2007 , angela merkel 's government managed to drive a reluctant eu and a stubborn g8 down the road of multilateralism . the notoriously fractious eu states were strapped together in unity around a european climate protection program and were rallied into a series of reforms ; no mean feat by anyone 's standards .
more impressively , germany managed to get the united states to sign on to an international climate accord in heiligendamm .
less publicly , germany worked hard to secure peace in the middle east , the release of hostages in afghanistan and the freedom of bulgarian nurses on death row in libya among other diplomatic efforts around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was no.1 in brussels after her successes at eu level when it came to handing over the power , merkel and her team were satisfied that germany had played a significant role in setting a new multilateral , international agenda , and created diplomatic structures for its successors to build on .
all in all , it had been a successful tenure , as approval ratings and commentaries proved .
but although they once were the ones setting the agenda , merkel and co. now are left to read in the newspapers the outcome of decisions they should have been closely involved in .
blair appointment during its eu presidency , germany was very active in the middle east .
chancellor merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier both made numerous visits to the region , attempting to persuade israel and the palestinians to return to the negotiating table , supporting the fragile democracy in lebanon and maintaining an even-handed eu involvement in the surrounding countries .
merkel had made the middle east her main foreign-affairs focus at the start of the eu presidency , continuing a german belief that a secure middle east meant a secure europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's appointment was reported to germany by the media however , just days before germany 's role as head of the eu came to an end , the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the us , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- announced that former british prime minister tony blair would be its special envoy to the region .

it is unlikely , however , that it has ever had an ancient cursed relic pass over its front desk before . many people come back from holiday with little souvenirs that they shouldn ’ t really have .
exotic seashells plucked from the sand of the south china seas , carvings made from the bough of an endangered amazonian tree and medicines made from rare animal parts may add a slight weight to the conscience in more reflective times but none are likely to cause the ill-advised tourist a life of disease and an agonizing death .
this , however , was the alleged outcome of one man ’ s visit to egypt back in 2004 .
according to the unnamed german man ’ s stepson in a note handed in together with a stolen carving to egypt 's embassy in berlin this week , the unwitting thief returned to germany from his exotic travels to suffer from unexplained paralysis , nausea , mysterious fevers and ultimately the terminal cancer which claimed his life .
son claims stepfather killed by curse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mummy was most displeased the stepson , also anonymously , claimed that the artifact , which displayed a hieroglyphic text , was responsible for bringing the " curse of the pharaohs " onto his family .
the note with the stolen fragment said that the man felt obliged to return the carving to make amends for his late stepfather 's light-fingered-ness and enable his soul to rest in peace , as well as freeing his relatives from potential repercussions .
the egyptian embassy in berlin sent the fragment back to egypt by diplomatic pouch and it has since been handed over to the supreme council for antiquities , where a committee of experts was trying to ascertain its authenticity , the council statement said .
the belief in a curse that strikes down anyone who disturbs the tombs or mummies of ancient egypt 's pharaohs has been around since the discovery of tutankhamun 's tomb in 1922 and the subsequent death of the excavation 's financier lord carnarvon . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 24.08.2007 germany launches initiative against dangerous products großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polly pocket dolls made by mattel were among the thousands recalled over lead fears while the scandal and embarassment over dangerous and defective children 's toys continues in china , germany has announced an intitiative to promote stringent safety standards within the european union . the recall of 18 million chinese-made products by us toy giant mattel because of safety concerns has led to germany launching its own initiative against defective and dangerous products .
the german economics ministry announced thursday that it planned to host a round-table discussion on the subject on august 30 with manufacturers , industry groups , consumer protection organizations and the 16 regional states .
while acknowledging that the european union sets high standards for product quality , the ministry ’ s statement called for more to be done to and suggested a quality seal verifying products are safe .
" labelling to indicate the quality -lrb- of a product -rrb- is in the most basic interest of the german economy , " the ministry said .
" german products in particular but also european products with high quality standards must compete on the market every day against much more cheaply produced products - for example from asia . "
product scandal rumbles on the slogan " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months .
hardly a day goes by without criticism about the dangers to which chinese-made products might expose consumers .
the scandals of recent weeks revolving around the safety of chinese-manufactured goods and even food reached a pinnacle when the concerns moved into children 's rooms with scares over polly pocket , batman and barbie dolls .
previously , the chemical melamine in chinese wheat-gluten exports used in pet food were blamed for the deaths of dogs and cats in the united states .
this was followed by headlines about contaminated seafood and fruit , and poisonous industrial diethylene glycol in cough syrups and toothpaste .
additionally , chinese cars exported abroad fared terribly in crash tests in germany and russia .
while the us has been sounding the alarm for weeks , the reactions of european consumers remained relatively muffled until mattel started recalling millions of toys this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbie : all dressed up and nowhere to go the company announced that tests found dangerously high lead content in the lacquer of its toys and that attached magnets came loose easily and could be swallowed by small children .
those discoveries woke up the europeans , while for the chinese a lot is now on the gaming board .
the hurried reaction of beijing 's trade ministry was to declare that the problem had been blown out of proportion , but to also pledge to spare no effort to ensure the safety of chinese export goods .
low standards ignored for cheap goods but the toy scandal also raised questions about mattel 's responsibility as well as the usual networks of subcontractors , middlemen and factories in china , where workers toil for extremely low wages in often hazardous conditions .
by producing in china , companies can maximize their profit margins , while consumers in western countries are either unaware of or choose to ignore the miserable working conditions as they have come to expect low prices for products such as dvd players , personal computers , textiles and shoes .
bildunterschrift : a " sweat shop " factory common to asia china 's government , meanwhile , concedes that black sheep do exist among local manufacturers , but insists that foreign companies had a responsibility for monitoring the quality of their products too .
this is because barbie or batman dolls , for example , were not marketed in europe and the us by chinese companies but under the renowned brand " mattel , " which traditionally stood for quality and safety .
meanwhile , the country 's toy-manufacturing industry has expressed embarrassment over the scandal and fears losing future business .
" we feel deep sorrow over the irresponsible attitude of some companies , " said the industry association in a statement and added that it would assume responsibility for improving quality standards .
" we must use this lesson as an opportunity to raise management standards , " the statement said .
firms should refrain from accepting orders that are " low priced and with unclear quality requirements " or which exceeded their manufacturing capacities .
eu , china trade accusations and admonishments more often than not , european reports to the chinese about certain unsafe products are simply ignored , which recently prompted the eu commissioner for consumer protection , meglena kuneva , to admonish beijing that " more has to be done -lrb- to ensure the safety of locally manufactured goods destined for export -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson is in the middle of an eu-china spat again earlier this week , china claimed that the eu was using concerns over chinese export standards as a form of protectionism , a claim that trade commissioner , peter mandelson , dismissed as " totally false . "
" as trade commissioner , i will not accept claims of toxicity being used as a pretext for protectionism .
equally , i will give firm backing to european companies having to reject goods that are dangerous to consumers , " he added china already has to deal with more than enough trouble domestically through contaminated food , counterfeit medicines or products which do not comply with required quality standards of local markets .
increasing concern among the general population and fear of social instability has prompted the government to order state-run media to refrain from publishing product-quality news .
because of the ban , the average chinese citizen does n't know about the recent toy scandal or complaints about the low safety standards of exported goods . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however he still has the best rating since charles de gaulle . according to a recent opinion poll , 61 percent of the french population rate nicolas sarkozy 's performance as either " very " or " fairly " good .
the survey was conducted by the ipsos institute which surveyed a representative sample of 1,000 french adults . the results were published on thursday -lrb- 23.8 -rrb- in the weekly magazine le point and represent a fall of five percent in the new president 's popularity rating since the last poll was conducted in july .

sources close to the government now said that , in the short term , electrical and mechanic engineers from the 12 newer eu member states could be allowed to start working in germany as early as oct .

industry representatives welcomed the government 's decision to open up parts of the labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minimum wage requirements for foreign workers are expected to go down " it 's a good thing that the government in meseberg decided to implement not only short-term measures , but also to develop a master plan that 's a bit more medium-term oriented , " said achim dercks , deputy chief executive of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
comprehensive plan the plan - which will be developed jointly by the ministries of labor and education over the next few months - will also address the issue of reducing the minimum wage requirement for foreign workers , which is currently set at 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 115,000 -rrb- per year .
this issue has been a thorn in the eye of german employers who have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
german education minister annette schavan previously suggested that the wage requirement should be lowered to between 40,000 and 60,000 euros .
additionally , foreign students who complete a course of study at a german university will be able to work without hurdles for three years after graduation .
the government agreed that , in the long term , targeted immigration was " necessary and desirable , " especially in view of germany 's increasingly ageing population .
it also stressed , however , that exhausting the potential of the domestic german labor market was also a priority that could be achieved by training and educating the unemployed .

the german economics ministry announced thursday that it planned to host a round-table discussion on the subject on august 30 with manufacturers , industry groups , consumer protection organizations and the 16 regional states .
while acknowledging that the european union sets high standards for product quality , the ministry ’ s statement called for more to be done to and suggested a quality seal verifying products are safe .
" labelling to indicate the quality -lrb- of a product -rrb- is in the most basic interest of the german economy , " the ministry said .
" german products in particular but also european products with high quality standards must compete on the market every day against much more cheaply produced products - for example from asia . "
product scandal rumbles on the slogan " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months .
hardly a day goes by without criticism about the dangers to which chinese-made products might expose consumers .
the scandals of recent weeks revolving around the safety of chinese-manufactured goods and even food reached a pinnacle when the concerns moved into children 's rooms with scares over polly pocket , batman and barbie dolls .
previously , the chemical melamine in chinese wheat-gluten exports used in pet food were blamed for the deaths of dogs and cats in the united states .
this was followed by headlines about contaminated seafood and fruit , and poisonous industrial diethylene glycol in cough syrups and toothpaste .
additionally , chinese cars exported abroad fared terribly in crash tests in germany and russia .
while the us has been sounding the alarm for weeks , the reactions of european consumers remained relatively muffled until mattel started recalling millions of toys this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbie : all dressed up and nowhere to go the company announced that tests found dangerously high lead content in the lacquer of its toys and that attached magnets came loose easily and could be swallowed by small children .
those discoveries woke up the europeans , while for the chinese a lot is now on the gaming board .
the hurried reaction of beijing 's trade ministry was to declare that the problem had been blown out of proportion , but to also pledge to spare no effort to ensure the safety of chinese export goods .
low standards ignored for cheap goods but the toy scandal also raised questions about mattel 's responsibility as well as the usual networks of subcontractors , middlemen and factories in china , where workers toil for extremely low wages in often hazardous conditions .
by producing in china , companies can maximize their profit margins , while consumers in western countries are either unaware of or choose to ignore the miserable working conditions as they have come to expect low prices for products such as dvd players , personal computers , textiles and shoes .
bildunterschrift : a " sweat shop " factory common to asia china 's government , meanwhile , concedes that black sheep do exist among local manufacturers , but insists that foreign companies had a responsibility for monitoring the quality of their products too .
this is because barbie or batman dolls , for example , were not marketed in europe and the us by chinese companies but under the renowned brand " mattel , " which traditionally stood for quality and safety .
meanwhile , the country 's toy-manufacturing industry has expressed embarrassment over the scandal and fears losing future business .
" we feel deep sorrow over the irresponsible attitude of some companies , " said the industry association in a statement and added that it would assume responsibility for improving quality standards .
" we must use this lesson as an opportunity to raise management standards , " the statement said .
firms should refrain from accepting orders that are " low priced and with unclear quality requirements " or which exceeded their manufacturing capacities .
eu , china trade accusations and admonishments more often than not , european reports to the chinese about certain unsafe products are simply ignored , which recently prompted the eu commissioner for consumer protection , meglena kuneva , to admonish beijing that " more has to be done -lrb- to ensure the safety of locally manufactured goods destined for export -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson is in the middle of an eu-china spat again earlier this week , china claimed that the eu was using concerns over chinese export standards as a form of protectionism , a claim that trade commissioner , peter mandelson , dismissed as " totally false .

equally , i will give firm backing to european companies having to reject goods that are dangerous to consumers , " he added china already has to deal with more than enough trouble domestically through contaminated food , counterfeit medicines or products which do not comply with required quality standards of local markets .
increasing concern among the general population and fear of social instability has prompted the government to order state-run media to refrain from publishing product-quality news .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 24.08.2007 germany launches initiative against dangerous products großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polly pocket dolls made by mattel were among the thousands recalled over lead fears while the scandal and embarassment over dangerous and defective children 's toys continues in china , germany has announced an intitiative to promote stringent safety standards within the european union . the recall of 18 million chinese-made products by us toy giant mattel because of safety concerns has led to germany launching its own initiative against defective and dangerous products .
the german economics ministry announced thursday that it planned to host a round-table discussion on the subject on august 30 with manufacturers , industry groups , consumer protection organizations and the 16 regional states .
while acknowledging that the european union sets high standards for product quality , the ministry ’ s statement called for more to be done to and suggested a quality seal verifying products are safe .
" labelling to indicate the quality -lrb- of a product -rrb- is in the most basic interest of the german economy , " the ministry said .
" german products in particular but also european products with high quality standards must compete on the market every day against much more cheaply produced products - for example from asia . "
product scandal rumbles on the slogan " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months .
hardly a day goes by without criticism about the dangers to which chinese-made products might expose consumers .
the scandals of recent weeks revolving around the safety of chinese-manufactured goods and even food reached a pinnacle when the concerns moved into children 's rooms with scares over polly pocket , batman and barbie dolls .
previously , the chemical melamine in chinese wheat-gluten exports used in pet food were blamed for the deaths of dogs and cats in the united states .
this was followed by headlines about contaminated seafood and fruit , and poisonous industrial diethylene glycol in cough syrups and toothpaste .
additionally , chinese cars exported abroad fared terribly in crash tests in germany and russia .
while the us has been sounding the alarm for weeks , the reactions of european consumers remained relatively muffled until mattel started recalling millions of toys this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbie : all dressed up and nowhere to go the company announced that tests found dangerously high lead content in the lacquer of its toys and that attached magnets came loose easily and could be swallowed by small children .
those discoveries woke up the europeans , while for the chinese a lot is now on the gaming board .
the hurried reaction of beijing 's trade ministry was to declare that the problem had been blown out of proportion , but to also pledge to spare no effort to ensure the safety of chinese export goods .
low standards ignored for cheap goods but the toy scandal also raised questions about mattel 's responsibility as well as the usual networks of subcontractors , middlemen and factories in china , where workers toil for extremely low wages in often hazardous conditions .
by producing in china , companies can maximize their profit margins , while consumers in western countries are either unaware of or choose to ignore the miserable working conditions as they have come to expect low prices for products such as dvd players , personal computers , textiles and shoes .
bildunterschrift : a " sweat shop " factory common to asia china 's government , meanwhile , concedes that black sheep do exist among local manufacturers , but insists that foreign companies had a responsibility for monitoring the quality of their products too .
this is because barbie or batman dolls , for example , were not marketed in europe and the us by chinese companies but under the renowned brand " mattel , " which traditionally stood for quality and safety .
meanwhile , the country 's toy-manufacturing industry has expressed embarrassment over the scandal and fears losing future business .
" we feel deep sorrow over the irresponsible attitude of some companies , " said the industry association in a statement and added that it would assume responsibility for improving quality standards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 24.08.2007 germany launches initiative against dangerous products großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polly pocket dolls made by mattel were among the thousands recalled over lead fears while the scandal and embarassment over dangerous and defective children 's toys continues in china , germany has announced an intitiative to promote stringent safety standards within the european union . the recall of 18 million chinese-made products by us toy giant mattel because of safety concerns has led to germany launching its own initiative against defective and dangerous products .
the german economics ministry announced thursday that it planned to host a round-table discussion on the subject on august 30 with manufacturers , industry groups , consumer protection organizations and the 16 regional states .
while acknowledging that the european union sets high standards for product quality , the ministry ’ s statement called for more to be done to and suggested a quality seal verifying products are safe .
" labelling to indicate the quality -lrb- of a product -rrb- is in the most basic interest of the german economy , " the ministry said .
" german products in particular but also european products with high quality standards must compete on the market every day against much more cheaply produced products - for example from asia . "
product scandal rumbles on the slogan " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months .
hardly a day goes by without criticism about the dangers to which chinese-made products might expose consumers .
the scandals of recent weeks revolving around the safety of chinese-manufactured goods and even food reached a pinnacle when the concerns moved into children 's rooms with scares over polly pocket , batman and barbie dolls .
previously , the chemical melamine in chinese wheat-gluten exports used in pet food were blamed for the deaths of dogs and cats in the united states .
this was followed by headlines about contaminated seafood and fruit , and poisonous industrial diethylene glycol in cough syrups and toothpaste .
additionally , chinese cars exported abroad fared terribly in crash tests in germany and russia .
while the us has been sounding the alarm for weeks , the reactions of european consumers remained relatively muffled until mattel started recalling millions of toys this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbie : all dressed up and nowhere to go the company announced that tests found dangerously high lead content in the lacquer of its toys and that attached magnets came loose easily and could be swallowed by small children .
those discoveries woke up the europeans , while for the chinese a lot is now on the gaming board .
the hurried reaction of beijing 's trade ministry was to declare that the problem had been blown out of proportion , but to also pledge to spare no effort to ensure the safety of chinese export goods .
low standards ignored for cheap goods but the toy scandal also raised questions about mattel 's responsibility as well as the usual networks of subcontractors , middlemen and factories in china , where workers toil for extremely low wages in often hazardous conditions .
by producing in china , companies can maximize their profit margins , while consumers in western countries are either unaware of or choose to ignore the miserable working conditions as they have come to expect low prices for products such as dvd players , personal computers , textiles and shoes .
bildunterschrift : a " sweat shop " factory common to asia china 's government , meanwhile , concedes that black sheep do exist among local manufacturers , but insists that foreign companies had a responsibility for monitoring the quality of their products too .
this is because barbie or batman dolls , for example , were not marketed in europe and the us by chinese companies but under the renowned brand " mattel , " which traditionally stood for quality and safety .
meanwhile , the country 's toy-manufacturing industry has expressed embarrassment over the scandal and fears losing future business .
" we feel deep sorrow over the irresponsible attitude of some companies , " said the industry association in a statement and added that it would assume responsibility for improving quality standards .
" we must use this lesson as an opportunity to raise management standards , " the statement said .
firms should refrain from accepting orders that are " low priced and with unclear quality requirements " or which exceeded their manufacturing capacities .

"
he said on friday morning on german public broadcaster ard that it would contribute to a 35 to 36 percent reduction in co2 emissions by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 . with additional government programs , germany would reach its goal of 40 percent reduction in emissions by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel and merkel went to greenland last week to discuss climate protection higher taxes on gas-guzzling vehicles , greater emphasis on alternatives energy forms and stricter energy-saving requirements are at the core of the package 's 30 points , according to reports . these measures will make germany one of the " most energy-efficient regions in the world , " said economics minister michael glos , who had been involved in intense negotiations with gabriel before thursday 's meeting .
glos is a member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , while gabriel is a social democrat . at a joint presentation of the approved plan at the government 's summer retreat at meseberg palace near berlin , gabriel and glos said that several of the new laws would be considered by parliament before the end of the year , though the implementation of the individual points would be subject to review . expanded climate budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german cabinet met at meseberg palace oskar lafontaine , chairman of the left party , called the coalition 's environmental plan " much ado about nothing .

the new program would cost around 8 billion euros in total , but would ultimately save the country 13 billion euros , gabriel said . thursday 's climate announcement was part of a two-day conference marking the mid-point of the governing coalition 's four-year term . the shortage of skilled labor , germany 's military mission to afghanistan and last weekend 's attack on eight indian men in eastern germany were also on the agenda at the conference , which concludes on friday . nuclear safety also on thursday , on the margins of the coalition meeting , the german government decided together with four major nuclear energy companies to tighten safety measures in that sector .

however he still has the best rating since charles de gaulle . according to a recent opinion poll , 61 percent of the french population rate nicolas sarkozy 's performance as either " very " or " fairly " good .
the survey was conducted by the ipsos institute which surveyed a representative sample of 1,000 french adults . the results were published on thursday -lrb- 23.8 -rrb- in the weekly magazine le point and represent a fall of five percent in the new president 's popularity rating since the last poll was conducted in july .
the percentage of those dissatisfied with his performance rose from 25 to 39 percent . " are those voters who expected a clearer break with his predecessor chirac now becoming impatient ? "
le point asked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a change of face and style at the elysee palace the thursday edition of the paris daily le parisien remarked that sarkozy " has entered his first spell of turbulence " due to a darkening economic outlook that could slow down planned reforms .

" he 's very dynamic and always forging ahead .
one of his main characteristics is his speed . he has something to say about every aspect of domestic and foreign policy being debated and usually comes up with proposals for new legislation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and what i 'd also like to say is .
this dynamism could well be a reason for sarkozy 's present popularity .

immigration was an explosive topic in the election campaign , even causing unrest in several suburbs . there are fears that this could be re-ignited as a result of the new laws .
however , neumann believes there will be widespread approval of the new legislation among the french electorate in general . is the honeymoon over ? sarkozy could well find he has a tougher time now he 's notched up his first 100 days . figures released this month show economic growth for the second quarter failing to meet expectations , casting doubt over whether the government can meet its target of 2.25-percent growth for the year . also on the agenda are measures to reduce health care costs and the labor-market reform . " these are all big changes for which there is bound to be opposition within french society , " neumann predicted . with his penchant for getting involved in every area of politics , sarkozy is , in fact , overstepping the boundaries of his mandate . " if you look at french politics , there is practically no longer a government in the autonomous sense , " says neumann . " the president has always had a prominent role but in the past has not played such an active role in day-to-day politics .

however he still has the best rating since charles de gaulle . according to a recent opinion poll , 61 percent of the french population rate nicolas sarkozy 's performance as either " very " or " fairly " good .
the survey was conducted by the ipsos institute which surveyed a representative sample of 1,000 french adults . the results were published on thursday -lrb- 23.8 -rrb- in the weekly magazine le point and represent a fall of five percent in the new president 's popularity rating since the last poll was conducted in july .
the percentage of those dissatisfied with his performance rose from 25 to 39 percent . " are those voters who expected a clearer break with his predecessor chirac now becoming impatient ? "
le point asked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a change of face and style at the elysee palace the thursday edition of the paris daily le parisien remarked that sarkozy " has entered his first spell of turbulence " due to a darkening economic outlook that could slow down planned reforms .
but le parisien also pointed out that , according to the ipsos poll , at the 100-day mark , sarkozy has the best popularity rating since legendary french leader charles de gaulle . something to say about everything the new french president has made domestic politics a main focus . this was demonstrated again this week following the rape of a five year-old boy by a convicted pedophile who had been released before the end of his jail term . sarkozy spoke in favor of so-called " chemical castration " and pledged to introduce tougher penalties for repeat offenders . this comes just two weeks after the introduction of the current laws . this is a perfect illustration of sarkozy 's style , said wolfgang neumann of the german-french institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- . " he 's very dynamic and always forging ahead .
one of his main characteristics is his speed . he has something to say about every aspect of domestic and foreign policy being debated and usually comes up with proposals for new legislation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and what i 'd also like to say is .
this dynamism could well be a reason for sarkozy 's present popularity .
this summer he 's pushed a number of reforms through parliament . according to neumann , the most important is university reform which would give higher-education institutions greater autonomy . " there 's also a reform of labor-market law which includes what amounts to the abolition of the 35-hour working week in france , " he said . a sheaf of further laws are waiting for approval , primarily concerning immigration and including restrictions on family reunification .
immigration was an explosive topic in the election campaign , even causing unrest in several suburbs . there are fears that this could be re-ignited as a result of the new laws .
however , neumann believes there will be widespread approval of the new legislation among the french electorate in general . is the honeymoon over ? sarkozy could well find he has a tougher time now he 's notched up his first 100 days . figures released this month show economic growth for the second quarter failing to meet expectations , casting doubt over whether the government can meet its target of 2.25-percent growth for the year . also on the agenda are measures to reduce health care costs and the labor-market reform . " these are all big changes for which there is bound to be opposition within french society , " neumann predicted . with his penchant for getting involved in every area of politics , sarkozy is , in fact , overstepping the boundaries of his mandate . " if you look at french politics , there is practically no longer a government in the autonomous sense , " says neumann . " the president has always had a prominent role but in the past has not played such an active role in day-to-day politics . " sarkozy is strengthened by the absence of any real political opposition . the only force of any significance , the socialist party , is internally divided , and several party leaders have even been brought into the sarkozy government , weakening the center-left party . reorientation of foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're such good friends when looking at foreign policy under sarkozy , the most obvious changes are france 's changed stance towards the conflict in iraq and towards the us . " the fact that sarkozy spent his summer vacation in the us , with all the accompanying media attention , is more than symbolic , " said neumann . " it 's a clear indication that french foreign policy towards the us will change significantly from the chirac era and we can expect to see relations warming .

sources close to the government now said that , in the short term , electrical and mechanic engineers from the 12 newer eu member states could be allowed to start working in germany as early as oct .
1 without having to apply for a work permit .
industry representatives welcomed the government 's decision to open up parts of the labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minimum wage requirements for foreign workers are expected to go down " it 's a good thing that the government in meseberg decided to implement not only short-term measures , but also to develop a master plan that 's a bit more medium-term oriented , " said achim dercks , deputy chief executive of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
comprehensive plan the plan - which will be developed jointly by the ministries of labor and education over the next few months - will also address the issue of reducing the minimum wage requirement for foreign workers , which is currently set at 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 115,000 -rrb- per year .
this issue has been a thorn in the eye of german employers who have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
german education minister annette schavan previously suggested that the wage requirement should be lowered to between 40,000 and 60,000 euros .
additionally , foreign students who complete a course of study at a german university will be able to work without hurdles for three years after graduation .
the government agreed that , in the long term , targeted immigration was " necessary and desirable , " especially in view of germany 's increasingly ageing population .
it also stressed , however , that exhausting the potential of the domestic german labor market was also a priority that could be achieved by training and educating the unemployed .

due to its successful stewardship of the eu and the g8 this year , germany felt ready to take a seat at the top table of global politics .
now , however , it believes it is being relegated to the sidelines . if the old adage " a week is a long time in politics " is true , then two months must seem like an eternity .
it certainly appears to be the case for germany .
at the end of june this year , the german government relinquished the reins of the european union 's presidency with applause and platitudes hanging in the balmy berlin air .
the g8 summit in heiligendamm it hosted in early june as this year 's head of the group was seen as a success . but less than eight weeks later , clouds of discontent have settled over the german capital and the chill blowing down its wide streets has more to do with an international cold shoulder than the onset of fall .
the perceived spurn was all the more surprising since in the first six months of 2007 , angela merkel 's government managed to drive a reluctant eu and a stubborn g8 down the road of multilateralism . the notoriously fractious eu states were strapped together in unity around a european climate protection program and were rallied into a series of reforms ; no mean feat by anyone 's standards .
more impressively , germany managed to get the united states to sign on to an international climate accord in heiligendamm .
less publicly , germany worked hard to secure peace in the middle east , the release of hostages in afghanistan and the freedom of bulgarian nurses on death row in libya among other diplomatic efforts around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was no.1 in brussels after her successes at eu level when it came to handing over the power , merkel and her team were satisfied that germany had played a significant role in setting a new multilateral , international agenda , and created diplomatic structures for its successors to build on .
all in all , it had been a successful tenure , as approval ratings and commentaries proved .
but although they once were the ones setting the agenda , merkel and co. now are left to read in the newspapers the outcome of decisions they should have been closely involved in .
blair appointment during its eu presidency , germany was very active in the middle east .
chancellor merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier both made numerous visits to the region , attempting to persuade israel and the palestinians to return to the negotiating table , supporting the fragile democracy in lebanon and maintaining an even-handed eu involvement in the surrounding countries .
merkel had made the middle east her main foreign-affairs focus at the start of the eu presidency , continuing a german belief that a secure middle east meant a secure europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's appointment was reported to germany by the media however , just days before germany 's role as head of the eu came to an end , the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the us , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- announced that former british prime minister tony blair would be its special envoy to the region .
steinmeier 's reaction suggested that it had been less a quartet decision and more the work of a trio , with germany as eu representative cut out of the loop .
his remonstrations with his quartet colleagues were widely reported . despite merkel 's denials of a rift , it was clear that germany had not been consulted on blair 's appointment , which was reportedly first made known to the government in a front page headline . but amelia torres , acting spokesperson for the european commission , said that no german dissatisfaction was registered in brussels . " the commission is not aware of -lrb- the german -rrb- claims and , as far as we are concerned , all the decisions involving the european union were taken in consultation with all eu partners , " she said . still , germany 's leadership , at least in the eyes of berlin , was being challenged and its credibility as a global player undermined .
imf appointment rushed through by france two weeks later , the germans got another surprise .
while the appointment of former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn as the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- had been proposed by recently elected french president nicolas sarkozy , germany had been cautious about his candidacy .
sarkozy 's intentions concerning european financial institutions and policies had caused concern in berlin and a move to install strauss-kahn had increased the jitters .
when it was announced that strauss-kahn had the imf job , it was the media once again who informed germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy aggressively campaigned for strauss-kahn " it 's worth pointing out that germany was by no means the only country that felt ' under-consulted ' on these developments , " said bastian giegerich from the international center for strategic studies .
" french and us activism surprised other partners , such as the british , italians and spaniards just as much .
in the cases of the strauss-kahn and blair decisions , presidents sarkozy and bush chose to push choices aggressively . "
michael link , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp 's faction in the bundestag and his party 's eu expert , insisted that there was no snub over the imf job . " germany was involved , " he said . " and germany has had , at several instances , debated all sorts of critical issues in a very open way with the new french administration . " germany , however , was still convinced it was being pushed further to the sidelines .
sarkozys steal limelight in libya more french-inspired aggravation was to follow .
during his numerous visits to the middle east , steinmeier had been working together with the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner to secure the release of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor accused of infecting children with hiv in libya . steinmeier and ferrero-waldner were campaigning together against the death sentence issued to the six medics up until germany 's eu presidency expired .
it was assumed that the efforts would then be continued by luis amado , the foreign minister of succeeding eu president , portugal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cecilia sarkozy : " really , it was nothing . "
imagine germany 's surprise when president sarkozy 's wife cecilia appeared on the steps of a french aircraft to present the newly free nurses to the world media while her husband shook hands and made deals with libyan dictator moammar gadhafi in tripoli .
while the german foreign ministry once again made calming noises , individual politicians were livid .
some went public with claims that president sarkozy had only made a move to free the nurses to win contracts in libya while others called for france to realign itself with european interests , and not just focus on its own .
" regarding the release of the bulgarian nurses , " giegerich added , " i think the feeling in berlin is that germany had done a lot of very constructive behind-the-scenes work which ultimately contributed to the release and sarkozy stole the limelight , which of course leaves a bitter taste . " " the pictures of the release of the bulgarian nurses fitted the whole image of this libyan justice scandal : théâtre absurde , " the fdp 's michael link added .
" minister steinmeier worked hard for that release .
the real progress was made during the german eu presidency .
that 's what counts .
and everybody in the eu knows that . " in each of these cases , the situation was resolved with a welcome outcome for many .
blair will push for peace in the middle east , strauss-kahn will head the imf with european influence , and the bulgarian nurses have their freedom .
for the german government , it might be a case of credit not given where credit was due .
but was germany really ignored ?
an end to germany 's multilateralist approach ? " while it would not be completely accurate to say that germany was ignored in any of these cases , the way in which these events occurred stands in fairly sharp contrast to the consensus-building and mediating character of current german foreign policy under chancellor merkel 's leadership , " giegerich said . " the question for the future is thus whether merkel 's mode of policy-making , which has been successful so far both domestically and internationally , is sustainable , " he added . but link said he believes that germany has nothing to worry about . " the german government has overcome the shortcomings of the narrow and self-sufficient foreign-policy activities of messrs. schröder and fischer , " he said .
" and germany ’ s role as largest eu member should always be an integrating one , not a polarizing one .
but nothing in international politics is for granted .
our government must work hard in order to increase that role . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

due to its successful stewardship of the eu and the g8 this year , germany felt ready to take a seat at the top table of global politics .
now , however , it believes it is being relegated to the sidelines . if the old adage " a week is a long time in politics " is true , then two months must seem like an eternity .
it certainly appears to be the case for germany .
at the end of june this year , the german government relinquished the reins of the european union 's presidency with applause and platitudes hanging in the balmy berlin air .
the g8 summit in heiligendamm it hosted in early june as this year 's head of the group was seen as a success . but less than eight weeks later , clouds of discontent have settled over the german capital and the chill blowing down its wide streets has more to do with an international cold shoulder than the onset of fall .
the perceived spurn was all the more surprising since in the first six months of 2007 , angela merkel 's government managed to drive a reluctant eu and a stubborn g8 down the road of multilateralism . the notoriously fractious eu states were strapped together in unity around a european climate protection program and were rallied into a series of reforms ; no mean feat by anyone 's standards .
more impressively , germany managed to get the united states to sign on to an international climate accord in heiligendamm .
less publicly , germany worked hard to secure peace in the middle east , the release of hostages in afghanistan and the freedom of bulgarian nurses on death row in libya among other diplomatic efforts around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was no.1 in brussels after her successes at eu level when it came to handing over the power , merkel and her team were satisfied that germany had played a significant role in setting a new multilateral , international agenda , and created diplomatic structures for its successors to build on .
all in all , it had been a successful tenure , as approval ratings and commentaries proved .
but although they once were the ones setting the agenda , merkel and co. now are left to read in the newspapers the outcome of decisions they should have been closely involved in .
blair appointment during its eu presidency , germany was very active in the middle east .
chancellor merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier both made numerous visits to the region , attempting to persuade israel and the palestinians to return to the negotiating table , supporting the fragile democracy in lebanon and maintaining an even-handed eu involvement in the surrounding countries .
merkel had made the middle east her main foreign-affairs focus at the start of the eu presidency , continuing a german belief that a secure middle east meant a secure europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's appointment was reported to germany by the media however , just days before germany 's role as head of the eu came to an end , the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the us , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- announced that former british prime minister tony blair would be its special envoy to the region .
steinmeier 's reaction suggested that it had been less a quartet decision and more the work of a trio , with germany as eu representative cut out of the loop .
his remonstrations with his quartet colleagues were widely reported . despite merkel 's denials of a rift , it was clear that germany had not been consulted on blair 's appointment , which was reportedly first made known to the government in a front page headline . but amelia torres , acting spokesperson for the european commission , said that no german dissatisfaction was registered in brussels . " the commission is not aware of -lrb- the german -rrb- claims and , as far as we are concerned , all the decisions involving the european union were taken in consultation with all eu partners , " she said . still , germany 's leadership , at least in the eyes of berlin , was being challenged and its credibility as a global player undermined .
imf appointment rushed through by france two weeks later , the germans got another surprise .
while the appointment of former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn as the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- had been proposed by recently elected french president nicolas sarkozy , germany had been cautious about his candidacy .
sarkozy 's intentions concerning european financial institutions and policies had caused concern in berlin and a move to install strauss-kahn had increased the jitters .
when it was announced that strauss-kahn had the imf job , it was the media once again who informed germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy aggressively campaigned for strauss-kahn " it 's worth pointing out that germany was by no means the only country that felt ' under-consulted ' on these developments , " said bastian giegerich from the international center for strategic studies .
" french and us activism surprised other partners , such as the british , italians and spaniards just as much .
in the cases of the strauss-kahn and blair decisions , presidents sarkozy and bush chose to push choices aggressively . "
michael link , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp 's faction in the bundestag and his party 's eu expert , insisted that there was no snub over the imf job . " germany was involved , " he said . " and germany has had , at several instances , debated all sorts of critical issues in a very open way with the new french administration . " germany , however , was still convinced it was being pushed further to the sidelines .
sarkozys steal limelight in libya more french-inspired aggravation was to follow .
during his numerous visits to the middle east , steinmeier had been working together with the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner to secure the release of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor accused of infecting children with hiv in libya . steinmeier and ferrero-waldner were campaigning together against the death sentence issued to the six medics up until germany 's eu presidency expired .
it was assumed that the efforts would then be continued by luis amado , the foreign minister of succeeding eu president , portugal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cecilia sarkozy : " really , it was nothing . "
imagine germany 's surprise when president sarkozy 's wife cecilia appeared on the steps of a french aircraft to present the newly free nurses to the world media while her husband shook hands and made deals with libyan dictator moammar gadhafi in tripoli .
while the german foreign ministry once again made calming noises , individual politicians were livid .
some went public with claims that president sarkozy had only made a move to free the nurses to win contracts in libya while others called for france to realign itself with european interests , and not just focus on its own .
" regarding the release of the bulgarian nurses , " giegerich added , " i think the feeling in berlin is that germany had done a lot of very constructive behind-the-scenes work which ultimately contributed to the release and sarkozy stole the limelight , which of course leaves a bitter taste . " " the pictures of the release of the bulgarian nurses fitted the whole image of this libyan justice scandal : théâtre absurde , " the fdp 's michael link added .
" minister steinmeier worked hard for that release .
the real progress was made during the german eu presidency .
that 's what counts .
and everybody in the eu knows that . " in each of these cases , the situation was resolved with a welcome outcome for many .
blair will push for peace in the middle east , strauss-kahn will head the imf with european influence , and the bulgarian nurses have their freedom .
for the german government , it might be a case of credit not given where credit was due .
but was germany really ignored ?
an end to germany 's multilateralist approach ? " while it would not be completely accurate to say that germany was ignored in any of these cases , the way in which these events occurred stands in fairly sharp contrast to the consensus-building and mediating character of current german foreign policy under chancellor merkel 's leadership , " giegerich said . " the question for the future is thus whether merkel 's mode of policy-making , which has been successful so far both domestically and internationally , is sustainable , " he added . but link said he believes that germany has nothing to worry about . " the german government has overcome the shortcomings of the narrow and self-sufficient foreign-policy activities of messrs. schröder and fischer , " he said .
" and germany ’ s role as largest eu member should always be an integrating one , not a polarizing one .
but nothing in international politics is for granted .
our government must work hard in order to increase that role . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 24.08.2007 german-turkish politician : gül is good for europe , turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül is a former islamist but has expressed a commitment to a secularized constitution european parliament member cem özdemir spoke with dw-world.de about the challenges that face abdullah gül , who is likely to become turkey 's next president , and what will top the presidential agenda if he 's elected . cem özdemir is a german politician of turkish origin and has been a member of the european parliament for the greens since 2004 . dw-world.de : after gül 's akp -lrb- justice and development -rrb- party won a clear victory in the early parliamentary elections in july , it appears fairly certain that gül will be elected president by aug .
28 at the latest .
he has promised to protect democracy and the constitutional separation of church and state in turkey .
are his claims credible ? cem özdemir : one just has to look at the last four and a half years of the akp administration .
they have not contributed to a fundamentalization of the turkish society - just the opposite .
the turkish society has opened up like never before in its history . so many reforms have taken place , such as in the areas of democracy and women 's rights .
it 's common knowledge that some people are distrustful of gül and now it 's in his hands - should he be elected - to break down this mistrust . is the criticism warranted ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir is a german politician of turkish origin it generally has to do with the headscarf issue among women .
but gül is right in pointing out that his wife -lsb- who wears a headscarf -rsb- is n't running for president - he is .
what the opposition leader deniz baykal said is also true , even if he unfortunately does n't stick to it himself : " it 's not important what she has on her head , but in her head . " so far , neither women nor mr. gül have had reason to be seen as radical fundamentalists .
that ca n't necessarily be said about any of the opposition politicians .
gül stands for a liberal opening of turkey .
those who want to stop him stand for ultra-nationalism . as foreign minister , he was actively involved in negotiations over turkey 's accession to the european union .
how is gül viewed in europe ? he is very highly regarded by european politicians , such as enlargement commissioner olli rehn , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier or his predecessor joschka fischer .
-lsb- gül -rsb- is seen as a reliable partner with whom one can reach agreements that the other side will stick to as well .
in this respect , one can say that gül is confronted with less distrust abroad than in his own country . what would gül 's election mean for turkey 's eu ambitions ? it would make many things easier .
you ca n't forget that the incumbent , -lsb- ahmet necdet -rsb- sezer , has blocked many important reforms in turkey , like the law on foundations , which has particularly disadvantaged christian and jewish foundations there .
the akp government wanted to put an end to this , but it was blocked by the opposition and the president did n't sign the law . important initiatives to reform the bureaucracy , postponing the retirement age and restructuring the budget were also blocked by the president .
if a president like gül , who is more open to reform , came along now , it would make the situation easier for the government . a major point of criticism concerning turkey 's possible accession to the eu is always the issue of human rights .
will changes be made in this area as well ? i knew gül way back when he was in the fundamentalist opposition party , which he tried to reform before he left it .
during that time , i often came to him with criticism from human rights organizations .
i also always asked these organizations about gül . my impression was that they 'd found a partner in gül who would always listen and take their concerns seriously - even when he could n't do anything about them due to the constraints he faced and the problems that turkey had then and still has now .
i believe that gül is someone who stands for reform in the area of human rights . do you support gül 's election as president from a european point of view ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : özdemir : gül should show the women without headscarves that his wife 's is n't a sign i not only think that he is good for europe , i also believe that he 's good for turkey .
however , the fears that exist have to be taken seriously by gül and his party .
they can best be defused by proving that they 're unjustified . there are two important groups that gül has to pay attention to : the first is the women who do n't wear headscarves .
gül has to show them that his wife 's headscarf is n't a sign .
on the contrary , it shows that diversity must be accepted .
the other group that 's waiting for a signal is the alevis , a religious minority in turkey .
it 's important for gül to show them that he is also the president of alevis . ina rottscheidt interviewed cem özdemir -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what the opposition leader deniz baykal said is also true , even if he unfortunately does n't stick to it himself : " it 's not important what she has on her head , but in her head . " so far , neither women nor mr. gül have had reason to be seen as radical fundamentalists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 24.08.2007 germany launches initiative against dangerous products großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polly pocket dolls made by mattel were among the thousands recalled over lead fears while the scandal and embarassment over dangerous and defective children 's toys continues in china , germany has announced an intitiative to promote stringent safety standards within the european union . the recall of 18 million chinese-made products by us toy giant mattel because of safety concerns has led to germany launching its own initiative against defective and dangerous products .
the german economics ministry announced thursday that it planned to host a round-table discussion on the subject on august 30 with manufacturers , industry groups , consumer protection organizations and the 16 regional states .
while acknowledging that the european union sets high standards for product quality , the ministry ’ s statement called for more to be done to and suggested a quality seal verifying products are safe .
" labelling to indicate the quality -lrb- of a product -rrb- is in the most basic interest of the german economy , " the ministry said .
" german products in particular but also european products with high quality standards must compete on the market every day against much more cheaply produced products - for example from asia . "
product scandal rumbles on the slogan " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months .
hardly a day goes by without criticism about the dangers to which chinese-made products might expose consumers .
the scandals of recent weeks revolving around the safety of chinese-manufactured goods and even food reached a pinnacle when the concerns moved into children 's rooms with scares over polly pocket , batman and barbie dolls .
previously , the chemical melamine in chinese wheat-gluten exports used in pet food were blamed for the deaths of dogs and cats in the united states .
this was followed by headlines about contaminated seafood and fruit , and poisonous industrial diethylene glycol in cough syrups and toothpaste .
additionally , chinese cars exported abroad fared terribly in crash tests in germany and russia .
while the us has been sounding the alarm for weeks , the reactions of european consumers remained relatively muffled until mattel started recalling millions of toys this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbie : all dressed up and nowhere to go the company announced that tests found dangerously high lead content in the lacquer of its toys and that attached magnets came loose easily and could be swallowed by small children .
those discoveries woke up the europeans , while for the chinese a lot is now on the gaming board .
the hurried reaction of beijing 's trade ministry was to declare that the problem had been blown out of proportion , but to also pledge to spare no effort to ensure the safety of chinese export goods .
low standards ignored for cheap goods but the toy scandal also raised questions about mattel 's responsibility as well as the usual networks of subcontractors , middlemen and factories in china , where workers toil for extremely low wages in often hazardous conditions .
by producing in china , companies can maximize their profit margins , while consumers in western countries are either unaware of or choose to ignore the miserable working conditions as they have come to expect low prices for products such as dvd players , personal computers , textiles and shoes .
bildunterschrift : a " sweat shop " factory common to asia china 's government , meanwhile , concedes that black sheep do exist among local manufacturers , but insists that foreign companies had a responsibility for monitoring the quality of their products too .
this is because barbie or batman dolls , for example , were not marketed in europe and the us by chinese companies but under the renowned brand " mattel , " which traditionally stood for quality and safety .
meanwhile , the country 's toy-manufacturing industry has expressed embarrassment over the scandal and fears losing future business .
" we feel deep sorrow over the irresponsible attitude of some companies , " said the industry association in a statement and added that it would assume responsibility for improving quality standards .
" we must use this lesson as an opportunity to raise management standards , " the statement said .
firms should refrain from accepting orders that are " low priced and with unclear quality requirements " or which exceeded their manufacturing capacities .
eu , china trade accusations and admonishments more often than not , european reports to the chinese about certain unsafe products are simply ignored , which recently prompted the eu commissioner for consumer protection , meglena kuneva , to admonish beijing that " more has to be done -lrb- to ensure the safety of locally manufactured goods destined for export -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson is in the middle of an eu-china spat again earlier this week , china claimed that the eu was using concerns over chinese export standards as a form of protectionism , a claim that trade commissioner , peter mandelson , dismissed as " totally false . "
" as trade commissioner , i will not accept claims of toxicity being used as a pretext for protectionism .

the german economics ministry announced thursday that it planned to host a round-table discussion on the subject on august 30 with manufacturers , industry groups , consumer protection organizations and the 16 regional states .
while acknowledging that the european union sets high standards for product quality , the ministry ’ s statement called for more to be done to and suggested a quality seal verifying products are safe .
" labelling to indicate the quality -lrb- of a product -rrb- is in the most basic interest of the german economy , " the ministry said .
" german products in particular but also european products with high quality standards must compete on the market every day against much more cheaply produced products - for example from asia . "
product scandal rumbles on the slogan " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months .
hardly a day goes by without criticism about the dangers to which chinese-made products might expose consumers .
the scandals of recent weeks revolving around the safety of chinese-manufactured goods and even food reached a pinnacle when the concerns moved into children 's rooms with scares over polly pocket , batman and barbie dolls .
previously , the chemical melamine in chinese wheat-gluten exports used in pet food were blamed for the deaths of dogs and cats in the united states .
this was followed by headlines about contaminated seafood and fruit , and poisonous industrial diethylene glycol in cough syrups and toothpaste .
additionally , chinese cars exported abroad fared terribly in crash tests in germany and russia .
while the us has been sounding the alarm for weeks , the reactions of european consumers remained relatively muffled until mattel started recalling millions of toys this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbie : all dressed up and nowhere to go the company announced that tests found dangerously high lead content in the lacquer of its toys and that attached magnets came loose easily and could be swallowed by small children .
those discoveries woke up the europeans , while for the chinese a lot is now on the gaming board .
the hurried reaction of beijing 's trade ministry was to declare that the problem had been blown out of proportion , but to also pledge to spare no effort to ensure the safety of chinese export goods .
low standards ignored for cheap goods but the toy scandal also raised questions about mattel 's responsibility as well as the usual networks of subcontractors , middlemen and factories in china , where workers toil for extremely low wages in often hazardous conditions .
by producing in china , companies can maximize their profit margins , while consumers in western countries are either unaware of or choose to ignore the miserable working conditions as they have come to expect low prices for products such as dvd players , personal computers , textiles and shoes .
bildunterschrift : a " sweat shop " factory common to asia china 's government , meanwhile , concedes that black sheep do exist among local manufacturers , but insists that foreign companies had a responsibility for monitoring the quality of their products too .
this is because barbie or batman dolls , for example , were not marketed in europe and the us by chinese companies but under the renowned brand " mattel , " which traditionally stood for quality and safety .
meanwhile , the country 's toy-manufacturing industry has expressed embarrassment over the scandal and fears losing future business .
" we feel deep sorrow over the irresponsible attitude of some companies , " said the industry association in a statement and added that it would assume responsibility for improving quality standards .
" we must use this lesson as an opportunity to raise management standards , " the statement said .
firms should refrain from accepting orders that are " low priced and with unclear quality requirements " or which exceeded their manufacturing capacities .
eu , china trade accusations and admonishments more often than not , european reports to the chinese about certain unsafe products are simply ignored , which recently prompted the eu commissioner for consumer protection , meglena kuneva , to admonish beijing that " more has to be done -lrb- to ensure the safety of locally manufactured goods destined for export -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson is in the middle of an eu-china spat again earlier this week , china claimed that the eu was using concerns over chinese export standards as a form of protectionism , a claim that trade commissioner , peter mandelson , dismissed as " totally false .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 24.08.2007 germany launches initiative against dangerous products großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polly pocket dolls made by mattel were among the thousands recalled over lead fears while the scandal and embarassment over dangerous and defective children 's toys continues in china , germany has announced an intitiative to promote stringent safety standards within the european union . the recall of 18 million chinese-made products by us toy giant mattel because of safety concerns has led to germany launching its own initiative against defective and dangerous products .
the german economics ministry announced thursday that it planned to host a round-table discussion on the subject on august 30 with manufacturers , industry groups , consumer protection organizations and the 16 regional states .
while acknowledging that the european union sets high standards for product quality , the ministry ’ s statement called for more to be done to and suggested a quality seal verifying products are safe .
" labelling to indicate the quality -lrb- of a product -rrb- is in the most basic interest of the german economy , " the ministry said .
" german products in particular but also european products with high quality standards must compete on the market every day against much more cheaply produced products - for example from asia . "
product scandal rumbles on the slogan " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months .
hardly a day goes by without criticism about the dangers to which chinese-made products might expose consumers .
the scandals of recent weeks revolving around the safety of chinese-manufactured goods and even food reached a pinnacle when the concerns moved into children 's rooms with scares over polly pocket , batman and barbie dolls .
previously , the chemical melamine in chinese wheat-gluten exports used in pet food were blamed for the deaths of dogs and cats in the united states .
this was followed by headlines about contaminated seafood and fruit , and poisonous industrial diethylene glycol in cough syrups and toothpaste .
additionally , chinese cars exported abroad fared terribly in crash tests in germany and russia .
while the us has been sounding the alarm for weeks , the reactions of european consumers remained relatively muffled until mattel started recalling millions of toys this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbie : all dressed up and nowhere to go the company announced that tests found dangerously high lead content in the lacquer of its toys and that attached magnets came loose easily and could be swallowed by small children .
those discoveries woke up the europeans , while for the chinese a lot is now on the gaming board .
the hurried reaction of beijing 's trade ministry was to declare that the problem had been blown out of proportion , but to also pledge to spare no effort to ensure the safety of chinese export goods .
low standards ignored for cheap goods but the toy scandal also raised questions about mattel 's responsibility as well as the usual networks of subcontractors , middlemen and factories in china , where workers toil for extremely low wages in often hazardous conditions .
by producing in china , companies can maximize their profit margins , while consumers in western countries are either unaware of or choose to ignore the miserable working conditions as they have come to expect low prices for products such as dvd players , personal computers , textiles and shoes .
bildunterschrift : a " sweat shop " factory common to asia china 's government , meanwhile , concedes that black sheep do exist among local manufacturers , but insists that foreign companies had a responsibility for monitoring the quality of their products too .
this is because barbie or batman dolls , for example , were not marketed in europe and the us by chinese companies but under the renowned brand " mattel , " which traditionally stood for quality and safety .
meanwhile , the country 's toy-manufacturing industry has expressed embarrassment over the scandal and fears losing future business .
" we feel deep sorrow over the irresponsible attitude of some companies , " said the industry association in a statement and added that it would assume responsibility for improving quality standards .
" we must use this lesson as an opportunity to raise management standards , " the statement said .
firms should refrain from accepting orders that are " low priced and with unclear quality requirements " or which exceeded their manufacturing capacities .
eu , china trade accusations and admonishments more often than not , european reports to the chinese about certain unsafe products are simply ignored , which recently prompted the eu commissioner for consumer protection , meglena kuneva , to admonish beijing that " more has to be done -lrb- to ensure the safety of locally manufactured goods destined for export -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson is in the middle of an eu-china spat again earlier this week , china claimed that the eu was using concerns over chinese export standards as a form of protectionism , a claim that trade commissioner , peter mandelson , dismissed as " totally false . "
" as trade commissioner , i will not accept claims of toxicity being used as a pretext for protectionism .
equally , i will give firm backing to european companies having to reject goods that are dangerous to consumers , " he added china already has to deal with more than enough trouble domestically through contaminated food , counterfeit medicines or products which do not comply with required quality standards of local markets .

however he still has the best rating since charles de gaulle . according to a recent opinion poll , 61 percent of the french population rate nicolas sarkozy 's performance as either " very " or " fairly " good .
the survey was conducted by the ipsos institute which surveyed a representative sample of 1,000 french adults . the results were published on thursday -lrb- 23.8 -rrb- in the weekly magazine le point and represent a fall of five percent in the new president 's popularity rating since the last poll was conducted in july .
the percentage of those dissatisfied with his performance rose from 25 to 39 percent . " are those voters who expected a clearer break with his predecessor chirac now becoming impatient ? "
le point asked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a change of face and style at the elysee palace the thursday edition of the paris daily le parisien remarked that sarkozy " has entered his first spell of turbulence " due to a darkening economic outlook that could slow down planned reforms .

" he 's very dynamic and always forging ahead .
one of his main characteristics is his speed . he has something to say about every aspect of domestic and foreign policy being debated and usually comes up with proposals for new legislation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and what i 'd also like to say is .
this dynamism could well be a reason for sarkozy 's present popularity .

" there 's also a reform of labor-market law which includes what amounts to the abolition of the 35-hour working week in france , " he said . a sheaf of further laws are waiting for approval , primarily concerning immigration and including restrictions on family reunification .
immigration was an explosive topic in the election campaign , even causing unrest in several suburbs . there are fears that this could be re-ignited as a result of the new laws .
however , neumann believes there will be widespread approval of the new legislation among the french electorate in general . is the honeymoon over ? sarkozy could well find he has a tougher time now he 's notched up his first 100 days . figures released this month show economic growth for the second quarter failing to meet expectations , casting doubt over whether the government can meet its target of 2.25-percent growth for the year . also on the agenda are measures to reduce health care costs and the labor-market reform . " these are all big changes for which there is bound to be opposition within french society , " neumann predicted . with his penchant for getting involved in every area of politics , sarkozy is , in fact , overstepping the boundaries of his mandate . " if you look at french politics , there is practically no longer a government in the autonomous sense , " says neumann . " the president has always had a prominent role but in the past has not played such an active role in day-to-day politics .

however he still has the best rating since charles de gaulle . according to a recent opinion poll , 61 percent of the french population rate nicolas sarkozy 's performance as either " very " or " fairly " good .
the survey was conducted by the ipsos institute which surveyed a representative sample of 1,000 french adults . the results were published on thursday -lrb- 23.8 -rrb- in the weekly magazine le point and represent a fall of five percent in the new president 's popularity rating since the last poll was conducted in july .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 24.08.2007 germany to ease restrictions for influx of foreign skilled labor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs more skilled workers in an attempt to resolve shortages of skilled labor in key economic sectors , the german government is planning to ease labor restrictions for foreign skilled workers from central and eastern european eu member states . at a two-day retreat at meseberg palace north of berlin , the german coalition government has agreed to develop a comprehensive plan that would make it significantly easier for qualified foreign workers to get a job in germany .
sources close to the government now said that , in the short term , electrical and mechanic engineers from the 12 newer eu member states could be allowed to start working in germany as early as oct .
1 without having to apply for a work permit .
industry representatives welcomed the government 's decision to open up parts of the labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minimum wage requirements for foreign workers are expected to go down " it 's a good thing that the government in meseberg decided to implement not only short-term measures , but also to develop a master plan that 's a bit more medium-term oriented , " said achim dercks , deputy chief executive of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
comprehensive plan the plan - which will be developed jointly by the ministries of labor and education over the next few months - will also address the issue of reducing the minimum wage requirement for foreign workers , which is currently set at 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 115,000 -rrb- per year .
this issue has been a thorn in the eye of german employers who have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
german education minister annette schavan previously suggested that the wage requirement should be lowered to between 40,000 and 60,000 euros .
additionally , foreign students who complete a course of study at a german university will be able to work without hurdles for three years after graduation .

"
he said on friday morning on german public broadcaster ard that it would contribute to a 35 to 36 percent reduction in co2 emissions by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 . with additional government programs , germany would reach its goal of 40 percent reduction in emissions by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel and merkel went to greenland last week to discuss climate protection higher taxes on gas-guzzling vehicles , greater emphasis on alternatives energy forms and stricter energy-saving requirements are at the core of the package 's 30 points , according to reports . these measures will make germany one of the " most energy-efficient regions in the world , " said economics minister michael glos , who had been involved in intense negotiations with gabriel before thursday 's meeting .
glos is a member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , while gabriel is a social democrat . at a joint presentation of the approved plan at the government 's summer retreat at meseberg palace near berlin , gabriel and glos said that several of the new laws would be considered by parliament before the end of the year , though the implementation of the individual points would be subject to review . expanded climate budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german cabinet met at meseberg palace oskar lafontaine , chairman of the left party , called the coalition 's environmental plan " much ado about nothing . " gabriel countered by pointing out that germany 's climate protection budget this year amounted to 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- - 200 percent more than in 2005 , when the coalition was founded .
the new program would cost around 8 billion euros in total , but would ultimately save the country 13 billion euros , gabriel said . thursday 's climate announcement was part of a two-day conference marking the mid-point of the governing coalition 's four-year term . the shortage of skilled labor , germany 's military mission to afghanistan and last weekend 's attack on eight indian men in eastern germany were also on the agenda at the conference , which concludes on friday . nuclear safety also on thursday , on the margins of the coalition meeting , the german government decided together with four major nuclear energy companies to tighten safety measures in that sector . " we have agreed to put in place steps that will further improve the safety climate at nuclear power plant operations within a year , " said the environment ministry in a statement . in a bid to improve safety , environment minister gabriel proposed on thursday that the oldest reactors be phased out earlier than planned and their workload transferred to more modern plants . the move comes a month after two incidents at nuclear power plants in germany sparked a national outcry and debate on safety in the branch . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
he said on friday morning on german public broadcaster ard that it would contribute to a 35 to 36 percent reduction in co2 emissions by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 . with additional government programs , germany would reach its goal of 40 percent reduction in emissions by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel and merkel went to greenland last week to discuss climate protection higher taxes on gas-guzzling vehicles , greater emphasis on alternatives energy forms and stricter energy-saving requirements are at the core of the package 's 30 points , according to reports . these measures will make germany one of the " most energy-efficient regions in the world , " said economics minister michael glos , who had been involved in intense negotiations with gabriel before thursday 's meeting .
glos is a member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , while gabriel is a social democrat . at a joint presentation of the approved plan at the government 's summer retreat at meseberg palace near berlin , gabriel and glos said that several of the new laws would be considered by parliament before the end of the year , though the implementation of the individual points would be subject to review . expanded climate budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german cabinet met at meseberg palace oskar lafontaine , chairman of the left party , called the coalition 's environmental plan " much ado about nothing . " gabriel countered by pointing out that germany 's climate protection budget this year amounted to 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- - 200 percent more than in 2005 , when the coalition was founded .
the new program would cost around 8 billion euros in total , but would ultimately save the country 13 billion euros , gabriel said . thursday 's climate announcement was part of a two-day conference marking the mid-point of the governing coalition 's four-year term . the shortage of skilled labor , germany 's military mission to afghanistan and last weekend 's attack on eight indian men in eastern germany were also on the agenda at the conference , which concludes on friday . nuclear safety also on thursday , on the margins of the coalition meeting , the german government decided together with four major nuclear energy companies to tighten safety measures in that sector . " we have agreed to put in place steps that will further improve the safety climate at nuclear power plant operations within a year , " said the environment ministry in a statement . in a bid to improve safety , environment minister gabriel proposed on thursday that the oldest reactors be phased out earlier than planned and their workload transferred to more modern plants . the move comes a month after two incidents at nuclear power plants in germany sparked a national outcry and debate on safety in the branch . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

due to its successful stewardship of the eu and the g8 this year , germany felt ready to take a seat at the top table of global politics .
now , however , it believes it is being relegated to the sidelines . if the old adage " a week is a long time in politics " is true , then two months must seem like an eternity .
it certainly appears to be the case for germany .
at the end of june this year , the german government relinquished the reins of the european union 's presidency with applause and platitudes hanging in the balmy berlin air .
the g8 summit in heiligendamm it hosted in early june as this year 's head of the group was seen as a success . but less than eight weeks later , clouds of discontent have settled over the german capital and the chill blowing down its wide streets has more to do with an international cold shoulder than the onset of fall .
the perceived spurn was all the more surprising since in the first six months of 2007 , angela merkel 's government managed to drive a reluctant eu and a stubborn g8 down the road of multilateralism . the notoriously fractious eu states were strapped together in unity around a european climate protection program and were rallied into a series of reforms ; no mean feat by anyone 's standards .
more impressively , germany managed to get the united states to sign on to an international climate accord in heiligendamm .
less publicly , germany worked hard to secure peace in the middle east , the release of hostages in afghanistan and the freedom of bulgarian nurses on death row in libya among other diplomatic efforts around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was no.1 in brussels after her successes at eu level when it came to handing over the power , merkel and her team were satisfied that germany had played a significant role in setting a new multilateral , international agenda , and created diplomatic structures for its successors to build on .
all in all , it had been a successful tenure , as approval ratings and commentaries proved .
but although they once were the ones setting the agenda , merkel and co. now are left to read in the newspapers the outcome of decisions they should have been closely involved in .
blair appointment during its eu presidency , germany was very active in the middle east .
chancellor merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier both made numerous visits to the region , attempting to persuade israel and the palestinians to return to the negotiating table , supporting the fragile democracy in lebanon and maintaining an even-handed eu involvement in the surrounding countries .
merkel had made the middle east her main foreign-affairs focus at the start of the eu presidency , continuing a german belief that a secure middle east meant a secure europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's appointment was reported to germany by the media however , just days before germany 's role as head of the eu came to an end , the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the us , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- announced that former british prime minister tony blair would be its special envoy to the region .
steinmeier 's reaction suggested that it had been less a quartet decision and more the work of a trio , with germany as eu representative cut out of the loop .
his remonstrations with his quartet colleagues were widely reported . despite merkel 's denials of a rift , it was clear that germany had not been consulted on blair 's appointment , which was reportedly first made known to the government in a front page headline . but amelia torres , acting spokesperson for the european commission , said that no german dissatisfaction was registered in brussels . " the commission is not aware of -lrb- the german -rrb- claims and , as far as we are concerned , all the decisions involving the european union were taken in consultation with all eu partners , " she said . still , germany 's leadership , at least in the eyes of berlin , was being challenged and its credibility as a global player undermined .
imf appointment rushed through by france two weeks later , the germans got another surprise .
while the appointment of former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn as the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- had been proposed by recently elected french president nicolas sarkozy , germany had been cautious about his candidacy .
sarkozy 's intentions concerning european financial institutions and policies had caused concern in berlin and a move to install strauss-kahn had increased the jitters .
when it was announced that strauss-kahn had the imf job , it was the media once again who informed germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy aggressively campaigned for strauss-kahn " it 's worth pointing out that germany was by no means the only country that felt ' under-consulted ' on these developments , " said bastian giegerich from the international center for strategic studies .
" french and us activism surprised other partners , such as the british , italians and spaniards just as much .
in the cases of the strauss-kahn and blair decisions , presidents sarkozy and bush chose to push choices aggressively . "
michael link , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp 's faction in the bundestag and his party 's eu expert , insisted that there was no snub over the imf job . " germany was involved , " he said . " and germany has had , at several instances , debated all sorts of critical issues in a very open way with the new french administration . " germany , however , was still convinced it was being pushed further to the sidelines .
sarkozys steal limelight in libya more french-inspired aggravation was to follow .
during his numerous visits to the middle east , steinmeier had been working together with the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner to secure the release of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor accused of infecting children with hiv in libya . steinmeier and ferrero-waldner were campaigning together against the death sentence issued to the six medics up until germany 's eu presidency expired .
it was assumed that the efforts would then be continued by luis amado , the foreign minister of succeeding eu president , portugal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cecilia sarkozy : " really , it was nothing . "
imagine germany 's surprise when president sarkozy 's wife cecilia appeared on the steps of a french aircraft to present the newly free nurses to the world media while her husband shook hands and made deals with libyan dictator moammar gadhafi in tripoli .
while the german foreign ministry once again made calming noises , individual politicians were livid .
some went public with claims that president sarkozy had only made a move to free the nurses to win contracts in libya while others called for france to realign itself with european interests , and not just focus on its own .
" regarding the release of the bulgarian nurses , " giegerich added , " i think the feeling in berlin is that germany had done a lot of very constructive behind-the-scenes work which ultimately contributed to the release and sarkozy stole the limelight , which of course leaves a bitter taste . " " the pictures of the release of the bulgarian nurses fitted the whole image of this libyan justice scandal : théâtre absurde , " the fdp 's michael link added .
" minister steinmeier worked hard for that release .
the real progress was made during the german eu presidency .
that 's what counts .
and everybody in the eu knows that . " in each of these cases , the situation was resolved with a welcome outcome for many .
blair will push for peace in the middle east , strauss-kahn will head the imf with european influence , and the bulgarian nurses have their freedom .
for the german government , it might be a case of credit not given where credit was due .
but was germany really ignored ?
an end to germany 's multilateralist approach ? " while it would not be completely accurate to say that germany was ignored in any of these cases , the way in which these events occurred stands in fairly sharp contrast to the consensus-building and mediating character of current german foreign policy under chancellor merkel 's leadership , " giegerich said . " the question for the future is thus whether merkel 's mode of policy-making , which has been successful so far both domestically and internationally , is sustainable , " he added . but link said he believes that germany has nothing to worry about . " the german government has overcome the shortcomings of the narrow and self-sufficient foreign-policy activities of messrs. schröder and fischer , " he said .
" and germany ’ s role as largest eu member should always be an integrating one , not a polarizing one .
but nothing in international politics is for granted .
our government must work hard in order to increase that role . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but although they once were the ones setting the agenda , merkel and co. now are left to read in the newspapers the outcome of decisions they should have been closely involved in .
blair appointment during its eu presidency , germany was very active in the middle east .
chancellor merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier both made numerous visits to the region , attempting to persuade israel and the palestinians to return to the negotiating table , supporting the fragile democracy in lebanon and maintaining an even-handed eu involvement in the surrounding countries .
merkel had made the middle east her main foreign-affairs focus at the start of the eu presidency , continuing a german belief that a secure middle east meant a secure europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's appointment was reported to germany by the media however , just days before germany 's role as head of the eu came to an end , the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the us , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- announced that former british prime minister tony blair would be its special envoy to the region .
steinmeier 's reaction suggested that it had been less a quartet decision and more the work of a trio , with germany as eu representative cut out of the loop .
his remonstrations with his quartet colleagues were widely reported . despite merkel 's denials of a rift , it was clear that germany had not been consulted on blair 's appointment , which was reportedly first made known to the government in a front page headline . but amelia torres , acting spokesperson for the european commission , said that no german dissatisfaction was registered in brussels . " the commission is not aware of -lrb- the german -rrb- claims and , as far as we are concerned , all the decisions involving the european union were taken in consultation with all eu partners , " she said . still , germany 's leadership , at least in the eyes of berlin , was being challenged and its credibility as a global player undermined .
imf appointment rushed through by france two weeks later , the germans got another surprise .
while the appointment of former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn as the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- had been proposed by recently elected french president nicolas sarkozy , germany had been cautious about his candidacy .
sarkozy 's intentions concerning european financial institutions and policies had caused concern in berlin and a move to install strauss-kahn had increased the jitters .
when it was announced that strauss-kahn had the imf job , it was the media once again who informed germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy aggressively campaigned for strauss-kahn " it 's worth pointing out that germany was by no means the only country that felt ' under-consulted ' on these developments , " said bastian giegerich from the international center for strategic studies .
" french and us activism surprised other partners , such as the british , italians and spaniards just as much .
in the cases of the strauss-kahn and blair decisions , presidents sarkozy and bush chose to push choices aggressively . "
michael link , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp 's faction in the bundestag and his party 's eu expert , insisted that there was no snub over the imf job . " germany was involved , " he said . " and germany has had , at several instances , debated all sorts of critical issues in a very open way with the new french administration . " germany , however , was still convinced it was being pushed further to the sidelines .
sarkozys steal limelight in libya more french-inspired aggravation was to follow .
during his numerous visits to the middle east , steinmeier had been working together with the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner to secure the release of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor accused of infecting children with hiv in libya . steinmeier and ferrero-waldner were campaigning together against the death sentence issued to the six medics up until germany 's eu presidency expired .
it was assumed that the efforts would then be continued by luis amado , the foreign minister of succeeding eu president , portugal .

imagine germany 's surprise when president sarkozy 's wife cecilia appeared on the steps of a french aircraft to present the newly free nurses to the world media while her husband shook hands and made deals with libyan dictator moammar gadhafi in tripoli .
while the german foreign ministry once again made calming noises , individual politicians were livid .
some went public with claims that president sarkozy had only made a move to free the nurses to win contracts in libya while others called for france to realign itself with european interests , and not just focus on its own .
" regarding the release of the bulgarian nurses , " giegerich added , " i think the feeling in berlin is that germany had done a lot of very constructive behind-the-scenes work which ultimately contributed to the release and sarkozy stole the limelight , which of course leaves a bitter taste .

due to its successful stewardship of the eu and the g8 this year , germany felt ready to take a seat at the top table of global politics .
now , however , it believes it is being relegated to the sidelines . if the old adage " a week is a long time in politics " is true , then two months must seem like an eternity .
it certainly appears to be the case for germany .
at the end of june this year , the german government relinquished the reins of the european union 's presidency with applause and platitudes hanging in the balmy berlin air .
the g8 summit in heiligendamm it hosted in early june as this year 's head of the group was seen as a success . but less than eight weeks later , clouds of discontent have settled over the german capital and the chill blowing down its wide streets has more to do with an international cold shoulder than the onset of fall .
the perceived spurn was all the more surprising since in the first six months of 2007 , angela merkel 's government managed to drive a reluctant eu and a stubborn g8 down the road of multilateralism . the notoriously fractious eu states were strapped together in unity around a european climate protection program and were rallied into a series of reforms ; no mean feat by anyone 's standards .
more impressively , germany managed to get the united states to sign on to an international climate accord in heiligendamm .
less publicly , germany worked hard to secure peace in the middle east , the release of hostages in afghanistan and the freedom of bulgarian nurses on death row in libya among other diplomatic efforts around the world .

"
he said on friday morning on german public broadcaster ard that it would contribute to a 35 to 36 percent reduction in co2 emissions by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 . with additional government programs , germany would reach its goal of 40 percent reduction in emissions by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel and merkel went to greenland last week to discuss climate protection higher taxes on gas-guzzling vehicles , greater emphasis on alternatives energy forms and stricter energy-saving requirements are at the core of the package 's 30 points , according to reports . these measures will make germany one of the " most energy-efficient regions in the world , " said economics minister michael glos , who had been involved in intense negotiations with gabriel before thursday 's meeting .
glos is a member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , while gabriel is a social democrat . at a joint presentation of the approved plan at the government 's summer retreat at meseberg palace near berlin , gabriel and glos said that several of the new laws would be considered by parliament before the end of the year , though the implementation of the individual points would be subject to review . expanded climate budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german cabinet met at meseberg palace oskar lafontaine , chairman of the left party , called the coalition 's environmental plan " much ado about nothing .

due to its successful stewardship of the eu and the g8 this year , germany felt ready to take a seat at the top table of global politics .
now , however , it believes it is being relegated to the sidelines . if the old adage " a week is a long time in politics " is true , then two months must seem like an eternity .
it certainly appears to be the case for germany .
at the end of june this year , the german government relinquished the reins of the european union 's presidency with applause and platitudes hanging in the balmy berlin air .
the g8 summit in heiligendamm it hosted in early june as this year 's head of the group was seen as a success . but less than eight weeks later , clouds of discontent have settled over the german capital and the chill blowing down its wide streets has more to do with an international cold shoulder than the onset of fall .
the perceived spurn was all the more surprising since in the first six months of 2007 , angela merkel 's government managed to drive a reluctant eu and a stubborn g8 down the road of multilateralism . the notoriously fractious eu states were strapped together in unity around a european climate protection program and were rallied into a series of reforms ; no mean feat by anyone 's standards .
more impressively , germany managed to get the united states to sign on to an international climate accord in heiligendamm .
less publicly , germany worked hard to secure peace in the middle east , the release of hostages in afghanistan and the freedom of bulgarian nurses on death row in libya among other diplomatic efforts around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was no.1 in brussels after her successes at eu level when it came to handing over the power , merkel and her team were satisfied that germany had played a significant role in setting a new multilateral , international agenda , and created diplomatic structures for its successors to build on .
all in all , it had been a successful tenure , as approval ratings and commentaries proved .
but although they once were the ones setting the agenda , merkel and co. now are left to read in the newspapers the outcome of decisions they should have been closely involved in .
blair appointment during its eu presidency , germany was very active in the middle east .
chancellor merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier both made numerous visits to the region , attempting to persuade israel and the palestinians to return to the negotiating table , supporting the fragile democracy in lebanon and maintaining an even-handed eu involvement in the surrounding countries .
merkel had made the middle east her main foreign-affairs focus at the start of the eu presidency , continuing a german belief that a secure middle east meant a secure europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's appointment was reported to germany by the media however , just days before germany 's role as head of the eu came to an end , the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the us , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- announced that former british prime minister tony blair would be its special envoy to the region .
steinmeier 's reaction suggested that it had been less a quartet decision and more the work of a trio , with germany as eu representative cut out of the loop .
his remonstrations with his quartet colleagues were widely reported . despite merkel 's denials of a rift , it was clear that germany had not been consulted on blair 's appointment , which was reportedly first made known to the government in a front page headline . but amelia torres , acting spokesperson for the european commission , said that no german dissatisfaction was registered in brussels . " the commission is not aware of -lrb- the german -rrb- claims and , as far as we are concerned , all the decisions involving the european union were taken in consultation with all eu partners , " she said . still , germany 's leadership , at least in the eyes of berlin , was being challenged and its credibility as a global player undermined .
imf appointment rushed through by france two weeks later , the germans got another surprise .
while the appointment of former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn as the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- had been proposed by recently elected french president nicolas sarkozy , germany had been cautious about his candidacy .
sarkozy 's intentions concerning european financial institutions and policies had caused concern in berlin and a move to install strauss-kahn had increased the jitters .
when it was announced that strauss-kahn had the imf job , it was the media once again who informed germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy aggressively campaigned for strauss-kahn " it 's worth pointing out that germany was by no means the only country that felt ' under-consulted ' on these developments , " said bastian giegerich from the international center for strategic studies .
" french and us activism surprised other partners , such as the british , italians and spaniards just as much .
in the cases of the strauss-kahn and blair decisions , presidents sarkozy and bush chose to push choices aggressively . "
michael link , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp 's faction in the bundestag and his party 's eu expert , insisted that there was no snub over the imf job . " germany was involved , " he said . " and germany has had , at several instances , debated all sorts of critical issues in a very open way with the new french administration . " germany , however , was still convinced it was being pushed further to the sidelines .
sarkozys steal limelight in libya more french-inspired aggravation was to follow .
during his numerous visits to the middle east , steinmeier had been working together with the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner to secure the release of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor accused of infecting children with hiv in libya . steinmeier and ferrero-waldner were campaigning together against the death sentence issued to the six medics up until germany 's eu presidency expired .
it was assumed that the efforts would then be continued by luis amado , the foreign minister of succeeding eu president , portugal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cecilia sarkozy : " really , it was nothing . "
imagine germany 's surprise when president sarkozy 's wife cecilia appeared on the steps of a french aircraft to present the newly free nurses to the world media while her husband shook hands and made deals with libyan dictator moammar gadhafi in tripoli .
while the german foreign ministry once again made calming noises , individual politicians were livid .
some went public with claims that president sarkozy had only made a move to free the nurses to win contracts in libya while others called for france to realign itself with european interests , and not just focus on its own .
" regarding the release of the bulgarian nurses , " giegerich added , " i think the feeling in berlin is that germany had done a lot of very constructive behind-the-scenes work which ultimately contributed to the release and sarkozy stole the limelight , which of course leaves a bitter taste . " " the pictures of the release of the bulgarian nurses fitted the whole image of this libyan justice scandal : théâtre absurde , " the fdp 's michael link added .
" minister steinmeier worked hard for that release .
the real progress was made during the german eu presidency .
that 's what counts .
and everybody in the eu knows that . " in each of these cases , the situation was resolved with a welcome outcome for many .
blair will push for peace in the middle east , strauss-kahn will head the imf with european influence , and the bulgarian nurses have their freedom .
for the german government , it might be a case of credit not given where credit was due .
but was germany really ignored ?
an end to germany 's multilateralist approach ? " while it would not be completely accurate to say that germany was ignored in any of these cases , the way in which these events occurred stands in fairly sharp contrast to the consensus-building and mediating character of current german foreign policy under chancellor merkel 's leadership , " giegerich said . " the question for the future is thus whether merkel 's mode of policy-making , which has been successful so far both domestically and internationally , is sustainable , " he added . but link said he believes that germany has nothing to worry about . " the german government has overcome the shortcomings of the narrow and self-sufficient foreign-policy activities of messrs. schröder and fischer , " he said .
" and germany ’ s role as largest eu member should always be an integrating one , not a polarizing one .
but nothing in international politics is for granted .
our government must work hard in order to increase that role . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

due to its successful stewardship of the eu and the g8 this year , germany felt ready to take a seat at the top table of global politics .
now , however , it believes it is being relegated to the sidelines . if the old adage " a week is a long time in politics " is true , then two months must seem like an eternity .
it certainly appears to be the case for germany .
at the end of june this year , the german government relinquished the reins of the european union 's presidency with applause and platitudes hanging in the balmy berlin air .
the g8 summit in heiligendamm it hosted in early june as this year 's head of the group was seen as a success . but less than eight weeks later , clouds of discontent have settled over the german capital and the chill blowing down its wide streets has more to do with an international cold shoulder than the onset of fall .
the perceived spurn was all the more surprising since in the first six months of 2007 , angela merkel 's government managed to drive a reluctant eu and a stubborn g8 down the road of multilateralism . the notoriously fractious eu states were strapped together in unity around a european climate protection program and were rallied into a series of reforms ; no mean feat by anyone 's standards .
more impressively , germany managed to get the united states to sign on to an international climate accord in heiligendamm .
less publicly , germany worked hard to secure peace in the middle east , the release of hostages in afghanistan and the freedom of bulgarian nurses on death row in libya among other diplomatic efforts around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was no.1 in brussels after her successes at eu level when it came to handing over the power , merkel and her team were satisfied that germany had played a significant role in setting a new multilateral , international agenda , and created diplomatic structures for its successors to build on .
all in all , it had been a successful tenure , as approval ratings and commentaries proved .
but although they once were the ones setting the agenda , merkel and co. now are left to read in the newspapers the outcome of decisions they should have been closely involved in .
blair appointment during its eu presidency , germany was very active in the middle east .
chancellor merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier both made numerous visits to the region , attempting to persuade israel and the palestinians to return to the negotiating table , supporting the fragile democracy in lebanon and maintaining an even-handed eu involvement in the surrounding countries .
merkel had made the middle east her main foreign-affairs focus at the start of the eu presidency , continuing a german belief that a secure middle east meant a secure europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's appointment was reported to germany by the media however , just days before germany 's role as head of the eu came to an end , the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the us , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- announced that former british prime minister tony blair would be its special envoy to the region .
steinmeier 's reaction suggested that it had been less a quartet decision and more the work of a trio , with germany as eu representative cut out of the loop .
his remonstrations with his quartet colleagues were widely reported . despite merkel 's denials of a rift , it was clear that germany had not been consulted on blair 's appointment , which was reportedly first made known to the government in a front page headline . but amelia torres , acting spokesperson for the european commission , said that no german dissatisfaction was registered in brussels . " the commission is not aware of -lrb- the german -rrb- claims and , as far as we are concerned , all the decisions involving the european union were taken in consultation with all eu partners , " she said . still , germany 's leadership , at least in the eyes of berlin , was being challenged and its credibility as a global player undermined .
imf appointment rushed through by france two weeks later , the germans got another surprise .
while the appointment of former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn as the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- had been proposed by recently elected french president nicolas sarkozy , germany had been cautious about his candidacy .
sarkozy 's intentions concerning european financial institutions and policies had caused concern in berlin and a move to install strauss-kahn had increased the jitters .
when it was announced that strauss-kahn had the imf job , it was the media once again who informed germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy aggressively campaigned for strauss-kahn " it 's worth pointing out that germany was by no means the only country that felt ' under-consulted ' on these developments , " said bastian giegerich from the international center for strategic studies .
" french and us activism surprised other partners , such as the british , italians and spaniards just as much .
in the cases of the strauss-kahn and blair decisions , presidents sarkozy and bush chose to push choices aggressively . "
michael link , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp 's faction in the bundestag and his party 's eu expert , insisted that there was no snub over the imf job . " germany was involved , " he said . " and germany has had , at several instances , debated all sorts of critical issues in a very open way with the new french administration . " germany , however , was still convinced it was being pushed further to the sidelines .
sarkozys steal limelight in libya more french-inspired aggravation was to follow .
during his numerous visits to the middle east , steinmeier had been working together with the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner to secure the release of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor accused of infecting children with hiv in libya . steinmeier and ferrero-waldner were campaigning together against the death sentence issued to the six medics up until germany 's eu presidency expired .
it was assumed that the efforts would then be continued by luis amado , the foreign minister of succeeding eu president , portugal .

sarkozy 's intentions concerning european financial institutions and policies had caused concern in berlin and a move to install strauss-kahn had increased the jitters .
when it was announced that strauss-kahn had the imf job , it was the media once again who informed germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy aggressively campaigned for strauss-kahn " it 's worth pointing out that germany was by no means the only country that felt ' under-consulted ' on these developments , " said bastian giegerich from the international center for strategic studies .
" french and us activism surprised other partners , such as the british , italians and spaniards just as much .
in the cases of the strauss-kahn and blair decisions , presidents sarkozy and bush chose to push choices aggressively . "
michael link , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp 's faction in the bundestag and his party 's eu expert , insisted that there was no snub over the imf job . " germany was involved , " he said . " and germany has had , at several instances , debated all sorts of critical issues in a very open way with the new french administration . " germany , however , was still convinced it was being pushed further to the sidelines .
sarkozys steal limelight in libya more french-inspired aggravation was to follow .
during his numerous visits to the middle east , steinmeier had been working together with the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner to secure the release of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor accused of infecting children with hiv in libya . steinmeier and ferrero-waldner were campaigning together against the death sentence issued to the six medics up until germany 's eu presidency expired .
it was assumed that the efforts would then be continued by luis amado , the foreign minister of succeeding eu president , portugal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cecilia sarkozy : " really , it was nothing . "
imagine germany 's surprise when president sarkozy 's wife cecilia appeared on the steps of a french aircraft to present the newly free nurses to the world media while her husband shook hands and made deals with libyan dictator moammar gadhafi in tripoli .
while the german foreign ministry once again made calming noises , individual politicians were livid .
some went public with claims that president sarkozy had only made a move to free the nurses to win contracts in libya while others called for france to realign itself with european interests , and not just focus on its own .
" regarding the release of the bulgarian nurses , " giegerich added , " i think the feeling in berlin is that germany had done a lot of very constructive behind-the-scenes work which ultimately contributed to the release and sarkozy stole the limelight , which of course leaves a bitter taste . " " the pictures of the release of the bulgarian nurses fitted the whole image of this libyan justice scandal : théâtre absurde , " the fdp 's michael link added .
" minister steinmeier worked hard for that release .
the real progress was made during the german eu presidency .
that 's what counts .
and everybody in the eu knows that . " in each of these cases , the situation was resolved with a welcome outcome for many .
blair will push for peace in the middle east , strauss-kahn will head the imf with european influence , and the bulgarian nurses have their freedom .
for the german government , it might be a case of credit not given where credit was due .
but was germany really ignored ?
an end to germany 's multilateralist approach ? " while it would not be completely accurate to say that germany was ignored in any of these cases , the way in which these events occurred stands in fairly sharp contrast to the consensus-building and mediating character of current german foreign policy under chancellor merkel 's leadership , " giegerich said . " the question for the future is thus whether merkel 's mode of policy-making , which has been successful so far both domestically and internationally , is sustainable , " he added . but link said he believes that germany has nothing to worry about . " the german government has overcome the shortcomings of the narrow and self-sufficient foreign-policy activities of messrs. schröder and fischer , " he said .
" and germany ’ s role as largest eu member should always be an integrating one , not a polarizing one .
but nothing in international politics is for granted .
our government must work hard in order to increase that role . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is unlikely , however , that it has ever had an ancient cursed relic pass over its front desk before . many people come back from holiday with little souvenirs that they shouldn ’ t really have .
exotic seashells plucked from the sand of the south china seas , carvings made from the bough of an endangered amazonian tree and medicines made from rare animal parts may add a slight weight to the conscience in more reflective times but none are likely to cause the ill-advised tourist a life of disease and an agonizing death .
this , however , was the alleged outcome of one man ’ s visit to egypt back in 2004 .
according to the unnamed german man ’ s stepson in a note handed in together with a stolen carving to egypt 's embassy in berlin this week , the unwitting thief returned to germany from his exotic travels to suffer from unexplained paralysis , nausea , mysterious fevers and ultimately the terminal cancer which claimed his life .
son claims stepfather killed by curse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mummy was most displeased the stepson , also anonymously , claimed that the artifact , which displayed a hieroglyphic text , was responsible for bringing the " curse of the pharaohs " onto his family .
the note with the stolen fragment said that the man felt obliged to return the carving to make amends for his late stepfather 's light-fingered-ness and enable his soul to rest in peace , as well as freeing his relatives from potential repercussions .
the egyptian embassy in berlin sent the fragment back to egypt by diplomatic pouch and it has since been handed over to the supreme council for antiquities , where a committee of experts was trying to ascertain its authenticity , the council statement said .
the belief in a curse that strikes down anyone who disturbs the tombs or mummies of ancient egypt 's pharaohs has been around since the discovery of tutankhamun 's tomb in 1922 and the subsequent death of the excavation 's financier lord carnarvon . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 24.08.2007 germany launches initiative against dangerous products großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polly pocket dolls made by mattel were among the thousands recalled over lead fears while the scandal and embarassment over dangerous and defective children 's toys continues in china , germany has announced an intitiative to promote stringent safety standards within the european union . the recall of 18 million chinese-made products by us toy giant mattel because of safety concerns has led to germany launching its own initiative against defective and dangerous products .
the german economics ministry announced thursday that it planned to host a round-table discussion on the subject on august 30 with manufacturers , industry groups , consumer protection organizations and the 16 regional states .
while acknowledging that the european union sets high standards for product quality , the ministry ’ s statement called for more to be done to and suggested a quality seal verifying products are safe .
" labelling to indicate the quality -lrb- of a product -rrb- is in the most basic interest of the german economy , " the ministry said .
" german products in particular but also european products with high quality standards must compete on the market every day against much more cheaply produced products - for example from asia . "
product scandal rumbles on the slogan " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months .
hardly a day goes by without criticism about the dangers to which chinese-made products might expose consumers .
the scandals of recent weeks revolving around the safety of chinese-manufactured goods and even food reached a pinnacle when the concerns moved into children 's rooms with scares over polly pocket , batman and barbie dolls .
previously , the chemical melamine in chinese wheat-gluten exports used in pet food were blamed for the deaths of dogs and cats in the united states .
this was followed by headlines about contaminated seafood and fruit , and poisonous industrial diethylene glycol in cough syrups and toothpaste .
additionally , chinese cars exported abroad fared terribly in crash tests in germany and russia .
while the us has been sounding the alarm for weeks , the reactions of european consumers remained relatively muffled until mattel started recalling millions of toys this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbie : all dressed up and nowhere to go the company announced that tests found dangerously high lead content in the lacquer of its toys and that attached magnets came loose easily and could be swallowed by small children .
those discoveries woke up the europeans , while for the chinese a lot is now on the gaming board .
the hurried reaction of beijing 's trade ministry was to declare that the problem had been blown out of proportion , but to also pledge to spare no effort to ensure the safety of chinese export goods .
low standards ignored for cheap goods but the toy scandal also raised questions about mattel 's responsibility as well as the usual networks of subcontractors , middlemen and factories in china , where workers toil for extremely low wages in often hazardous conditions .
by producing in china , companies can maximize their profit margins , while consumers in western countries are either unaware of or choose to ignore the miserable working conditions as they have come to expect low prices for products such as dvd players , personal computers , textiles and shoes .
bildunterschrift : a " sweat shop " factory common to asia china 's government , meanwhile , concedes that black sheep do exist among local manufacturers , but insists that foreign companies had a responsibility for monitoring the quality of their products too .
this is because barbie or batman dolls , for example , were not marketed in europe and the us by chinese companies but under the renowned brand " mattel , " which traditionally stood for quality and safety .
meanwhile , the country 's toy-manufacturing industry has expressed embarrassment over the scandal and fears losing future business .
" we feel deep sorrow over the irresponsible attitude of some companies , " said the industry association in a statement and added that it would assume responsibility for improving quality standards .
" we must use this lesson as an opportunity to raise management standards , " the statement said .
firms should refrain from accepting orders that are " low priced and with unclear quality requirements " or which exceeded their manufacturing capacities .
eu , china trade accusations and admonishments more often than not , european reports to the chinese about certain unsafe products are simply ignored , which recently prompted the eu commissioner for consumer protection , meglena kuneva , to admonish beijing that " more has to be done -lrb- to ensure the safety of locally manufactured goods destined for export -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson is in the middle of an eu-china spat again earlier this week , china claimed that the eu was using concerns over chinese export standards as a form of protectionism , a claim that trade commissioner , peter mandelson , dismissed as " totally false . "
" as trade commissioner , i will not accept claims of toxicity being used as a pretext for protectionism .
equally , i will give firm backing to european companies having to reject goods that are dangerous to consumers , " he added china already has to deal with more than enough trouble domestically through contaminated food , counterfeit medicines or products which do not comply with required quality standards of local markets .
increasing concern among the general population and fear of social instability has prompted the government to order state-run media to refrain from publishing product-quality news .
because of the ban , the average chinese citizen does n't know about the recent toy scandal or complaints about the low safety standards of exported goods . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however he still has the best rating since charles de gaulle . according to a recent opinion poll , 61 percent of the french population rate nicolas sarkozy 's performance as either " very " or " fairly " good .
the survey was conducted by the ipsos institute which surveyed a representative sample of 1,000 french adults . the results were published on thursday -lrb- 23.8 -rrb- in the weekly magazine le point and represent a fall of five percent in the new president 's popularity rating since the last poll was conducted in july .
the percentage of those dissatisfied with his performance rose from 25 to 39 percent . " are those voters who expected a clearer break with his predecessor chirac now becoming impatient ? "
le point asked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a change of face and style at the elysee palace the thursday edition of the paris daily le parisien remarked that sarkozy " has entered his first spell of turbulence " due to a darkening economic outlook that could slow down planned reforms .

it is unlikely , however , that it has ever had an ancient cursed relic pass over its front desk before . many people come back from holiday with little souvenirs that they shouldn ’ t really have .
exotic seashells plucked from the sand of the south china seas , carvings made from the bough of an endangered amazonian tree and medicines made from rare animal parts may add a slight weight to the conscience in more reflective times but none are likely to cause the ill-advised tourist a life of disease and an agonizing death .
this , however , was the alleged outcome of one man ’ s visit to egypt back in 2004 .
according to the unnamed german man ’ s stepson in a note handed in together with a stolen carving to egypt 's embassy in berlin this week , the unwitting thief returned to germany from his exotic travels to suffer from unexplained paralysis , nausea , mysterious fevers and ultimately the terminal cancer which claimed his life .
son claims stepfather killed by curse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mummy was most displeased the stepson , also anonymously , claimed that the artifact , which displayed a hieroglyphic text , was responsible for bringing the " curse of the pharaohs " onto his family .
the note with the stolen fragment said that the man felt obliged to return the carving to make amends for his late stepfather 's light-fingered-ness and enable his soul to rest in peace , as well as freeing his relatives from potential repercussions .

"
he said on friday morning on german public broadcaster ard that it would contribute to a 35 to 36 percent reduction in co2 emissions by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 . with additional government programs , germany would reach its goal of 40 percent reduction in emissions by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel and merkel went to greenland last week to discuss climate protection higher taxes on gas-guzzling vehicles , greater emphasis on alternatives energy forms and stricter energy-saving requirements are at the core of the package 's 30 points , according to reports . these measures will make germany one of the " most energy-efficient regions in the world , " said economics minister michael glos , who had been involved in intense negotiations with gabriel before thursday 's meeting .
glos is a member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , while gabriel is a social democrat . at a joint presentation of the approved plan at the government 's summer retreat at meseberg palace near berlin , gabriel and glos said that several of the new laws would be considered by parliament before the end of the year , though the implementation of the individual points would be subject to review . expanded climate budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german cabinet met at meseberg palace oskar lafontaine , chairman of the left party , called the coalition 's environmental plan " much ado about nothing . " gabriel countered by pointing out that germany 's climate protection budget this year amounted to 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- - 200 percent more than in 2005 , when the coalition was founded .
the new program would cost around 8 billion euros in total , but would ultimately save the country 13 billion euros , gabriel said . thursday 's climate announcement was part of a two-day conference marking the mid-point of the governing coalition 's four-year term . the shortage of skilled labor , germany 's military mission to afghanistan and last weekend 's attack on eight indian men in eastern germany were also on the agenda at the conference , which concludes on friday . nuclear safety also on thursday , on the margins of the coalition meeting , the german government decided together with four major nuclear energy companies to tighten safety measures in that sector . " we have agreed to put in place steps that will further improve the safety climate at nuclear power plant operations within a year , " said the environment ministry in a statement . in a bid to improve safety , environment minister gabriel proposed on thursday that the oldest reactors be phased out earlier than planned and their workload transferred to more modern plants . the move comes a month after two incidents at nuclear power plants in germany sparked a national outcry and debate on safety in the branch . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 24.08.2007 germany to ease restrictions for influx of foreign skilled labor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs more skilled workers in an attempt to resolve shortages of skilled labor in key economic sectors , the german government is planning to ease labor restrictions for foreign skilled workers from central and eastern european eu member states . at a two-day retreat at meseberg palace north of berlin , the german coalition government has agreed to develop a comprehensive plan that would make it significantly easier for qualified foreign workers to get a job in germany .
sources close to the government now said that , in the short term , electrical and mechanic engineers from the 12 newer eu member states could be allowed to start working in germany as early as oct .
1 without having to apply for a work permit .
industry representatives welcomed the government 's decision to open up parts of the labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minimum wage requirements for foreign workers are expected to go down " it 's a good thing that the government in meseberg decided to implement not only short-term measures , but also to develop a master plan that 's a bit more medium-term oriented , " said achim dercks , deputy chief executive of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
comprehensive plan the plan - which will be developed jointly by the ministries of labor and education over the next few months - will also address the issue of reducing the minimum wage requirement for foreign workers , which is currently set at 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 115,000 -rrb- per year .
this issue has been a thorn in the eye of german employers who have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
german education minister annette schavan previously suggested that the wage requirement should be lowered to between 40,000 and 60,000 euros .
additionally , foreign students who complete a course of study at a german university will be able to work without hurdles for three years after graduation .
the government agreed that , in the long term , targeted immigration was " necessary and desirable , " especially in view of germany 's increasingly ageing population .
it also stressed , however , that exhausting the potential of the domestic german labor market was also a priority that could be achieved by training and educating the unemployed .
fundamental rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been struggling with unemployment the free movement of labor is one of the most fundamental rights guaranteed to all eu citizens , but , in reality , not all eu citizens are born equal .
with an eastward expansion of the union , transitional measures were introduced to protect national labor markets . germany - having struggled itself with unemployment for years - was one of the few eu nations which required that citizens from the new member states apply for work permits .
work permits were granted only in those cases in which it could be proved that no qualified german workers could be found for the given position . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german economics ministry announced thursday that it planned to host a round-table discussion on the subject on august 30 with manufacturers , industry groups , consumer protection organizations and the 16 regional states .
while acknowledging that the european union sets high standards for product quality , the ministry ’ s statement called for more to be done to and suggested a quality seal verifying products are safe .
" labelling to indicate the quality -lrb- of a product -rrb- is in the most basic interest of the german economy , " the ministry said .
" german products in particular but also european products with high quality standards must compete on the market every day against much more cheaply produced products - for example from asia . "
product scandal rumbles on the slogan " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months .
hardly a day goes by without criticism about the dangers to which chinese-made products might expose consumers .

previously , the chemical melamine in chinese wheat-gluten exports used in pet food were blamed for the deaths of dogs and cats in the united states .
this was followed by headlines about contaminated seafood and fruit , and poisonous industrial diethylene glycol in cough syrups and toothpaste .

the hurried reaction of beijing 's trade ministry was to declare that the problem had been blown out of proportion , but to also pledge to spare no effort to ensure the safety of chinese export goods .
low standards ignored for cheap goods but the toy scandal also raised questions about mattel 's responsibility as well as the usual networks of subcontractors , middlemen and factories in china , where workers toil for extremely low wages in often hazardous conditions .

meanwhile , the country 's toy-manufacturing industry has expressed embarrassment over the scandal and fears losing future business .
" we feel deep sorrow over the irresponsible attitude of some companies , " said the industry association in a statement and added that it would assume responsibility for improving quality standards .

the scandals of recent weeks revolving around the safety of chinese-manufactured goods and even food reached a pinnacle when the concerns moved into children 's rooms with scares over polly pocket , batman and barbie dolls .
previously , the chemical melamine in chinese wheat-gluten exports used in pet food were blamed for the deaths of dogs and cats in the united states .
this was followed by headlines about contaminated seafood and fruit , and poisonous industrial diethylene glycol in cough syrups and toothpaste .
additionally , chinese cars exported abroad fared terribly in crash tests in germany and russia .
while the us has been sounding the alarm for weeks , the reactions of european consumers remained relatively muffled until mattel started recalling millions of toys this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbie : all dressed up and nowhere to go the company announced that tests found dangerously high lead content in the lacquer of its toys and that attached magnets came loose easily and could be swallowed by small children .
those discoveries woke up the europeans , while for the chinese a lot is now on the gaming board .
the hurried reaction of beijing 's trade ministry was to declare that the problem had been blown out of proportion , but to also pledge to spare no effort to ensure the safety of chinese export goods .
low standards ignored for cheap goods but the toy scandal also raised questions about mattel 's responsibility as well as the usual networks of subcontractors , middlemen and factories in china , where workers toil for extremely low wages in often hazardous conditions .
by producing in china , companies can maximize their profit margins , while consumers in western countries are either unaware of or choose to ignore the miserable working conditions as they have come to expect low prices for products such as dvd players , personal computers , textiles and shoes .
bildunterschrift : a " sweat shop " factory common to asia china 's government , meanwhile , concedes that black sheep do exist among local manufacturers , but insists that foreign companies had a responsibility for monitoring the quality of their products too .
this is because barbie or batman dolls , for example , were not marketed in europe and the us by chinese companies but under the renowned brand " mattel , " which traditionally stood for quality and safety .
meanwhile , the country 's toy-manufacturing industry has expressed embarrassment over the scandal and fears losing future business .
" we feel deep sorrow over the irresponsible attitude of some companies , " said the industry association in a statement and added that it would assume responsibility for improving quality standards .
" we must use this lesson as an opportunity to raise management standards , " the statement said .
firms should refrain from accepting orders that are " low priced and with unclear quality requirements " or which exceeded their manufacturing capacities .

the scandals of recent weeks revolving around the safety of chinese-manufactured goods and even food reached a pinnacle when the concerns moved into children 's rooms with scares over polly pocket , batman and barbie dolls .
previously , the chemical melamine in chinese wheat-gluten exports used in pet food were blamed for the deaths of dogs and cats in the united states .
this was followed by headlines about contaminated seafood and fruit , and poisonous industrial diethylene glycol in cough syrups and toothpaste .
additionally , chinese cars exported abroad fared terribly in crash tests in germany and russia .
while the us has been sounding the alarm for weeks , the reactions of european consumers remained relatively muffled until mattel started recalling millions of toys this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbie : all dressed up and nowhere to go the company announced that tests found dangerously high lead content in the lacquer of its toys and that attached magnets came loose easily and could be swallowed by small children .
those discoveries woke up the europeans , while for the chinese a lot is now on the gaming board .
the hurried reaction of beijing 's trade ministry was to declare that the problem had been blown out of proportion , but to also pledge to spare no effort to ensure the safety of chinese export goods .
low standards ignored for cheap goods but the toy scandal also raised questions about mattel 's responsibility as well as the usual networks of subcontractors , middlemen and factories in china , where workers toil for extremely low wages in often hazardous conditions .
by producing in china , companies can maximize their profit margins , while consumers in western countries are either unaware of or choose to ignore the miserable working conditions as they have come to expect low prices for products such as dvd players , personal computers , textiles and shoes .
bildunterschrift : a " sweat shop " factory common to asia china 's government , meanwhile , concedes that black sheep do exist among local manufacturers , but insists that foreign companies had a responsibility for monitoring the quality of their products too .
this is because barbie or batman dolls , for example , were not marketed in europe and the us by chinese companies but under the renowned brand " mattel , " which traditionally stood for quality and safety .
meanwhile , the country 's toy-manufacturing industry has expressed embarrassment over the scandal and fears losing future business .
" we feel deep sorrow over the irresponsible attitude of some companies , " said the industry association in a statement and added that it would assume responsibility for improving quality standards .
" we must use this lesson as an opportunity to raise management standards , " the statement said .
firms should refrain from accepting orders that are " low priced and with unclear quality requirements " or which exceeded their manufacturing capacities .
eu , china trade accusations and admonishments more often than not , european reports to the chinese about certain unsafe products are simply ignored , which recently prompted the eu commissioner for consumer protection , meglena kuneva , to admonish beijing that " more has to be done -lrb- to ensure the safety of locally manufactured goods destined for export -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson is in the middle of an eu-china spat again earlier this week , china claimed that the eu was using concerns over chinese export standards as a form of protectionism , a claim that trade commissioner , peter mandelson , dismissed as " totally false . "
" as trade commissioner , i will not accept claims of toxicity being used as a pretext for protectionism .
equally , i will give firm backing to european companies having to reject goods that are dangerous to consumers , " he added china already has to deal with more than enough trouble domestically through contaminated food , counterfeit medicines or products which do not comply with required quality standards of local markets .
increasing concern among the general population and fear of social instability has prompted the government to order state-run media to refrain from publishing product-quality news .
because of the ban , the average chinese citizen does n't know about the recent toy scandal or complaints about the low safety standards of exported goods . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however he still has the best rating since charles de gaulle . according to a recent opinion poll , 61 percent of the french population rate nicolas sarkozy 's performance as either " very " or " fairly " good .
the survey was conducted by the ipsos institute which surveyed a representative sample of 1,000 french adults . the results were published on thursday -lrb- 23.8 -rrb- in the weekly magazine le point and represent a fall of five percent in the new president 's popularity rating since the last poll was conducted in july .
the percentage of those dissatisfied with his performance rose from 25 to 39 percent . " are those voters who expected a clearer break with his predecessor chirac now becoming impatient ? "
le point asked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a change of face and style at the elysee palace the thursday edition of the paris daily le parisien remarked that sarkozy " has entered his first spell of turbulence " due to a darkening economic outlook that could slow down planned reforms .
but le parisien also pointed out that , according to the ipsos poll , at the 100-day mark , sarkozy has the best popularity rating since legendary french leader charles de gaulle . something to say about everything the new french president has made domestic politics a main focus . this was demonstrated again this week following the rape of a five year-old boy by a convicted pedophile who had been released before the end of his jail term . sarkozy spoke in favor of so-called " chemical castration " and pledged to introduce tougher penalties for repeat offenders . this comes just two weeks after the introduction of the current laws . this is a perfect illustration of sarkozy 's style , said wolfgang neumann of the german-french institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- . " he 's very dynamic and always forging ahead .
one of his main characteristics is his speed . he has something to say about every aspect of domestic and foreign policy being debated and usually comes up with proposals for new legislation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and what i 'd also like to say is .
this dynamism could well be a reason for sarkozy 's present popularity .
this summer he 's pushed a number of reforms through parliament . according to neumann , the most important is university reform which would give higher-education institutions greater autonomy . " there 's also a reform of labor-market law which includes what amounts to the abolition of the 35-hour working week in france , " he said . a sheaf of further laws are waiting for approval , primarily concerning immigration and including restrictions on family reunification .
immigration was an explosive topic in the election campaign , even causing unrest in several suburbs . there are fears that this could be re-ignited as a result of the new laws .
however , neumann believes there will be widespread approval of the new legislation among the french electorate in general . is the honeymoon over ? sarkozy could well find he has a tougher time now he 's notched up his first 100 days . figures released this month show economic growth for the second quarter failing to meet expectations , casting doubt over whether the government can meet its target of 2.25-percent growth for the year . also on the agenda are measures to reduce health care costs and the labor-market reform . " these are all big changes for which there is bound to be opposition within french society , " neumann predicted . with his penchant for getting involved in every area of politics , sarkozy is , in fact , overstepping the boundaries of his mandate . " if you look at french politics , there is practically no longer a government in the autonomous sense , " says neumann . " the president has always had a prominent role but in the past has not played such an active role in day-to-day politics . " sarkozy is strengthened by the absence of any real political opposition . the only force of any significance , the socialist party , is internally divided , and several party leaders have even been brought into the sarkozy government , weakening the center-left party . reorientation of foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're such good friends when looking at foreign policy under sarkozy , the most obvious changes are france 's changed stance towards the conflict in iraq and towards the us . " the fact that sarkozy spent his summer vacation in the us , with all the accompanying media attention , is more than symbolic , " said neumann . " it 's a clear indication that french foreign policy towards the us will change significantly from the chirac era and we can expect to see relations warming .

however he still has the best rating since charles de gaulle . according to a recent opinion poll , 61 percent of the french population rate nicolas sarkozy 's performance as either " very " or " fairly " good .
the survey was conducted by the ipsos institute which surveyed a representative sample of 1,000 french adults . the results were published on thursday -lrb- 23.8 -rrb- in the weekly magazine le point and represent a fall of five percent in the new president 's popularity rating since the last poll was conducted in july .
the percentage of those dissatisfied with his performance rose from 25 to 39 percent . " are those voters who expected a clearer break with his predecessor chirac now becoming impatient ? "
le point asked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a change of face and style at the elysee palace the thursday edition of the paris daily le parisien remarked that sarkozy " has entered his first spell of turbulence " due to a darkening economic outlook that could slow down planned reforms .
but le parisien also pointed out that , according to the ipsos poll , at the 100-day mark , sarkozy has the best popularity rating since legendary french leader charles de gaulle . something to say about everything the new french president has made domestic politics a main focus . this was demonstrated again this week following the rape of a five year-old boy by a convicted pedophile who had been released before the end of his jail term . sarkozy spoke in favor of so-called " chemical castration " and pledged to introduce tougher penalties for repeat offenders . this comes just two weeks after the introduction of the current laws . this is a perfect illustration of sarkozy 's style , said wolfgang neumann of the german-french institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- . " he 's very dynamic and always forging ahead .
one of his main characteristics is his speed . he has something to say about every aspect of domestic and foreign policy being debated and usually comes up with proposals for new legislation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and what i 'd also like to say is .
this dynamism could well be a reason for sarkozy 's present popularity .
this summer he 's pushed a number of reforms through parliament . according to neumann , the most important is university reform which would give higher-education institutions greater autonomy . " there 's also a reform of labor-market law which includes what amounts to the abolition of the 35-hour working week in france , " he said . a sheaf of further laws are waiting for approval , primarily concerning immigration and including restrictions on family reunification .
immigration was an explosive topic in the election campaign , even causing unrest in several suburbs . there are fears that this could be re-ignited as a result of the new laws .
however , neumann believes there will be widespread approval of the new legislation among the french electorate in general . is the honeymoon over ? sarkozy could well find he has a tougher time now he 's notched up his first 100 days . figures released this month show economic growth for the second quarter failing to meet expectations , casting doubt over whether the government can meet its target of 2.25-percent growth for the year . also on the agenda are measures to reduce health care costs and the labor-market reform . " these are all big changes for which there is bound to be opposition within french society , " neumann predicted . with his penchant for getting involved in every area of politics , sarkozy is , in fact , overstepping the boundaries of his mandate . " if you look at french politics , there is practically no longer a government in the autonomous sense , " says neumann . " the president has always had a prominent role but in the past has not played such an active role in day-to-day politics . " sarkozy is strengthened by the absence of any real political opposition . the only force of any significance , the socialist party , is internally divided , and several party leaders have even been brought into the sarkozy government , weakening the center-left party . reorientation of foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're such good friends when looking at foreign policy under sarkozy , the most obvious changes are france 's changed stance towards the conflict in iraq and towards the us . " the fact that sarkozy spent his summer vacation in the us , with all the accompanying media attention , is more than symbolic , " said neumann . " it 's a clear indication that french foreign policy towards the us will change significantly from the chirac era and we can expect to see relations warming .

24 under the motto " joy ! " beethoven may have been buried in 1827 , but the planners behind bonn 's annual beethovenfest are determined to present the legendary classical composer as fresh , modern and still relevant today . " fortunately there 's a whole collection of beethoven works that not only make it possible to reconsider how we deal with his music in the 21st century , but also to ask what possibilities we have today to find points of medial interface - interdisciplinary , aesthetically effective new forms that inspire us to keep going , " said festival director ilona schmiel . look at beethoven bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven was born in bonn in 1770 the film project " look at beethoven " is one of the new , interdisciplinary approaches to the composer that schmiel is referring to .

" berlin artist götz lemberg has developed three installations entitled ' colored sounds ' and one of them makes reference to one of ludwig van beethoven 's central works : the slow movement of the moonlight sonata , " schmiel said . the well-known piece of music is represented in 84 pillars of light in a work that will be exhibited in the foyer of t-mobile 's bonn headquarters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 24.08.2007 germany feeling political cold shoulder after time in the sun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany sparred with the heavyweights but was it punching above its weight ?
due to its successful stewardship of the eu and the g8 this year , germany felt ready to take a seat at the top table of global politics .
now , however , it believes it is being relegated to the sidelines . if the old adage " a week is a long time in politics " is true , then two months must seem like an eternity .
it certainly appears to be the case for germany .
at the end of june this year , the german government relinquished the reins of the european union 's presidency with applause and platitudes hanging in the balmy berlin air .
the g8 summit in heiligendamm it hosted in early june as this year 's head of the group was seen as a success . but less than eight weeks later , clouds of discontent have settled over the german capital and the chill blowing down its wide streets has more to do with an international cold shoulder than the onset of fall .
the perceived spurn was all the more surprising since in the first six months of 2007 , angela merkel 's government managed to drive a reluctant eu and a stubborn g8 down the road of multilateralism . the notoriously fractious eu states were strapped together in unity around a european climate protection program and were rallied into a series of reforms ; no mean feat by anyone 's standards .
more impressively , germany managed to get the united states to sign on to an international climate accord in heiligendamm .
less publicly , germany worked hard to secure peace in the middle east , the release of hostages in afghanistan and the freedom of bulgarian nurses on death row in libya among other diplomatic efforts around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was no.1 in brussels after her successes at eu level when it came to handing over the power , merkel and her team were satisfied that germany had played a significant role in setting a new multilateral , international agenda , and created diplomatic structures for its successors to build on .
all in all , it had been a successful tenure , as approval ratings and commentaries proved .
but although they once were the ones setting the agenda , merkel and co. now are left to read in the newspapers the outcome of decisions they should have been closely involved in .
blair appointment during its eu presidency , germany was very active in the middle east .
chancellor merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier both made numerous visits to the region , attempting to persuade israel and the palestinians to return to the negotiating table , supporting the fragile democracy in lebanon and maintaining an even-handed eu involvement in the surrounding countries .
merkel had made the middle east her main foreign-affairs focus at the start of the eu presidency , continuing a german belief that a secure middle east meant a secure europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's appointment was reported to germany by the media however , just days before germany 's role as head of the eu came to an end , the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the us , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- announced that former british prime minister tony blair would be its special envoy to the region .
steinmeier 's reaction suggested that it had been less a quartet decision and more the work of a trio , with germany as eu representative cut out of the loop .
his remonstrations with his quartet colleagues were widely reported . despite merkel 's denials of a rift , it was clear that germany had not been consulted on blair 's appointment , which was reportedly first made known to the government in a front page headline . but amelia torres , acting spokesperson for the european commission , said that no german dissatisfaction was registered in brussels . " the commission is not aware of -lrb- the german -rrb- claims and , as far as we are concerned , all the decisions involving the european union were taken in consultation with all eu partners , " she said . still , germany 's leadership , at least in the eyes of berlin , was being challenged and its credibility as a global player undermined .
imf appointment rushed through by france two weeks later , the germans got another surprise .
while the appointment of former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn as the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- had been proposed by recently elected french president nicolas sarkozy , germany had been cautious about his candidacy .
sarkozy 's intentions concerning european financial institutions and policies had caused concern in berlin and a move to install strauss-kahn had increased the jitters .
when it was announced that strauss-kahn had the imf job , it was the media once again who informed germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy aggressively campaigned for strauss-kahn " it 's worth pointing out that germany was by no means the only country that felt ' under-consulted ' on these developments , " said bastian giegerich from the international center for strategic studies .
" french and us activism surprised other partners , such as the british , italians and spaniards just as much .
in the cases of the strauss-kahn and blair decisions , presidents sarkozy and bush chose to push choices aggressively . "
michael link , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp 's faction in the bundestag and his party 's eu expert , insisted that there was no snub over the imf job . " germany was involved , " he said . " and germany has had , at several instances , debated all sorts of critical issues in a very open way with the new french administration . " germany , however , was still convinced it was being pushed further to the sidelines .
sarkozys steal limelight in libya more french-inspired aggravation was to follow .
during his numerous visits to the middle east , steinmeier had been working together with the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner to secure the release of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor accused of infecting children with hiv in libya . steinmeier and ferrero-waldner were campaigning together against the death sentence issued to the six medics up until germany 's eu presidency expired .
it was assumed that the efforts would then be continued by luis amado , the foreign minister of succeeding eu president , portugal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cecilia sarkozy : " really , it was nothing . "
imagine germany 's surprise when president sarkozy 's wife cecilia appeared on the steps of a french aircraft to present the newly free nurses to the world media while her husband shook hands and made deals with libyan dictator moammar gadhafi in tripoli .
while the german foreign ministry once again made calming noises , individual politicians were livid .
some went public with claims that president sarkozy had only made a move to free the nurses to win contracts in libya while others called for france to realign itself with european interests , and not just focus on its own .
" regarding the release of the bulgarian nurses , " giegerich added , " i think the feeling in berlin is that germany had done a lot of very constructive behind-the-scenes work which ultimately contributed to the release and sarkozy stole the limelight , which of course leaves a bitter taste . " " the pictures of the release of the bulgarian nurses fitted the whole image of this libyan justice scandal : théâtre absurde , " the fdp 's michael link added .
" minister steinmeier worked hard for that release .
the real progress was made during the german eu presidency .
that 's what counts .
and everybody in the eu knows that . " in each of these cases , the situation was resolved with a welcome outcome for many .
blair will push for peace in the middle east , strauss-kahn will head the imf with european influence , and the bulgarian nurses have their freedom .
for the german government , it might be a case of credit not given where credit was due .
but was germany really ignored ?
an end to germany 's multilateralist approach ? " while it would not be completely accurate to say that germany was ignored in any of these cases , the way in which these events occurred stands in fairly sharp contrast to the consensus-building and mediating character of current german foreign policy under chancellor merkel 's leadership , " giegerich said . " the question for the future is thus whether merkel 's mode of policy-making , which has been successful so far both domestically and internationally , is sustainable , " he added . but link said he believes that germany has nothing to worry about . " the german government has overcome the shortcomings of the narrow and self-sufficient foreign-policy activities of messrs. schröder and fischer , " he said .
" and germany ’ s role as largest eu member should always be an integrating one , not a polarizing one .
but nothing in international politics is for granted .
our government must work hard in order to increase that role . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is unlikely , however , that it has ever had an ancient cursed relic pass over its front desk before . many people come back from holiday with little souvenirs that they shouldn ’ t really have .
exotic seashells plucked from the sand of the south china seas , carvings made from the bough of an endangered amazonian tree and medicines made from rare animal parts may add a slight weight to the conscience in more reflective times but none are likely to cause the ill-advised tourist a life of disease and an agonizing death .
this , however , was the alleged outcome of one man ’ s visit to egypt back in 2004 .
according to the unnamed german man ’ s stepson in a note handed in together with a stolen carving to egypt 's embassy in berlin this week , the unwitting thief returned to germany from his exotic travels to suffer from unexplained paralysis , nausea , mysterious fevers and ultimately the terminal cancer which claimed his life .
son claims stepfather killed by curse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mummy was most displeased the stepson , also anonymously , claimed that the artifact , which displayed a hieroglyphic text , was responsible for bringing the " curse of the pharaohs " onto his family .
the note with the stolen fragment said that the man felt obliged to return the carving to make amends for his late stepfather 's light-fingered-ness and enable his soul to rest in peace , as well as freeing his relatives from potential repercussions .
the egyptian embassy in berlin sent the fragment back to egypt by diplomatic pouch and it has since been handed over to the supreme council for antiquities , where a committee of experts was trying to ascertain its authenticity , the council statement said .
the belief in a curse that strikes down anyone who disturbs the tombs or mummies of ancient egypt 's pharaohs has been around since the discovery of tutankhamun 's tomb in 1922 and the subsequent death of the excavation 's financier lord carnarvon . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
he said on friday morning on german public broadcaster ard that it would contribute to a 35 to 36 percent reduction in co2 emissions by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 . with additional government programs , germany would reach its goal of 40 percent reduction in emissions by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel and merkel went to greenland last week to discuss climate protection higher taxes on gas-guzzling vehicles , greater emphasis on alternatives energy forms and stricter energy-saving requirements are at the core of the package 's 30 points , according to reports . these measures will make germany one of the " most energy-efficient regions in the world , " said economics minister michael glos , who had been involved in intense negotiations with gabriel before thursday 's meeting .
glos is a member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , while gabriel is a social democrat . at a joint presentation of the approved plan at the government 's summer retreat at meseberg palace near berlin , gabriel and glos said that several of the new laws would be considered by parliament before the end of the year , though the implementation of the individual points would be subject to review . expanded climate budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german cabinet met at meseberg palace oskar lafontaine , chairman of the left party , called the coalition 's environmental plan " much ado about nothing . " gabriel countered by pointing out that germany 's climate protection budget this year amounted to 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- - 200 percent more than in 2005 , when the coalition was founded .
the new program would cost around 8 billion euros in total , but would ultimately save the country 13 billion euros , gabriel said . thursday 's climate announcement was part of a two-day conference marking the mid-point of the governing coalition 's four-year term . the shortage of skilled labor , germany 's military mission to afghanistan and last weekend 's attack on eight indian men in eastern germany were also on the agenda at the conference , which concludes on friday . nuclear safety also on thursday , on the margins of the coalition meeting , the german government decided together with four major nuclear energy companies to tighten safety measures in that sector . " we have agreed to put in place steps that will further improve the safety climate at nuclear power plant operations within a year , " said the environment ministry in a statement . in a bid to improve safety , environment minister gabriel proposed on thursday that the oldest reactors be phased out earlier than planned and their workload transferred to more modern plants . the move comes a month after two incidents at nuclear power plants in germany sparked a national outcry and debate on safety in the branch . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

due to its successful stewardship of the eu and the g8 this year , germany felt ready to take a seat at the top table of global politics .
now , however , it believes it is being relegated to the sidelines . if the old adage " a week is a long time in politics " is true , then two months must seem like an eternity .
it certainly appears to be the case for germany .
at the end of june this year , the german government relinquished the reins of the european union 's presidency with applause and platitudes hanging in the balmy berlin air .
the g8 summit in heiligendamm it hosted in early june as this year 's head of the group was seen as a success . but less than eight weeks later , clouds of discontent have settled over the german capital and the chill blowing down its wide streets has more to do with an international cold shoulder than the onset of fall .
the perceived spurn was all the more surprising since in the first six months of 2007 , angela merkel 's government managed to drive a reluctant eu and a stubborn g8 down the road of multilateralism . the notoriously fractious eu states were strapped together in unity around a european climate protection program and were rallied into a series of reforms ; no mean feat by anyone 's standards .
more impressively , germany managed to get the united states to sign on to an international climate accord in heiligendamm .
less publicly , germany worked hard to secure peace in the middle east , the release of hostages in afghanistan and the freedom of bulgarian nurses on death row in libya among other diplomatic efforts around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was no.1 in brussels after her successes at eu level when it came to handing over the power , merkel and her team were satisfied that germany had played a significant role in setting a new multilateral , international agenda , and created diplomatic structures for its successors to build on .
all in all , it had been a successful tenure , as approval ratings and commentaries proved .
but although they once were the ones setting the agenda , merkel and co. now are left to read in the newspapers the outcome of decisions they should have been closely involved in .
blair appointment during its eu presidency , germany was very active in the middle east .
chancellor merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier both made numerous visits to the region , attempting to persuade israel and the palestinians to return to the negotiating table , supporting the fragile democracy in lebanon and maintaining an even-handed eu involvement in the surrounding countries .
merkel had made the middle east her main foreign-affairs focus at the start of the eu presidency , continuing a german belief that a secure middle east meant a secure europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's appointment was reported to germany by the media however , just days before germany 's role as head of the eu came to an end , the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the us , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- announced that former british prime minister tony blair would be its special envoy to the region .
steinmeier 's reaction suggested that it had been less a quartet decision and more the work of a trio , with germany as eu representative cut out of the loop .
his remonstrations with his quartet colleagues were widely reported . despite merkel 's denials of a rift , it was clear that germany had not been consulted on blair 's appointment , which was reportedly first made known to the government in a front page headline . but amelia torres , acting spokesperson for the european commission , said that no german dissatisfaction was registered in brussels . " the commission is not aware of -lrb- the german -rrb- claims and , as far as we are concerned , all the decisions involving the european union were taken in consultation with all eu partners , " she said . still , germany 's leadership , at least in the eyes of berlin , was being challenged and its credibility as a global player undermined .
imf appointment rushed through by france two weeks later , the germans got another surprise .
while the appointment of former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn as the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- had been proposed by recently elected french president nicolas sarkozy , germany had been cautious about his candidacy .
sarkozy 's intentions concerning european financial institutions and policies had caused concern in berlin and a move to install strauss-kahn had increased the jitters .
when it was announced that strauss-kahn had the imf job , it was the media once again who informed germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy aggressively campaigned for strauss-kahn " it 's worth pointing out that germany was by no means the only country that felt ' under-consulted ' on these developments , " said bastian giegerich from the international center for strategic studies .
" french and us activism surprised other partners , such as the british , italians and spaniards just as much .
in the cases of the strauss-kahn and blair decisions , presidents sarkozy and bush chose to push choices aggressively . "
michael link , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp 's faction in the bundestag and his party 's eu expert , insisted that there was no snub over the imf job . " germany was involved , " he said . " and germany has had , at several instances , debated all sorts of critical issues in a very open way with the new french administration . " germany , however , was still convinced it was being pushed further to the sidelines .
sarkozys steal limelight in libya more french-inspired aggravation was to follow .
during his numerous visits to the middle east , steinmeier had been working together with the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner to secure the release of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor accused of infecting children with hiv in libya . steinmeier and ferrero-waldner were campaigning together against the death sentence issued to the six medics up until germany 's eu presidency expired .
it was assumed that the efforts would then be continued by luis amado , the foreign minister of succeeding eu president , portugal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cecilia sarkozy : " really , it was nothing . "
imagine germany 's surprise when president sarkozy 's wife cecilia appeared on the steps of a french aircraft to present the newly free nurses to the world media while her husband shook hands and made deals with libyan dictator moammar gadhafi in tripoli .
while the german foreign ministry once again made calming noises , individual politicians were livid .
some went public with claims that president sarkozy had only made a move to free the nurses to win contracts in libya while others called for france to realign itself with european interests , and not just focus on its own .
" regarding the release of the bulgarian nurses , " giegerich added , " i think the feeling in berlin is that germany had done a lot of very constructive behind-the-scenes work which ultimately contributed to the release and sarkozy stole the limelight , which of course leaves a bitter taste . " " the pictures of the release of the bulgarian nurses fitted the whole image of this libyan justice scandal : théâtre absurde , " the fdp 's michael link added .
" minister steinmeier worked hard for that release .
the real progress was made during the german eu presidency .
that 's what counts .
and everybody in the eu knows that . " in each of these cases , the situation was resolved with a welcome outcome for many .
blair will push for peace in the middle east , strauss-kahn will head the imf with european influence , and the bulgarian nurses have their freedom .
for the german government , it might be a case of credit not given where credit was due .
but was germany really ignored ?
an end to germany 's multilateralist approach ? " while it would not be completely accurate to say that germany was ignored in any of these cases , the way in which these events occurred stands in fairly sharp contrast to the consensus-building and mediating character of current german foreign policy under chancellor merkel 's leadership , " giegerich said . " the question for the future is thus whether merkel 's mode of policy-making , which has been successful so far both domestically and internationally , is sustainable , " he added . but link said he believes that germany has nothing to worry about . " the german government has overcome the shortcomings of the narrow and self-sufficient foreign-policy activities of messrs. schröder and fischer , " he said .
" and germany ’ s role as largest eu member should always be an integrating one , not a polarizing one .

however he still has the best rating since charles de gaulle . according to a recent opinion poll , 61 percent of the french population rate nicolas sarkozy 's performance as either " very " or " fairly " good .
the survey was conducted by the ipsos institute which surveyed a representative sample of 1,000 french adults . the results were published on thursday -lrb- 23.8 -rrb- in the weekly magazine le point and represent a fall of five percent in the new president 's popularity rating since the last poll was conducted in july .
the percentage of those dissatisfied with his performance rose from 25 to 39 percent . " are those voters who expected a clearer break with his predecessor chirac now becoming impatient ? "

one of his main characteristics is his speed . he has something to say about every aspect of domestic and foreign policy being debated and usually comes up with proposals for new legislation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and what i 'd also like to say is .

" these are all big changes for which there is bound to be opposition within french society , " neumann predicted . with his penchant for getting involved in every area of politics , sarkozy is , in fact , overstepping the boundaries of his mandate . " if you look at french politics , there is practically no longer a government in the autonomous sense , " says neumann . " the president has always had a prominent role but in the past has not played such an active role in day-to-day politics .

28 at the latest .
he has promised to protect democracy and the constitutional separation of church and state in turkey .
are his claims credible ? cem özdemir : one just has to look at the last four and a half years of the akp administration .
they have not contributed to a fundamentalization of the turkish society - just the opposite .
the turkish society has opened up like never before in its history . so many reforms have taken place , such as in the areas of democracy and women 's rights .
it 's common knowledge that some people are distrustful of gül and now it 's in his hands - should he be elected - to break down this mistrust . is the criticism warranted ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir is a german politician of turkish origin it generally has to do with the headscarf issue among women .
but gül is right in pointing out that his wife -lsb- who wears a headscarf -rsb- is n't running for president - he is .
what the opposition leader deniz baykal said is also true , even if he unfortunately does n't stick to it himself : " it 's not important what she has on her head , but in her head . " so far , neither women nor mr. gül have had reason to be seen as radical fundamentalists .
that ca n't necessarily be said about any of the opposition politicians .
gül stands for a liberal opening of turkey .
those who want to stop him stand for ultra-nationalism . as foreign minister , he was actively involved in negotiations over turkey 's accession to the european union .
how is gül viewed in europe ? he is very highly regarded by european politicians , such as enlargement commissioner olli rehn , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier or his predecessor joschka fischer .
-lsb- gül -rsb- is seen as a reliable partner with whom one can reach agreements that the other side will stick to as well .
in this respect , one can say that gül is confronted with less distrust abroad than in his own country . what would gül 's election mean for turkey 's eu ambitions ? it would make many things easier .
you ca n't forget that the incumbent , -lsb- ahmet necdet -rsb- sezer , has blocked many important reforms in turkey , like the law on foundations , which has particularly disadvantaged christian and jewish foundations there .
the akp government wanted to put an end to this , but it was blocked by the opposition and the president did n't sign the law . important initiatives to reform the bureaucracy , postponing the retirement age and restructuring the budget were also blocked by the president .
if a president like gül , who is more open to reform , came along now , it would make the situation easier for the government . a major point of criticism concerning turkey 's possible accession to the eu is always the issue of human rights .
will changes be made in this area as well ? i knew gül way back when he was in the fundamentalist opposition party , which he tried to reform before he left it .
during that time , i often came to him with criticism from human rights organizations .
i also always asked these organizations about gül . my impression was that they 'd found a partner in gül who would always listen and take their concerns seriously - even when he could n't do anything about them due to the constraints he faced and the problems that turkey had then and still has now .
i believe that gül is someone who stands for reform in the area of human rights . do you support gül 's election as president from a european point of view ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : özdemir : gül should show the women without headscarves that his wife 's is n't a sign i not only think that he is good for europe , i also believe that he 's good for turkey .
however , the fears that exist have to be taken seriously by gül and his party .
they can best be defused by proving that they 're unjustified . there are two important groups that gül has to pay attention to : the first is the women who do n't wear headscarves .
gül has to show them that his wife 's headscarf is n't a sign .
on the contrary , it shows that diversity must be accepted .
the other group that 's waiting for a signal is the alevis , a religious minority in turkey .
it 's important for gül to show them that he is also the president of alevis . ina rottscheidt interviewed cem özdemir -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
he said on friday morning on german public broadcaster ard that it would contribute to a 35 to 36 percent reduction in co2 emissions by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 . with additional government programs , germany would reach its goal of 40 percent reduction in emissions by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel and merkel went to greenland last week to discuss climate protection higher taxes on gas-guzzling vehicles , greater emphasis on alternatives energy forms and stricter energy-saving requirements are at the core of the package 's 30 points , according to reports . these measures will make germany one of the " most energy-efficient regions in the world , " said economics minister michael glos , who had been involved in intense negotiations with gabriel before thursday 's meeting .
glos is a member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , while gabriel is a social democrat . at a joint presentation of the approved plan at the government 's summer retreat at meseberg palace near berlin , gabriel and glos said that several of the new laws would be considered by parliament before the end of the year , though the implementation of the individual points would be subject to review . expanded climate budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german cabinet met at meseberg palace oskar lafontaine , chairman of the left party , called the coalition 's environmental plan " much ado about nothing .

the new program would cost around 8 billion euros in total , but would ultimately save the country 13 billion euros , gabriel said . thursday 's climate announcement was part of a two-day conference marking the mid-point of the governing coalition 's four-year term . the shortage of skilled labor , germany 's military mission to afghanistan and last weekend 's attack on eight indian men in eastern germany were also on the agenda at the conference , which concludes on friday . nuclear safety also on thursday , on the margins of the coalition meeting , the german government decided together with four major nuclear energy companies to tighten safety measures in that sector .

" if all goes well , the ec could take a decision regarding the unbundling of energy supplies on sept .
19 , " commission spokesman for energy issues , ferran tarradellas , told journalists in brussels on thursday . " unbundling " is a model of separating production and distribution channels in the energy sector .
according to this model , companies providing energy supplies - oil , gas or electricity - could not own and control transmission systems such as pipelines and cables at the same time . " choosing a gas or electricity provider is a fundamental right , " tarradellas said .

28 at the latest .
he has promised to protect democracy and the constitutional separation of church and state in turkey .
are his claims credible ? cem özdemir : one just has to look at the last four and a half years of the akp administration .
they have not contributed to a fundamentalization of the turkish society - just the opposite .
the turkish society has opened up like never before in its history . so many reforms have taken place , such as in the areas of democracy and women 's rights .
it 's common knowledge that some people are distrustful of gül and now it 's in his hands - should he be elected - to break down this mistrust . is the criticism warranted ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir is a german politician of turkish origin it generally has to do with the headscarf issue among women .
but gül is right in pointing out that his wife -lsb- who wears a headscarf -rsb- is n't running for president - he is .
what the opposition leader deniz baykal said is also true , even if he unfortunately does n't stick to it himself : " it 's not important what she has on her head , but in her head . " so far , neither women nor mr. gül have had reason to be seen as radical fundamentalists .
that ca n't necessarily be said about any of the opposition politicians .
gül stands for a liberal opening of turkey .
those who want to stop him stand for ultra-nationalism . as foreign minister , he was actively involved in negotiations over turkey 's accession to the european union .
how is gül viewed in europe ? he is very highly regarded by european politicians , such as enlargement commissioner olli rehn , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier or his predecessor joschka fischer .
-lsb- gül -rsb- is seen as a reliable partner with whom one can reach agreements that the other side will stick to as well .
in this respect , one can say that gül is confronted with less distrust abroad than in his own country . what would gül 's election mean for turkey 's eu ambitions ? it would make many things easier .
you ca n't forget that the incumbent , -lsb- ahmet necdet -rsb- sezer , has blocked many important reforms in turkey , like the law on foundations , which has particularly disadvantaged christian and jewish foundations there .
the akp government wanted to put an end to this , but it was blocked by the opposition and the president did n't sign the law . important initiatives to reform the bureaucracy , postponing the retirement age and restructuring the budget were also blocked by the president .
if a president like gül , who is more open to reform , came along now , it would make the situation easier for the government . a major point of criticism concerning turkey 's possible accession to the eu is always the issue of human rights .
will changes be made in this area as well ? i knew gül way back when he was in the fundamentalist opposition party , which he tried to reform before he left it .
during that time , i often came to him with criticism from human rights organizations .
i also always asked these organizations about gül . my impression was that they 'd found a partner in gül who would always listen and take their concerns seriously - even when he could n't do anything about them due to the constraints he faced and the problems that turkey had then and still has now .
i believe that gül is someone who stands for reform in the area of human rights . do you support gül 's election as president from a european point of view ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : özdemir : gül should show the women without headscarves that his wife 's is n't a sign i not only think that he is good for europe , i also believe that he 's good for turkey .
however , the fears that exist have to be taken seriously by gül and his party .
they can best be defused by proving that they 're unjustified . there are two important groups that gül has to pay attention to : the first is the women who do n't wear headscarves .
gül has to show them that his wife 's headscarf is n't a sign .
on the contrary , it shows that diversity must be accepted .

" if all goes well , the ec could take a decision regarding the unbundling of energy supplies on sept .
19 , " commission spokesman for energy issues , ferran tarradellas , told journalists in brussels on thursday . " unbundling " is a model of separating production and distribution channels in the energy sector .
according to this model , companies providing energy supplies - oil , gas or electricity - could not own and control transmission systems such as pipelines and cables at the same time . " choosing a gas or electricity provider is a fundamental right , " tarradellas said .
" for that , asset separation is equally fundamental . " free-market advocates have hailed asset separation as a move that would efficiently open up the monolithic energy market to free and fair competition and benefit consumers in the long term . two approaches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some energy producers also control their delivery networks german business daily handelsblatt reported on thursday that the european union 's executive branch was considering two possible approaches to force big energy concerns to loosen their grip on bundled energy systems . under the first approach - known as full ownership unbundling - owners of distribution networks that are also energy producers would have to sell their networks to an independent third party or form a new separate business by splitting their shares . the second approach foresees big energy companies retaining ownership of the networks , but forcing them to hire an independent system operator that would manage the networks and make investment decisions in exchange for an " appropriate " fee . " if you want to guarantee that consumers can choose their energy supplier , that necessary investment is done , and that prices respond to market rules , you need strong measures to ensure real competition in the eu , " tarradellas said . opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all european countries are in favor of full ownership unbundling eight eu countries - belgium , britain , denmark , finland , the netherlands , romania , spain and sweden - already voiced their support for separation of assets in a letter to eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs in june . in july , however , nine countries - austria , bulgaria , cyprus , france , germany , greece , luxembourg , latvia and slovakia - opposed the plan , claiming that unbundling did not guarantee a rise in investment and lower consumer prices . concerns have been also raised about whether the separation of supply and distribution would make it easier for eu companies to fall under the control of non-european firms . unbundling is also not favored by russia - one of the eu 's main energy suppliers - which sees its practical monopoly over gas production and transmission as a key national security issue . proposal still lacking a majority while , according to the afp news agency , the european commission does not , at the moment , have a qualified majority necessary to implement the plan , it has the backing of the european parliament , which indicated in july that it was in favor of unbundling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy supplies are increasingly seen as a major national security concern " we wo n't propose anything which can not get a majority in the european council , " tarradellas said . eu energy ministers are expected to consider the proposal in october and reach a final decision sometime next year . in addition to unbundling , the commission is expected to propose setting transparency rules for energy sellers and buyers in order to boost control over wholesale energy prices . a 2003 law requires eu member states have an independent national regulatory authority on energy matters .

it is unlikely , however , that it has ever had an ancient cursed relic pass over its front desk before . many people come back from holiday with little souvenirs that they shouldn ’ t really have .
exotic seashells plucked from the sand of the south china seas , carvings made from the bough of an endangered amazonian tree and medicines made from rare animal parts may add a slight weight to the conscience in more reflective times but none are likely to cause the ill-advised tourist a life of disease and an agonizing death .
this , however , was the alleged outcome of one man ’ s visit to egypt back in 2004 .
according to the unnamed german man ’ s stepson in a note handed in together with a stolen carving to egypt 's embassy in berlin this week , the unwitting thief returned to germany from his exotic travels to suffer from unexplained paralysis , nausea , mysterious fevers and ultimately the terminal cancer which claimed his life .
son claims stepfather killed by curse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mummy was most displeased the stepson , also anonymously , claimed that the artifact , which displayed a hieroglyphic text , was responsible for bringing the " curse of the pharaohs " onto his family .
the note with the stolen fragment said that the man felt obliged to return the carving to make amends for his late stepfather 's light-fingered-ness and enable his soul to rest in peace , as well as freeing his relatives from potential repercussions .
the egyptian embassy in berlin sent the fragment back to egypt by diplomatic pouch and it has since been handed over to the supreme council for antiquities , where a committee of experts was trying to ascertain its authenticity , the council statement said .
the belief in a curse that strikes down anyone who disturbs the tombs or mummies of ancient egypt 's pharaohs has been around since the discovery of tutankhamun 's tomb in 1922 and the subsequent death of the excavation 's financier lord carnarvon . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german economics ministry announced thursday that it planned to host a round-table discussion on the subject on august 30 with manufacturers , industry groups , consumer protection organizations and the 16 regional states .
while acknowledging that the european union sets high standards for product quality , the ministry ’ s statement called for more to be done to and suggested a quality seal verifying products are safe .
" labelling to indicate the quality -lrb- of a product -rrb- is in the most basic interest of the german economy , " the ministry said .
" german products in particular but also european products with high quality standards must compete on the market every day against much more cheaply produced products - for example from asia . "
product scandal rumbles on the slogan " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months .
hardly a day goes by without criticism about the dangers to which chinese-made products might expose consumers .
the scandals of recent weeks revolving around the safety of chinese-manufactured goods and even food reached a pinnacle when the concerns moved into children 's rooms with scares over polly pocket , batman and barbie dolls .
previously , the chemical melamine in chinese wheat-gluten exports used in pet food were blamed for the deaths of dogs and cats in the united states .
this was followed by headlines about contaminated seafood and fruit , and poisonous industrial diethylene glycol in cough syrups and toothpaste .
additionally , chinese cars exported abroad fared terribly in crash tests in germany and russia .
while the us has been sounding the alarm for weeks , the reactions of european consumers remained relatively muffled until mattel started recalling millions of toys this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbie : all dressed up and nowhere to go the company announced that tests found dangerously high lead content in the lacquer of its toys and that attached magnets came loose easily and could be swallowed by small children .
those discoveries woke up the europeans , while for the chinese a lot is now on the gaming board .
the hurried reaction of beijing 's trade ministry was to declare that the problem had been blown out of proportion , but to also pledge to spare no effort to ensure the safety of chinese export goods .
low standards ignored for cheap goods but the toy scandal also raised questions about mattel 's responsibility as well as the usual networks of subcontractors , middlemen and factories in china , where workers toil for extremely low wages in often hazardous conditions .
by producing in china , companies can maximize their profit margins , while consumers in western countries are either unaware of or choose to ignore the miserable working conditions as they have come to expect low prices for products such as dvd players , personal computers , textiles and shoes .
bildunterschrift : a " sweat shop " factory common to asia china 's government , meanwhile , concedes that black sheep do exist among local manufacturers , but insists that foreign companies had a responsibility for monitoring the quality of their products too .
this is because barbie or batman dolls , for example , were not marketed in europe and the us by chinese companies but under the renowned brand " mattel , " which traditionally stood for quality and safety .
meanwhile , the country 's toy-manufacturing industry has expressed embarrassment over the scandal and fears losing future business .
" we feel deep sorrow over the irresponsible attitude of some companies , " said the industry association in a statement and added that it would assume responsibility for improving quality standards .
" we must use this lesson as an opportunity to raise management standards , " the statement said .
firms should refrain from accepting orders that are " low priced and with unclear quality requirements " or which exceeded their manufacturing capacities .
eu , china trade accusations and admonishments more often than not , european reports to the chinese about certain unsafe products are simply ignored , which recently prompted the eu commissioner for consumer protection , meglena kuneva , to admonish beijing that " more has to be done -lrb- to ensure the safety of locally manufactured goods destined for export -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson is in the middle of an eu-china spat again earlier this week , china claimed that the eu was using concerns over chinese export standards as a form of protectionism , a claim that trade commissioner , peter mandelson , dismissed as " totally false .

equally , i will give firm backing to european companies having to reject goods that are dangerous to consumers , " he added china already has to deal with more than enough trouble domestically through contaminated food , counterfeit medicines or products which do not comply with required quality standards of local markets .

the german economics ministry announced thursday that it planned to host a round-table discussion on the subject on august 30 with manufacturers , industry groups , consumer protection organizations and the 16 regional states .
while acknowledging that the european union sets high standards for product quality , the ministry ’ s statement called for more to be done to and suggested a quality seal verifying products are safe .
" labelling to indicate the quality -lrb- of a product -rrb- is in the most basic interest of the german economy , " the ministry said .
" german products in particular but also european products with high quality standards must compete on the market every day against much more cheaply produced products - for example from asia . "
product scandal rumbles on the slogan " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months .
hardly a day goes by without criticism about the dangers to which chinese-made products might expose consumers .
the scandals of recent weeks revolving around the safety of chinese-manufactured goods and even food reached a pinnacle when the concerns moved into children 's rooms with scares over polly pocket , batman and barbie dolls .
previously , the chemical melamine in chinese wheat-gluten exports used in pet food were blamed for the deaths of dogs and cats in the united states .
this was followed by headlines about contaminated seafood and fruit , and poisonous industrial diethylene glycol in cough syrups and toothpaste .
additionally , chinese cars exported abroad fared terribly in crash tests in germany and russia .
while the us has been sounding the alarm for weeks , the reactions of european consumers remained relatively muffled until mattel started recalling millions of toys this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbie : all dressed up and nowhere to go the company announced that tests found dangerously high lead content in the lacquer of its toys and that attached magnets came loose easily and could be swallowed by small children .
those discoveries woke up the europeans , while for the chinese a lot is now on the gaming board .
the hurried reaction of beijing 's trade ministry was to declare that the problem had been blown out of proportion , but to also pledge to spare no effort to ensure the safety of chinese export goods .
low standards ignored for cheap goods but the toy scandal also raised questions about mattel 's responsibility as well as the usual networks of subcontractors , middlemen and factories in china , where workers toil for extremely low wages in often hazardous conditions .
by producing in china , companies can maximize their profit margins , while consumers in western countries are either unaware of or choose to ignore the miserable working conditions as they have come to expect low prices for products such as dvd players , personal computers , textiles and shoes .
bildunterschrift : a " sweat shop " factory common to asia china 's government , meanwhile , concedes that black sheep do exist among local manufacturers , but insists that foreign companies had a responsibility for monitoring the quality of their products too .
this is because barbie or batman dolls , for example , were not marketed in europe and the us by chinese companies but under the renowned brand " mattel , " which traditionally stood for quality and safety .
meanwhile , the country 's toy-manufacturing industry has expressed embarrassment over the scandal and fears losing future business .
" we feel deep sorrow over the irresponsible attitude of some companies , " said the industry association in a statement and added that it would assume responsibility for improving quality standards .
" we must use this lesson as an opportunity to raise management standards , " the statement said .
firms should refrain from accepting orders that are " low priced and with unclear quality requirements " or which exceeded their manufacturing capacities .
eu , china trade accusations and admonishments more often than not , european reports to the chinese about certain unsafe products are simply ignored , which recently prompted the eu commissioner for consumer protection , meglena kuneva , to admonish beijing that " more has to be done -lrb- to ensure the safety of locally manufactured goods destined for export -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson is in the middle of an eu-china spat again earlier this week , china claimed that the eu was using concerns over chinese export standards as a form of protectionism , a claim that trade commissioner , peter mandelson , dismissed as " totally false . "
" as trade commissioner , i will not accept claims of toxicity being used as a pretext for protectionism .
equally , i will give firm backing to european companies having to reject goods that are dangerous to consumers , " he added china already has to deal with more than enough trouble domestically through contaminated food , counterfeit medicines or products which do not comply with required quality standards of local markets .
increasing concern among the general population and fear of social instability has prompted the government to order state-run media to refrain from publishing product-quality news .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 24.08.2007 germany feeling political cold shoulder after time in the sun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany sparred with the heavyweights but was it punching above its weight ?
due to its successful stewardship of the eu and the g8 this year , germany felt ready to take a seat at the top table of global politics .
now , however , it believes it is being relegated to the sidelines . if the old adage " a week is a long time in politics " is true , then two months must seem like an eternity .
it certainly appears to be the case for germany .
at the end of june this year , the german government relinquished the reins of the european union 's presidency with applause and platitudes hanging in the balmy berlin air .
the g8 summit in heiligendamm it hosted in early june as this year 's head of the group was seen as a success . but less than eight weeks later , clouds of discontent have settled over the german capital and the chill blowing down its wide streets has more to do with an international cold shoulder than the onset of fall .
the perceived spurn was all the more surprising since in the first six months of 2007 , angela merkel 's government managed to drive a reluctant eu and a stubborn g8 down the road of multilateralism . the notoriously fractious eu states were strapped together in unity around a european climate protection program and were rallied into a series of reforms ; no mean feat by anyone 's standards .
more impressively , germany managed to get the united states to sign on to an international climate accord in heiligendamm .
less publicly , germany worked hard to secure peace in the middle east , the release of hostages in afghanistan and the freedom of bulgarian nurses on death row in libya among other diplomatic efforts around the world .

all in all , it had been a successful tenure , as approval ratings and commentaries proved .
but although they once were the ones setting the agenda , merkel and co. now are left to read in the newspapers the outcome of decisions they should have been closely involved in .
blair appointment during its eu presidency , germany was very active in the middle east .
chancellor merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier both made numerous visits to the region , attempting to persuade israel and the palestinians to return to the negotiating table , supporting the fragile democracy in lebanon and maintaining an even-handed eu involvement in the surrounding countries .
merkel had made the middle east her main foreign-affairs focus at the start of the eu presidency , continuing a german belief that a secure middle east meant a secure europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's appointment was reported to germany by the media however , just days before germany 's role as head of the eu came to an end , the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the us , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- announced that former british prime minister tony blair would be its special envoy to the region .
steinmeier 's reaction suggested that it had been less a quartet decision and more the work of a trio , with germany as eu representative cut out of the loop .
his remonstrations with his quartet colleagues were widely reported . despite merkel 's denials of a rift , it was clear that germany had not been consulted on blair 's appointment , which was reportedly first made known to the government in a front page headline . but amelia torres , acting spokesperson for the european commission , said that no german dissatisfaction was registered in brussels . " the commission is not aware of -lrb- the german -rrb- claims and , as far as we are concerned , all the decisions involving the european union were taken in consultation with all eu partners , " she said . still , germany 's leadership , at least in the eyes of berlin , was being challenged and its credibility as a global player undermined .
imf appointment rushed through by france two weeks later , the germans got another surprise .
while the appointment of former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn as the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- had been proposed by recently elected french president nicolas sarkozy , germany had been cautious about his candidacy .
sarkozy 's intentions concerning european financial institutions and policies had caused concern in berlin and a move to install strauss-kahn had increased the jitters .
when it was announced that strauss-kahn had the imf job , it was the media once again who informed germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy aggressively campaigned for strauss-kahn " it 's worth pointing out that germany was by no means the only country that felt ' under-consulted ' on these developments , " said bastian giegerich from the international center for strategic studies .

in the cases of the strauss-kahn and blair decisions , presidents sarkozy and bush chose to push choices aggressively . "
michael link , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp 's faction in the bundestag and his party 's eu expert , insisted that there was no snub over the imf job .

during his numerous visits to the middle east , steinmeier had been working together with the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner to secure the release of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor accused of infecting children with hiv in libya . steinmeier and ferrero-waldner were campaigning together against the death sentence issued to the six medics up until germany 's eu presidency expired .

while the german foreign ministry once again made calming noises , individual politicians were livid .
some went public with claims that president sarkozy had only made a move to free the nurses to win contracts in libya while others called for france to realign itself with european interests , and not just focus on its own .

due to its successful stewardship of the eu and the g8 this year , germany felt ready to take a seat at the top table of global politics .
now , however , it believes it is being relegated to the sidelines . if the old adage " a week is a long time in politics " is true , then two months must seem like an eternity .
it certainly appears to be the case for germany .
at the end of june this year , the german government relinquished the reins of the european union 's presidency with applause and platitudes hanging in the balmy berlin air .
the g8 summit in heiligendamm it hosted in early june as this year 's head of the group was seen as a success . but less than eight weeks later , clouds of discontent have settled over the german capital and the chill blowing down its wide streets has more to do with an international cold shoulder than the onset of fall .
the perceived spurn was all the more surprising since in the first six months of 2007 , angela merkel 's government managed to drive a reluctant eu and a stubborn g8 down the road of multilateralism . the notoriously fractious eu states were strapped together in unity around a european climate protection program and were rallied into a series of reforms ; no mean feat by anyone 's standards .
more impressively , germany managed to get the united states to sign on to an international climate accord in heiligendamm .
less publicly , germany worked hard to secure peace in the middle east , the release of hostages in afghanistan and the freedom of bulgarian nurses on death row in libya among other diplomatic efforts around the world .

due to its successful stewardship of the eu and the g8 this year , germany felt ready to take a seat at the top table of global politics .
now , however , it believes it is being relegated to the sidelines . if the old adage " a week is a long time in politics " is true , then two months must seem like an eternity .
it certainly appears to be the case for germany .
at the end of june this year , the german government relinquished the reins of the european union 's presidency with applause and platitudes hanging in the balmy berlin air .
the g8 summit in heiligendamm it hosted in early june as this year 's head of the group was seen as a success . but less than eight weeks later , clouds of discontent have settled over the german capital and the chill blowing down its wide streets has more to do with an international cold shoulder than the onset of fall .
the perceived spurn was all the more surprising since in the first six months of 2007 , angela merkel 's government managed to drive a reluctant eu and a stubborn g8 down the road of multilateralism . the notoriously fractious eu states were strapped together in unity around a european climate protection program and were rallied into a series of reforms ; no mean feat by anyone 's standards .
more impressively , germany managed to get the united states to sign on to an international climate accord in heiligendamm .
less publicly , germany worked hard to secure peace in the middle east , the release of hostages in afghanistan and the freedom of bulgarian nurses on death row in libya among other diplomatic efforts around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was no.1 in brussels after her successes at eu level when it came to handing over the power , merkel and her team were satisfied that germany had played a significant role in setting a new multilateral , international agenda , and created diplomatic structures for its successors to build on .
all in all , it had been a successful tenure , as approval ratings and commentaries proved .
but although they once were the ones setting the agenda , merkel and co. now are left to read in the newspapers the outcome of decisions they should have been closely involved in .
blair appointment during its eu presidency , germany was very active in the middle east .
chancellor merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier both made numerous visits to the region , attempting to persuade israel and the palestinians to return to the negotiating table , supporting the fragile democracy in lebanon and maintaining an even-handed eu involvement in the surrounding countries .
merkel had made the middle east her main foreign-affairs focus at the start of the eu presidency , continuing a german belief that a secure middle east meant a secure europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's appointment was reported to germany by the media however , just days before germany 's role as head of the eu came to an end , the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the us , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- announced that former british prime minister tony blair would be its special envoy to the region .
steinmeier 's reaction suggested that it had been less a quartet decision and more the work of a trio , with germany as eu representative cut out of the loop .
his remonstrations with his quartet colleagues were widely reported . despite merkel 's denials of a rift , it was clear that germany had not been consulted on blair 's appointment , which was reportedly first made known to the government in a front page headline . but amelia torres , acting spokesperson for the european commission , said that no german dissatisfaction was registered in brussels . " the commission is not aware of -lrb- the german -rrb- claims and , as far as we are concerned , all the decisions involving the european union were taken in consultation with all eu partners , " she said . still , germany 's leadership , at least in the eyes of berlin , was being challenged and its credibility as a global player undermined .
imf appointment rushed through by france two weeks later , the germans got another surprise .
while the appointment of former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn as the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- had been proposed by recently elected french president nicolas sarkozy , germany had been cautious about his candidacy .
sarkozy 's intentions concerning european financial institutions and policies had caused concern in berlin and a move to install strauss-kahn had increased the jitters .
when it was announced that strauss-kahn had the imf job , it was the media once again who informed germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy aggressively campaigned for strauss-kahn " it 's worth pointing out that germany was by no means the only country that felt ' under-consulted ' on these developments , " said bastian giegerich from the international center for strategic studies .
" french and us activism surprised other partners , such as the british , italians and spaniards just as much .
in the cases of the strauss-kahn and blair decisions , presidents sarkozy and bush chose to push choices aggressively . "
michael link , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp 's faction in the bundestag and his party 's eu expert , insisted that there was no snub over the imf job . " germany was involved , " he said . " and germany has had , at several instances , debated all sorts of critical issues in a very open way with the new french administration . " germany , however , was still convinced it was being pushed further to the sidelines .
sarkozys steal limelight in libya more french-inspired aggravation was to follow .
during his numerous visits to the middle east , steinmeier had been working together with the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner to secure the release of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor accused of infecting children with hiv in libya . steinmeier and ferrero-waldner were campaigning together against the death sentence issued to the six medics up until germany 's eu presidency expired .
it was assumed that the efforts would then be continued by luis amado , the foreign minister of succeeding eu president , portugal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cecilia sarkozy : " really , it was nothing . "
imagine germany 's surprise when president sarkozy 's wife cecilia appeared on the steps of a french aircraft to present the newly free nurses to the world media while her husband shook hands and made deals with libyan dictator moammar gadhafi in tripoli .
while the german foreign ministry once again made calming noises , individual politicians were livid .
some went public with claims that president sarkozy had only made a move to free the nurses to win contracts in libya while others called for france to realign itself with european interests , and not just focus on its own .
" regarding the release of the bulgarian nurses , " giegerich added , " i think the feeling in berlin is that germany had done a lot of very constructive behind-the-scenes work which ultimately contributed to the release and sarkozy stole the limelight , which of course leaves a bitter taste . " " the pictures of the release of the bulgarian nurses fitted the whole image of this libyan justice scandal : théâtre absurde , " the fdp 's michael link added .
" minister steinmeier worked hard for that release .
the real progress was made during the german eu presidency .
that 's what counts .
and everybody in the eu knows that . " in each of these cases , the situation was resolved with a welcome outcome for many .
blair will push for peace in the middle east , strauss-kahn will head the imf with european influence , and the bulgarian nurses have their freedom .
for the german government , it might be a case of credit not given where credit was due .
but was germany really ignored ?
an end to germany 's multilateralist approach ? " while it would not be completely accurate to say that germany was ignored in any of these cases , the way in which these events occurred stands in fairly sharp contrast to the consensus-building and mediating character of current german foreign policy under chancellor merkel 's leadership , " giegerich said . " the question for the future is thus whether merkel 's mode of policy-making , which has been successful so far both domestically and internationally , is sustainable , " he added . but link said he believes that germany has nothing to worry about . " the german government has overcome the shortcomings of the narrow and self-sufficient foreign-policy activities of messrs. schröder and fischer , " he said .
" and germany ’ s role as largest eu member should always be an integrating one , not a polarizing one .
but nothing in international politics is for granted .
our government must work hard in order to increase that role . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however he still has the best rating since charles de gaulle . according to a recent opinion poll , 61 percent of the french population rate nicolas sarkozy 's performance as either " very " or " fairly " good .
the survey was conducted by the ipsos institute which surveyed a representative sample of 1,000 french adults . the results were published on thursday -lrb- 23.8 -rrb- in the weekly magazine le point and represent a fall of five percent in the new president 's popularity rating since the last poll was conducted in july .
the percentage of those dissatisfied with his performance rose from 25 to 39 percent . " are those voters who expected a clearer break with his predecessor chirac now becoming impatient ? "
le point asked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a change of face and style at the elysee palace the thursday edition of the paris daily le parisien remarked that sarkozy " has entered his first spell of turbulence " due to a darkening economic outlook that could slow down planned reforms .
but le parisien also pointed out that , according to the ipsos poll , at the 100-day mark , sarkozy has the best popularity rating since legendary french leader charles de gaulle . something to say about everything the new french president has made domestic politics a main focus . this was demonstrated again this week following the rape of a five year-old boy by a convicted pedophile who had been released before the end of his jail term . sarkozy spoke in favor of so-called " chemical castration " and pledged to introduce tougher penalties for repeat offenders . this comes just two weeks after the introduction of the current laws . this is a perfect illustration of sarkozy 's style , said wolfgang neumann of the german-french institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- . " he 's very dynamic and always forging ahead .
one of his main characteristics is his speed . he has something to say about every aspect of domestic and foreign policy being debated and usually comes up with proposals for new legislation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and what i 'd also like to say is .
this dynamism could well be a reason for sarkozy 's present popularity .
this summer he 's pushed a number of reforms through parliament . according to neumann , the most important is university reform which would give higher-education institutions greater autonomy . " there 's also a reform of labor-market law which includes what amounts to the abolition of the 35-hour working week in france , " he said . a sheaf of further laws are waiting for approval , primarily concerning immigration and including restrictions on family reunification .
immigration was an explosive topic in the election campaign , even causing unrest in several suburbs . there are fears that this could be re-ignited as a result of the new laws .
however , neumann believes there will be widespread approval of the new legislation among the french electorate in general . is the honeymoon over ? sarkozy could well find he has a tougher time now he 's notched up his first 100 days . figures released this month show economic growth for the second quarter failing to meet expectations , casting doubt over whether the government can meet its target of 2.25-percent growth for the year . also on the agenda are measures to reduce health care costs and the labor-market reform . " these are all big changes for which there is bound to be opposition within french society , " neumann predicted . with his penchant for getting involved in every area of politics , sarkozy is , in fact , overstepping the boundaries of his mandate . " if you look at french politics , there is practically no longer a government in the autonomous sense , " says neumann . " the president has always had a prominent role but in the past has not played such an active role in day-to-day politics . " sarkozy is strengthened by the absence of any real political opposition . the only force of any significance , the socialist party , is internally divided , and several party leaders have even been brought into the sarkozy government , weakening the center-left party . reorientation of foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're such good friends when looking at foreign policy under sarkozy , the most obvious changes are france 's changed stance towards the conflict in iraq and towards the us . " the fact that sarkozy spent his summer vacation in the us , with all the accompanying media attention , is more than symbolic , " said neumann . " it 's a clear indication that french foreign policy towards the us will change significantly from the chirac era and we can expect to see relations warming .

however he still has the best rating since charles de gaulle . according to a recent opinion poll , 61 percent of the french population rate nicolas sarkozy 's performance as either " very " or " fairly " good .
the survey was conducted by the ipsos institute which surveyed a representative sample of 1,000 french adults . the results were published on thursday -lrb- 23.8 -rrb- in the weekly magazine le point and represent a fall of five percent in the new president 's popularity rating since the last poll was conducted in july .
the percentage of those dissatisfied with his performance rose from 25 to 39 percent . " are those voters who expected a clearer break with his predecessor chirac now becoming impatient ? "
le point asked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a change of face and style at the elysee palace the thursday edition of the paris daily le parisien remarked that sarkozy " has entered his first spell of turbulence " due to a darkening economic outlook that could slow down planned reforms .
but le parisien also pointed out that , according to the ipsos poll , at the 100-day mark , sarkozy has the best popularity rating since legendary french leader charles de gaulle . something to say about everything the new french president has made domestic politics a main focus . this was demonstrated again this week following the rape of a five year-old boy by a convicted pedophile who had been released before the end of his jail term . sarkozy spoke in favor of so-called " chemical castration " and pledged to introduce tougher penalties for repeat offenders . this comes just two weeks after the introduction of the current laws . this is a perfect illustration of sarkozy 's style , said wolfgang neumann of the german-french institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- . " he 's very dynamic and always forging ahead .
one of his main characteristics is his speed . he has something to say about every aspect of domestic and foreign policy being debated and usually comes up with proposals for new legislation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and what i 'd also like to say is .
this dynamism could well be a reason for sarkozy 's present popularity .
this summer he 's pushed a number of reforms through parliament . according to neumann , the most important is university reform which would give higher-education institutions greater autonomy . " there 's also a reform of labor-market law which includes what amounts to the abolition of the 35-hour working week in france , " he said . a sheaf of further laws are waiting for approval , primarily concerning immigration and including restrictions on family reunification .
immigration was an explosive topic in the election campaign , even causing unrest in several suburbs . there are fears that this could be re-ignited as a result of the new laws .
however , neumann believes there will be widespread approval of the new legislation among the french electorate in general . is the honeymoon over ? sarkozy could well find he has a tougher time now he 's notched up his first 100 days . figures released this month show economic growth for the second quarter failing to meet expectations , casting doubt over whether the government can meet its target of 2.25-percent growth for the year . also on the agenda are measures to reduce health care costs and the labor-market reform . " these are all big changes for which there is bound to be opposition within french society , " neumann predicted . with his penchant for getting involved in every area of politics , sarkozy is , in fact , overstepping the boundaries of his mandate . " if you look at french politics , there is practically no longer a government in the autonomous sense , " says neumann . " the president has always had a prominent role but in the past has not played such an active role in day-to-day politics . " sarkozy is strengthened by the absence of any real political opposition . the only force of any significance , the socialist party , is internally divided , and several party leaders have even been brought into the sarkozy government , weakening the center-left party . reorientation of foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're such good friends when looking at foreign policy under sarkozy , the most obvious changes are france 's changed stance towards the conflict in iraq and towards the us . " the fact that sarkozy spent his summer vacation in the us , with all the accompanying media attention , is more than symbolic , " said neumann .

the german economics ministry announced thursday that it planned to host a round-table discussion on the subject on august 30 with manufacturers , industry groups , consumer protection organizations and the 16 regional states .
while acknowledging that the european union sets high standards for product quality , the ministry ’ s statement called for more to be done to and suggested a quality seal verifying products are safe .
" labelling to indicate the quality -lrb- of a product -rrb- is in the most basic interest of the german economy , " the ministry said .
" german products in particular but also european products with high quality standards must compete on the market every day against much more cheaply produced products - for example from asia . "
product scandal rumbles on the slogan " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months .
hardly a day goes by without criticism about the dangers to which chinese-made products might expose consumers .
the scandals of recent weeks revolving around the safety of chinese-manufactured goods and even food reached a pinnacle when the concerns moved into children 's rooms with scares over polly pocket , batman and barbie dolls .
previously , the chemical melamine in chinese wheat-gluten exports used in pet food were blamed for the deaths of dogs and cats in the united states .
this was followed by headlines about contaminated seafood and fruit , and poisonous industrial diethylene glycol in cough syrups and toothpaste .
additionally , chinese cars exported abroad fared terribly in crash tests in germany and russia .
while the us has been sounding the alarm for weeks , the reactions of european consumers remained relatively muffled until mattel started recalling millions of toys this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbie : all dressed up and nowhere to go the company announced that tests found dangerously high lead content in the lacquer of its toys and that attached magnets came loose easily and could be swallowed by small children .
those discoveries woke up the europeans , while for the chinese a lot is now on the gaming board .
the hurried reaction of beijing 's trade ministry was to declare that the problem had been blown out of proportion , but to also pledge to spare no effort to ensure the safety of chinese export goods .
low standards ignored for cheap goods but the toy scandal also raised questions about mattel 's responsibility as well as the usual networks of subcontractors , middlemen and factories in china , where workers toil for extremely low wages in often hazardous conditions .
by producing in china , companies can maximize their profit margins , while consumers in western countries are either unaware of or choose to ignore the miserable working conditions as they have come to expect low prices for products such as dvd players , personal computers , textiles and shoes .
bildunterschrift : a " sweat shop " factory common to asia china 's government , meanwhile , concedes that black sheep do exist among local manufacturers , but insists that foreign companies had a responsibility for monitoring the quality of their products too .
this is because barbie or batman dolls , for example , were not marketed in europe and the us by chinese companies but under the renowned brand " mattel , " which traditionally stood for quality and safety .
meanwhile , the country 's toy-manufacturing industry has expressed embarrassment over the scandal and fears losing future business .
" we feel deep sorrow over the irresponsible attitude of some companies , " said the industry association in a statement and added that it would assume responsibility for improving quality standards .
" we must use this lesson as an opportunity to raise management standards , " the statement said .
firms should refrain from accepting orders that are " low priced and with unclear quality requirements " or which exceeded their manufacturing capacities .
eu , china trade accusations and admonishments more often than not , european reports to the chinese about certain unsafe products are simply ignored , which recently prompted the eu commissioner for consumer protection , meglena kuneva , to admonish beijing that " more has to be done -lrb- to ensure the safety of locally manufactured goods destined for export -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson is in the middle of an eu-china spat again earlier this week , china claimed that the eu was using concerns over chinese export standards as a form of protectionism , a claim that trade commissioner , peter mandelson , dismissed as " totally false .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 24.08.2007 germany launches initiative against dangerous products großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polly pocket dolls made by mattel were among the thousands recalled over lead fears while the scandal and embarassment over dangerous and defective children 's toys continues in china , germany has announced an intitiative to promote stringent safety standards within the european union . the recall of 18 million chinese-made products by us toy giant mattel because of safety concerns has led to germany launching its own initiative against defective and dangerous products .
the german economics ministry announced thursday that it planned to host a round-table discussion on the subject on august 30 with manufacturers , industry groups , consumer protection organizations and the 16 regional states .
while acknowledging that the european union sets high standards for product quality , the ministry ’ s statement called for more to be done to and suggested a quality seal verifying products are safe .
" labelling to indicate the quality -lrb- of a product -rrb- is in the most basic interest of the german economy , " the ministry said .
" german products in particular but also european products with high quality standards must compete on the market every day against much more cheaply produced products - for example from asia . "
product scandal rumbles on the slogan " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months .
hardly a day goes by without criticism about the dangers to which chinese-made products might expose consumers .
the scandals of recent weeks revolving around the safety of chinese-manufactured goods and even food reached a pinnacle when the concerns moved into children 's rooms with scares over polly pocket , batman and barbie dolls .
previously , the chemical melamine in chinese wheat-gluten exports used in pet food were blamed for the deaths of dogs and cats in the united states .
this was followed by headlines about contaminated seafood and fruit , and poisonous industrial diethylene glycol in cough syrups and toothpaste .
additionally , chinese cars exported abroad fared terribly in crash tests in germany and russia .
while the us has been sounding the alarm for weeks , the reactions of european consumers remained relatively muffled until mattel started recalling millions of toys this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbie : all dressed up and nowhere to go the company announced that tests found dangerously high lead content in the lacquer of its toys and that attached magnets came loose easily and could be swallowed by small children .
those discoveries woke up the europeans , while for the chinese a lot is now on the gaming board .
the hurried reaction of beijing 's trade ministry was to declare that the problem had been blown out of proportion , but to also pledge to spare no effort to ensure the safety of chinese export goods .
low standards ignored for cheap goods but the toy scandal also raised questions about mattel 's responsibility as well as the usual networks of subcontractors , middlemen and factories in china , where workers toil for extremely low wages in often hazardous conditions .
by producing in china , companies can maximize their profit margins , while consumers in western countries are either unaware of or choose to ignore the miserable working conditions as they have come to expect low prices for products such as dvd players , personal computers , textiles and shoes .
bildunterschrift : a " sweat shop " factory common to asia china 's government , meanwhile , concedes that black sheep do exist among local manufacturers , but insists that foreign companies had a responsibility for monitoring the quality of their products too .
this is because barbie or batman dolls , for example , were not marketed in europe and the us by chinese companies but under the renowned brand " mattel , " which traditionally stood for quality and safety .
meanwhile , the country 's toy-manufacturing industry has expressed embarrassment over the scandal and fears losing future business .
" we feel deep sorrow over the irresponsible attitude of some companies , " said the industry association in a statement and added that it would assume responsibility for improving quality standards .
" we must use this lesson as an opportunity to raise management standards , " the statement said .
firms should refrain from accepting orders that are " low priced and with unclear quality requirements " or which exceeded their manufacturing capacities .
eu , china trade accusations and admonishments more often than not , european reports to the chinese about certain unsafe products are simply ignored , which recently prompted the eu commissioner for consumer protection , meglena kuneva , to admonish beijing that " more has to be done -lrb- to ensure the safety of locally manufactured goods destined for export -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson is in the middle of an eu-china spat again earlier this week , china claimed that the eu was using concerns over chinese export standards as a form of protectionism , a claim that trade commissioner , peter mandelson , dismissed as " totally false . "
" as trade commissioner , i will not accept claims of toxicity being used as a pretext for protectionism .
equally , i will give firm backing to european companies having to reject goods that are dangerous to consumers , " he added china already has to deal with more than enough trouble domestically through contaminated food , counterfeit medicines or products which do not comply with required quality standards of local markets .
increasing concern among the general population and fear of social instability has prompted the government to order state-run media to refrain from publishing product-quality news .
because of the ban , the average chinese citizen does n't know about the recent toy scandal or complaints about the low safety standards of exported goods . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if all goes well , the ec could take a decision regarding the unbundling of energy supplies on sept .
19 , " commission spokesman for energy issues , ferran tarradellas , told journalists in brussels on thursday . " unbundling " is a model of separating production and distribution channels in the energy sector .
according to this model , companies providing energy supplies - oil , gas or electricity - could not own and control transmission systems such as pipelines and cables at the same time . " choosing a gas or electricity provider is a fundamental right , " tarradellas said .

the commission , however , is planning to strengthen the role of a pan-european regulator , either by creating a new agency or giving a wider mandate to its existing advisory body , the european regulators ' group for electricity and gas -lrb- ergeg -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sources close to the government now said that , in the short term , electrical and mechanic engineers from the 12 newer eu member states could be allowed to start working in germany as early as oct .
1 without having to apply for a work permit .
industry representatives welcomed the government 's decision to open up parts of the labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minimum wage requirements for foreign workers are expected to go down " it 's a good thing that the government in meseberg decided to implement not only short-term measures , but also to develop a master plan that 's a bit more medium-term oriented , " said achim dercks , deputy chief executive of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
comprehensive plan the plan - which will be developed jointly by the ministries of labor and education over the next few months - will also address the issue of reducing the minimum wage requirement for foreign workers , which is currently set at 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 115,000 -rrb- per year .
this issue has been a thorn in the eye of german employers who have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
german education minister annette schavan previously suggested that the wage requirement should be lowered to between 40,000 and 60,000 euros .
additionally , foreign students who complete a course of study at a german university will be able to work without hurdles for three years after graduation .
the government agreed that , in the long term , targeted immigration was " necessary and desirable , " especially in view of germany 's increasingly ageing population .
it also stressed , however , that exhausting the potential of the domestic german labor market was also a priority that could be achieved by training and educating the unemployed .
fundamental rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been struggling with unemployment the free movement of labor is one of the most fundamental rights guaranteed to all eu citizens , but , in reality , not all eu citizens are born equal .
with an eastward expansion of the union , transitional measures were introduced to protect national labor markets . germany - having struggled itself with unemployment for years - was one of the few eu nations which required that citizens from the new member states apply for work permits .
work permits were granted only in those cases in which it could be proved that no qualified german workers could be found for the given position . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

are his claims credible ? cem özdemir : one just has to look at the last four and a half years of the akp administration .
they have not contributed to a fundamentalization of the turkish society - just the opposite .
the turkish society has opened up like never before in its history . so many reforms have taken place , such as in the areas of democracy and women 's rights .

but gül is right in pointing out that his wife -lsb- who wears a headscarf -rsb- is n't running for president - he is .
what the opposition leader deniz baykal said is also true , even if he unfortunately does n't stick to it himself : " it 's not important what she has on her head , but in her head . " so far , neither women nor mr. gül have had reason to be seen as radical fundamentalists .
that ca n't necessarily be said about any of the opposition politicians .
gül stands for a liberal opening of turkey .
those who want to stop him stand for ultra-nationalism . as foreign minister , he was actively involved in negotiations over turkey 's accession to the european union .

-lsb- gül -rsb- is seen as a reliable partner with whom one can reach agreements that the other side will stick to as well .
in this respect , one can say that gül is confronted with less distrust abroad than in his own country . what would gül 's election mean for turkey 's eu ambitions ? it would make many things easier .
you ca n't forget that the incumbent , -lsb- ahmet necdet -rsb- sezer , has blocked many important reforms in turkey , like the law on foundations , which has particularly disadvantaged christian and jewish foundations there .
the akp government wanted to put an end to this , but it was blocked by the opposition and the president did n't sign the law . important initiatives to reform the bureaucracy , postponing the retirement age and restructuring the budget were also blocked by the president .
if a president like gül , who is more open to reform , came along now , it would make the situation easier for the government . a major point of criticism concerning turkey 's possible accession to the eu is always the issue of human rights .
will changes be made in this area as well ? i knew gül way back when he was in the fundamentalist opposition party , which he tried to reform before he left it .
during that time , i often came to him with criticism from human rights organizations .
i also always asked these organizations about gül . my impression was that they 'd found a partner in gül who would always listen and take their concerns seriously - even when he could n't do anything about them due to the constraints he faced and the problems that turkey had then and still has now .

what the opposition leader deniz baykal said is also true , even if he unfortunately does n't stick to it himself : " it 's not important what she has on her head , but in her head . " so far , neither women nor mr. gül have had reason to be seen as radical fundamentalists .

sources close to the government now said that , in the short term , electrical and mechanic engineers from the 12 newer eu member states could be allowed to start working in germany as early as oct .
1 without having to apply for a work permit .
industry representatives welcomed the government 's decision to open up parts of the labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minimum wage requirements for foreign workers are expected to go down " it 's a good thing that the government in meseberg decided to implement not only short-term measures , but also to develop a master plan that 's a bit more medium-term oriented , " said achim dercks , deputy chief executive of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
comprehensive plan the plan - which will be developed jointly by the ministries of labor and education over the next few months - will also address the issue of reducing the minimum wage requirement for foreign workers , which is currently set at 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 115,000 -rrb- per year .
this issue has been a thorn in the eye of german employers who have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
german education minister annette schavan previously suggested that the wage requirement should be lowered to between 40,000 and 60,000 euros .
additionally , foreign students who complete a course of study at a german university will be able to work without hurdles for three years after graduation .
the government agreed that , in the long term , targeted immigration was " necessary and desirable , " especially in view of germany 's increasingly ageing population .
it also stressed , however , that exhausting the potential of the domestic german labor market was also a priority that could be achieved by training and educating the unemployed .
fundamental rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been struggling with unemployment the free movement of labor is one of the most fundamental rights guaranteed to all eu citizens , but , in reality , not all eu citizens are born equal .
with an eastward expansion of the union , transitional measures were introduced to protect national labor markets . germany - having struggled itself with unemployment for years - was one of the few eu nations which required that citizens from the new member states apply for work permits .
work permits were granted only in those cases in which it could be proved that no qualified german workers could be found for the given position . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

due to its successful stewardship of the eu and the g8 this year , germany felt ready to take a seat at the top table of global politics .
now , however , it believes it is being relegated to the sidelines . if the old adage " a week is a long time in politics " is true , then two months must seem like an eternity .
it certainly appears to be the case for germany .
at the end of june this year , the german government relinquished the reins of the european union 's presidency with applause and platitudes hanging in the balmy berlin air .
the g8 summit in heiligendamm it hosted in early june as this year 's head of the group was seen as a success . but less than eight weeks later , clouds of discontent have settled over the german capital and the chill blowing down its wide streets has more to do with an international cold shoulder than the onset of fall .
the perceived spurn was all the more surprising since in the first six months of 2007 , angela merkel 's government managed to drive a reluctant eu and a stubborn g8 down the road of multilateralism . the notoriously fractious eu states were strapped together in unity around a european climate protection program and were rallied into a series of reforms ; no mean feat by anyone 's standards .
more impressively , germany managed to get the united states to sign on to an international climate accord in heiligendamm .
less publicly , germany worked hard to secure peace in the middle east , the release of hostages in afghanistan and the freedom of bulgarian nurses on death row in libya among other diplomatic efforts around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was no.1 in brussels after her successes at eu level when it came to handing over the power , merkel and her team were satisfied that germany had played a significant role in setting a new multilateral , international agenda , and created diplomatic structures for its successors to build on .
all in all , it had been a successful tenure , as approval ratings and commentaries proved .
but although they once were the ones setting the agenda , merkel and co. now are left to read in the newspapers the outcome of decisions they should have been closely involved in .
blair appointment during its eu presidency , germany was very active in the middle east .
chancellor merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier both made numerous visits to the region , attempting to persuade israel and the palestinians to return to the negotiating table , supporting the fragile democracy in lebanon and maintaining an even-handed eu involvement in the surrounding countries .
merkel had made the middle east her main foreign-affairs focus at the start of the eu presidency , continuing a german belief that a secure middle east meant a secure europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's appointment was reported to germany by the media however , just days before germany 's role as head of the eu came to an end , the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the us , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- announced that former british prime minister tony blair would be its special envoy to the region .
steinmeier 's reaction suggested that it had been less a quartet decision and more the work of a trio , with germany as eu representative cut out of the loop .
his remonstrations with his quartet colleagues were widely reported . despite merkel 's denials of a rift , it was clear that germany had not been consulted on blair 's appointment , which was reportedly first made known to the government in a front page headline . but amelia torres , acting spokesperson for the european commission , said that no german dissatisfaction was registered in brussels . " the commission is not aware of -lrb- the german -rrb- claims and , as far as we are concerned , all the decisions involving the european union were taken in consultation with all eu partners , " she said . still , germany 's leadership , at least in the eyes of berlin , was being challenged and its credibility as a global player undermined .
imf appointment rushed through by france two weeks later , the germans got another surprise .
while the appointment of former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn as the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- had been proposed by recently elected french president nicolas sarkozy , germany had been cautious about his candidacy .
sarkozy 's intentions concerning european financial institutions and policies had caused concern in berlin and a move to install strauss-kahn had increased the jitters .
when it was announced that strauss-kahn had the imf job , it was the media once again who informed germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy aggressively campaigned for strauss-kahn " it 's worth pointing out that germany was by no means the only country that felt ' under-consulted ' on these developments , " said bastian giegerich from the international center for strategic studies .
" french and us activism surprised other partners , such as the british , italians and spaniards just as much .
in the cases of the strauss-kahn and blair decisions , presidents sarkozy and bush chose to push choices aggressively . "
michael link , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp 's faction in the bundestag and his party 's eu expert , insisted that there was no snub over the imf job . " germany was involved , " he said . " and germany has had , at several instances , debated all sorts of critical issues in a very open way with the new french administration . " germany , however , was still convinced it was being pushed further to the sidelines .
sarkozys steal limelight in libya more french-inspired aggravation was to follow .
during his numerous visits to the middle east , steinmeier had been working together with the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner to secure the release of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor accused of infecting children with hiv in libya . steinmeier and ferrero-waldner were campaigning together against the death sentence issued to the six medics up until germany 's eu presidency expired .
it was assumed that the efforts would then be continued by luis amado , the foreign minister of succeeding eu president , portugal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cecilia sarkozy : " really , it was nothing . "
imagine germany 's surprise when president sarkozy 's wife cecilia appeared on the steps of a french aircraft to present the newly free nurses to the world media while her husband shook hands and made deals with libyan dictator moammar gadhafi in tripoli .
while the german foreign ministry once again made calming noises , individual politicians were livid .
some went public with claims that president sarkozy had only made a move to free the nurses to win contracts in libya while others called for france to realign itself with european interests , and not just focus on its own .
" regarding the release of the bulgarian nurses , " giegerich added , " i think the feeling in berlin is that germany had done a lot of very constructive behind-the-scenes work which ultimately contributed to the release and sarkozy stole the limelight , which of course leaves a bitter taste . " " the pictures of the release of the bulgarian nurses fitted the whole image of this libyan justice scandal : théâtre absurde , " the fdp 's michael link added .
" minister steinmeier worked hard for that release .
the real progress was made during the german eu presidency .
that 's what counts .
and everybody in the eu knows that . " in each of these cases , the situation was resolved with a welcome outcome for many .
blair will push for peace in the middle east , strauss-kahn will head the imf with european influence , and the bulgarian nurses have their freedom .
for the german government , it might be a case of credit not given where credit was due .
but was germany really ignored ?
an end to germany 's multilateralist approach ? " while it would not be completely accurate to say that germany was ignored in any of these cases , the way in which these events occurred stands in fairly sharp contrast to the consensus-building and mediating character of current german foreign policy under chancellor merkel 's leadership , " giegerich said . " the question for the future is thus whether merkel 's mode of policy-making , which has been successful so far both domestically and internationally , is sustainable , " he added . but link said he believes that germany has nothing to worry about . " the german government has overcome the shortcomings of the narrow and self-sufficient foreign-policy activities of messrs. schröder and fischer , " he said .
" and germany ’ s role as largest eu member should always be an integrating one , not a polarizing one .
but nothing in international politics is for granted .
our government must work hard in order to increase that role . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however he still has the best rating since charles de gaulle . according to a recent opinion poll , 61 percent of the french population rate nicolas sarkozy 's performance as either " very " or " fairly " good .
the survey was conducted by the ipsos institute which surveyed a representative sample of 1,000 french adults . the results were published on thursday -lrb- 23.8 -rrb- in the weekly magazine le point and represent a fall of five percent in the new president 's popularity rating since the last poll was conducted in july .
the percentage of those dissatisfied with his performance rose from 25 to 39 percent . " are those voters who expected a clearer break with his predecessor chirac now becoming impatient ? "
le point asked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a change of face and style at the elysee palace the thursday edition of the paris daily le parisien remarked that sarkozy " has entered his first spell of turbulence " due to a darkening economic outlook that could slow down planned reforms .
but le parisien also pointed out that , according to the ipsos poll , at the 100-day mark , sarkozy has the best popularity rating since legendary french leader charles de gaulle . something to say about everything the new french president has made domestic politics a main focus . this was demonstrated again this week following the rape of a five year-old boy by a convicted pedophile who had been released before the end of his jail term . sarkozy spoke in favor of so-called " chemical castration " and pledged to introduce tougher penalties for repeat offenders . this comes just two weeks after the introduction of the current laws . this is a perfect illustration of sarkozy 's style , said wolfgang neumann of the german-french institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- . " he 's very dynamic and always forging ahead .
one of his main characteristics is his speed . he has something to say about every aspect of domestic and foreign policy being debated and usually comes up with proposals for new legislation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and what i 'd also like to say is .
this dynamism could well be a reason for sarkozy 's present popularity .
this summer he 's pushed a number of reforms through parliament . according to neumann , the most important is university reform which would give higher-education institutions greater autonomy . " there 's also a reform of labor-market law which includes what amounts to the abolition of the 35-hour working week in france , " he said . a sheaf of further laws are waiting for approval , primarily concerning immigration and including restrictions on family reunification .
immigration was an explosive topic in the election campaign , even causing unrest in several suburbs . there are fears that this could be re-ignited as a result of the new laws .
however , neumann believes there will be widespread approval of the new legislation among the french electorate in general . is the honeymoon over ? sarkozy could well find he has a tougher time now he 's notched up his first 100 days . figures released this month show economic growth for the second quarter failing to meet expectations , casting doubt over whether the government can meet its target of 2.25-percent growth for the year . also on the agenda are measures to reduce health care costs and the labor-market reform . " these are all big changes for which there is bound to be opposition within french society , " neumann predicted . with his penchant for getting involved in every area of politics , sarkozy is , in fact , overstepping the boundaries of his mandate . " if you look at french politics , there is practically no longer a government in the autonomous sense , " says neumann . " the president has always had a prominent role but in the past has not played such an active role in day-to-day politics . " sarkozy is strengthened by the absence of any real political opposition . the only force of any significance , the socialist party , is internally divided , and several party leaders have even been brought into the sarkozy government , weakening the center-left party . reorientation of foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're such good friends when looking at foreign policy under sarkozy , the most obvious changes are france 's changed stance towards the conflict in iraq and towards the us . " the fact that sarkozy spent his summer vacation in the us , with all the accompanying media attention , is more than symbolic , " said neumann . " it 's a clear indication that french foreign policy towards the us will change significantly from the chirac era and we can expect to see relations warming .

the note with the stolen fragment said that the man felt obliged to return the carving to make amends for his late stepfather 's light-fingered-ness and enable his soul to rest in peace , as well as freeing his relatives from potential repercussions .
the egyptian embassy in berlin sent the fragment back to egypt by diplomatic pouch and it has since been handed over to the supreme council for antiquities , where a committee of experts was trying to ascertain its authenticity , the council statement said .
the belief in a curse that strikes down anyone who disturbs the tombs or mummies of ancient egypt 's pharaohs has been around since the discovery of tutankhamun 's tomb in 1922 and the subsequent death of the excavation 's financier lord carnarvon . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german economics ministry announced thursday that it planned to host a round-table discussion on the subject on august 30 with manufacturers , industry groups , consumer protection organizations and the 16 regional states .
while acknowledging that the european union sets high standards for product quality , the ministry ’ s statement called for more to be done to and suggested a quality seal verifying products are safe .
" labelling to indicate the quality -lrb- of a product -rrb- is in the most basic interest of the german economy , " the ministry said .
" german products in particular but also european products with high quality standards must compete on the market every day against much more cheaply produced products - for example from asia . "
product scandal rumbles on the slogan " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months .
hardly a day goes by without criticism about the dangers to which chinese-made products might expose consumers .
the scandals of recent weeks revolving around the safety of chinese-manufactured goods and even food reached a pinnacle when the concerns moved into children 's rooms with scares over polly pocket , batman and barbie dolls .
previously , the chemical melamine in chinese wheat-gluten exports used in pet food were blamed for the deaths of dogs and cats in the united states .
this was followed by headlines about contaminated seafood and fruit , and poisonous industrial diethylene glycol in cough syrups and toothpaste .
additionally , chinese cars exported abroad fared terribly in crash tests in germany and russia .

those discoveries woke up the europeans , while for the chinese a lot is now on the gaming board .
the hurried reaction of beijing 's trade ministry was to declare that the problem had been blown out of proportion , but to also pledge to spare no effort to ensure the safety of chinese export goods .
low standards ignored for cheap goods but the toy scandal also raised questions about mattel 's responsibility as well as the usual networks of subcontractors , middlemen and factories in china , where workers toil for extremely low wages in often hazardous conditions .
by producing in china , companies can maximize their profit margins , while consumers in western countries are either unaware of or choose to ignore the miserable working conditions as they have come to expect low prices for products such as dvd players , personal computers , textiles and shoes .
bildunterschrift : a " sweat shop " factory common to asia china 's government , meanwhile , concedes that black sheep do exist among local manufacturers , but insists that foreign companies had a responsibility for monitoring the quality of their products too .
this is because barbie or batman dolls , for example , were not marketed in europe and the us by chinese companies but under the renowned brand " mattel , " which traditionally stood for quality and safety .
meanwhile , the country 's toy-manufacturing industry has expressed embarrassment over the scandal and fears losing future business .
" we feel deep sorrow over the irresponsible attitude of some companies , " said the industry association in a statement and added that it would assume responsibility for improving quality standards .

it is unlikely , however , that it has ever had an ancient cursed relic pass over its front desk before . many people come back from holiday with little souvenirs that they shouldn ’ t really have .
exotic seashells plucked from the sand of the south china seas , carvings made from the bough of an endangered amazonian tree and medicines made from rare animal parts may add a slight weight to the conscience in more reflective times but none are likely to cause the ill-advised tourist a life of disease and an agonizing death .
this , however , was the alleged outcome of one man ’ s visit to egypt back in 2004 .
according to the unnamed german man ’ s stepson in a note handed in together with a stolen carving to egypt 's embassy in berlin this week , the unwitting thief returned to germany from his exotic travels to suffer from unexplained paralysis , nausea , mysterious fevers and ultimately the terminal cancer which claimed his life .
son claims stepfather killed by curse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mummy was most displeased the stepson , also anonymously , claimed that the artifact , which displayed a hieroglyphic text , was responsible for bringing the " curse of the pharaohs " onto his family .
the note with the stolen fragment said that the man felt obliged to return the carving to make amends for his late stepfather 's light-fingered-ness and enable his soul to rest in peace , as well as freeing his relatives from potential repercussions .
the egyptian embassy in berlin sent the fragment back to egypt by diplomatic pouch and it has since been handed over to the supreme council for antiquities , where a committee of experts was trying to ascertain its authenticity , the council statement said .
the belief in a curse that strikes down anyone who disturbs the tombs or mummies of ancient egypt 's pharaohs has been around since the discovery of tutankhamun 's tomb in 1922 and the subsequent death of the excavation 's financier lord carnarvon . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however he still has the best rating since charles de gaulle . according to a recent opinion poll , 61 percent of the french population rate nicolas sarkozy 's performance as either " very " or " fairly " good .
the survey was conducted by the ipsos institute which surveyed a representative sample of 1,000 french adults . the results were published on thursday -lrb- 23.8 -rrb- in the weekly magazine le point and represent a fall of five percent in the new president 's popularity rating since the last poll was conducted in july .
the percentage of those dissatisfied with his performance rose from 25 to 39 percent . " are those voters who expected a clearer break with his predecessor chirac now becoming impatient ? "
le point asked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a change of face and style at the elysee palace the thursday edition of the paris daily le parisien remarked that sarkozy " has entered his first spell of turbulence " due to a darkening economic outlook that could slow down planned reforms .
but le parisien also pointed out that , according to the ipsos poll , at the 100-day mark , sarkozy has the best popularity rating since legendary french leader charles de gaulle . something to say about everything the new french president has made domestic politics a main focus . this was demonstrated again this week following the rape of a five year-old boy by a convicted pedophile who had been released before the end of his jail term . sarkozy spoke in favor of so-called " chemical castration " and pledged to introduce tougher penalties for repeat offenders . this comes just two weeks after the introduction of the current laws . this is a perfect illustration of sarkozy 's style , said wolfgang neumann of the german-french institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- . " he 's very dynamic and always forging ahead .
one of his main characteristics is his speed . he has something to say about every aspect of domestic and foreign policy being debated and usually comes up with proposals for new legislation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and what i 'd also like to say is .
this dynamism could well be a reason for sarkozy 's present popularity .
this summer he 's pushed a number of reforms through parliament . according to neumann , the most important is university reform which would give higher-education institutions greater autonomy . " there 's also a reform of labor-market law which includes what amounts to the abolition of the 35-hour working week in france , " he said . a sheaf of further laws are waiting for approval , primarily concerning immigration and including restrictions on family reunification .
immigration was an explosive topic in the election campaign , even causing unrest in several suburbs . there are fears that this could be re-ignited as a result of the new laws .
however , neumann believes there will be widespread approval of the new legislation among the french electorate in general . is the honeymoon over ? sarkozy could well find he has a tougher time now he 's notched up his first 100 days . figures released this month show economic growth for the second quarter failing to meet expectations , casting doubt over whether the government can meet its target of 2.25-percent growth for the year . also on the agenda are measures to reduce health care costs and the labor-market reform . " these are all big changes for which there is bound to be opposition within french society , " neumann predicted . with his penchant for getting involved in every area of politics , sarkozy is , in fact , overstepping the boundaries of his mandate . " if you look at french politics , there is practically no longer a government in the autonomous sense , " says neumann . " the president has always had a prominent role but in the past has not played such an active role in day-to-day politics . " sarkozy is strengthened by the absence of any real political opposition . the only force of any significance , the socialist party , is internally divided , and several party leaders have even been brought into the sarkozy government , weakening the center-left party . reorientation of foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're such good friends when looking at foreign policy under sarkozy , the most obvious changes are france 's changed stance towards the conflict in iraq and towards the us . " the fact that sarkozy spent his summer vacation in the us , with all the accompanying media attention , is more than symbolic , " said neumann . " it 's a clear indication that french foreign policy towards the us will change significantly from the chirac era and we can expect to see relations warming .

it is unlikely , however , that it has ever had an ancient cursed relic pass over its front desk before . many people come back from holiday with little souvenirs that they shouldn ’ t really have .
exotic seashells plucked from the sand of the south china seas , carvings made from the bough of an endangered amazonian tree and medicines made from rare animal parts may add a slight weight to the conscience in more reflective times but none are likely to cause the ill-advised tourist a life of disease and an agonizing death .
this , however , was the alleged outcome of one man ’ s visit to egypt back in 2004 .
according to the unnamed german man ’ s stepson in a note handed in together with a stolen carving to egypt 's embassy in berlin this week , the unwitting thief returned to germany from his exotic travels to suffer from unexplained paralysis , nausea , mysterious fevers and ultimately the terminal cancer which claimed his life .
son claims stepfather killed by curse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mummy was most displeased the stepson , also anonymously , claimed that the artifact , which displayed a hieroglyphic text , was responsible for bringing the " curse of the pharaohs " onto his family .
the note with the stolen fragment said that the man felt obliged to return the carving to make amends for his late stepfather 's light-fingered-ness and enable his soul to rest in peace , as well as freeing his relatives from potential repercussions .
the egyptian embassy in berlin sent the fragment back to egypt by diplomatic pouch and it has since been handed over to the supreme council for antiquities , where a committee of experts was trying to ascertain its authenticity , the council statement said .
the belief in a curse that strikes down anyone who disturbs the tombs or mummies of ancient egypt 's pharaohs has been around since the discovery of tutankhamun 's tomb in 1922 and the subsequent death of the excavation 's financier lord carnarvon . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german economics ministry announced thursday that it planned to host a round-table discussion on the subject on august 30 with manufacturers , industry groups , consumer protection organizations and the 16 regional states .
while acknowledging that the european union sets high standards for product quality , the ministry ’ s statement called for more to be done to and suggested a quality seal verifying products are safe .
" labelling to indicate the quality -lrb- of a product -rrb- is in the most basic interest of the german economy , " the ministry said .
" german products in particular but also european products with high quality standards must compete on the market every day against much more cheaply produced products - for example from asia . "
product scandal rumbles on the slogan " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months .
hardly a day goes by without criticism about the dangers to which chinese-made products might expose consumers .
the scandals of recent weeks revolving around the safety of chinese-manufactured goods and even food reached a pinnacle when the concerns moved into children 's rooms with scares over polly pocket , batman and barbie dolls .
previously , the chemical melamine in chinese wheat-gluten exports used in pet food were blamed for the deaths of dogs and cats in the united states .
this was followed by headlines about contaminated seafood and fruit , and poisonous industrial diethylene glycol in cough syrups and toothpaste .
additionally , chinese cars exported abroad fared terribly in crash tests in germany and russia .
while the us has been sounding the alarm for weeks , the reactions of european consumers remained relatively muffled until mattel started recalling millions of toys this month .

those discoveries woke up the europeans , while for the chinese a lot is now on the gaming board .
the hurried reaction of beijing 's trade ministry was to declare that the problem had been blown out of proportion , but to also pledge to spare no effort to ensure the safety of chinese export goods .
low standards ignored for cheap goods but the toy scandal also raised questions about mattel 's responsibility as well as the usual networks of subcontractors , middlemen and factories in china , where workers toil for extremely low wages in often hazardous conditions .
by producing in china , companies can maximize their profit margins , while consumers in western countries are either unaware of or choose to ignore the miserable working conditions as they have come to expect low prices for products such as dvd players , personal computers , textiles and shoes .
bildunterschrift : a " sweat shop " factory common to asia china 's government , meanwhile , concedes that black sheep do exist among local manufacturers , but insists that foreign companies had a responsibility for monitoring the quality of their products too .
this is because barbie or batman dolls , for example , were not marketed in europe and the us by chinese companies but under the renowned brand " mattel , " which traditionally stood for quality and safety .
meanwhile , the country 's toy-manufacturing industry has expressed embarrassment over the scandal and fears losing future business .
" we feel deep sorrow over the irresponsible attitude of some companies , " said the industry association in a statement and added that it would assume responsibility for improving quality standards .
" we must use this lesson as an opportunity to raise management standards , " the statement said .
firms should refrain from accepting orders that are " low priced and with unclear quality requirements " or which exceeded their manufacturing capacities .

the german economics ministry announced thursday that it planned to host a round-table discussion on the subject on august 30 with manufacturers , industry groups , consumer protection organizations and the 16 regional states .
while acknowledging that the european union sets high standards for product quality , the ministry ’ s statement called for more to be done to and suggested a quality seal verifying products are safe .
" labelling to indicate the quality -lrb- of a product -rrb- is in the most basic interest of the german economy , " the ministry said .
" german products in particular but also european products with high quality standards must compete on the market every day against much more cheaply produced products - for example from asia . "
product scandal rumbles on the slogan " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months .
hardly a day goes by without criticism about the dangers to which chinese-made products might expose consumers .
the scandals of recent weeks revolving around the safety of chinese-manufactured goods and even food reached a pinnacle when the concerns moved into children 's rooms with scares over polly pocket , batman and barbie dolls .
previously , the chemical melamine in chinese wheat-gluten exports used in pet food were blamed for the deaths of dogs and cats in the united states .
this was followed by headlines about contaminated seafood and fruit , and poisonous industrial diethylene glycol in cough syrups and toothpaste .
additionally , chinese cars exported abroad fared terribly in crash tests in germany and russia .
while the us has been sounding the alarm for weeks , the reactions of european consumers remained relatively muffled until mattel started recalling millions of toys this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbie : all dressed up and nowhere to go the company announced that tests found dangerously high lead content in the lacquer of its toys and that attached magnets came loose easily and could be swallowed by small children .
those discoveries woke up the europeans , while for the chinese a lot is now on the gaming board .
the hurried reaction of beijing 's trade ministry was to declare that the problem had been blown out of proportion , but to also pledge to spare no effort to ensure the safety of chinese export goods .
low standards ignored for cheap goods but the toy scandal also raised questions about mattel 's responsibility as well as the usual networks of subcontractors , middlemen and factories in china , where workers toil for extremely low wages in often hazardous conditions .
by producing in china , companies can maximize their profit margins , while consumers in western countries are either unaware of or choose to ignore the miserable working conditions as they have come to expect low prices for products such as dvd players , personal computers , textiles and shoes .

this , however , was the alleged outcome of one man ’ s visit to egypt back in 2004 .
according to the unnamed german man ’ s stepson in a note handed in together with a stolen carving to egypt 's embassy in berlin this week , the unwitting thief returned to germany from his exotic travels to suffer from unexplained paralysis , nausea , mysterious fevers and ultimately the terminal cancer which claimed his life .

however he still has the best rating since charles de gaulle . according to a recent opinion poll , 61 percent of the french population rate nicolas sarkozy 's performance as either " very " or " fairly " good .
the survey was conducted by the ipsos institute which surveyed a representative sample of 1,000 french adults . the results were published on thursday -lrb- 23.8 -rrb- in the weekly magazine le point and represent a fall of five percent in the new president 's popularity rating since the last poll was conducted in july .
the percentage of those dissatisfied with his performance rose from 25 to 39 percent . " are those voters who expected a clearer break with his predecessor chirac now becoming impatient ? "
le point asked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a change of face and style at the elysee palace the thursday edition of the paris daily le parisien remarked that sarkozy " has entered his first spell of turbulence " due to a darkening economic outlook that could slow down planned reforms .
but le parisien also pointed out that , according to the ipsos poll , at the 100-day mark , sarkozy has the best popularity rating since legendary french leader charles de gaulle . something to say about everything the new french president has made domestic politics a main focus . this was demonstrated again this week following the rape of a five year-old boy by a convicted pedophile who had been released before the end of his jail term . sarkozy spoke in favor of so-called " chemical castration " and pledged to introduce tougher penalties for repeat offenders . this comes just two weeks after the introduction of the current laws . this is a perfect illustration of sarkozy 's style , said wolfgang neumann of the german-french institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- . " he 's very dynamic and always forging ahead .
one of his main characteristics is his speed . he has something to say about every aspect of domestic and foreign policy being debated and usually comes up with proposals for new legislation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and what i 'd also like to say is .
this dynamism could well be a reason for sarkozy 's present popularity .
this summer he 's pushed a number of reforms through parliament . according to neumann , the most important is university reform which would give higher-education institutions greater autonomy . " there 's also a reform of labor-market law which includes what amounts to the abolition of the 35-hour working week in france , " he said . a sheaf of further laws are waiting for approval , primarily concerning immigration and including restrictions on family reunification .
immigration was an explosive topic in the election campaign , even causing unrest in several suburbs . there are fears that this could be re-ignited as a result of the new laws .
however , neumann believes there will be widespread approval of the new legislation among the french electorate in general . is the honeymoon over ? sarkozy could well find he has a tougher time now he 's notched up his first 100 days . figures released this month show economic growth for the second quarter failing to meet expectations , casting doubt over whether the government can meet its target of 2.25-percent growth for the year . also on the agenda are measures to reduce health care costs and the labor-market reform . " these are all big changes for which there is bound to be opposition within french society , " neumann predicted . with his penchant for getting involved in every area of politics , sarkozy is , in fact , overstepping the boundaries of his mandate . " if you look at french politics , there is practically no longer a government in the autonomous sense , " says neumann . " the president has always had a prominent role but in the past has not played such an active role in day-to-day politics . " sarkozy is strengthened by the absence of any real political opposition . the only force of any significance , the socialist party , is internally divided , and several party leaders have even been brought into the sarkozy government , weakening the center-left party . reorientation of foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're such good friends when looking at foreign policy under sarkozy , the most obvious changes are france 's changed stance towards the conflict in iraq and towards the us . " the fact that sarkozy spent his summer vacation in the us , with all the accompanying media attention , is more than symbolic , " said neumann . " it 's a clear indication that french foreign policy towards the us will change significantly from the chirac era and we can expect to see relations warming .

it is unlikely , however , that it has ever had an ancient cursed relic pass over its front desk before . many people come back from holiday with little souvenirs that they shouldn ’ t really have .
exotic seashells plucked from the sand of the south china seas , carvings made from the bough of an endangered amazonian tree and medicines made from rare animal parts may add a slight weight to the conscience in more reflective times but none are likely to cause the ill-advised tourist a life of disease and an agonizing death .
this , however , was the alleged outcome of one man ’ s visit to egypt back in 2004 .
according to the unnamed german man ’ s stepson in a note handed in together with a stolen carving to egypt 's embassy in berlin this week , the unwitting thief returned to germany from his exotic travels to suffer from unexplained paralysis , nausea , mysterious fevers and ultimately the terminal cancer which claimed his life .
son claims stepfather killed by curse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mummy was most displeased the stepson , also anonymously , claimed that the artifact , which displayed a hieroglyphic text , was responsible for bringing the " curse of the pharaohs " onto his family .
the note with the stolen fragment said that the man felt obliged to return the carving to make amends for his late stepfather 's light-fingered-ness and enable his soul to rest in peace , as well as freeing his relatives from potential repercussions .
the egyptian embassy in berlin sent the fragment back to egypt by diplomatic pouch and it has since been handed over to the supreme council for antiquities , where a committee of experts was trying to ascertain its authenticity , the council statement said .
the belief in a curse that strikes down anyone who disturbs the tombs or mummies of ancient egypt 's pharaohs has been around since the discovery of tutankhamun 's tomb in 1922 and the subsequent death of the excavation 's financier lord carnarvon . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however he still has the best rating since charles de gaulle . according to a recent opinion poll , 61 percent of the french population rate nicolas sarkozy 's performance as either " very " or " fairly " good .
the survey was conducted by the ipsos institute which surveyed a representative sample of 1,000 french adults . the results were published on thursday -lrb- 23.8 -rrb- in the weekly magazine le point and represent a fall of five percent in the new president 's popularity rating since the last poll was conducted in july .
the percentage of those dissatisfied with his performance rose from 25 to 39 percent . " are those voters who expected a clearer break with his predecessor chirac now becoming impatient ? "
le point asked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a change of face and style at the elysee palace the thursday edition of the paris daily le parisien remarked that sarkozy " has entered his first spell of turbulence " due to a darkening economic outlook that could slow down planned reforms .
but le parisien also pointed out that , according to the ipsos poll , at the 100-day mark , sarkozy has the best popularity rating since legendary french leader charles de gaulle . something to say about everything the new french president has made domestic politics a main focus . this was demonstrated again this week following the rape of a five year-old boy by a convicted pedophile who had been released before the end of his jail term . sarkozy spoke in favor of so-called " chemical castration " and pledged to introduce tougher penalties for repeat offenders . this comes just two weeks after the introduction of the current laws . this is a perfect illustration of sarkozy 's style , said wolfgang neumann of the german-french institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- . " he 's very dynamic and always forging ahead .
one of his main characteristics is his speed . he has something to say about every aspect of domestic and foreign policy being debated and usually comes up with proposals for new legislation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and what i 'd also like to say is .
this dynamism could well be a reason for sarkozy 's present popularity .
this summer he 's pushed a number of reforms through parliament . according to neumann , the most important is university reform which would give higher-education institutions greater autonomy . " there 's also a reform of labor-market law which includes what amounts to the abolition of the 35-hour working week in france , " he said . a sheaf of further laws are waiting for approval , primarily concerning immigration and including restrictions on family reunification .
immigration was an explosive topic in the election campaign , even causing unrest in several suburbs . there are fears that this could be re-ignited as a result of the new laws .
however , neumann believes there will be widespread approval of the new legislation among the french electorate in general . is the honeymoon over ? sarkozy could well find he has a tougher time now he 's notched up his first 100 days . figures released this month show economic growth for the second quarter failing to meet expectations , casting doubt over whether the government can meet its target of 2.25-percent growth for the year . also on the agenda are measures to reduce health care costs and the labor-market reform . " these are all big changes for which there is bound to be opposition within french society , " neumann predicted . with his penchant for getting involved in every area of politics , sarkozy is , in fact , overstepping the boundaries of his mandate . " if you look at french politics , there is practically no longer a government in the autonomous sense , " says neumann . " the president has always had a prominent role but in the past has not played such an active role in day-to-day politics . " sarkozy is strengthened by the absence of any real political opposition . the only force of any significance , the socialist party , is internally divided , and several party leaders have even been brought into the sarkozy government , weakening the center-left party . reorientation of foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're such good friends when looking at foreign policy under sarkozy , the most obvious changes are france 's changed stance towards the conflict in iraq and towards the us . " the fact that sarkozy spent his summer vacation in the us , with all the accompanying media attention , is more than symbolic , " said neumann . " it 's a clear indication that french foreign policy towards the us will change significantly from the chirac era and we can expect to see relations warming .

however , neumann believes there will be widespread approval of the new legislation among the french electorate in general . is the honeymoon over ? sarkozy could well find he has a tougher time now he 's notched up his first 100 days . figures released this month show economic growth for the second quarter failing to meet expectations , casting doubt over whether the government can meet its target of 2.25-percent growth for the year . also on the agenda are measures to reduce health care costs and the labor-market reform . " these are all big changes for which there is bound to be opposition within french society , " neumann predicted . with his penchant for getting involved in every area of politics , sarkozy is , in fact , overstepping the boundaries of his mandate . " if you look at french politics , there is practically no longer a government in the autonomous sense , " says neumann . " the president has always had a prominent role but in the past has not played such an active role in day-to-day politics . " sarkozy is strengthened by the absence of any real political opposition . the only force of any significance , the socialist party , is internally divided , and several party leaders have even been brought into the sarkozy government , weakening the center-left party . reorientation of foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we 're such good friends when looking at foreign policy under sarkozy , the most obvious changes are france 's changed stance towards the conflict in iraq and towards the us . " the fact that sarkozy spent his summer vacation in the us , with all the accompanying media attention , is more than symbolic , " said neumann . " it 's a clear indication that french foreign policy towards the us will change significantly from the chirac era and we can expect to see relations warming .

are his claims credible ? cem özdemir : one just has to look at the last four and a half years of the akp administration .

the turkish society has opened up like never before in its history . so many reforms have taken place , such as in the areas of democracy and women 's rights .
it 's common knowledge that some people are distrustful of gül and now it 's in his hands - should he be elected - to break down this mistrust . is the criticism warranted ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir is a german politician of turkish origin it generally has to do with the headscarf issue among women .
but gül is right in pointing out that his wife -lsb- who wears a headscarf -rsb- is n't running for president - he is .
what the opposition leader deniz baykal said is also true , even if he unfortunately does n't stick to it himself : " it 's not important what she has on her head , but in her head . " so far , neither women nor mr. gül have had reason to be seen as radical fundamentalists .

the akp government wanted to put an end to this , but it was blocked by the opposition and the president did n't sign the law . important initiatives to reform the bureaucracy , postponing the retirement age and restructuring the budget were also blocked by the president .
if a president like gül , who is more open to reform , came along now , it would make the situation easier for the government . a major point of criticism concerning turkey 's possible accession to the eu is always the issue of human rights .
will changes be made in this area as well ? i knew gül way back when he was in the fundamentalist opposition party , which he tried to reform before he left it .
during that time , i often came to him with criticism from human rights organizations .
i also always asked these organizations about gül . my impression was that they 'd found a partner in gül who would always listen and take their concerns seriously - even when he could n't do anything about them due to the constraints he faced and the problems that turkey had then and still has now .

he has promised to protect democracy and the constitutional separation of church and state in turkey .
are his claims credible ? cem özdemir : one just has to look at the last four and a half years of the akp administration .
they have not contributed to a fundamentalization of the turkish society - just the opposite .
the turkish society has opened up like never before in its history . so many reforms have taken place , such as in the areas of democracy and women 's rights .
it 's common knowledge that some people are distrustful of gül and now it 's in his hands - should he be elected - to break down this mistrust . is the criticism warranted ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir is a german politician of turkish origin it generally has to do with the headscarf issue among women .
but gül is right in pointing out that his wife -lsb- who wears a headscarf -rsb- is n't running for president - he is .
what the opposition leader deniz baykal said is also true , even if he unfortunately does n't stick to it himself : " it 's not important what she has on her head , but in her head . " so far , neither women nor mr. gül have had reason to be seen as radical fundamentalists .
that ca n't necessarily be said about any of the opposition politicians .
gül stands for a liberal opening of turkey .
those who want to stop him stand for ultra-nationalism . as foreign minister , he was actively involved in negotiations over turkey 's accession to the european union .
how is gül viewed in europe ? he is very highly regarded by european politicians , such as enlargement commissioner olli rehn , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier or his predecessor joschka fischer .
-lsb- gül -rsb- is seen as a reliable partner with whom one can reach agreements that the other side will stick to as well .
in this respect , one can say that gül is confronted with less distrust abroad than in his own country . what would gül 's election mean for turkey 's eu ambitions ? it would make many things easier .
you ca n't forget that the incumbent , -lsb- ahmet necdet -rsb- sezer , has blocked many important reforms in turkey , like the law on foundations , which has particularly disadvantaged christian and jewish foundations there .
the akp government wanted to put an end to this , but it was blocked by the opposition and the president did n't sign the law . important initiatives to reform the bureaucracy , postponing the retirement age and restructuring the budget were also blocked by the president .
if a president like gül , who is more open to reform , came along now , it would make the situation easier for the government . a major point of criticism concerning turkey 's possible accession to the eu is always the issue of human rights .

28 at the latest .
he has promised to protect democracy and the constitutional separation of church and state in turkey .
are his claims credible ? cem özdemir : one just has to look at the last four and a half years of the akp administration .
they have not contributed to a fundamentalization of the turkish society - just the opposite .
the turkish society has opened up like never before in its history . so many reforms have taken place , such as in the areas of democracy and women 's rights .
it 's common knowledge that some people are distrustful of gül and now it 's in his hands - should he be elected - to break down this mistrust . is the criticism warranted ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir is a german politician of turkish origin it generally has to do with the headscarf issue among women .
but gül is right in pointing out that his wife -lsb- who wears a headscarf -rsb- is n't running for president - he is .
what the opposition leader deniz baykal said is also true , even if he unfortunately does n't stick to it himself : " it 's not important what she has on her head , but in her head . " so far , neither women nor mr. gül have had reason to be seen as radical fundamentalists .
that ca n't necessarily be said about any of the opposition politicians .
gül stands for a liberal opening of turkey .
those who want to stop him stand for ultra-nationalism . as foreign minister , he was actively involved in negotiations over turkey 's accession to the european union .
how is gül viewed in europe ? he is very highly regarded by european politicians , such as enlargement commissioner olli rehn , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier or his predecessor joschka fischer .
-lsb- gül -rsb- is seen as a reliable partner with whom one can reach agreements that the other side will stick to as well .
in this respect , one can say that gül is confronted with less distrust abroad than in his own country . what would gül 's election mean for turkey 's eu ambitions ? it would make many things easier .
you ca n't forget that the incumbent , -lsb- ahmet necdet -rsb- sezer , has blocked many important reforms in turkey , like the law on foundations , which has particularly disadvantaged christian and jewish foundations there .
the akp government wanted to put an end to this , but it was blocked by the opposition and the president did n't sign the law . important initiatives to reform the bureaucracy , postponing the retirement age and restructuring the budget were also blocked by the president .
if a president like gül , who is more open to reform , came along now , it would make the situation easier for the government . a major point of criticism concerning turkey 's possible accession to the eu is always the issue of human rights .
will changes be made in this area as well ? i knew gül way back when he was in the fundamentalist opposition party , which he tried to reform before he left it .
during that time , i often came to him with criticism from human rights organizations .
i also always asked these organizations about gül . my impression was that they 'd found a partner in gül who would always listen and take their concerns seriously - even when he could n't do anything about them due to the constraints he faced and the problems that turkey had then and still has now .
i believe that gül is someone who stands for reform in the area of human rights . do you support gül 's election as president from a european point of view ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : özdemir : gül should show the women without headscarves that his wife 's is n't a sign i not only think that he is good for europe , i also believe that he 's good for turkey .

due to its successful stewardship of the eu and the g8 this year , germany felt ready to take a seat at the top table of global politics .
now , however , it believes it is being relegated to the sidelines . if the old adage " a week is a long time in politics " is true , then two months must seem like an eternity .
it certainly appears to be the case for germany .
at the end of june this year , the german government relinquished the reins of the european union 's presidency with applause and platitudes hanging in the balmy berlin air .
the g8 summit in heiligendamm it hosted in early june as this year 's head of the group was seen as a success . but less than eight weeks later , clouds of discontent have settled over the german capital and the chill blowing down its wide streets has more to do with an international cold shoulder than the onset of fall .
the perceived spurn was all the more surprising since in the first six months of 2007 , angela merkel 's government managed to drive a reluctant eu and a stubborn g8 down the road of multilateralism . the notoriously fractious eu states were strapped together in unity around a european climate protection program and were rallied into a series of reforms ; no mean feat by anyone 's standards .
more impressively , germany managed to get the united states to sign on to an international climate accord in heiligendamm .
less publicly , germany worked hard to secure peace in the middle east , the release of hostages in afghanistan and the freedom of bulgarian nurses on death row in libya among other diplomatic efforts around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was no.1 in brussels after her successes at eu level when it came to handing over the power , merkel and her team were satisfied that germany had played a significant role in setting a new multilateral , international agenda , and created diplomatic structures for its successors to build on .
all in all , it had been a successful tenure , as approval ratings and commentaries proved .
but although they once were the ones setting the agenda , merkel and co. now are left to read in the newspapers the outcome of decisions they should have been closely involved in .
blair appointment during its eu presidency , germany was very active in the middle east .
chancellor merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier both made numerous visits to the region , attempting to persuade israel and the palestinians to return to the negotiating table , supporting the fragile democracy in lebanon and maintaining an even-handed eu involvement in the surrounding countries .
merkel had made the middle east her main foreign-affairs focus at the start of the eu presidency , continuing a german belief that a secure middle east meant a secure europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's appointment was reported to germany by the media however , just days before germany 's role as head of the eu came to an end , the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the us , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- announced that former british prime minister tony blair would be its special envoy to the region .
steinmeier 's reaction suggested that it had been less a quartet decision and more the work of a trio , with germany as eu representative cut out of the loop .
his remonstrations with his quartet colleagues were widely reported . despite merkel 's denials of a rift , it was clear that germany had not been consulted on blair 's appointment , which was reportedly first made known to the government in a front page headline . but amelia torres , acting spokesperson for the european commission , said that no german dissatisfaction was registered in brussels . " the commission is not aware of -lrb- the german -rrb- claims and , as far as we are concerned , all the decisions involving the european union were taken in consultation with all eu partners , " she said . still , germany 's leadership , at least in the eyes of berlin , was being challenged and its credibility as a global player undermined .
imf appointment rushed through by france two weeks later , the germans got another surprise .
while the appointment of former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn as the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- had been proposed by recently elected french president nicolas sarkozy , germany had been cautious about his candidacy .
sarkozy 's intentions concerning european financial institutions and policies had caused concern in berlin and a move to install strauss-kahn had increased the jitters .
when it was announced that strauss-kahn had the imf job , it was the media once again who informed germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy aggressively campaigned for strauss-kahn " it 's worth pointing out that germany was by no means the only country that felt ' under-consulted ' on these developments , " said bastian giegerich from the international center for strategic studies .
" french and us activism surprised other partners , such as the british , italians and spaniards just as much .
in the cases of the strauss-kahn and blair decisions , presidents sarkozy and bush chose to push choices aggressively . "
michael link , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp 's faction in the bundestag and his party 's eu expert , insisted that there was no snub over the imf job . " germany was involved , " he said . " and germany has had , at several instances , debated all sorts of critical issues in a very open way with the new french administration . " germany , however , was still convinced it was being pushed further to the sidelines .
sarkozys steal limelight in libya more french-inspired aggravation was to follow .
during his numerous visits to the middle east , steinmeier had been working together with the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner to secure the release of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor accused of infecting children with hiv in libya . steinmeier and ferrero-waldner were campaigning together against the death sentence issued to the six medics up until germany 's eu presidency expired .
it was assumed that the efforts would then be continued by luis amado , the foreign minister of succeeding eu president , portugal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cecilia sarkozy : " really , it was nothing . "
imagine germany 's surprise when president sarkozy 's wife cecilia appeared on the steps of a french aircraft to present the newly free nurses to the world media while her husband shook hands and made deals with libyan dictator moammar gadhafi in tripoli .
while the german foreign ministry once again made calming noises , individual politicians were livid .
some went public with claims that president sarkozy had only made a move to free the nurses to win contracts in libya while others called for france to realign itself with european interests , and not just focus on its own .
" regarding the release of the bulgarian nurses , " giegerich added , " i think the feeling in berlin is that germany had done a lot of very constructive behind-the-scenes work which ultimately contributed to the release and sarkozy stole the limelight , which of course leaves a bitter taste . " " the pictures of the release of the bulgarian nurses fitted the whole image of this libyan justice scandal : théâtre absurde , " the fdp 's michael link added .
" minister steinmeier worked hard for that release .
the real progress was made during the german eu presidency .
that 's what counts .
and everybody in the eu knows that . " in each of these cases , the situation was resolved with a welcome outcome for many .
blair will push for peace in the middle east , strauss-kahn will head the imf with european influence , and the bulgarian nurses have their freedom .
for the german government , it might be a case of credit not given where credit was due .
but was germany really ignored ?
an end to germany 's multilateralist approach ? " while it would not be completely accurate to say that germany was ignored in any of these cases , the way in which these events occurred stands in fairly sharp contrast to the consensus-building and mediating character of current german foreign policy under chancellor merkel 's leadership , " giegerich said . " the question for the future is thus whether merkel 's mode of policy-making , which has been successful so far both domestically and internationally , is sustainable , " he added . but link said he believes that germany has nothing to worry about . " the german government has overcome the shortcomings of the narrow and self-sufficient foreign-policy activities of messrs. schröder and fischer , " he said .
" and germany ’ s role as largest eu member should always be an integrating one , not a polarizing one .

due to its successful stewardship of the eu and the g8 this year , germany felt ready to take a seat at the top table of global politics .
now , however , it believes it is being relegated to the sidelines . if the old adage " a week is a long time in politics " is true , then two months must seem like an eternity .
it certainly appears to be the case for germany .
at the end of june this year , the german government relinquished the reins of the european union 's presidency with applause and platitudes hanging in the balmy berlin air .
the g8 summit in heiligendamm it hosted in early june as this year 's head of the group was seen as a success . but less than eight weeks later , clouds of discontent have settled over the german capital and the chill blowing down its wide streets has more to do with an international cold shoulder than the onset of fall .
the perceived spurn was all the more surprising since in the first six months of 2007 , angela merkel 's government managed to drive a reluctant eu and a stubborn g8 down the road of multilateralism . the notoriously fractious eu states were strapped together in unity around a european climate protection program and were rallied into a series of reforms ; no mean feat by anyone 's standards .
more impressively , germany managed to get the united states to sign on to an international climate accord in heiligendamm .
less publicly , germany worked hard to secure peace in the middle east , the release of hostages in afghanistan and the freedom of bulgarian nurses on death row in libya among other diplomatic efforts around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was no.1 in brussels after her successes at eu level when it came to handing over the power , merkel and her team were satisfied that germany had played a significant role in setting a new multilateral , international agenda , and created diplomatic structures for its successors to build on .
all in all , it had been a successful tenure , as approval ratings and commentaries proved .
but although they once were the ones setting the agenda , merkel and co. now are left to read in the newspapers the outcome of decisions they should have been closely involved in .
blair appointment during its eu presidency , germany was very active in the middle east .
chancellor merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier both made numerous visits to the region , attempting to persuade israel and the palestinians to return to the negotiating table , supporting the fragile democracy in lebanon and maintaining an even-handed eu involvement in the surrounding countries .
merkel had made the middle east her main foreign-affairs focus at the start of the eu presidency , continuing a german belief that a secure middle east meant a secure europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's appointment was reported to germany by the media however , just days before germany 's role as head of the eu came to an end , the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the us , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- announced that former british prime minister tony blair would be its special envoy to the region .
steinmeier 's reaction suggested that it had been less a quartet decision and more the work of a trio , with germany as eu representative cut out of the loop .
his remonstrations with his quartet colleagues were widely reported . despite merkel 's denials of a rift , it was clear that germany had not been consulted on blair 's appointment , which was reportedly first made known to the government in a front page headline . but amelia torres , acting spokesperson for the european commission , said that no german dissatisfaction was registered in brussels . " the commission is not aware of -lrb- the german -rrb- claims and , as far as we are concerned , all the decisions involving the european union were taken in consultation with all eu partners , " she said . still , germany 's leadership , at least in the eyes of berlin , was being challenged and its credibility as a global player undermined .
imf appointment rushed through by france two weeks later , the germans got another surprise .
while the appointment of former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn as the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- had been proposed by recently elected french president nicolas sarkozy , germany had been cautious about his candidacy .
sarkozy 's intentions concerning european financial institutions and policies had caused concern in berlin and a move to install strauss-kahn had increased the jitters .
when it was announced that strauss-kahn had the imf job , it was the media once again who informed germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy aggressively campaigned for strauss-kahn " it 's worth pointing out that germany was by no means the only country that felt ' under-consulted ' on these developments , " said bastian giegerich from the international center for strategic studies .
" french and us activism surprised other partners , such as the british , italians and spaniards just as much .
in the cases of the strauss-kahn and blair decisions , presidents sarkozy and bush chose to push choices aggressively . "
michael link , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp 's faction in the bundestag and his party 's eu expert , insisted that there was no snub over the imf job . " germany was involved , " he said . " and germany has had , at several instances , debated all sorts of critical issues in a very open way with the new french administration . " germany , however , was still convinced it was being pushed further to the sidelines .
sarkozys steal limelight in libya more french-inspired aggravation was to follow .
during his numerous visits to the middle east , steinmeier had been working together with the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner to secure the release of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor accused of infecting children with hiv in libya . steinmeier and ferrero-waldner were campaigning together against the death sentence issued to the six medics up until germany 's eu presidency expired .
it was assumed that the efforts would then be continued by luis amado , the foreign minister of succeeding eu president , portugal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cecilia sarkozy : " really , it was nothing . "
imagine germany 's surprise when president sarkozy 's wife cecilia appeared on the steps of a french aircraft to present the newly free nurses to the world media while her husband shook hands and made deals with libyan dictator moammar gadhafi in tripoli .
while the german foreign ministry once again made calming noises , individual politicians were livid .
some went public with claims that president sarkozy had only made a move to free the nurses to win contracts in libya while others called for france to realign itself with european interests , and not just focus on its own .
" regarding the release of the bulgarian nurses , " giegerich added , " i think the feeling in berlin is that germany had done a lot of very constructive behind-the-scenes work which ultimately contributed to the release and sarkozy stole the limelight , which of course leaves a bitter taste . " " the pictures of the release of the bulgarian nurses fitted the whole image of this libyan justice scandal : théâtre absurde , " the fdp 's michael link added .
" minister steinmeier worked hard for that release .
the real progress was made during the german eu presidency .
that 's what counts .
and everybody in the eu knows that . " in each of these cases , the situation was resolved with a welcome outcome for many .
blair will push for peace in the middle east , strauss-kahn will head the imf with european influence , and the bulgarian nurses have their freedom .
for the german government , it might be a case of credit not given where credit was due .
but was germany really ignored ?
an end to germany 's multilateralist approach ? " while it would not be completely accurate to say that germany was ignored in any of these cases , the way in which these events occurred stands in fairly sharp contrast to the consensus-building and mediating character of current german foreign policy under chancellor merkel 's leadership , " giegerich said . " the question for the future is thus whether merkel 's mode of policy-making , which has been successful so far both domestically and internationally , is sustainable , " he added . but link said he believes that germany has nothing to worry about .

due to its successful stewardship of the eu and the g8 this year , germany felt ready to take a seat at the top table of global politics .
now , however , it believes it is being relegated to the sidelines . if the old adage " a week is a long time in politics " is true , then two months must seem like an eternity .
it certainly appears to be the case for germany .
at the end of june this year , the german government relinquished the reins of the european union 's presidency with applause and platitudes hanging in the balmy berlin air .
the g8 summit in heiligendamm it hosted in early june as this year 's head of the group was seen as a success . but less than eight weeks later , clouds of discontent have settled over the german capital and the chill blowing down its wide streets has more to do with an international cold shoulder than the onset of fall .
the perceived spurn was all the more surprising since in the first six months of 2007 , angela merkel 's government managed to drive a reluctant eu and a stubborn g8 down the road of multilateralism . the notoriously fractious eu states were strapped together in unity around a european climate protection program and were rallied into a series of reforms ; no mean feat by anyone 's standards .
more impressively , germany managed to get the united states to sign on to an international climate accord in heiligendamm .
less publicly , germany worked hard to secure peace in the middle east , the release of hostages in afghanistan and the freedom of bulgarian nurses on death row in libya among other diplomatic efforts around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was no.1 in brussels after her successes at eu level when it came to handing over the power , merkel and her team were satisfied that germany had played a significant role in setting a new multilateral , international agenda , and created diplomatic structures for its successors to build on .
all in all , it had been a successful tenure , as approval ratings and commentaries proved .
but although they once were the ones setting the agenda , merkel and co. now are left to read in the newspapers the outcome of decisions they should have been closely involved in .
blair appointment during its eu presidency , germany was very active in the middle east .
chancellor merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier both made numerous visits to the region , attempting to persuade israel and the palestinians to return to the negotiating table , supporting the fragile democracy in lebanon and maintaining an even-handed eu involvement in the surrounding countries .
merkel had made the middle east her main foreign-affairs focus at the start of the eu presidency , continuing a german belief that a secure middle east meant a secure europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair 's appointment was reported to germany by the media however , just days before germany 's role as head of the eu came to an end , the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the us , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- announced that former british prime minister tony blair would be its special envoy to the region .
steinmeier 's reaction suggested that it had been less a quartet decision and more the work of a trio , with germany as eu representative cut out of the loop .
his remonstrations with his quartet colleagues were widely reported . despite merkel 's denials of a rift , it was clear that germany had not been consulted on blair 's appointment , which was reportedly first made known to the government in a front page headline . but amelia torres , acting spokesperson for the european commission , said that no german dissatisfaction was registered in brussels . " the commission is not aware of -lrb- the german -rrb- claims and , as far as we are concerned , all the decisions involving the european union were taken in consultation with all eu partners , " she said . still , germany 's leadership , at least in the eyes of berlin , was being challenged and its credibility as a global player undermined .
imf appointment rushed through by france two weeks later , the germans got another surprise .
while the appointment of former french finance minister dominique strauss-kahn as the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- had been proposed by recently elected french president nicolas sarkozy , germany had been cautious about his candidacy .
sarkozy 's intentions concerning european financial institutions and policies had caused concern in berlin and a move to install strauss-kahn had increased the jitters .
when it was announced that strauss-kahn had the imf job , it was the media once again who informed germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy aggressively campaigned for strauss-kahn " it 's worth pointing out that germany was by no means the only country that felt ' under-consulted ' on these developments , " said bastian giegerich from the international center for strategic studies .
" french and us activism surprised other partners , such as the british , italians and spaniards just as much .
in the cases of the strauss-kahn and blair decisions , presidents sarkozy and bush chose to push choices aggressively . "
michael link , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp 's faction in the bundestag and his party 's eu expert , insisted that there was no snub over the imf job . " germany was involved , " he said . " and germany has had , at several instances , debated all sorts of critical issues in a very open way with the new french administration . " germany , however , was still convinced it was being pushed further to the sidelines .
sarkozys steal limelight in libya more french-inspired aggravation was to follow .
during his numerous visits to the middle east , steinmeier had been working together with the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner to secure the release of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor accused of infecting children with hiv in libya . steinmeier and ferrero-waldner were campaigning together against the death sentence issued to the six medics up until germany 's eu presidency expired .
it was assumed that the efforts would then be continued by luis amado , the foreign minister of succeeding eu president , portugal .

"
he said on friday morning on german public broadcaster ard that it would contribute to a 35 to 36 percent reduction in co2 emissions by the year 2020 , compared to 1990 . with additional government programs , germany would reach its goal of 40 percent reduction in emissions by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel and merkel went to greenland last week to discuss climate protection higher taxes on gas-guzzling vehicles , greater emphasis on alternatives energy forms and stricter energy-saving requirements are at the core of the package 's 30 points , according to reports . these measures will make germany one of the " most energy-efficient regions in the world , " said economics minister michael glos , who had been involved in intense negotiations with gabriel before thursday 's meeting .
glos is a member of bavaria 's conservative christian social union , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , while gabriel is a social democrat . at a joint presentation of the approved plan at the government 's summer retreat at meseberg palace near berlin , gabriel and glos said that several of the new laws would be considered by parliament before the end of the year , though the implementation of the individual points would be subject to review . expanded climate budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german cabinet met at meseberg palace oskar lafontaine , chairman of the left party , called the coalition 's environmental plan " much ado about nothing . " gabriel countered by pointing out that germany 's climate protection budget this year amounted to 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- - 200 percent more than in 2005 , when the coalition was founded .
the new program would cost around 8 billion euros in total , but would ultimately save the country 13 billion euros , gabriel said . thursday 's climate announcement was part of a two-day conference marking the mid-point of the governing coalition 's four-year term . the shortage of skilled labor , germany 's military mission to afghanistan and last weekend 's attack on eight indian men in eastern germany were also on the agenda at the conference , which concludes on friday . nuclear safety also on thursday , on the margins of the coalition meeting , the german government decided together with four major nuclear energy companies to tighten safety measures in that sector . " we have agreed to put in place steps that will further improve the safety climate at nuclear power plant operations within a year , " said the environment ministry in a statement . in a bid to improve safety , environment minister gabriel proposed on thursday that the oldest reactors be phased out earlier than planned and their workload transferred to more modern plants . the move comes a month after two incidents at nuclear power plants in germany sparked a national outcry and debate on safety in the branch . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sources close to the government now said that , in the short term , electrical and mechanic engineers from the 12 newer eu member states could be allowed to start working in germany as early as oct .
1 without having to apply for a work permit .
industry representatives welcomed the government 's decision to open up parts of the labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minimum wage requirements for foreign workers are expected to go down " it 's a good thing that the government in meseberg decided to implement not only short-term measures , but also to develop a master plan that 's a bit more medium-term oriented , " said achim dercks , deputy chief executive of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
comprehensive plan the plan - which will be developed jointly by the ministries of labor and education over the next few months - will also address the issue of reducing the minimum wage requirement for foreign workers , which is currently set at 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 115,000 -rrb- per year .
this issue has been a thorn in the eye of german employers who have for years complained of a lack of qualified professionals in critical hi-tech sectors , warning that it could seriously undermine the country 's competitiveness in an increasingly globalized world .
german education minister annette schavan previously suggested that the wage requirement should be lowered to between 40,000 and 60,000 euros .
additionally , foreign students who complete a course of study at a german university will be able to work without hurdles for three years after graduation .
the government agreed that , in the long term , targeted immigration was " necessary and desirable , " especially in view of germany 's increasingly ageing population .
it also stressed , however , that exhausting the potential of the domestic german labor market was also a priority that could be achieved by training and educating the unemployed .

28 at the latest .
he has promised to protect democracy and the constitutional separation of church and state in turkey .
are his claims credible ? cem özdemir : one just has to look at the last four and a half years of the akp administration .
they have not contributed to a fundamentalization of the turkish society - just the opposite .
the turkish society has opened up like never before in its history . so many reforms have taken place , such as in the areas of democracy and women 's rights .
it 's common knowledge that some people are distrustful of gül and now it 's in his hands - should he be elected - to break down this mistrust . is the criticism warranted ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir is a german politician of turkish origin it generally has to do with the headscarf issue among women .
but gül is right in pointing out that his wife -lsb- who wears a headscarf -rsb- is n't running for president - he is .
what the opposition leader deniz baykal said is also true , even if he unfortunately does n't stick to it himself : " it 's not important what she has on her head , but in her head . " so far , neither women nor mr. gül have had reason to be seen as radical fundamentalists .
that ca n't necessarily be said about any of the opposition politicians .
gül stands for a liberal opening of turkey .
those who want to stop him stand for ultra-nationalism . as foreign minister , he was actively involved in negotiations over turkey 's accession to the european union .
how is gül viewed in europe ? he is very highly regarded by european politicians , such as enlargement commissioner olli rehn , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier or his predecessor joschka fischer .
-lsb- gül -rsb- is seen as a reliable partner with whom one can reach agreements that the other side will stick to as well .
in this respect , one can say that gül is confronted with less distrust abroad than in his own country . what would gül 's election mean for turkey 's eu ambitions ? it would make many things easier .
you ca n't forget that the incumbent , -lsb- ahmet necdet -rsb- sezer , has blocked many important reforms in turkey , like the law on foundations , which has particularly disadvantaged christian and jewish foundations there .
the akp government wanted to put an end to this , but it was blocked by the opposition and the president did n't sign the law . important initiatives to reform the bureaucracy , postponing the retirement age and restructuring the budget were also blocked by the president .
if a president like gül , who is more open to reform , came along now , it would make the situation easier for the government . a major point of criticism concerning turkey 's possible accession to the eu is always the issue of human rights .
will changes be made in this area as well ? i knew gül way back when he was in the fundamentalist opposition party , which he tried to reform before he left it .
during that time , i often came to him with criticism from human rights organizations .
i also always asked these organizations about gül . my impression was that they 'd found a partner in gül who would always listen and take their concerns seriously - even when he could n't do anything about them due to the constraints he faced and the problems that turkey had then and still has now .
i believe that gül is someone who stands for reform in the area of human rights . do you support gül 's election as president from a european point of view ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : özdemir : gül should show the women without headscarves that his wife 's is n't a sign i not only think that he is good for europe , i also believe that he 's good for turkey .
however , the fears that exist have to be taken seriously by gül and his party .
they can best be defused by proving that they 're unjustified . there are two important groups that gül has to pay attention to : the first is the women who do n't wear headscarves .
gül has to show them that his wife 's headscarf is n't a sign .
on the contrary , it shows that diversity must be accepted .
the other group that 's waiting for a signal is the alevis , a religious minority in turkey .

28 at the latest .
he has promised to protect democracy and the constitutional separation of church and state in turkey .
are his claims credible ? cem özdemir : one just has to look at the last four and a half years of the akp administration .
they have not contributed to a fundamentalization of the turkish society - just the opposite .
the turkish society has opened up like never before in its history . so many reforms have taken place , such as in the areas of democracy and women 's rights .
it 's common knowledge that some people are distrustful of gül and now it 's in his hands - should he be elected - to break down this mistrust . is the criticism warranted ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir is a german politician of turkish origin it generally has to do with the headscarf issue among women .
but gül is right in pointing out that his wife -lsb- who wears a headscarf -rsb- is n't running for president - he is .
what the opposition leader deniz baykal said is also true , even if he unfortunately does n't stick to it himself : " it 's not important what she has on her head , but in her head . " so far , neither women nor mr. gül have had reason to be seen as radical fundamentalists .
that ca n't necessarily be said about any of the opposition politicians .
gül stands for a liberal opening of turkey .
those who want to stop him stand for ultra-nationalism . as foreign minister , he was actively involved in negotiations over turkey 's accession to the european union .
how is gül viewed in europe ? he is very highly regarded by european politicians , such as enlargement commissioner olli rehn , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier or his predecessor joschka fischer .
-lsb- gül -rsb- is seen as a reliable partner with whom one can reach agreements that the other side will stick to as well .
in this respect , one can say that gül is confronted with less distrust abroad than in his own country . what would gül 's election mean for turkey 's eu ambitions ? it would make many things easier .
you ca n't forget that the incumbent , -lsb- ahmet necdet -rsb- sezer , has blocked many important reforms in turkey , like the law on foundations , which has particularly disadvantaged christian and jewish foundations there .
the akp government wanted to put an end to this , but it was blocked by the opposition and the president did n't sign the law . important initiatives to reform the bureaucracy , postponing the retirement age and restructuring the budget were also blocked by the president .
if a president like gül , who is more open to reform , came along now , it would make the situation easier for the government . a major point of criticism concerning turkey 's possible accession to the eu is always the issue of human rights .
will changes be made in this area as well ? i knew gül way back when he was in the fundamentalist opposition party , which he tried to reform before he left it .
during that time , i often came to him with criticism from human rights organizations .
i also always asked these organizations about gül . my impression was that they 'd found a partner in gül who would always listen and take their concerns seriously - even when he could n't do anything about them due to the constraints he faced and the problems that turkey had then and still has now .
i believe that gül is someone who stands for reform in the area of human rights . do you support gül 's election as president from a european point of view ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : özdemir : gül should show the women without headscarves that his wife 's is n't a sign i not only think that he is good for europe , i also believe that he 's good for turkey .
however , the fears that exist have to be taken seriously by gül and his party .
they can best be defused by proving that they 're unjustified . there are two important groups that gül has to pay attention to : the first is the women who do n't wear headscarves .
gül has to show them that his wife 's headscarf is n't a sign .
on the contrary , it shows that diversity must be accepted .
the other group that 's waiting for a signal is the alevis , a religious minority in turkey .

the german economics ministry announced thursday that it planned to host a round-table discussion on the subject on august 30 with manufacturers , industry groups , consumer protection organizations and the 16 regional states .
while acknowledging that the european union sets high standards for product quality , the ministry ’ s statement called for more to be done to and suggested a quality seal verifying products are safe .
" labelling to indicate the quality -lrb- of a product -rrb- is in the most basic interest of the german economy , " the ministry said .
" german products in particular but also european products with high quality standards must compete on the market every day against much more cheaply produced products - for example from asia . "
product scandal rumbles on the slogan " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months .
hardly a day goes by without criticism about the dangers to which chinese-made products might expose consumers .
the scandals of recent weeks revolving around the safety of chinese-manufactured goods and even food reached a pinnacle when the concerns moved into children 's rooms with scares over polly pocket , batman and barbie dolls .
previously , the chemical melamine in chinese wheat-gluten exports used in pet food were blamed for the deaths of dogs and cats in the united states .
this was followed by headlines about contaminated seafood and fruit , and poisonous industrial diethylene glycol in cough syrups and toothpaste .
additionally , chinese cars exported abroad fared terribly in crash tests in germany and russia .

those discoveries woke up the europeans , while for the chinese a lot is now on the gaming board .
the hurried reaction of beijing 's trade ministry was to declare that the problem had been blown out of proportion , but to also pledge to spare no effort to ensure the safety of chinese export goods .
low standards ignored for cheap goods but the toy scandal also raised questions about mattel 's responsibility as well as the usual networks of subcontractors , middlemen and factories in china , where workers toil for extremely low wages in often hazardous conditions .
by producing in china , companies can maximize their profit margins , while consumers in western countries are either unaware of or choose to ignore the miserable working conditions as they have come to expect low prices for products such as dvd players , personal computers , textiles and shoes .
bildunterschrift : a " sweat shop " factory common to asia china 's government , meanwhile , concedes that black sheep do exist among local manufacturers , but insists that foreign companies had a responsibility for monitoring the quality of their products too .
this is because barbie or batman dolls , for example , were not marketed in europe and the us by chinese companies but under the renowned brand " mattel , " which traditionally stood for quality and safety .
meanwhile , the country 's toy-manufacturing industry has expressed embarrassment over the scandal and fears losing future business .
" we feel deep sorrow over the irresponsible attitude of some companies , " said the industry association in a statement and added that it would assume responsibility for improving quality standards .
" we must use this lesson as an opportunity to raise management standards , " the statement said .
firms should refrain from accepting orders that are " low priced and with unclear quality requirements " or which exceeded their manufacturing capacities .

judge abrahams , at luton county court , has ordered barclays to stop applying the charges until a high court test case settles the legal issues involved .
barclays said it will be entitled to reclaim any further charges from nadine fry should the test case be successful .
the five main banks have handed back almost £ 400m in charges since january .
barclays itself has so far repaid £ 87m in overdraft charges this year .
the judge suspended ms fry 's claim until the outcome of the test case .
john fry , who pursued the case for his daughter , explained how he persuaded the judge also to suspend any further penalty charges .
" i argued that a stay would have serious financial implications for my daughter as she would have to continue meeting interest payments on her debts , whereas the sum in question -lrb- £ 1,384 -rrb- would have been sufficient to clear her debt entirely , " he said .
' not general policy ' judge abraham 's decision is likely to be deeply disturbing to the uk 's banks , in case other judges around the country adopt a similar line .
a spokesman for the judicial communications office -lrb- jco -rrb- , which speaks on behalf of judges , said : " this is not a general policy - each case is assessed on its own merits . "
in the past year , tens of thousands of bank customers have been winning refunds of overdraft penalty charges from their banks , amounting to millions of pounds .
to resolve this vexed issue , the banks , along with the office of fair trading -lrb- oft -rrb- , agreed at the end of july to stage in the high court next year a test case on the legality of the charges .
the oft believes they are an unfair and illegal penalty under consumer protection regulations .
the banks say they are a fair charge for providing a service to their customers while their accounts are in the red .
waiver win at the same time as announcing the test case , the banks won from the financial services authority -lrb- fsa -rrb- a waiver from the current rules so that they can largely stop processing new claims against them until the legal issues are sorted out .
likewise , the financial ombudsman service -lrb- fos -rrb- decided to stop dealing with the thousands of similar complaints it has been receiving .
the banks also asked the courts to suspend all existing legal actions against them for the time being .
however , any decisions on cases that are already before the courts have been left up to local judges to decide .
marc gander of the consumer action group said the luton judge 's decision was both just and encouraging .
" this is what should have been done from the start to maintain fair play . "
" this waiver adopted by the fsa and the ombudsman has been profoundly unjust because it is so one-sided , " he said .

' not general policy ' judge abraham 's decision is likely to be deeply disturbing to the uk 's banks , in case other judges around the country adopt a similar line .
luton county court 's order against barclays bank a spokesman for the judicial communications office -lrb- jco -rrb- , which speaks on behalf of judges , said : " this is not a general policy - each case is assessed on its own merits . "
in the past year , tens of thousands of bank customers have been winning refunds of overdraft penalty charges from their banks , amounting to millions of pounds .
to resolve this vexed issue , the banks , along with the office of fair trading -lrb- oft -rrb- , agreed at the end of july to stage in the high court next year a test case on the legality of the charges .
the oft believes they are an unfair and illegal penalty under consumer protection regulations .
the banks say they are a fair charge for providing a service to their customers while their accounts are in the red .
waiver win at the same time as announcing the test case , the banks won from the financial services authority -lrb- fsa -rrb- a waiver from the current rules so that they can largely stop processing new claims against them until the legal issues are sorted out .
likewise , the financial ombudsman service -lrb- fos -rrb- decided to stop dealing with the thousands of similar complaints it has been receiving .
the banks also asked the courts to suspend all existing legal actions against them for the time being .
however , any decisions on cases that are already before the courts have been left up to local judges to decide .
marc gander of the consumer action group said the luton judge 's decision was both just and encouraging .
" this is what should have been done from the start to maintain fair play . "
" this waiver adopted by the fsa and the ombudsman has been profoundly unjust because it is so one-sided , " he said .

as intellectual phenomena go , the internet is still very young .

the internet , however , stands poised to become the greatest communications platform humanity has ever known .
it has profoundly increased access to information around the world , and it has likewise provided a platform for free expression on a scale unimaginable a generation ago .
for a variety of reasons - cultural , political , technological - the internet has grown rapidly .
the benefits it offers and the degree to which we rely on it -lrb- for everything from personal communications to global financial transactions -rrb- , far outstrip its relatively short existence .
as access to the internet spreads to more and more places around the world , more people will come online ; they 'll access the net through a wider variety of devices , and they 'll produce and consume new types of content .

improving the resilience and resistance to attack of key infrastructure such as the domain name system -lrb- the phone book of the internet -rrb- and the routing system will be major focal points for near-term internet development .
what is the tech lab ?
the world 's leading thinkers give a personal view of future technologies introducing dnssec -lrb- security for the domain name system -rrb- and the digital signing of address space by the regional internet registries will assume much higher priority .
internet-based software and digital goods have historically been vulnerable to various kinds of failures and subject to a variety of attacks .

with its 128 bits of address space -lrb- about 340 trillion trillion trillion addresses -rrb- , there will be ample address space for the foreseeable future .
it will be a non-trivial exercise to bring ipv6 online in parallel with the present ipv4 system and it is not too early to get started .

stunningly valuable going forward , we must also remain aware of limitations of the data we access through the internet .
information on the web varies in quality from completely useless or even damaging to stunningly valuable .
today 's search engines draw the most relevant information to our attention , and as more data become available online , the importance of search engines will only increase .

or in one thousand years .
it 's not only file formats that change , though .
changes in computer programs , operating systems and even the hardware that we use to build computers will accentuate the challenge of keeping digital information meaningful .
this raises a host of intellectual property questions that will almost certainly need to be considered .

the future of the net also poses opportunities for society as a whole .

he was a founding member of the internet society and is google 's chief internet evangelist .
vint cerf is one of the leading figures in the internet 's development as intellectual phenomena go , the internet is still very young .
if we look at other innovative technologies that fundamentally transformed human communications - the printing press , the telephone and television , to name a few - we are confronted with the fact that it takes generations for their full effects to be understood .
the internet , by comparison , has only existed for three decades , and the world wide web is younger still .
the internet , however , stands poised to become the greatest communications platform humanity has ever known .
it has profoundly increased access to information around the world , and it has likewise provided a platform for free expression on a scale unimaginable a generation ago .
for a variety of reasons - cultural , political , technological - the internet has grown rapidly .
the benefits it offers and the degree to which we rely on it -lrb- for everything from personal communications to global financial transactions -rrb- , far outstrip its relatively short existence .
as access to the internet spreads to more and more places around the world , more people will come online ; they 'll access the net through a wider variety of devices , and they 'll produce and consume new types of content .
the continued expansion of the internet poses very real challenges to those of us responsible for its health .
key infrastructure the robustness and security of the internet will climb in importance as we rely increasingly on it and its services .
improving the resilience and resistance to attack of key infrastructure such as the domain name system -lrb- the phone book of the internet -rrb- and the routing system will be major focal points for near-term internet development .
what is the tech lab ?
the world 's leading thinkers give a personal view of future technologies introducing dnssec -lrb- security for the domain name system -rrb- and the digital signing of address space by the regional internet registries will assume much higher priority .
internet-based software and digital goods have historically been vulnerable to various kinds of failures and subject to a variety of attacks .
the computer science community is challenged to devise solutions to these problems .
capacity poses a further challenge to the future of the web .
as more devices become part of the internet -lrb- think of the three billion mobile phones already in operation -rrb- , we will need to move to a new internet address space , called ipv6 .
with its 128 bits of address space -lrb- about 340 trillion trillion trillion addresses -rrb- , there will be ample address space for the foreseeable future .
it will be a non-trivial exercise to bring ipv6 online in parallel with the present ipv4 system and it is not too early to get started .
efforts in japan and china have begun blazing trails towards this important new goal .
stunningly valuable going forward , we must also remain aware of limitations of the data we access through the internet .
information on the web varies in quality from completely useless or even damaging to stunningly valuable .
today 's search engines draw the most relevant information to our attention , and as more data become available online , the importance of search engines will only increase .
in the future , people around the world will likely look for new ways to identify the authenticity of online information sources .
the idea that all the world 's knowledge could be discoverable not just by humans but by programs acting on their behalf at speeds well beyond the superhuman , is one of this century 's most exciting opportunities we will also be confronted with a kind of " information decay " in which digital objects become less and less accessible owing to the age of the software that created it .
as an example : it is already a challenge to watch videos posted on the bbc website in 1997 .
imagine trying to watch the same video in 100 years .
or in one thousand years .
it 's not only file formats that change , though .
changes in computer programs , operating systems and even the hardware that we use to build computers will accentuate the challenge of keeping digital information meaningful .
this raises a host of intellectual property questions that will almost certainly need to be considered .
prosaic opportunities from a strictly technological standpoint , then , the future of the internet poses a number of challenges to computer scientists .
the future of the net also poses opportunities for society as a whole .
some of these opportunities are prosaic .
with home , car and office appliances all online and rich sensor networks as part of the landscape of the internet , it is easy to predict that people will be looking for online services to manage these devices and systems , regardless of where they happen to be .
we have barely begun what will no doubt be a long journey , but already the openness of the web is fostering free expression in parts of the world that need it most it is clear that programmable mobiles have the potential to become general purpose " controllers " that allow us to interact , possibly indirectly through online services , with the many devices that service us from moment to moment .
the internet is a medium for communicating information , and by democratising access to information the internet is changing people 's lives for the better .
we have barely begun what will no doubt be a long journey , but already the openness of the web is fostering free expression in parts of the world that need it most .
there are challenges and setbacks along the way , but the trend is clear and inexorable .
at the same time , access to information is expanding rapidly .
usage spike when google news for mobile devices became available in french , the biggest spike in usage outside france was in côte d 'ivoire .
in the developing world especially , the proliferation of mobile devices and improvements in the ability of those devices to access the web will accelerate access to information .
every year , humanity produces more data , and we must decide how that data will be found , shared , remembered , and interpreted .
as we become better able to cope with huge quantities of information , scientific and otherwise , our appetites for organising and mining it will increase .
we have already witnessed the salient benefits of shared scientific databases such as the online human genome archives .
the idea that all the world 's knowledge could be discoverable not just by humans but by programs acting on their behalf at speeds well beyond the superhuman , is one of this century 's most exciting opportunities , especially as much of this information may lead to medical understanding and breakthroughs .
as we deepen our understanding of our biology - the move from genetics to epigenetics and the proteome - our understanding of ourselves and the universe around us will deepen .
what a gift to be a part of this period in the evolution of our civilisation .

improving the resilience and resistance to attack of key infrastructure such as the domain name system -lrb- the phone book of the internet -rrb- and the routing system will be major focal points for near-term internet development .
what is the tech lab ?
the world 's leading thinkers give a personal view of future technologies introducing dnssec -lrb- security for the domain name system -rrb- and the digital signing of address space by the regional internet registries will assume much higher priority .
internet-based software and digital goods have historically been vulnerable to various kinds of failures and subject to a variety of attacks .
the computer science community is challenged to devise solutions to these problems .
capacity poses a further challenge to the future of the web .
as more devices become part of the internet -lrb- think of the three billion mobile phones already in operation -rrb- , we will need to move to a new internet address space , called ipv6 .
with its 128 bits of address space -lrb- about 340 trillion trillion trillion addresses -rrb- , there will be ample address space for the foreseeable future .
it will be a non-trivial exercise to bring ipv6 online in parallel with the present ipv4 system and it is not too early to get started .
efforts in japan and china have begun blazing trails towards this important new goal .
stunningly valuable going forward , we must also remain aware of limitations of the data we access through the internet .
information on the web varies in quality from completely useless or even damaging to stunningly valuable .
today 's search engines draw the most relevant information to our attention , and as more data become available online , the importance of search engines will only increase .
in the future , people around the world will likely look for new ways to identify the authenticity of online information sources .
the idea that all the world 's knowledge could be discoverable not just by humans but by programs acting on their behalf at speeds well beyond the superhuman , is one of this century 's most exciting opportunities we will also be confronted with a kind of " information decay " in which digital objects become less and less accessible owing to the age of the software that created it .
as an example : it is already a challenge to watch videos posted on the bbc website in 1997 .
imagine trying to watch the same video in 100 years .
or in one thousand years .
it 's not only file formats that change , though .
changes in computer programs , operating systems and even the hardware that we use to build computers will accentuate the challenge of keeping digital information meaningful .
this raises a host of intellectual property questions that will almost certainly need to be considered .
prosaic opportunities from a strictly technological standpoint , then , the future of the internet poses a number of challenges to computer scientists .
the future of the net also poses opportunities for society as a whole .
some of these opportunities are prosaic .
with home , car and office appliances all online and rich sensor networks as part of the landscape of the internet , it is easy to predict that people will be looking for online services to manage these devices and systems , regardless of where they happen to be .
we have barely begun what will no doubt be a long journey , but already the openness of the web is fostering free expression in parts of the world that need it most it is clear that programmable mobiles have the potential to become general purpose " controllers " that allow us to interact , possibly indirectly through online services , with the many devices that service us from moment to moment .
the internet is a medium for communicating information , and by democratising access to information the internet is changing people 's lives for the better .
we have barely begun what will no doubt be a long journey , but already the openness of the web is fostering free expression in parts of the world that need it most .
there are challenges and setbacks along the way , but the trend is clear and inexorable .
at the same time , access to information is expanding rapidly .
usage spike when google news for mobile devices became available in french , the biggest spike in usage outside france was in côte d 'ivoire .
in the developing world especially , the proliferation of mobile devices and improvements in the ability of those devices to access the web will accelerate access to information .
every year , humanity produces more data , and we must decide how that data will be found , shared , remembered , and interpreted .
as we become better able to cope with huge quantities of information , scientific and otherwise , our appetites for organising and mining it will increase .
we have already witnessed the salient benefits of shared scientific databases such as the online human genome archives .
the idea that all the world 's knowledge could be discoverable not just by humans but by programs acting on their behalf at speeds well beyond the superhuman , is one of this century 's most exciting opportunities , especially as much of this information may lead to medical understanding and breakthroughs .
as we deepen our understanding of our biology - the move from genetics to epigenetics and the proteome - our understanding of ourselves and the universe around us will deepen .
what a gift to be a part of this period in the evolution of our civilisation .

vint cerf is one of the leading figures in the internet 's development as intellectual phenomena go , the internet is still very young .
if we look at other innovative technologies that fundamentally transformed human communications - the printing press , the telephone and television , to name a few - we are confronted with the fact that it takes generations for their full effects to be understood .
the internet , by comparison , has only existed for three decades , and the world wide web is younger still .
the internet , however , stands poised to become the greatest communications platform humanity has ever known .
it has profoundly increased access to information around the world , and it has likewise provided a platform for free expression on a scale unimaginable a generation ago .
for a variety of reasons - cultural , political , technological - the internet has grown rapidly .
the benefits it offers and the degree to which we rely on it -lrb- for everything from personal communications to global financial transactions -rrb- , far outstrip its relatively short existence .
as access to the internet spreads to more and more places around the world , more people will come online ; they 'll access the net through a wider variety of devices , and they 'll produce and consume new types of content .

improving the resilience and resistance to attack of key infrastructure such as the domain name system -lrb- the phone book of the internet -rrb- and the routing system will be major focal points for near-term internet development .
what is the tech lab ?
the world 's leading thinkers give a personal view of future technologies introducing dnssec -lrb- security for the domain name system -rrb- and the digital signing of address space by the regional internet registries will assume much higher priority .
internet-based software and digital goods have historically been vulnerable to various kinds of failures and subject to a variety of attacks .
the computer science community is challenged to devise solutions to these problems .

as more devices become part of the internet -lrb- think of the three billion mobile phones already in operation -rrb- , we will need to move to a new internet address space , called ipv6 .
with its 128 bits of address space -lrb- about 340 trillion trillion trillion addresses -rrb- , there will be ample address space for the foreseeable future .
it will be a non-trivial exercise to bring ipv6 online in parallel with the present ipv4 system and it is not too early to get started .

stunningly valuable going forward , we must also remain aware of limitations of the data we access through the internet .
information on the web varies in quality from completely useless or even damaging to stunningly valuable .
today 's search engines draw the most relevant information to our attention , and as more data become available online , the importance of search engines will only increase .
in the future , people around the world will likely look for new ways to identify the authenticity of online information sources .
the idea that all the world 's knowledge could be discoverable not just by humans but by programs acting on their behalf at speeds well beyond the superhuman , is one of this century 's most exciting opportunities we will also be confronted with a kind of " information decay " in which digital objects become less and less accessible owing to the age of the software that created it .

imagine trying to watch the same video in 100 years .
or in one thousand years .
it 's not only file formats that change , though .

but in future , computers could help them reclaim their summer holidays .
professor sargur srihari 's research team at the university at buffalo , new york , is developing software to fully automate the essay-marking process .
" trying to analyse children 's handwriting is a completely unexplored domain , " says professor srihari .
exam scripts are scanned into the computer , the software reads the handwriting and translates it into computer type , and then grades the response as an examiner would , professor srihari explains .
he has tested the software using a reading comprehension exam at us grade 8 level -lrb- 13-14 year-olds -rrb- .
the children were asked to read a passage about american first ladies and use the information within to answer a question : " how was martha washington 's role as first lady different from that of eleanor roosevelt ? "
graded scripts professor srihari asked human examiners to grade 300 answer booklets .
half of the graded scripts were then fed into the computer to " teach " it the grading process .
the software identified key words and phrases that were repeatedly associated with high grades .
if few of these features are present in an exam script , it generally receives a low grade .
what did the computer make of written work by bbc journalists ?
next , the computer was switched from " learning " mode to " grading " mode .
professor srihari fed the remaining 150 scripts into the computer without the human grades attached .
the computer predicted which grade a teacher would give each answer .
the computer was within a grade of the human examiners 70 % of the time .
the results are published in the journal artificial intelligence .
could your results be marked by computer one day ?
to see the software in action , the staff on the bbc online technology desk tried their hand at the grade 8 exam .
while the computer graded the responses , professor srihari explained some of the problems involved in developing the software .
" analysing handwriting is difficult , " he says .
" but once you have computerised texts you can do many things . "
" today , over 90 % of handwritten addresses on envelopes are read by computer , which seemed unbelievable 15 years ago . "
legible handwriting the key , professor srihari explains , is to only expose the computer to legible handwriting .
this is one advantage of using handwriting recognition software on children .
" children write better , " he says .
" they do n't have the bad habits you see in an adult scrawl . "
the computer can easily break down children 's handwriting into individual letters and interpret the words , professor srihari says .
to refine the process , the computer also carries a database of handwriting samples that it can use to compare the general form of handwritten words .
working with children 's handwriting carries additional advantages .
they have a comparatively small vocabulary , says professor srihari , and so the computer needs a smaller " dictionary " of words to translate their handwriting .
professor srihari 's software can correctly identify about 60 % of the words in any child 's handwriting .
but that is only half the problem .
next , the computer must grade the child 's answer using its artificial neural network .
" the artificial neural network learns from the human scored answers to identify the important features of the text , " says professor srihari .
" some of the features are content dependent - key phrases or words in the answer - and some are content independent - the length of the sentences and the total answer length , for example . "
the computer isolates and identifies keywords dr mary mcgee wood at the university of manchester is also studying the role of computers in exam marking .
" it 's interesting stuff , " she says .
" but they 've been very clever to limit this to a specific domain - reading comprehension . "
because the children have to answer a question using information in a specific passage of text , the software programmers can predict what keywords will appear in the text , which makes the computer 's task relatively simple , she explains .
" there is a buzz word for this - ' expectation driven ' .
if there 's a single model answer , it gives you a great deal to go on , " dr wood says .
ambiguous question professor srihari accepts that the software can not yet tackle an answer to a more ambiguous exam question .
" it 's a much bigger problem to read arbitrary handwriting that you know nothing about , " he says .
we 're reluctant to take human markers out of the process oxford , cambridge and rsa board professor stephen pulman at the university of oxford has identified another potential pitfall in professor srihari 's approach .
" you ca n't just look for keywords , because the student might have the right keywords in the wrong configuration , or they might use keywords equivalents , " professor pulman says .
for instance , if a student is asked about world war 2 , the keywords might include churchill and hitler .
but it is not enough for the computer to identify those words - it would need to recognise the error in an essay that stated churchill was the german leader and hitler led the british .
it would also need to learn that " prime minister " or " the british bulldog " are equivalent terms for " churchill " .
but professor pulman thinks software of this kind could have an application in the future .
in 2003 , his team developed computer software to mark typed responses in a gcse biology exam .
' resistant people ' " we tried to persuade the exam boards to take up the technology , but people are resistant to having a computer determine how well they did in an exam , " he says .
a spokesman at the oxford , cambridge and rsa -lrb- ocr -rrb- exam board agrees .
" we 're reluctant to take human markers out of the process .
but that 's not to say the technology wo n't have reached a useable stage in the future . "
but professor srihari thinks that these arguments underestimate the benefits his technology could have for teachers today .
" one of the most mundane things teachers have to do is grade pieces of writing , " he says .
" in large volumes , marking is n't enjoyable . "
alison smith , head of the english department at millom school , cumbria , is willing to concede the point , but she stresses that marking is an important aspect of teaching nonetheless .
" most examiners who are current teachers do it partly because it gives them information that they can use with their own classes , " miss smith says .
" i 've been an examiner for five years because it makes me a better teacher . "
even if the technology improves , it is unlikely that there will be a clamour to use it for nationwide exams , miss smith thinks .
" if your chances of going to university rested on grades , you 'd want a human examiner . "
professor srihari is still at an early stage of his research , and he hopes there will be improvements in software accuracy in the future .
until that happens , gcse examiners must continue to sacrifice their summer holidays to hours of marking .
three bbc journalists provided written answers to the question - how was martha washington 's role as first lady different from that of eleanor roosevelt ? - after reading the accompanying text .
our handwritten answers were sent to professor srihari and the computer marked the responses .
the grades covered the entire range from the highest grade six to the lowest grade one .
a grade one answer is " brief , repetitive , and shows minimal understanding of the text " according to the computer 's marking scheme .
so have standards fallen at the bbc ?

but in future , computers could help them reclaim their summer holidays .
professor sargur srihari 's research team at the university at buffalo , new york , is developing software to fully automate the essay-marking process .
" trying to analyse children 's handwriting is a completely unexplored domain , " says professor srihari .
exam scripts are scanned into the computer , the software reads the handwriting and translates it into computer type , and then grades the response as an examiner would , professor srihari explains .
he has tested the software using a reading comprehension exam at us grade 8 level -lrb- 13-14 year-olds -rrb- .
the children were asked to read a passage about american first ladies and use the information within to answer a question : " how was martha washington 's role as first lady different from that of eleanor roosevelt ? "
graded scripts professor srihari asked human examiners to grade 300 answer booklets .
half of the graded scripts were then fed into the computer to " teach " it the grading process .
the software identified key words and phrases that were repeatedly associated with high grades .
if few of these features are present in an exam script , it generally receives a low grade .
what did the computer make of written work by bbc journalists ?
next , the computer was switched from " learning " mode to " grading " mode .
professor srihari fed the remaining 150 scripts into the computer without the human grades attached .
the computer predicted which grade a teacher would give each answer .
the computer was within a grade of the human examiners 70 % of the time .
the results are published in the journal artificial intelligence .
could your results be marked by computer one day ?
to see the software in action , the staff on the bbc online technology desk tried their hand at the grade 8 exam .
while the computer graded the responses , professor srihari explained some of the problems involved in developing the software .

but in future , computers could help them reclaim their summer holidays .
professor sargur srihari 's research team at the university at buffalo , new york , is developing software to fully automate the essay-marking process .
" trying to analyse children 's handwriting is a completely unexplored domain , " says professor srihari .
exam scripts are scanned into the computer , the software reads the handwriting and translates it into computer type , and then grades the response as an examiner would , professor srihari explains .
he has tested the software using a reading comprehension exam at us grade 8 level -lrb- 13-14 year-olds -rrb- .
the children were asked to read a passage about american first ladies and use the information within to answer a question : " how was martha washington 's role as first lady different from that of eleanor roosevelt ? "
graded scripts professor srihari asked human examiners to grade 300 answer booklets .
half of the graded scripts were then fed into the computer to " teach " it the grading process .
the software identified key words and phrases that were repeatedly associated with high grades .
if few of these features are present in an exam script , it generally receives a low grade .
what did the computer make of written work by bbc journalists ?
next , the computer was switched from " learning " mode to " grading " mode .
professor srihari fed the remaining 150 scripts into the computer without the human grades attached .
the computer predicted which grade a teacher would give each answer .
the computer was within a grade of the human examiners 70 % of the time .
the results are published in the journal artificial intelligence .
could your results be marked by computer one day ?
to see the software in action , the staff on the bbc online technology desk tried their hand at the grade 8 exam .
while the computer graded the responses , professor srihari explained some of the problems involved in developing the software .
" analysing handwriting is difficult , " he says .
" but once you have computerised texts you can do many things . "
" today , over 90 % of handwritten addresses on envelopes are read by computer , which seemed unbelievable 15 years ago . "
legible handwriting the key , professor srihari explains , is to only expose the computer to legible handwriting .
this is one advantage of using handwriting recognition software on children .
" children write better , " he says .
" they do n't have the bad habits you see in an adult scrawl . "
the computer can easily break down children 's handwriting into individual letters and interpret the words , professor srihari says .
to refine the process , the computer also carries a database of handwriting samples that it can use to compare the general form of handwritten words .
working with children 's handwriting carries additional advantages .
they have a comparatively small vocabulary , says professor srihari , and so the computer needs a smaller " dictionary " of words to translate their handwriting .
professor srihari 's software can correctly identify about 60 % of the words in any child 's handwriting .
but that is only half the problem .
next , the computer must grade the child 's answer using its artificial neural network .
" the artificial neural network learns from the human scored answers to identify the important features of the text , " says professor srihari .
" some of the features are content dependent - key phrases or words in the answer - and some are content independent - the length of the sentences and the total answer length , for example . "
the computer isolates and identifies keywords dr mary mcgee wood at the university of manchester is also studying the role of computers in exam marking .
" it 's interesting stuff , " she says .
" but they 've been very clever to limit this to a specific domain - reading comprehension . "
because the children have to answer a question using information in a specific passage of text , the software programmers can predict what keywords will appear in the text , which makes the computer 's task relatively simple , she explains .
" there is a buzz word for this - ' expectation driven ' .
if there 's a single model answer , it gives you a great deal to go on , " dr wood says .
ambiguous question professor srihari accepts that the software can not yet tackle an answer to a more ambiguous exam question .
" it 's a much bigger problem to read arbitrary handwriting that you know nothing about , " he says .
we 're reluctant to take human markers out of the process oxford , cambridge and rsa board professor stephen pulman at the university of oxford has identified another potential pitfall in professor srihari 's approach .
" you ca n't just look for keywords , because the student might have the right keywords in the wrong configuration , or they might use keywords equivalents , " professor pulman says .
for instance , if a student is asked about world war 2 , the keywords might include churchill and hitler .
but it is not enough for the computer to identify those words - it would need to recognise the error in an essay that stated churchill was the german leader and hitler led the british .
it would also need to learn that " prime minister " or " the british bulldog " are equivalent terms for " churchill " .
but professor pulman thinks software of this kind could have an application in the future .
in 2003 , his team developed computer software to mark typed responses in a gcse biology exam .
' resistant people ' " we tried to persuade the exam boards to take up the technology , but people are resistant to having a computer determine how well they did in an exam , " he says .
a spokesman at the oxford , cambridge and rsa -lrb- ocr -rrb- exam board agrees .
" we 're reluctant to take human markers out of the process .
but that 's not to say the technology wo n't have reached a useable stage in the future . "
but professor srihari thinks that these arguments underestimate the benefits his technology could have for teachers today .
" one of the most mundane things teachers have to do is grade pieces of writing , " he says .
" in large volumes , marking is n't enjoyable . "
alison smith , head of the english department at millom school , cumbria , is willing to concede the point , but she stresses that marking is an important aspect of teaching nonetheless .
" most examiners who are current teachers do it partly because it gives them information that they can use with their own classes , " miss smith says .
" i 've been an examiner for five years because it makes me a better teacher . "
even if the technology improves , it is unlikely that there will be a clamour to use it for nationwide exams , miss smith thinks .
" if your chances of going to university rested on grades , you 'd want a human examiner . "
professor srihari is still at an early stage of his research , and he hopes there will be improvements in software accuracy in the future .
until that happens , gcse examiners must continue to sacrifice their summer holidays to hours of marking .
three bbc journalists provided written answers to the question - how was martha washington 's role as first lady different from that of eleanor roosevelt ? - after reading the accompanying text .
our handwritten answers were sent to professor srihari and the computer marked the responses .
the grades covered the entire range from the highest grade six to the lowest grade one .
a grade one answer is " brief , repetitive , and shows minimal understanding of the text " according to the computer 's marking scheme .
so have standards fallen at the bbc ?
" some of the words in the answers were n't recognised , " explains professor srihari .
" perhaps because they were not in the computer 's dictionary . "

" some of the features are content dependent - key phrases or words in the answer - and some are content independent - the length of the sentences and the total answer length , for example . "
the computer isolates and identifies keywords dr mary mcgee wood at the university of manchester is also studying the role of computers in exam marking .
" it 's interesting stuff , " she says .
" but they 've been very clever to limit this to a specific domain - reading comprehension . "
because the children have to answer a question using information in a specific passage of text , the software programmers can predict what keywords will appear in the text , which makes the computer 's task relatively simple , she explains .
" there is a buzz word for this - ' expectation driven ' .
if there 's a single model answer , it gives you a great deal to go on , " dr wood says .
ambiguous question professor srihari accepts that the software can not yet tackle an answer to a more ambiguous exam question .
" it 's a much bigger problem to read arbitrary handwriting that you know nothing about , " he says .
we 're reluctant to take human markers out of the process oxford , cambridge and rsa board professor stephen pulman at the university of oxford has identified another potential pitfall in professor srihari 's approach .
" you ca n't just look for keywords , because the student might have the right keywords in the wrong configuration , or they might use keywords equivalents , " professor pulman says .
for instance , if a student is asked about world war 2 , the keywords might include churchill and hitler .
but it is not enough for the computer to identify those words - it would need to recognise the error in an essay that stated churchill was the german leader and hitler led the british .
it would also need to learn that " prime minister " or " the british bulldog " are equivalent terms for " churchill " .
but professor pulman thinks software of this kind could have an application in the future .
in 2003 , his team developed computer software to mark typed responses in a gcse biology exam .
' resistant people ' " we tried to persuade the exam boards to take up the technology , but people are resistant to having a computer determine how well they did in an exam , " he says .
a spokesman at the oxford , cambridge and rsa -lrb- ocr -rrb- exam board agrees .
" we 're reluctant to take human markers out of the process .
but that 's not to say the technology wo n't have reached a useable stage in the future . "
but professor srihari thinks that these arguments underestimate the benefits his technology could have for teachers today .
" one of the most mundane things teachers have to do is grade pieces of writing , " he says .
" in large volumes , marking is n't enjoyable . "
alison smith , head of the english department at millom school , cumbria , is willing to concede the point , but she stresses that marking is an important aspect of teaching nonetheless .
" most examiners who are current teachers do it partly because it gives them information that they can use with their own classes , " miss smith says .
" i 've been an examiner for five years because it makes me a better teacher . "
even if the technology improves , it is unlikely that there will be a clamour to use it for nationwide exams , miss smith thinks .
" if your chances of going to university rested on grades , you 'd want a human examiner . "
professor srihari is still at an early stage of his research , and he hopes there will be improvements in software accuracy in the future .
until that happens , gcse examiners must continue to sacrifice their summer holidays to hours of marking .
three bbc journalists provided written answers to the question - how was martha washington 's role as first lady different from that of eleanor roosevelt ? - after reading the accompanying text .
our handwritten answers were sent to professor srihari and the computer marked the responses .
the grades covered the entire range from the highest grade six to the lowest grade one .
a grade one answer is " brief , repetitive , and shows minimal understanding of the text " according to the computer 's marking scheme .

but in future , computers could help them reclaim their summer holidays .
professor sargur srihari 's research team at the university at buffalo , new york , is developing software to fully automate the essay-marking process .
" trying to analyse children 's handwriting is a completely unexplored domain , " says professor srihari .
exam scripts are scanned into the computer , the software reads the handwriting and translates it into computer type , and then grades the response as an examiner would , professor srihari explains .
he has tested the software using a reading comprehension exam at us grade 8 level -lrb- 13-14 year-olds -rrb- .
the children were asked to read a passage about american first ladies and use the information within to answer a question : " how was martha washington 's role as first lady different from that of eleanor roosevelt ? "
graded scripts professor srihari asked human examiners to grade 300 answer booklets .
half of the graded scripts were then fed into the computer to " teach " it the grading process .
the software identified key words and phrases that were repeatedly associated with high grades .
if few of these features are present in an exam script , it generally receives a low grade .
what did the computer make of written work by bbc journalists ?
next , the computer was switched from " learning " mode to " grading " mode .
professor srihari fed the remaining 150 scripts into the computer without the human grades attached .
the computer predicted which grade a teacher would give each answer .
the computer was within a grade of the human examiners 70 % of the time .
the results are published in the journal artificial intelligence .
could your results be marked by computer one day ?
to see the software in action , the staff on the bbc online technology desk tried their hand at the grade 8 exam .
while the computer graded the responses , professor srihari explained some of the problems involved in developing the software .
" analysing handwriting is difficult , " he says .
" but once you have computerised texts you can do many things . "
" today , over 90 % of handwritten addresses on envelopes are read by computer , which seemed unbelievable 15 years ago . "
legible handwriting the key , professor srihari explains , is to only expose the computer to legible handwriting .
this is one advantage of using handwriting recognition software on children .
" children write better , " he says .
" they do n't have the bad habits you see in an adult scrawl . "
the computer can easily break down children 's handwriting into individual letters and interpret the words , professor srihari says .
to refine the process , the computer also carries a database of handwriting samples that it can use to compare the general form of handwritten words .
working with children 's handwriting carries additional advantages .
they have a comparatively small vocabulary , says professor srihari , and so the computer needs a smaller " dictionary " of words to translate their handwriting .
professor srihari 's software can correctly identify about 60 % of the words in any child 's handwriting .
but that is only half the problem .
next , the computer must grade the child 's answer using its artificial neural network .
" the artificial neural network learns from the human scored answers to identify the important features of the text , " says professor srihari .
" some of the features are content dependent - key phrases or words in the answer - and some are content independent - the length of the sentences and the total answer length , for example . "

rhys was walking home from playing football in croxteth , liverpool , when a youth , perhaps as a young as 13 , rode up on a bmx and opened fire .
the sense of disbelief at the way such a young boy , who had nothing to do with gangs , was killed was summed up by his grieving parents .
" people are saying to me ' wrong time , wrong place ' .
it should n't be a case of wrong time , wrong place , " said stephen jones , rhys 's father .
" it should not happen in this country . "
but it does not take long to find evidence of armed youths in the croxteth area .
a quick search of youtube reveals gangs of young men , with their faces covered , showing off their array of weapons for anyone with a passing interest and an internet connection .
warren bradley wants a zero tolerance approach the leader of liverpool city council , warren bradley , believes a tough approach is the answer to tackling them , and wants a summit among city leaders to discuss the problem .
" i regularly meet people who tell me there 's got to be a period of zero tolerance across major towns and cities where graffiti is dealt with as a crime , " he told bbc five live .
" that 's the problem .
you 've got young people who are teetering on the brink of crime undertaking small , low level crimes and not being punished for it and that leads them on to something bigger . "
but what is the root of the problem ?
why do some young men attach so much value to violence and criminality ?
the reverend dr david leslie , of st cuthbert 's church in croxteth , near where rhys was shot , believes modern culture is partly to blame .
he told radio 4 : " i think we are locked into what i would call sort of false values , a kind of commodified culture where people are valued much more for what they have than what they are .
they are not empowered ... so you hold a gun - you feel powerful practical wizdom , youth worker " i feel also , in terms of education , that right from early days people really do n't know how to communicate with one another , which means that as they get older they are much more likely to be aggressive and instead of having fights now we 're into knives and guns . "
community leaders agree that education is an important tool in steering young men away from gang violence , and ultimately reducing gun crime .
youth worker practical wizdom is part of the gunz down group , which tours schools in cities addressing the issues facing boys aged between 11 and 14 .
he told bbc breakfast that getting to boys early was important to address the " fear and anger " that drives them into gangs .
family support " they are not empowered .
so you hold a gun - you feel powerful .
i think that 's as simple as it is , so we need to find ways to empower young people , " he said .
" i do personally believe it starts with families .
and family breakdown and poverty is one of the main drivers of this .
not necessarily just money , but the fact of not having that support there . "
practical wizdom also believes that supporting families , and encouraging them to stay together , was an important factor in steering youths away from gangs .
" i think we have got two years to turn this around , " he added .
" if we can get into the schools , if we can get to the parents and support them and get the kids to think about their actions before they get in to it , i think we can stem this .
" but we have got to work hard at it .
it is a problem , it is present and we need to get on . "

the reverend dr david leslie , of st cuthbert 's church in croxteth , near where rhys was shot , believes modern culture is partly to blame .
he told radio 4 : " i think we are locked into what i would call sort of false values , a kind of commodified culture where people are valued much more for what they have than what they are .
they are not empowered ... so you hold a gun - you feel powerful practical wizdom , youth worker " i feel also , in terms of education , that right from early days people really do n't know how to communicate with one another , which means that as they get older they are much more likely to be aggressive and instead of having fights now we 're into knives and guns . "
community leaders agree that education is an important tool in steering young men away from gang violence , and ultimately reducing gun crime .
youth worker practical wizdom is part of the gunz down group , which tours schools in cities addressing the issues facing boys aged between 11 and 14 .
he told bbc breakfast that getting to boys early was important to address the " fear and anger " that drives them into gangs .
family support " they are not empowered .
so you hold a gun - you feel powerful .
i think that 's as simple as it is , so we need to find ways to empower young people , " he said .
" i do personally believe it starts with families .
and family breakdown and poverty is one of the main drivers of this .
not necessarily just money , but the fact of not having that support there . "
practical wizdom also believes that supporting families , and encouraging them to stay together , was an important factor in steering youths away from gangs .
" i think we have got two years to turn this around , " he added .
" if we can get into the schools , if we can get to the parents and support them and get the kids to think about their actions before they get in to it , i think we can stem this .
" but we have got to work hard at it .
it is a problem , it is present and we need to get on . "

the course is aimed at 13 to 15 year olds .
deputy chair of the metbpa , bevan powell , said , " the aim of the course is to develop a greater sense of social responsibility and leadership capability within young people " .
