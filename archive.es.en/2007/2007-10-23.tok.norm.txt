" this is a new and historic step in the fight against doping , " pat mcquaid told reporters on tuesday from paris , where he was attending the second day of a two-day international meeting on doping in cycling . the " biological passport , " which was first announced by uci last week , would monitor a series of blood parameters of a rider , creating a medical profile that could be compared to the results of anti-doping tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping scandals continually rock the tour de france mcquaid cautioned that the initiative , set to take effect in january , will not cure cycling 's doping problem but will serve as a new element in the anti-doping " arsenal " along with blood and urine tests . " for each rider , you 'll have an individual set of parameters that are his norm ... his blood parameters .
there is a norm and above and below , it can only go a certain distance , " mcquaid said . " if you see that during the tests the number goes above the norm , then you know he 's done something , that he 's manipulated something and it 's not a natural occurrence , " he added . mcquaid urged all parties to help set up a working group as quickly as possible in order to be able to start the project on time . " if everybody stays will be us - riders , teams , organizers and media together we can build a better future for this sport , " he said . increased doping controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uci has promised more out of competition controls uci anti-doping manager anne gripper said the organization hopes to increase the number of tests taken out of competition .
the uci will have conducted about 1,500 doping tests out of competition in 2007 , she said , a figure that should rise to about 8,000 next year . the director general of the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- , david howman , also praised the passport , in a new show of unity after recent high-profile disputes between the two organizations who have variously pointed fingers over who deserves blame for the doping scandals that have battered cycling . wada and the uci were to sign an agreement later tuesday creating a working group to flesh out the details of the biological passports in time for a january launch . the meeting was organized by french health and sports minister roselyne bachelot in an effort to parry some of the fallout from the tour de france . " the first thing i 'm expecting is to show how cycling can be at the forefront - voluntarily - in this area , and rebuild the image " of the sport , bachelot said in the lead-up to the event .
" we want to make this summit a sort of pilot project for the fight against doping , which will be useful for the entire sports world . " annus horribilis cheating has dogged cycling for years , but this year more than most . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floyd landis has appealed against loosing his 2006 tour de france title the season started off with confessions by former cycling star bjarne riis and a half-dozen riders from the german team t-mobile , who admitted to using the blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- , during the 1990s . then , at this year 's tour de france , race leader michael rasmussen was sacked by his rabobank team for allegedly lying about his training program , while pre-race favorite kazakh alexandre vinokourov was kicked out of the event along with his astana team after testing positive for a banned blood transfusion . to cap it off , last month , 2006 tour winner floyd landis was stripped of his title after testing positive for elevated levels of testosterone . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 , for an eu-wide work permit .
the european " blue card " will simplify entry requirements for highly skilled workers seeking employment in the 27-member bloc . the blue card is designed to attract professionals such as indian computer workers and chinese engineers , most of whom currently prefer to seek employment in the united states , australia or canada . " we are not good enough at attracting highly skilled people , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , who along with franco frattini , eu commissioner in charge of immigration issues , presented the blue card plan in strasbourg in tuesday . too few skilled foreigners according to frattini , highly skilled foreign workers make up 10 percent of the workforce in australia , and 3.5 percent in the us .
" in the eu it 's only 1.7 percent , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue card is named after the blue flag of the eu to qualify for a blue card , applicants would have to have a work contract , professional qualifications and a minimum salary level at least three times the level of existing minimum wages in that country , plus health insurance . in return , its holders would have the right to work across the 27-nation bloc in addition to access to social security , tax and housing benefits .
blue card holders would also be allowed to bring their families to join them within months of applying . the proposals also include special provisions for young professionals and seek to limit the extent to which companies can recruit skilled workers from developing countries that are suffering from so-called " brain drain . " overwhelming bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner franco frattini has been pushing strongly for the blue card according to the commission , member states should set up a simplified " one-stop-shop " system quickly granting white-collar workers a work permit . " in a market where there is increasing international competition for these workers , europe can only succeed in attracting ' the best and the brightest ' if it speaks with one voice , " the commission said in its draft proposal . the plan could do away with some 20 different national procedures within the eu that have proven complex and burdensome to those seeking residence and work permits . germany against proposal the european parliament endorsed the blue card scheme last month , but it still needs to gain approval from all 27 member states .
that could prove difficult , since several countries have already expressed their opposition to it . several countries feel immigration should remain an issue of national policy , and not be guided by brussels .
some unions feel that in influx of foreign workers could undercut salaries and labor rights of europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany lacks workers in engineering and the metal , electrical and automotive industries the proposed program is expected to face a particularly rough ride in countries such austria and the netherlands .
in germany , the federal government has already signalled it would reject the plan . the acting head of the parliamentary group of angela merkel 's christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , said on tuesday that germany was already competitive in attracting the best brains to its shores .
it was also important , he said , for germany do its utmost to requalify the some 3.5 million unemployed in the country . " we have to concentrate on getting these people into work , " bosbach said .
" -lrb- german people -rrb- would n't understand anything else . " this is despite rapidly growing demand for highly skilled workers in germany .

the city has received positive signals both from the german government and the german olympic committee . " we want to get the olympics to germany .
not only the city of munich but the state of bavaria and the whole german sporting world are behind the effort , " thomas bach , chief of the german olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- , told the dpa news agency . munich mayor christian ude said : " the meeting was a complete success , " referring to the presentation of the feasibility study on monday . the decisive dosb vote about munich 's bid takes place on december 8 in hamburg , with the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- to elect the 2018 winter olympics host city in 2011 . munich hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and , if chosen by the ioc , would be the first city to land the winter games as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a masked terrorist in munich in 1972 the 1972 olympics in munich were marred when members of the israeli olympic team were taken hostage by a palestinian terror organization .
by the end of the ordeal , during which the world held as the showdown was broadcast around the globe , the black september group had murdered 11 israeli athletes and one german policeman .
five of the eight terrorists were killed during a rescue attempt . venues in three areas munich plans a compact concept with three cluster areas for events which , according to bach " meets international requirements .

bob-sledding competitions would be held at the existing venue in königssee in southeast bavaria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing hosts the olympic games in august 2008 " no one doubts our concept anymore , " ude told dpa .
" it prevailed because only a compact concept has a chance to convince the ioc . " other traditional bavarian winter sports venues had initially protested the munich plans . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble 's presence at monday 's presentation of the study also reflected the government 's support of the concept . " the olympic bid offers an outstanding chance to present german sports on the international stage and reinforce the image of germany as a modern country , " schäuble said . bach , who is also on the ioc executive board , said " the dosb welcomes the support from the government and the state of bavaria . "
he also said that munich organizers are prepared for the bid . bildunterschrift : sochi residents on learning they 'd gotten the winter games in 2014 investments needed munich spent some 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 858,000 dollars -rrb- on the feasibility study for the 2018 games . actual bid costs are estimated at 30 million euros .

23 , for an eu-wide work permit .
the european " blue card " will simplify entry requirements for highly skilled workers seeking employment in the 27-member bloc . the blue card is designed to attract professionals such as indian computer workers and chinese engineers , most of whom currently prefer to seek employment in the united states , australia or canada . " we are not good enough at attracting highly skilled people , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , who along with franco frattini , eu commissioner in charge of immigration issues , presented the blue card plan in strasbourg in tuesday . too few skilled foreigners according to frattini , highly skilled foreign workers make up 10 percent of the workforce in australia , and 3.5 percent in the us .
" in the eu it 's only 1.7 percent , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue card is named after the blue flag of the eu to qualify for a blue card , applicants would have to have a work contract , professional qualifications and a minimum salary level at least three times the level of existing minimum wages in that country , plus health insurance . in return , its holders would have the right to work across the 27-nation bloc in addition to access to social security , tax and housing benefits .
blue card holders would also be allowed to bring their families to join them within months of applying . the proposals also include special provisions for young professionals and seek to limit the extent to which companies can recruit skilled workers from developing countries that are suffering from so-called " brain drain . " overwhelming bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner franco frattini has been pushing strongly for the blue card according to the commission , member states should set up a simplified " one-stop-shop " system quickly granting white-collar workers a work permit . " in a market where there is increasing international competition for these workers , europe can only succeed in attracting ' the best and the brightest ' if it speaks with one voice , " the commission said in its draft proposal . the plan could do away with some 20 different national procedures within the eu that have proven complex and burdensome to those seeking residence and work permits . germany against proposal the european parliament endorsed the blue card scheme last month , but it still needs to gain approval from all 27 member states .
that could prove difficult , since several countries have already expressed their opposition to it . several countries feel immigration should remain an issue of national policy , and not be guided by brussels .
some unions feel that in influx of foreign workers could undercut salaries and labor rights of europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany lacks workers in engineering and the metal , electrical and automotive industries the proposed program is expected to face a particularly rough ride in countries such austria and the netherlands .
in germany , the federal government has already signalled it would reject the plan . the acting head of the parliamentary group of angela merkel 's christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , said on tuesday that germany was already competitive in attracting the best brains to its shores .
it was also important , he said , for germany do its utmost to requalify the some 3.5 million unemployed in the country . " we have to concentrate on getting these people into work , " bosbach said .
" -lrb- german people -rrb- would n't understand anything else . " this is despite rapidly growing demand for highly skilled workers in germany .
a study released on monday estimated the lack of specialists in the country is costing the german economy 18.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 26.4 billion -rrb- a year .

" we decisively reject these unfounded accusations , " an exterior ministry spokesperson said in beijing .
" we will apply for a clarification from the german government . " remberg told a conference on industrial espionage in berlin on monday that the nature and frequency of the attacks on german companies pointed to a concerted targeting by chinese hackers backed by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel addressed the cyber row on her visit to beijing " in our view , state chinese interests stand behind these digital attacks , " said remberg .
" supporting this view is the intensity , structure and scope of the attacks , and above all the targets , which include -lsb- german -rsb- authorities and companies . " remberg 's statements come barely two months after the german media reported incidents of cyber-spying at german government ministries by computer hackers believed to be linked to the chinese army .
the issue was raised by german chancellor angela merkel when she met chinese president wen jiabao in beijing in august .
china denied the allegations and said all " hacking " behavior was prohibited . since the german reports surfaced , other countries , including the united states and britain , have admitted that their own government agencies have been targeted by hackers backed by the chinese state .
the growing number of allegations thrown china 's way has prompted some to speculate whether a new front of warfare is beginning to open up between states , via the internet . chinese cyber-war theory addressed this belief was addressed by remberg at the berlin conference , but he refused to say whether he thought china 's use of spying technology was part of an internet-based international destabilization campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military secrets are needed to advance china 's forces " some people call this the chinese cyber war , " remberg said , adding that it was important to differentiate between legitimate attempts to gather information on competitors by chinese companies and state-led industrial espionage . however , he was less reticent when it came to his assertions that china was behind the increasing numbers of attempted and successful breaches of internet security in germany . " across the world the people 's republic of china is intensively gathering political , military , corporate-strategic and scientific information in order to bridge their technological gaps as quickly as possible , " remberg said . china 's interest in industrial and government secrets , remberg added , was driven by its desire to become a top global economic power .
to catch up with the west , china needed " a massive transfer of high technology , " he said . astonishing intensity of cyber-attacks on germany remberg astonished the berlin conference by revealing that attacks on german ministries and authorities were being discovered every other day and that the perpetrators appeared unconcerned that the attacks were being discovered .
" every one or two days , new attacks are detected , " he said . he also suggested that china was using classic espionage methods to launch its spy attacks , albeit with the latest technology .
traditional infiltration by agents still occurred , he said , but instead of the spies gaining access to government buildings in person , they now remotely accessed the information they needed from legitimate bases within germany via the internet . " the diplomatic representative offices and chinese media agencies in germany enable the hidden deployment of intelligence agents , " remberg said .
firms in joint ventures with chinese firms were also at risk , he added . spies of many nations after german secrets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spies from many nations are operating in germany as many experts have previously concluded , remberg also said he was sure that the chinese were not alone in hacking german sites .
" russian intelligence agencies are making great efforts in germany to get important information , using both open and conspiratorial methods , in military , political , economic and scientific areas , " he said . remberg also named iran , north korea , pakistan and syria as countries that had sent intelligence agents to germany to procure " dual-use " machinery - which can be used in both civil and military applications - and know-how for illegal weapons technology , including nuclear technology . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we decisively reject these unfounded accusations , " an exterior ministry spokesperson said in beijing .
" we will apply for a clarification from the german government . " remberg told a conference on industrial espionage in berlin on monday that the nature and frequency of the attacks on german companies pointed to a concerted targeting by chinese hackers backed by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel addressed the cyber row on her visit to beijing " in our view , state chinese interests stand behind these digital attacks , " said remberg .
" supporting this view is the intensity , structure and scope of the attacks , and above all the targets , which include -lsb- german -rsb- authorities and companies . " remberg 's statements come barely two months after the german media reported incidents of cyber-spying at german government ministries by computer hackers believed to be linked to the chinese army .
the issue was raised by german chancellor angela merkel when she met chinese president wen jiabao in beijing in august .
china denied the allegations and said all " hacking " behavior was prohibited . since the german reports surfaced , other countries , including the united states and britain , have admitted that their own government agencies have been targeted by hackers backed by the chinese state .
the growing number of allegations thrown china 's way has prompted some to speculate whether a new front of warfare is beginning to open up between states , via the internet . chinese cyber-war theory addressed this belief was addressed by remberg at the berlin conference , but he refused to say whether he thought china 's use of spying technology was part of an internet-based international destabilization campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military secrets are needed to advance china 's forces " some people call this the chinese cyber war , " remberg said , adding that it was important to differentiate between legitimate attempts to gather information on competitors by chinese companies and state-led industrial espionage . however , he was less reticent when it came to his assertions that china was behind the increasing numbers of attempted and successful breaches of internet security in germany . " across the world the people 's republic of china is intensively gathering political , military , corporate-strategic and scientific information in order to bridge their technological gaps as quickly as possible , " remberg said . china 's interest in industrial and government secrets , remberg added , was driven by its desire to become a top global economic power .
to catch up with the west , china needed " a massive transfer of high technology , " he said . astonishing intensity of cyber-attacks on germany remberg astonished the berlin conference by revealing that attacks on german ministries and authorities were being discovered every other day and that the perpetrators appeared unconcerned that the attacks were being discovered .
" every one or two days , new attacks are detected , " he said . he also suggested that china was using classic espionage methods to launch its spy attacks , albeit with the latest technology .
traditional infiltration by agents still occurred , he said , but instead of the spies gaining access to government buildings in person , they now remotely accessed the information they needed from legitimate bases within germany via the internet . " the diplomatic representative offices and chinese media agencies in germany enable the hidden deployment of intelligence agents , " remberg said .
firms in joint ventures with chinese firms were also at risk , he added . spies of many nations after german secrets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spies from many nations are operating in germany as many experts have previously concluded , remberg also said he was sure that the chinese were not alone in hacking german sites .

the study determined that the lack of specialists was " economically relevant " and that the problem was " putting the brakes on growth , " otremba added . he said the phenomenon was attributable to a structural problem in the german labor market .
the study found that the information and communication industry was particularly endangered because of the lack of specialists in mathematics and computer science .
" we are urgently searching for new workers , " august-wilhelm scheer , the president of bitkom , the federation representing the it , telecommunications and new media industry in germany , told reporters at a computer systems fair in munich on monday .
according to bitkom statistics , around 57 percent of information and communication enterprises needed more personnel while 62 percent admitted that their companies were suffering due to the lack of specialists .
the federation estimates that there are currently 30,000 to 40,000 free places in the it industry .
scheer called on german universities to train more specialists and to promote exceptional students to businesses , as well as for an increased effort to bring in highly-skilled foreigners .
" we need these highly-intelligent foreigners , " scheer said .
" they will help us secure our future . "
existing specialists may flee germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if businesses suffer , their specialists may leave he also warned that if those companies in germany who are lacking specialists did not find people to take the positions , then the enterprises would suffer and the specialists they did have would look for work outside germany .
the federal ministry for economic affairs , which commissioned the iw study , said that it was particularly concerned with the lack of highly-skilled specialists in the industries which are important for germany 's technological progress such as mechanical engineering , the metal and electrical industries and automotive construction .
the bad news is that the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better , with germany 's aging population exacerbating the problem in the future .
statistics show around 970,000 school leavers this year compared with around 800,000 first graders .
martin wansleben , the managing director of the german chamber of commerce and industry , told reporters that the numbers of jobs open to school leavers and qualified parents must be increased and that german institutions should increase their promotion of vocational training schemes .
he also added that more should be done to open up the job market for qualified foreigners . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one church has decided to take control and move to where the believers are . these are hard times for christianity in europe .
while it is the world 's most popular faith with some 2.1 billion followers , the recruitment drive in the old world has been in the slow lane for some time .
church attendance is down all over the western world and in germany , rising maintenance costs and dwindling funds have seen parishes shut down churches and sell the buildings for commercial use .
church dug up , ready to roll coining a phrase that references a rival in the faith stakes - " if the mountain wo n't come to muhammad , muhammad must go to the mountain " - one church in germany has given up waiting for its flock to return and has gone of in search of pastures new .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heuersdorf church is making way for a new mine for a church to physically be uprooted and moved , there has to be a pretty good reason and while a lack of congregation may be a good argument , it is not usually enough to justify moving something which weighs a fair few tons .
the reason behind the relocation of the heuersdorf church has as much to do with commerce as it does with spreading the word .
mining company footing the bill the 660-ton stone church is being moved because it was sitting on extensive deposits of lignite , or brown coal , a fuel used in power generation plants .
after an extensive legal battle with the mibrag mining company , the church and 59 residents of the village will be moved 12 kilometers -lrb- 7.5 miles -rrb- to land near leipzig in eastern germany .
the church 's journey to its new home will begin on wednesday .
the 750-year-old church , complete with tiled bell tower , was separated from its foundations and lifted 1.5 meters -lrb- five feet -rrb- onto a massive rolling platform on monday .
the painstakingly slow journey to the village of borna is expected to take about a week at a cost of three million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- .
time will tell if the miraculous relocation rekindles the belief of the lapsed locals . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one church has decided to take control and move to where the believers are . these are hard times for christianity in europe .
while it is the world 's most popular faith with some 2.1 billion followers , the recruitment drive in the old world has been in the slow lane for some time .
church attendance is down all over the western world and in germany , rising maintenance costs and dwindling funds have seen parishes shut down churches and sell the buildings for commercial use .
church dug up , ready to roll coining a phrase that references a rival in the faith stakes - " if the mountain wo n't come to muhammad , muhammad must go to the mountain " - one church in germany has given up waiting for its flock to return and has gone of in search of pastures new .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heuersdorf church is making way for a new mine for a church to physically be uprooted and moved , there has to be a pretty good reason and while a lack of congregation may be a good argument , it is not usually enough to justify moving something which weighs a fair few tons .
the reason behind the relocation of the heuersdorf church has as much to do with commerce as it does with spreading the word .
mining company footing the bill the 660-ton stone church is being moved because it was sitting on extensive deposits of lignite , or brown coal , a fuel used in power generation plants .
after an extensive legal battle with the mibrag mining company , the church and 59 residents of the village will be moved 12 kilometers -lrb- 7.5 miles -rrb- to land near leipzig in eastern germany .
the church 's journey to its new home will begin on wednesday .
the 750-year-old church , complete with tiled bell tower , was separated from its foundations and lifted 1.5 meters -lrb- five feet -rrb- onto a massive rolling platform on monday .
the painstakingly slow journey to the village of borna is expected to take about a week at a cost of three million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- .
time will tell if the miraculous relocation rekindles the belief of the lapsed locals . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is a new and historic step in the fight against doping , " pat mcquaid told reporters on tuesday from paris , where he was attending the second day of a two-day international meeting on doping in cycling . the " biological passport , " which was first announced by uci last week , would monitor a series of blood parameters of a rider , creating a medical profile that could be compared to the results of anti-doping tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping scandals continually rock the tour de france mcquaid cautioned that the initiative , set to take effect in january , will not cure cycling 's doping problem but will serve as a new element in the anti-doping " arsenal " along with blood and urine tests . " for each rider , you 'll have an individual set of parameters that are his norm ... his blood parameters .
there is a norm and above and below , it can only go a certain distance , " mcquaid said . " if you see that during the tests the number goes above the norm , then you know he 's done something , that he 's manipulated something and it 's not a natural occurrence , " he added . mcquaid urged all parties to help set up a working group as quickly as possible in order to be able to start the project on time . " if everybody stays will be us - riders , teams , organizers and media together we can build a better future for this sport , " he said . increased doping controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uci has promised more out of competition controls uci anti-doping manager anne gripper said the organization hopes to increase the number of tests taken out of competition .
the uci will have conducted about 1,500 doping tests out of competition in 2007 , she said , a figure that should rise to about 8,000 next year . the director general of the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- , david howman , also praised the passport , in a new show of unity after recent high-profile disputes between the two organizations who have variously pointed fingers over who deserves blame for the doping scandals that have battered cycling . wada and the uci were to sign an agreement later tuesday creating a working group to flesh out the details of the biological passports in time for a january launch . the meeting was organized by french health and sports minister roselyne bachelot in an effort to parry some of the fallout from the tour de france . " the first thing i 'm expecting is to show how cycling can be at the forefront - voluntarily - in this area , and rebuild the image " of the sport , bachelot said in the lead-up to the event .
" we want to make this summit a sort of pilot project for the fight against doping , which will be useful for the entire sports world . " annus horribilis cheating has dogged cycling for years , but this year more than most . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floyd landis has appealed against loosing his 2006 tour de france title the season started off with confessions by former cycling star bjarne riis and a half-dozen riders from the german team t-mobile , who admitted to using the blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- , during the 1990s . then , at this year 's tour de france , race leader michael rasmussen was sacked by his rabobank team for allegedly lying about his training program , while pre-race favorite kazakh alexandre vinokourov was kicked out of the event along with his astana team after testing positive for a banned blood transfusion . to cap it off , last month , 2006 tour winner floyd landis was stripped of his title after testing positive for elevated levels of testosterone . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it could have been so easy for the nationalist conservative kaczynski to win .
his country is currently experiencing … its most fortunate , happiest time in 300 years .
that he did not take advantage of this unique opportunity goes to show what a poor take on reality he has .
but he viewed himself as more than a ' mere ' politician ; he considered himself more a revolutionary who claimed the moral authority to bend the constitutional state at will and to disregard the conventions of democracy , " the paper wrote . switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung expressed similar sentiments .
" the government not only lost the election because it was confronted with an ' exemplary , comprehensive attack front , ' but also because many polish people were tired of the prime minister 's aggressive , confrontational manner .
in addition , the government 's record was nothing to brag about .
it slid from one domestic crisis into another .
it hardly contributed to the current economic boom in the country and missed the chance to tackle the required reforms .
kaczynski 's government was wrought with scandals , staff suspensions , resignations , allegations , and tactical confusion .
his government stirred up a lot of dust , but did not accomplish much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski lost overwhelmingly the german business paper handelsblatt from düsseldorf looked ahead : " poland is going to need a little time to shed its historical sensitivities , overcome the burdens of transformation and truly become a part of europe .
we should give this country that chance and remain patient - particularly those of us in germany .
we have a historical responsibility toward poland , and we are benefiting tremendously from its integration .
this process will likely go faster with donald tusk at the helm .
it will , in any case , be more pleasant , " the paper noted . the dutch paper de volkskrant took a pragmatic view of poland 's election results .
" it would be a misconception to think that the mood will change completely in the country .
patriotic sentiments are and will remain intense .
warsaw will not suddenly start greeting brussels warmly .
-lsb- tusk 's -rsb- civic platform is a -lrb- neo- -rrb- liberal party with a significant conservative wing .
in addition , president lech kaczynski -lsb- jaroslaw 's twin brother -rsb- is in office until 2010 .
he can to block proposed legislation with his presidential veto power .
while it 's possible to override a veto with a three-fifths majority , frequent repeats could lead to a form of static warfare .
then , poland would be jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski -lrb- jaroslaw 's twin -rrb- is to remain in office until 2010 france 's le figaro was also hesitant to believe poland 's ties with europe would improve overnight .
" after two years of repeated crises , the polish people have now mobilized themselves to bring to an end to a chaotic campaign of shrugging off the country 's legacy of communism , an anticorruption battle worthy of an orwell novel and diplomatic posturings that have left the european union on the edge of a nervous breakdown . … it 's now up to the -lsb- civic platform -rsb- to reach out and repair the damage .
the party has already said its mission is to ' reestablish poland in the heart of europe ' - a declaration of intention received with caution by observers who remember that the conservative wing of this formation was , for a long time , on the same wave length as the kaczynski brothers . " austria 's die presse wrote : " as president and prime minister , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski stole … one thing from all of europe : time .
their election debacle gives us hope that the senseless blockades , historical blame games and embarrassing demands from warsaw will finally come to an end .
leading politicians , not just in brussels , but in many eu capitals , are now breathing a sigh of relief after the victory of the right-wing liberal civic platform .

the study determined that the lack of specialists was " economically relevant " and that the problem was " putting the brakes on growth , " otremba added . he said the phenomenon was attributable to a structural problem in the german labor market .
the study found that the information and communication industry was particularly endangered because of the lack of specialists in mathematics and computer science .
" we are urgently searching for new workers , " august-wilhelm scheer , the president of bitkom , the federation representing the it , telecommunications and new media industry in germany , told reporters at a computer systems fair in munich on monday .
according to bitkom statistics , around 57 percent of information and communication enterprises needed more personnel while 62 percent admitted that their companies were suffering due to the lack of specialists .
the federation estimates that there are currently 30,000 to 40,000 free places in the it industry .
scheer called on german universities to train more specialists and to promote exceptional students to businesses , as well as for an increased effort to bring in highly-skilled foreigners .
" we need these highly-intelligent foreigners , " scheer said .
" they will help us secure our future . "
existing specialists may flee germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if businesses suffer , their specialists may leave he also warned that if those companies in germany who are lacking specialists did not find people to take the positions , then the enterprises would suffer and the specialists they did have would look for work outside germany .
the federal ministry for economic affairs , which commissioned the iw study , said that it was particularly concerned with the lack of highly-skilled specialists in the industries which are important for germany 's technological progress such as mechanical engineering , the metal and electrical industries and automotive construction .
the bad news is that the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better , with germany 's aging population exacerbating the problem in the future .
statistics show around 970,000 school leavers this year compared with around 800,000 first graders .
martin wansleben , the managing director of the german chamber of commerce and industry , told reporters that the numbers of jobs open to school leavers and qualified parents must be increased and that german institutions should increase their promotion of vocational training schemes .
he also added that more should be done to open up the job market for qualified foreigners . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is a new and historic step in the fight against doping , " pat mcquaid told reporters on tuesday from paris , where he was attending the second day of a two-day international meeting on doping in cycling . the " biological passport , " which was first announced by uci last week , would monitor a series of blood parameters of a rider , creating a medical profile that could be compared to the results of anti-doping tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping scandals continually rock the tour de france mcquaid cautioned that the initiative , set to take effect in january , will not cure cycling 's doping problem but will serve as a new element in the anti-doping " arsenal " along with blood and urine tests . " for each rider , you 'll have an individual set of parameters that are his norm ... his blood parameters .
there is a norm and above and below , it can only go a certain distance , " mcquaid said . " if you see that during the tests the number goes above the norm , then you know he 's done something , that he 's manipulated something and it 's not a natural occurrence , " he added . mcquaid urged all parties to help set up a working group as quickly as possible in order to be able to start the project on time . " if everybody stays will be us - riders , teams , organizers and media together we can build a better future for this sport , " he said . increased doping controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uci has promised more out of competition controls uci anti-doping manager anne gripper said the organization hopes to increase the number of tests taken out of competition .
the uci will have conducted about 1,500 doping tests out of competition in 2007 , she said , a figure that should rise to about 8,000 next year . the director general of the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- , david howman , also praised the passport , in a new show of unity after recent high-profile disputes between the two organizations who have variously pointed fingers over who deserves blame for the doping scandals that have battered cycling . wada and the uci were to sign an agreement later tuesday creating a working group to flesh out the details of the biological passports in time for a january launch . the meeting was organized by french health and sports minister roselyne bachelot in an effort to parry some of the fallout from the tour de france . " the first thing i 'm expecting is to show how cycling can be at the forefront - voluntarily - in this area , and rebuild the image " of the sport , bachelot said in the lead-up to the event .
" we want to make this summit a sort of pilot project for the fight against doping , which will be useful for the entire sports world . " annus horribilis cheating has dogged cycling for years , but this year more than most . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floyd landis has appealed against loosing his 2006 tour de france title the season started off with confessions by former cycling star bjarne riis and a half-dozen riders from the german team t-mobile , who admitted to using the blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- , during the 1990s . then , at this year 's tour de france , race leader michael rasmussen was sacked by his rabobank team for allegedly lying about his training program , while pre-race favorite kazakh alexandre vinokourov was kicked out of the event along with his astana team after testing positive for a banned blood transfusion . to cap it off , last month , 2006 tour winner floyd landis was stripped of his title after testing positive for elevated levels of testosterone . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with this upcoming trilateral meeting between the chinese foreign minister yang jiechi , india ’ s external affairs minister pranab mukherjee and their russian counterpart sergei lavrov in china ’ s north eastern city of harbin , a fresh round of dialogue will commence .
professor ajay patnayak , an expert on russian affairs at jawahar lal nehru university in new delhi , explained that the meeting was significant because " china is an emerging power , a neighbour with which india has some border problems " .
he added it would be " good for india to have good neighbourly ties with china " and explained that russia was an old strategic ally for india .
" they share certain common perceptions in central asia and south asia . "

however , professor kozhokin ruled out such notions : " i don ’ t think the three ministers are thinking of confrontation with the us .
i think they have a positive agenda .
all these countries have good ties with the us .
so i don ’ t think they are trying to block the hegemony of the us . "
professor patnayak from india agrees only to a certain extent : " they wo n't build this up as a forum against the us , but in the long-term perspective , they would like to strengthen their position and limit outside interference , and they would like to solve their problems by co-operating among themselves .

" it could have been so easy for the nationalist conservative kaczynski to win .
his country is currently experiencing … its most fortunate , happiest time in 300 years .
that he did not take advantage of this unique opportunity goes to show what a poor take on reality he has .
but he viewed himself as more than a ' mere ' politician ; he considered himself more a revolutionary who claimed the moral authority to bend the constitutional state at will and to disregard the conventions of democracy , " the paper wrote . switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung expressed similar sentiments .
" the government not only lost the election because it was confronted with an ' exemplary , comprehensive attack front , ' but also because many polish people were tired of the prime minister 's aggressive , confrontational manner .
in addition , the government 's record was nothing to brag about .
it slid from one domestic crisis into another .
it hardly contributed to the current economic boom in the country and missed the chance to tackle the required reforms .
kaczynski 's government was wrought with scandals , staff suspensions , resignations , allegations , and tactical confusion .
his government stirred up a lot of dust , but did not accomplish much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski lost overwhelmingly the german business paper handelsblatt from düsseldorf looked ahead : " poland is going to need a little time to shed its historical sensitivities , overcome the burdens of transformation and truly become a part of europe .
we should give this country that chance and remain patient - particularly those of us in germany .
we have a historical responsibility toward poland , and we are benefiting tremendously from its integration .
this process will likely go faster with donald tusk at the helm .
it will , in any case , be more pleasant , " the paper noted . the dutch paper de volkskrant took a pragmatic view of poland 's election results .
" it would be a misconception to think that the mood will change completely in the country .
patriotic sentiments are and will remain intense .
warsaw will not suddenly start greeting brussels warmly .
-lsb- tusk 's -rsb- civic platform is a -lrb- neo- -rrb- liberal party with a significant conservative wing .

" after two years of repeated crises , the polish people have now mobilized themselves to bring to an end to a chaotic campaign of shrugging off the country 's legacy of communism , an anticorruption battle worthy of an orwell novel and diplomatic posturings that have left the european union on the edge of a nervous breakdown . … it 's now up to the -lsb- civic platform -rsb- to reach out and repair the damage .
the party has already said its mission is to ' reestablish poland in the heart of europe ' - a declaration of intention received with caution by observers who remember that the conservative wing of this formation was , for a long time , on the same wave length as the kaczynski brothers . " austria 's die presse wrote : " as president and prime minister , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski stole … one thing from all of europe : time .
their election debacle gives us hope that the senseless blockades , historical blame games and embarrassing demands from warsaw will finally come to an end .

the study determined that the lack of specialists was " economically relevant " and that the problem was " putting the brakes on growth , " otremba added . he said the phenomenon was attributable to a structural problem in the german labor market .
the study found that the information and communication industry was particularly endangered because of the lack of specialists in mathematics and computer science .
" we are urgently searching for new workers , " august-wilhelm scheer , the president of bitkom , the federation representing the it , telecommunications and new media industry in germany , told reporters at a computer systems fair in munich on monday .
according to bitkom statistics , around 57 percent of information and communication enterprises needed more personnel while 62 percent admitted that their companies were suffering due to the lack of specialists .
the federation estimates that there are currently 30,000 to 40,000 free places in the it industry .
scheer called on german universities to train more specialists and to promote exceptional students to businesses , as well as for an increased effort to bring in highly-skilled foreigners .
" we need these highly-intelligent foreigners , " scheer said .
" they will help us secure our future . "
existing specialists may flee germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if businesses suffer , their specialists may leave he also warned that if those companies in germany who are lacking specialists did not find people to take the positions , then the enterprises would suffer and the specialists they did have would look for work outside germany .
the federal ministry for economic affairs , which commissioned the iw study , said that it was particularly concerned with the lack of highly-skilled specialists in the industries which are important for germany 's technological progress such as mechanical engineering , the metal and electrical industries and automotive construction .
the bad news is that the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better , with germany 's aging population exacerbating the problem in the future .
statistics show around 970,000 school leavers this year compared with around 800,000 first graders .
martin wansleben , the managing director of the german chamber of commerce and industry , told reporters that the numbers of jobs open to school leavers and qualified parents must be increased and that german institutions should increase their promotion of vocational training schemes .
he also added that more should be done to open up the job market for qualified foreigners . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move paves the way for porsche to take control of europe 's biggest carmaker . the european commission brought the case to the european court of justice in luxembourg , arguing that that the " volkswagen law " violates eu rules on the free movement of capital .
on tuesday , the court voted in favor of the commission and will now order germany to change the law . striking down the law allows porsche to raise its 31-percent stake to a majority .
porsche has made no secret of its desire to expand beyond its traditional luxury sports car market . commenting on the ruling , the company said it had secured enough options to let it " significantly " raise its holding in vw , but did not say whether these would be enough to gain majority control . " there is no decision on how we will proceed , " porsche spokesman frank gaube told reuters news agency in luxembourg . " we will take the decision to the supervisory board and this will be a decision for -lsb- them -rsb- , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of justice deemed the vw law illegal the german government said it accepted the court 's ruling .
" we will start the legislative procedure immediately in order to make the changes , " a spokesman for the german justice ministry told reuters . tight state control the " volkswagen law " was introduced in 1960 as the then state-owned vw , which was founded in the wake of world war ii , was being privatized .
originally , the state government of lower saxony and the federal government each held onto 20 percent of the shares -lrb- the federal government sold its stake in 1965 -rrb- . the crux of the " volkswagen law " is that regardless of the amount of capital it owns , a shareholder can not hold more than 20 percent of the voting rights in the company , making a company takeover impossible . the law also stipulates that lower saxony has the right to appoint two members to vw 's supervisory board , allowing them to block the majority needed to adopt resolutions . after porsche , lower saxony is the second-biggest investor in vw , with 20.3 percent of the capital . porsche takeover expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche has spent more than five billion euros since 2005 amassing its stake in vw porsche has long railed against the restriction on its voting rights . " to have 31 percent of the capital but only 20 percent of the voting rights is clearly discrimination , " said porsche 's chief executive wendelin wiedeking on the eve of the court decision . now that the court has ruled against the law , lower saxony has two choices .
it could either withdraw from vw , or raise its stake by five percent to 25 percent .
under german corporate law , a 25-percent share gives a shareholder a blocking veto . tuesday 's ruling is seen as a test case to establish the extent to which eu governments can protect companies they see as vital to their economy . for years , the european commission has fought to abolish such protectionist laws . similar action has either been taken or threatened by the european commission against spain over allegations it is protecting energy companies like endesa sa , against italy for blocking a takeover attempt of highways company autostrade spa , and against poland for hindering italy 's unicredit spa from consolidating its grip over a local bank . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european " blue card " will simplify entry requirements for highly skilled workers seeking employment in the 27-member bloc . the blue card is designed to attract professionals such as indian computer workers and chinese engineers , most of whom currently prefer to seek employment in the united states , australia or canada . " we are not good enough at attracting highly skilled people , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , who along with franco frattini , eu commissioner in charge of immigration issues , presented the blue card plan in strasbourg in tuesday . too few skilled foreigners according to frattini , highly skilled foreign workers make up 10 percent of the workforce in australia , and 3.5 percent in the us .
" in the eu it 's only 1.7 percent , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue card is named after the blue flag of the eu to qualify for a blue card , applicants would have to have a work contract , professional qualifications and a minimum salary level at least three times the level of existing minimum wages in that country , plus health insurance . in return , its holders would have the right to work across the 27-nation bloc in addition to access to social security , tax and housing benefits .
blue card holders would also be allowed to bring their families to join them within months of applying . the proposals also include special provisions for young professionals and seek to limit the extent to which companies can recruit skilled workers from developing countries that are suffering from so-called " brain drain . " overwhelming bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner franco frattini has been pushing strongly for the blue card according to the commission , member states should set up a simplified " one-stop-shop " system quickly granting white-collar workers a work permit . " in a market where there is increasing international competition for these workers , europe can only succeed in attracting ' the best and the brightest ' if it speaks with one voice , " the commission said in its draft proposal . the plan could do away with some 20 different national procedures within the eu that have proven complex and burdensome to those seeking residence and work permits . germany against proposal the european parliament endorsed the blue card scheme last month , but it still needs to gain approval from all 27 member states .
that could prove difficult , since several countries have already expressed their opposition to it . several countries feel immigration should remain an issue of national policy , and not be guided by brussels .

in germany , the federal government has already signalled it would reject the plan . the acting head of the parliamentary group of angela merkel 's christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , said on tuesday that germany was already competitive in attracting the best brains to its shores .
it was also important , he said , for germany do its utmost to requalify the some 3.5 million unemployed in the country . " we have to concentrate on getting these people into work , " bosbach said .
" -lrb- german people -rrb- would n't understand anything else . " this is despite rapidly growing demand for highly skilled workers in germany .

" we decisively reject these unfounded accusations , " an exterior ministry spokesperson said in beijing .
" we will apply for a clarification from the german government . " remberg told a conference on industrial espionage in berlin on monday that the nature and frequency of the attacks on german companies pointed to a concerted targeting by chinese hackers backed by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel addressed the cyber row on her visit to beijing " in our view , state chinese interests stand behind these digital attacks , " said remberg .
" supporting this view is the intensity , structure and scope of the attacks , and above all the targets , which include -lsb- german -rsb- authorities and companies . " remberg 's statements come barely two months after the german media reported incidents of cyber-spying at german government ministries by computer hackers believed to be linked to the chinese army .
the issue was raised by german chancellor angela merkel when she met chinese president wen jiabao in beijing in august .
china denied the allegations and said all " hacking " behavior was prohibited . since the german reports surfaced , other countries , including the united states and britain , have admitted that their own government agencies have been targeted by hackers backed by the chinese state .
the growing number of allegations thrown china 's way has prompted some to speculate whether a new front of warfare is beginning to open up between states , via the internet . chinese cyber-war theory addressed this belief was addressed by remberg at the berlin conference , but he refused to say whether he thought china 's use of spying technology was part of an internet-based international destabilization campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military secrets are needed to advance china 's forces " some people call this the chinese cyber war , " remberg said , adding that it was important to differentiate between legitimate attempts to gather information on competitors by chinese companies and state-led industrial espionage . however , he was less reticent when it came to his assertions that china was behind the increasing numbers of attempted and successful breaches of internet security in germany . " across the world the people 's republic of china is intensively gathering political , military , corporate-strategic and scientific information in order to bridge their technological gaps as quickly as possible , " remberg said . china 's interest in industrial and government secrets , remberg added , was driven by its desire to become a top global economic power .
to catch up with the west , china needed " a massive transfer of high technology , " he said . astonishing intensity of cyber-attacks on germany remberg astonished the berlin conference by revealing that attacks on german ministries and authorities were being discovered every other day and that the perpetrators appeared unconcerned that the attacks were being discovered .
" every one or two days , new attacks are detected , " he said . he also suggested that china was using classic espionage methods to launch its spy attacks , albeit with the latest technology .
traditional infiltration by agents still occurred , he said , but instead of the spies gaining access to government buildings in person , they now remotely accessed the information they needed from legitimate bases within germany via the internet . " the diplomatic representative offices and chinese media agencies in germany enable the hidden deployment of intelligence agents , " remberg said .
firms in joint ventures with chinese firms were also at risk , he added . spies of many nations after german secrets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spies from many nations are operating in germany as many experts have previously concluded , remberg also said he was sure that the chinese were not alone in hacking german sites .
" russian intelligence agencies are making great efforts in germany to get important information , using both open and conspiratorial methods , in military , political , economic and scientific areas , " he said . remberg also named iran , north korea , pakistan and syria as countries that had sent intelligence agents to germany to procure " dual-use " machinery - which can be used in both civil and military applications - and know-how for illegal weapons technology , including nuclear technology . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we decisively reject these unfounded accusations , " an exterior ministry spokesperson said in beijing .
" we will apply for a clarification from the german government . " remberg told a conference on industrial espionage in berlin on monday that the nature and frequency of the attacks on german companies pointed to a concerted targeting by chinese hackers backed by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel addressed the cyber row on her visit to beijing " in our view , state chinese interests stand behind these digital attacks , " said remberg .
" supporting this view is the intensity , structure and scope of the attacks , and above all the targets , which include -lsb- german -rsb- authorities and companies . " remberg 's statements come barely two months after the german media reported incidents of cyber-spying at german government ministries by computer hackers believed to be linked to the chinese army .
the issue was raised by german chancellor angela merkel when she met chinese president wen jiabao in beijing in august .
china denied the allegations and said all " hacking " behavior was prohibited . since the german reports surfaced , other countries , including the united states and britain , have admitted that their own government agencies have been targeted by hackers backed by the chinese state .
the growing number of allegations thrown china 's way has prompted some to speculate whether a new front of warfare is beginning to open up between states , via the internet . chinese cyber-war theory addressed this belief was addressed by remberg at the berlin conference , but he refused to say whether he thought china 's use of spying technology was part of an internet-based international destabilization campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military secrets are needed to advance china 's forces " some people call this the chinese cyber war , " remberg said , adding that it was important to differentiate between legitimate attempts to gather information on competitors by chinese companies and state-led industrial espionage . however , he was less reticent when it came to his assertions that china was behind the increasing numbers of attempted and successful breaches of internet security in germany . " across the world the people 's republic of china is intensively gathering political , military , corporate-strategic and scientific information in order to bridge their technological gaps as quickly as possible , " remberg said . china 's interest in industrial and government secrets , remberg added , was driven by its desire to become a top global economic power .
to catch up with the west , china needed " a massive transfer of high technology , " he said . astonishing intensity of cyber-attacks on germany remberg astonished the berlin conference by revealing that attacks on german ministries and authorities were being discovered every other day and that the perpetrators appeared unconcerned that the attacks were being discovered .
" every one or two days , new attacks are detected , " he said . he also suggested that china was using classic espionage methods to launch its spy attacks , albeit with the latest technology .
traditional infiltration by agents still occurred , he said , but instead of the spies gaining access to government buildings in person , they now remotely accessed the information they needed from legitimate bases within germany via the internet . " the diplomatic representative offices and chinese media agencies in germany enable the hidden deployment of intelligence agents , " remberg said .
firms in joint ventures with chinese firms were also at risk , he added . spies of many nations after german secrets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spies from many nations are operating in germany as many experts have previously concluded , remberg also said he was sure that the chinese were not alone in hacking german sites .
" russian intelligence agencies are making great efforts in germany to get important information , using both open and conspiratorial methods , in military , political , economic and scientific areas , " he said . remberg also named iran , north korea , pakistan and syria as countries that had sent intelligence agents to germany to procure " dual-use " machinery - which can be used in both civil and military applications - and know-how for illegal weapons technology , including nuclear technology . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move paves the way for porsche to take control of europe 's biggest carmaker . the european commission brought the case to the european court of justice in luxembourg , arguing that that the " volkswagen law " violates eu rules on the free movement of capital .
on tuesday , the court voted in favor of the commission and will now order germany to change the law . striking down the law allows porsche to raise its 31-percent stake to a majority .
porsche has made no secret of its desire to expand beyond its traditional luxury sports car market . commenting on the ruling , the company said it had secured enough options to let it " significantly " raise its holding in vw , but did not say whether these would be enough to gain majority control . " there is no decision on how we will proceed , " porsche spokesman frank gaube told reuters news agency in luxembourg . " we will take the decision to the supervisory board and this will be a decision for -lsb- them -rsb- , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of justice deemed the vw law illegal the german government said it accepted the court 's ruling .

originally , the state government of lower saxony and the federal government each held onto 20 percent of the shares -lrb- the federal government sold its stake in 1965 -rrb- . the crux of the " volkswagen law " is that regardless of the amount of capital it owns , a shareholder can not hold more than 20 percent of the voting rights in the company , making a company takeover impossible . the law also stipulates that lower saxony has the right to appoint two members to vw 's supervisory board , allowing them to block the majority needed to adopt resolutions . after porsche , lower saxony is the second-biggest investor in vw , with 20.3 percent of the capital . porsche takeover expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche has spent more than five billion euros since 2005 amassing its stake in vw porsche has long railed against the restriction on its voting rights . " to have 31 percent of the capital but only 20 percent of the voting rights is clearly discrimination , " said porsche 's chief executive wendelin wiedeking on the eve of the court decision . now that the court has ruled against the law , lower saxony has two choices .
it could either withdraw from vw , or raise its stake by five percent to 25 percent .
under german corporate law , a 25-percent share gives a shareholder a blocking veto . tuesday 's ruling is seen as a test case to establish the extent to which eu governments can protect companies they see as vital to their economy . for years , the european commission has fought to abolish such protectionist laws . similar action has either been taken or threatened by the european commission against spain over allegations it is protecting energy companies like endesa sa , against italy for blocking a takeover attempt of highways company autostrade spa , and against poland for hindering italy 's unicredit spa from consolidating its grip over a local bank . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it could have been so easy for the nationalist conservative kaczynski to win .
his country is currently experiencing … its most fortunate , happiest time in 300 years .
that he did not take advantage of this unique opportunity goes to show what a poor take on reality he has .
but he viewed himself as more than a ' mere ' politician ; he considered himself more a revolutionary who claimed the moral authority to bend the constitutional state at will and to disregard the conventions of democracy , " the paper wrote . switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung expressed similar sentiments .
" the government not only lost the election because it was confronted with an ' exemplary , comprehensive attack front , ' but also because many polish people were tired of the prime minister 's aggressive , confrontational manner .
in addition , the government 's record was nothing to brag about .
it slid from one domestic crisis into another .
it hardly contributed to the current economic boom in the country and missed the chance to tackle the required reforms .

" it could have been so easy for the nationalist conservative kaczynski to win .
his country is currently experiencing … its most fortunate , happiest time in 300 years .
that he did not take advantage of this unique opportunity goes to show what a poor take on reality he has .
but he viewed himself as more than a ' mere ' politician ; he considered himself more a revolutionary who claimed the moral authority to bend the constitutional state at will and to disregard the conventions of democracy , " the paper wrote . switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung expressed similar sentiments .
" the government not only lost the election because it was confronted with an ' exemplary , comprehensive attack front , ' but also because many polish people were tired of the prime minister 's aggressive , confrontational manner .
in addition , the government 's record was nothing to brag about .
it slid from one domestic crisis into another .
it hardly contributed to the current economic boom in the country and missed the chance to tackle the required reforms .
kaczynski 's government was wrought with scandals , staff suspensions , resignations , allegations , and tactical confusion .
his government stirred up a lot of dust , but did not accomplish much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski lost overwhelmingly the german business paper handelsblatt from düsseldorf looked ahead : " poland is going to need a little time to shed its historical sensitivities , overcome the burdens of transformation and truly become a part of europe .
we should give this country that chance and remain patient - particularly those of us in germany .
we have a historical responsibility toward poland , and we are benefiting tremendously from its integration .
this process will likely go faster with donald tusk at the helm .
it will , in any case , be more pleasant , " the paper noted . the dutch paper de volkskrant took a pragmatic view of poland 's election results .
" it would be a misconception to think that the mood will change completely in the country .
patriotic sentiments are and will remain intense .
warsaw will not suddenly start greeting brussels warmly .
-lsb- tusk 's -rsb- civic platform is a -lrb- neo- -rrb- liberal party with a significant conservative wing .
in addition , president lech kaczynski -lsb- jaroslaw 's twin brother -rsb- is in office until 2010 .
he can to block proposed legislation with his presidential veto power .
while it 's possible to override a veto with a three-fifths majority , frequent repeats could lead to a form of static warfare .
then , poland would be jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski -lrb- jaroslaw 's twin -rrb- is to remain in office until 2010 france 's le figaro was also hesitant to believe poland 's ties with europe would improve overnight .
" after two years of repeated crises , the polish people have now mobilized themselves to bring to an end to a chaotic campaign of shrugging off the country 's legacy of communism , an anticorruption battle worthy of an orwell novel and diplomatic posturings that have left the european union on the edge of a nervous breakdown . … it 's now up to the -lsb- civic platform -rsb- to reach out and repair the damage .
the party has already said its mission is to ' reestablish poland in the heart of europe ' - a declaration of intention received with caution by observers who remember that the conservative wing of this formation was , for a long time , on the same wave length as the kaczynski brothers .

with this upcoming trilateral meeting between the chinese foreign minister yang jiechi , india ’ s external affairs minister pranab mukherjee and their russian counterpart sergei lavrov in china ’ s north eastern city of harbin , a fresh round of dialogue will commence .
professor ajay patnayak , an expert on russian affairs at jawahar lal nehru university in new delhi , explained that the meeting was significant because " china is an emerging power , a neighbour with which india has some border problems " .
he added it would be " good for india to have good neighbourly ties with china " and explained that russia was an old strategic ally for india .
" they share certain common perceptions in central asia and south asia . "
issues of common concern liu jianchao , the chinese foreign ministry spokesman , hinted the focus would be on exchanging views about major international and regional " issues of common concern " .
professor patnayak explained that one of these issues would be terrorism .
" there are small pockets of terrorism both in china and in india , and also in russia and its neighbourhood , which are threatening their regional stability . "
he said they would also discuss the " multi-polar world order , with no power centres " .
energy-hungry the three sides will also explore further co-operation in various fields , including trade , infrastructure , health , it and biotechnology and especially energy .
energy-hungry india and china have in the past expressed an interest in russia 's rich oil and gas reserves .
" russia is the number one supplier of energy , gas and coal .
and russia has possibilities to supply energy to both china and to india .
we see that chinese and indian companies have already begun to explore certain fields in siberia and sakhalin , " explained yevgenii kozhokin , the director of the russian institute of strategic studies in moscow .
counterbalance to us ?
every time the three sides come together for talks , observers speculate that the meetings are aimed at forming an alliance to counter the influence of the united states in the region .
however , professor kozhokin ruled out such notions : " i don ’ t think the three ministers are thinking of confrontation with the us .
i think they have a positive agenda .
all these countries have good ties with the us .
so i don ’ t think they are trying to block the hegemony of the us . "
professor patnayak from india agrees only to a certain extent : " they wo n't build this up as a forum against the us , but in the long-term perspective , they would like to strengthen their position and limit outside interference , and they would like to solve their problems by co-operating among themselves . "
the talks will last until friday .

the move paves the way for porsche to take control of europe 's biggest carmaker . the european commission brought the case to the european court of justice in luxembourg , arguing that that the " volkswagen law " violates eu rules on the free movement of capital .
on tuesday , the court voted in favor of the commission and will now order germany to change the law . striking down the law allows porsche to raise its 31-percent stake to a majority .
porsche has made no secret of its desire to expand beyond its traditional luxury sports car market . commenting on the ruling , the company said it had secured enough options to let it " significantly " raise its holding in vw , but did not say whether these would be enough to gain majority control . " there is no decision on how we will proceed , " porsche spokesman frank gaube told reuters news agency in luxembourg . " we will take the decision to the supervisory board and this will be a decision for -lsb- them -rsb- , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of justice deemed the vw law illegal the german government said it accepted the court 's ruling .
" we will start the legislative procedure immediately in order to make the changes , " a spokesman for the german justice ministry told reuters . tight state control the " volkswagen law " was introduced in 1960 as the then state-owned vw , which was founded in the wake of world war ii , was being privatized .
originally , the state government of lower saxony and the federal government each held onto 20 percent of the shares -lrb- the federal government sold its stake in 1965 -rrb- . the crux of the " volkswagen law " is that regardless of the amount of capital it owns , a shareholder can not hold more than 20 percent of the voting rights in the company , making a company takeover impossible . the law also stipulates that lower saxony has the right to appoint two members to vw 's supervisory board , allowing them to block the majority needed to adopt resolutions . after porsche , lower saxony is the second-biggest investor in vw , with 20.3 percent of the capital . porsche takeover expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche has spent more than five billion euros since 2005 amassing its stake in vw porsche has long railed against the restriction on its voting rights . " to have 31 percent of the capital but only 20 percent of the voting rights is clearly discrimination , " said porsche 's chief executive wendelin wiedeking on the eve of the court decision . now that the court has ruled against the law , lower saxony has two choices .
it could either withdraw from vw , or raise its stake by five percent to 25 percent .
under german corporate law , a 25-percent share gives a shareholder a blocking veto . tuesday 's ruling is seen as a test case to establish the extent to which eu governments can protect companies they see as vital to their economy . for years , the european commission has fought to abolish such protectionist laws . similar action has either been taken or threatened by the european commission against spain over allegations it is protecting energy companies like endesa sa , against italy for blocking a takeover attempt of highways company autostrade spa , and against poland for hindering italy 's unicredit spa from consolidating its grip over a local bank . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we decisively reject these unfounded accusations , " an exterior ministry spokesperson said in beijing .
" we will apply for a clarification from the german government . " remberg told a conference on industrial espionage in berlin on monday that the nature and frequency of the attacks on german companies pointed to a concerted targeting by chinese hackers backed by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel addressed the cyber row on her visit to beijing " in our view , state chinese interests stand behind these digital attacks , " said remberg .
" supporting this view is the intensity , structure and scope of the attacks , and above all the targets , which include -lsb- german -rsb- authorities and companies . " remberg 's statements come barely two months after the german media reported incidents of cyber-spying at german government ministries by computer hackers believed to be linked to the chinese army .
the issue was raised by german chancellor angela merkel when she met chinese president wen jiabao in beijing in august .
china denied the allegations and said all " hacking " behavior was prohibited . since the german reports surfaced , other countries , including the united states and britain , have admitted that their own government agencies have been targeted by hackers backed by the chinese state .
the growing number of allegations thrown china 's way has prompted some to speculate whether a new front of warfare is beginning to open up between states , via the internet . chinese cyber-war theory addressed this belief was addressed by remberg at the berlin conference , but he refused to say whether he thought china 's use of spying technology was part of an internet-based international destabilization campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military secrets are needed to advance china 's forces " some people call this the chinese cyber war , " remberg said , adding that it was important to differentiate between legitimate attempts to gather information on competitors by chinese companies and state-led industrial espionage . however , he was less reticent when it came to his assertions that china was behind the increasing numbers of attempted and successful breaches of internet security in germany . " across the world the people 's republic of china is intensively gathering political , military , corporate-strategic and scientific information in order to bridge their technological gaps as quickly as possible , " remberg said . china 's interest in industrial and government secrets , remberg added , was driven by its desire to become a top global economic power .
to catch up with the west , china needed " a massive transfer of high technology , " he said . astonishing intensity of cyber-attacks on germany remberg astonished the berlin conference by revealing that attacks on german ministries and authorities were being discovered every other day and that the perpetrators appeared unconcerned that the attacks were being discovered .
" every one or two days , new attacks are detected , " he said . he also suggested that china was using classic espionage methods to launch its spy attacks , albeit with the latest technology .
traditional infiltration by agents still occurred , he said , but instead of the spies gaining access to government buildings in person , they now remotely accessed the information they needed from legitimate bases within germany via the internet . " the diplomatic representative offices and chinese media agencies in germany enable the hidden deployment of intelligence agents , " remberg said .
firms in joint ventures with chinese firms were also at risk , he added . spies of many nations after german secrets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spies from many nations are operating in germany as many experts have previously concluded , remberg also said he was sure that the chinese were not alone in hacking german sites .
" russian intelligence agencies are making great efforts in germany to get important information , using both open and conspiratorial methods , in military , political , economic and scientific areas , " he said . remberg also named iran , north korea , pakistan and syria as countries that had sent intelligence agents to germany to procure " dual-use " machinery - which can be used in both civil and military applications - and know-how for illegal weapons technology , including nuclear technology . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move paves the way for porsche to take control of europe 's biggest carmaker . the european commission brought the case to the european court of justice in luxembourg , arguing that that the " volkswagen law " violates eu rules on the free movement of capital .
on tuesday , the court voted in favor of the commission and will now order germany to change the law . striking down the law allows porsche to raise its 31-percent stake to a majority .
porsche has made no secret of its desire to expand beyond its traditional luxury sports car market . commenting on the ruling , the company said it had secured enough options to let it " significantly " raise its holding in vw , but did not say whether these would be enough to gain majority control . " there is no decision on how we will proceed , " porsche spokesman frank gaube told reuters news agency in luxembourg . " we will take the decision to the supervisory board and this will be a decision for -lsb- them -rsb- , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of justice deemed the vw law illegal the german government said it accepted the court 's ruling .
" we will start the legislative procedure immediately in order to make the changes , " a spokesman for the german justice ministry told reuters . tight state control the " volkswagen law " was introduced in 1960 as the then state-owned vw , which was founded in the wake of world war ii , was being privatized .
originally , the state government of lower saxony and the federal government each held onto 20 percent of the shares -lrb- the federal government sold its stake in 1965 -rrb- . the crux of the " volkswagen law " is that regardless of the amount of capital it owns , a shareholder can not hold more than 20 percent of the voting rights in the company , making a company takeover impossible . the law also stipulates that lower saxony has the right to appoint two members to vw 's supervisory board , allowing them to block the majority needed to adopt resolutions . after porsche , lower saxony is the second-biggest investor in vw , with 20.3 percent of the capital . porsche takeover expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche has spent more than five billion euros since 2005 amassing its stake in vw porsche has long railed against the restriction on its voting rights . " to have 31 percent of the capital but only 20 percent of the voting rights is clearly discrimination , " said porsche 's chief executive wendelin wiedeking on the eve of the court decision . now that the court has ruled against the law , lower saxony has two choices .
it could either withdraw from vw , or raise its stake by five percent to 25 percent .
under german corporate law , a 25-percent share gives a shareholder a blocking veto . tuesday 's ruling is seen as a test case to establish the extent to which eu governments can protect companies they see as vital to their economy . for years , the european commission has fought to abolish such protectionist laws . similar action has either been taken or threatened by the european commission against spain over allegations it is protecting energy companies like endesa sa , against italy for blocking a takeover attempt of highways company autostrade spa , and against poland for hindering italy 's unicredit spa from consolidating its grip over a local bank . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move paves the way for porsche to take control of europe 's biggest carmaker . the european commission brought the case to the european court of justice in luxembourg , arguing that that the " volkswagen law " violates eu rules on the free movement of capital .
on tuesday , the court voted in favor of the commission and will now order germany to change the law . striking down the law allows porsche to raise its 31-percent stake to a majority .
porsche has made no secret of its desire to expand beyond its traditional luxury sports car market . commenting on the ruling , the company said it had secured enough options to let it " significantly " raise its holding in vw , but did not say whether these would be enough to gain majority control . " there is no decision on how we will proceed , " porsche spokesman frank gaube told reuters news agency in luxembourg . " we will take the decision to the supervisory board and this will be a decision for -lsb- them -rsb- , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of justice deemed the vw law illegal the german government said it accepted the court 's ruling .
" we will start the legislative procedure immediately in order to make the changes , " a spokesman for the german justice ministry told reuters . tight state control the " volkswagen law " was introduced in 1960 as the then state-owned vw , which was founded in the wake of world war ii , was being privatized .
originally , the state government of lower saxony and the federal government each held onto 20 percent of the shares -lrb- the federal government sold its stake in 1965 -rrb- . the crux of the " volkswagen law " is that regardless of the amount of capital it owns , a shareholder can not hold more than 20 percent of the voting rights in the company , making a company takeover impossible . the law also stipulates that lower saxony has the right to appoint two members to vw 's supervisory board , allowing them to block the majority needed to adopt resolutions . after porsche , lower saxony is the second-biggest investor in vw , with 20.3 percent of the capital . porsche takeover expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche has spent more than five billion euros since 2005 amassing its stake in vw porsche has long railed against the restriction on its voting rights . " to have 31 percent of the capital but only 20 percent of the voting rights is clearly discrimination , " said porsche 's chief executive wendelin wiedeking on the eve of the court decision . now that the court has ruled against the law , lower saxony has two choices .
it could either withdraw from vw , or raise its stake by five percent to 25 percent .
under german corporate law , a 25-percent share gives a shareholder a blocking veto . tuesday 's ruling is seen as a test case to establish the extent to which eu governments can protect companies they see as vital to their economy . for years , the european commission has fought to abolish such protectionist laws . similar action has either been taken or threatened by the european commission against spain over allegations it is protecting energy companies like endesa sa , against italy for blocking a takeover attempt of highways company autostrade spa , and against poland for hindering italy 's unicredit spa from consolidating its grip over a local bank . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the study determined that the lack of specialists was " economically relevant " and that the problem was " putting the brakes on growth , " otremba added . he said the phenomenon was attributable to a structural problem in the german labor market .
the study found that the information and communication industry was particularly endangered because of the lack of specialists in mathematics and computer science .
" we are urgently searching for new workers , " august-wilhelm scheer , the president of bitkom , the federation representing the it , telecommunications and new media industry in germany , told reporters at a computer systems fair in munich on monday .
according to bitkom statistics , around 57 percent of information and communication enterprises needed more personnel while 62 percent admitted that their companies were suffering due to the lack of specialists .
the federation estimates that there are currently 30,000 to 40,000 free places in the it industry .
scheer called on german universities to train more specialists and to promote exceptional students to businesses , as well as for an increased effort to bring in highly-skilled foreigners .
" we need these highly-intelligent foreigners , " scheer said .
" they will help us secure our future . "
existing specialists may flee germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if businesses suffer , their specialists may leave he also warned that if those companies in germany who are lacking specialists did not find people to take the positions , then the enterprises would suffer and the specialists they did have would look for work outside germany .
the federal ministry for economic affairs , which commissioned the iw study , said that it was particularly concerned with the lack of highly-skilled specialists in the industries which are important for germany 's technological progress such as mechanical engineering , the metal and electrical industries and automotive construction .
the bad news is that the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better , with germany 's aging population exacerbating the problem in the future .
statistics show around 970,000 school leavers this year compared with around 800,000 first graders .
martin wansleben , the managing director of the german chamber of commerce and industry , told reporters that the numbers of jobs open to school leavers and qualified parents must be increased and that german institutions should increase their promotion of vocational training schemes .
he also added that more should be done to open up the job market for qualified foreigners . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european " blue card " will simplify entry requirements for highly skilled workers seeking employment in the 27-member bloc . the blue card is designed to attract professionals such as indian computer workers and chinese engineers , most of whom currently prefer to seek employment in the united states , australia or canada . " we are not good enough at attracting highly skilled people , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , who along with franco frattini , eu commissioner in charge of immigration issues , presented the blue card plan in strasbourg in tuesday . too few skilled foreigners according to frattini , highly skilled foreign workers make up 10 percent of the workforce in australia , and 3.5 percent in the us .
" in the eu it 's only 1.7 percent , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue card is named after the blue flag of the eu to qualify for a blue card , applicants would have to have a work contract , professional qualifications and a minimum salary level at least three times the level of existing minimum wages in that country , plus health insurance . in return , its holders would have the right to work across the 27-nation bloc in addition to access to social security , tax and housing benefits .
blue card holders would also be allowed to bring their families to join them within months of applying . the proposals also include special provisions for young professionals and seek to limit the extent to which companies can recruit skilled workers from developing countries that are suffering from so-called " brain drain . " overwhelming bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner franco frattini has been pushing strongly for the blue card according to the commission , member states should set up a simplified " one-stop-shop " system quickly granting white-collar workers a work permit .

that could prove difficult , since several countries have already expressed their opposition to it . several countries feel immigration should remain an issue of national policy , and not be guided by brussels .

23 , for an eu-wide work permit .
the european " blue card " will simplify entry requirements for highly skilled workers seeking employment in the 27-member bloc . the blue card is designed to attract professionals such as indian computer workers and chinese engineers , most of whom currently prefer to seek employment in the united states , australia or canada . " we are not good enough at attracting highly skilled people , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , who along with franco frattini , eu commissioner in charge of immigration issues , presented the blue card plan in strasbourg in tuesday . too few skilled foreigners according to frattini , highly skilled foreign workers make up 10 percent of the workforce in australia , and 3.5 percent in the us .
" in the eu it 's only 1.7 percent , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue card is named after the blue flag of the eu to qualify for a blue card , applicants would have to have a work contract , professional qualifications and a minimum salary level at least three times the level of existing minimum wages in that country , plus health insurance . in return , its holders would have the right to work across the 27-nation bloc in addition to access to social security , tax and housing benefits .
blue card holders would also be allowed to bring their families to join them within months of applying . the proposals also include special provisions for young professionals and seek to limit the extent to which companies can recruit skilled workers from developing countries that are suffering from so-called " brain drain . " overwhelming bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner franco frattini has been pushing strongly for the blue card according to the commission , member states should set up a simplified " one-stop-shop " system quickly granting white-collar workers a work permit . " in a market where there is increasing international competition for these workers , europe can only succeed in attracting ' the best and the brightest ' if it speaks with one voice , " the commission said in its draft proposal . the plan could do away with some 20 different national procedures within the eu that have proven complex and burdensome to those seeking residence and work permits . germany against proposal the european parliament endorsed the blue card scheme last month , but it still needs to gain approval from all 27 member states .
that could prove difficult , since several countries have already expressed their opposition to it . several countries feel immigration should remain an issue of national policy , and not be guided by brussels .
some unions feel that in influx of foreign workers could undercut salaries and labor rights of europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany lacks workers in engineering and the metal , electrical and automotive industries the proposed program is expected to face a particularly rough ride in countries such austria and the netherlands .
in germany , the federal government has already signalled it would reject the plan . the acting head of the parliamentary group of angela merkel 's christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , said on tuesday that germany was already competitive in attracting the best brains to its shores .
it was also important , he said , for germany do its utmost to requalify the some 3.5 million unemployed in the country . " we have to concentrate on getting these people into work , " bosbach said .

" we decisively reject these unfounded accusations , " an exterior ministry spokesperson said in beijing .
" we will apply for a clarification from the german government . " remberg told a conference on industrial espionage in berlin on monday that the nature and frequency of the attacks on german companies pointed to a concerted targeting by chinese hackers backed by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel addressed the cyber row on her visit to beijing " in our view , state chinese interests stand behind these digital attacks , " said remberg .
" supporting this view is the intensity , structure and scope of the attacks , and above all the targets , which include -lsb- german -rsb- authorities and companies . " remberg 's statements come barely two months after the german media reported incidents of cyber-spying at german government ministries by computer hackers believed to be linked to the chinese army .
the issue was raised by german chancellor angela merkel when she met chinese president wen jiabao in beijing in august .
china denied the allegations and said all " hacking " behavior was prohibited . since the german reports surfaced , other countries , including the united states and britain , have admitted that their own government agencies have been targeted by hackers backed by the chinese state .
the growing number of allegations thrown china 's way has prompted some to speculate whether a new front of warfare is beginning to open up between states , via the internet . chinese cyber-war theory addressed this belief was addressed by remberg at the berlin conference , but he refused to say whether he thought china 's use of spying technology was part of an internet-based international destabilization campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military secrets are needed to advance china 's forces " some people call this the chinese cyber war , " remberg said , adding that it was important to differentiate between legitimate attempts to gather information on competitors by chinese companies and state-led industrial espionage . however , he was less reticent when it came to his assertions that china was behind the increasing numbers of attempted and successful breaches of internet security in germany . " across the world the people 's republic of china is intensively gathering political , military , corporate-strategic and scientific information in order to bridge their technological gaps as quickly as possible , " remberg said . china 's interest in industrial and government secrets , remberg added , was driven by its desire to become a top global economic power .
to catch up with the west , china needed " a massive transfer of high technology , " he said . astonishing intensity of cyber-attacks on germany remberg astonished the berlin conference by revealing that attacks on german ministries and authorities were being discovered every other day and that the perpetrators appeared unconcerned that the attacks were being discovered .
" every one or two days , new attacks are detected , " he said . he also suggested that china was using classic espionage methods to launch its spy attacks , albeit with the latest technology .
traditional infiltration by agents still occurred , he said , but instead of the spies gaining access to government buildings in person , they now remotely accessed the information they needed from legitimate bases within germany via the internet . " the diplomatic representative offices and chinese media agencies in germany enable the hidden deployment of intelligence agents , " remberg said .
firms in joint ventures with chinese firms were also at risk , he added . spies of many nations after german secrets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spies from many nations are operating in germany as many experts have previously concluded , remberg also said he was sure that the chinese were not alone in hacking german sites .
" russian intelligence agencies are making great efforts in germany to get important information , using both open and conspiratorial methods , in military , political , economic and scientific areas , " he said . remberg also named iran , north korea , pakistan and syria as countries that had sent intelligence agents to germany to procure " dual-use " machinery - which can be used in both civil and military applications - and know-how for illegal weapons technology , including nuclear technology . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heuersdorf church is making way for a new mine for a church to physically be uprooted and moved , there has to be a pretty good reason and while a lack of congregation may be a good argument , it is not usually enough to justify moving something which weighs a fair few tons .
the reason behind the relocation of the heuersdorf church has as much to do with commerce as it does with spreading the word .
mining company footing the bill the 660-ton stone church is being moved because it was sitting on extensive deposits of lignite , or brown coal , a fuel used in power generation plants .
after an extensive legal battle with the mibrag mining company , the church and 59 residents of the village will be moved 12 kilometers -lrb- 7.5 miles -rrb- to land near leipzig in eastern germany .
the church 's journey to its new home will begin on wednesday .
the 750-year-old church , complete with tiled bell tower , was separated from its foundations and lifted 1.5 meters -lrb- five feet -rrb- onto a massive rolling platform on monday .
the painstakingly slow journey to the village of borna is expected to take about a week at a cost of three million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- .

" this is a new and historic step in the fight against doping , " pat mcquaid told reporters on tuesday from paris , where he was attending the second day of a two-day international meeting on doping in cycling . the " biological passport , " which was first announced by uci last week , would monitor a series of blood parameters of a rider , creating a medical profile that could be compared to the results of anti-doping tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping scandals continually rock the tour de france mcquaid cautioned that the initiative , set to take effect in january , will not cure cycling 's doping problem but will serve as a new element in the anti-doping " arsenal " along with blood and urine tests . " for each rider , you 'll have an individual set of parameters that are his norm ... his blood parameters .
there is a norm and above and below , it can only go a certain distance , " mcquaid said . " if you see that during the tests the number goes above the norm , then you know he 's done something , that he 's manipulated something and it 's not a natural occurrence , " he added . mcquaid urged all parties to help set up a working group as quickly as possible in order to be able to start the project on time . " if everybody stays will be us - riders , teams , organizers and media together we can build a better future for this sport , " he said . increased doping controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uci has promised more out of competition controls uci anti-doping manager anne gripper said the organization hopes to increase the number of tests taken out of competition .
the uci will have conducted about 1,500 doping tests out of competition in 2007 , she said , a figure that should rise to about 8,000 next year . the director general of the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- , david howman , also praised the passport , in a new show of unity after recent high-profile disputes between the two organizations who have variously pointed fingers over who deserves blame for the doping scandals that have battered cycling . wada and the uci were to sign an agreement later tuesday creating a working group to flesh out the details of the biological passports in time for a january launch . the meeting was organized by french health and sports minister roselyne bachelot in an effort to parry some of the fallout from the tour de france . " the first thing i 'm expecting is to show how cycling can be at the forefront - voluntarily - in this area , and rebuild the image " of the sport , bachelot said in the lead-up to the event .
" we want to make this summit a sort of pilot project for the fight against doping , which will be useful for the entire sports world . " annus horribilis cheating has dogged cycling for years , but this year more than most . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floyd landis has appealed against loosing his 2006 tour de france title the season started off with confessions by former cycling star bjarne riis and a half-dozen riders from the german team t-mobile , who admitted to using the blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- , during the 1990s . then , at this year 's tour de france , race leader michael rasmussen was sacked by his rabobank team for allegedly lying about his training program , while pre-race favorite kazakh alexandre vinokourov was kicked out of the event along with his astana team after testing positive for a banned blood transfusion . to cap it off , last month , 2006 tour winner floyd landis was stripped of his title after testing positive for elevated levels of testosterone . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are not good enough at attracting highly skilled people , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , who along with franco frattini , eu commissioner in charge of immigration issues , presented the blue card plan in strasbourg in tuesday . too few skilled foreigners according to frattini , highly skilled foreign workers make up 10 percent of the workforce in australia , and 3.5 percent in the us .

" we are not good enough at attracting highly skilled people , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , who along with franco frattini , eu commissioner in charge of immigration issues , presented the blue card plan in strasbourg in tuesday . too few skilled foreigners according to frattini , highly skilled foreign workers make up 10 percent of the workforce in australia , and 3.5 percent in the us .

" we decisively reject these unfounded accusations , " an exterior ministry spokesperson said in beijing .
" we will apply for a clarification from the german government . " remberg told a conference on industrial espionage in berlin on monday that the nature and frequency of the attacks on german companies pointed to a concerted targeting by chinese hackers backed by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel addressed the cyber row on her visit to beijing " in our view , state chinese interests stand behind these digital attacks , " said remberg .
" supporting this view is the intensity , structure and scope of the attacks , and above all the targets , which include -lsb- german -rsb- authorities and companies . " remberg 's statements come barely two months after the german media reported incidents of cyber-spying at german government ministries by computer hackers believed to be linked to the chinese army .
the issue was raised by german chancellor angela merkel when she met chinese president wen jiabao in beijing in august .
china denied the allegations and said all " hacking " behavior was prohibited . since the german reports surfaced , other countries , including the united states and britain , have admitted that their own government agencies have been targeted by hackers backed by the chinese state .
the growing number of allegations thrown china 's way has prompted some to speculate whether a new front of warfare is beginning to open up between states , via the internet . chinese cyber-war theory addressed this belief was addressed by remberg at the berlin conference , but he refused to say whether he thought china 's use of spying technology was part of an internet-based international destabilization campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military secrets are needed to advance china 's forces " some people call this the chinese cyber war , " remberg said , adding that it was important to differentiate between legitimate attempts to gather information on competitors by chinese companies and state-led industrial espionage . however , he was less reticent when it came to his assertions that china was behind the increasing numbers of attempted and successful breaches of internet security in germany . " across the world the people 's republic of china is intensively gathering political , military , corporate-strategic and scientific information in order to bridge their technological gaps as quickly as possible , " remberg said . china 's interest in industrial and government secrets , remberg added , was driven by its desire to become a top global economic power .
to catch up with the west , china needed " a massive transfer of high technology , " he said . astonishing intensity of cyber-attacks on germany remberg astonished the berlin conference by revealing that attacks on german ministries and authorities were being discovered every other day and that the perpetrators appeared unconcerned that the attacks were being discovered .
" every one or two days , new attacks are detected , " he said . he also suggested that china was using classic espionage methods to launch its spy attacks , albeit with the latest technology .
traditional infiltration by agents still occurred , he said , but instead of the spies gaining access to government buildings in person , they now remotely accessed the information they needed from legitimate bases within germany via the internet . " the diplomatic representative offices and chinese media agencies in germany enable the hidden deployment of intelligence agents , " remberg said .
firms in joint ventures with chinese firms were also at risk , he added . spies of many nations after german secrets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spies from many nations are operating in germany as many experts have previously concluded , remberg also said he was sure that the chinese were not alone in hacking german sites .
" russian intelligence agencies are making great efforts in germany to get important information , using both open and conspiratorial methods , in military , political , economic and scientific areas , " he said . remberg also named iran , north korea , pakistan and syria as countries that had sent intelligence agents to germany to procure " dual-use " machinery - which can be used in both civil and military applications - and know-how for illegal weapons technology , including nuclear technology . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" remberg 's statements come barely two months after the german media reported incidents of cyber-spying at german government ministries by computer hackers believed to be linked to the chinese army .
the issue was raised by german chancellor angela merkel when she met chinese president wen jiabao in beijing in august .
china denied the allegations and said all " hacking " behavior was prohibited . since the german reports surfaced , other countries , including the united states and britain , have admitted that their own government agencies have been targeted by hackers backed by the chinese state .
the growing number of allegations thrown china 's way has prompted some to speculate whether a new front of warfare is beginning to open up between states , via the internet . chinese cyber-war theory addressed this belief was addressed by remberg at the berlin conference , but he refused to say whether he thought china 's use of spying technology was part of an internet-based international destabilization campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military secrets are needed to advance china 's forces " some people call this the chinese cyber war , " remberg said , adding that it was important to differentiate between legitimate attempts to gather information on competitors by chinese companies and state-led industrial espionage . however , he was less reticent when it came to his assertions that china was behind the increasing numbers of attempted and successful breaches of internet security in germany . " across the world the people 's republic of china is intensively gathering political , military , corporate-strategic and scientific information in order to bridge their technological gaps as quickly as possible , " remberg said . china 's interest in industrial and government secrets , remberg added , was driven by its desire to become a top global economic power .
to catch up with the west , china needed " a massive transfer of high technology , " he said . astonishing intensity of cyber-attacks on germany remberg astonished the berlin conference by revealing that attacks on german ministries and authorities were being discovered every other day and that the perpetrators appeared unconcerned that the attacks were being discovered .
" every one or two days , new attacks are detected , " he said . he also suggested that china was using classic espionage methods to launch its spy attacks , albeit with the latest technology .
traditional infiltration by agents still occurred , he said , but instead of the spies gaining access to government buildings in person , they now remotely accessed the information they needed from legitimate bases within germany via the internet . " the diplomatic representative offices and chinese media agencies in germany enable the hidden deployment of intelligence agents , " remberg said .

" russian intelligence agencies are making great efforts in germany to get important information , using both open and conspiratorial methods , in military , political , economic and scientific areas , " he said . remberg also named iran , north korea , pakistan and syria as countries that had sent intelligence agents to germany to procure " dual-use " machinery - which can be used in both civil and military applications - and know-how for illegal weapons technology , including nuclear technology . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 23.10.2007 european papers applaud polish election results großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civic platform leader donald tusk celebrates his victory after snap elections following the victory of poland 's pro-europe civic platform party led by donald tusk , many european papers are calling for patience as the nation moves out of the grips of euroskeptic prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . berlin 's die welt took a look back at jaroslaw kaczynski 's track record to explain the results of the election .
" it could have been so easy for the nationalist conservative kaczynski to win .
his country is currently experiencing … its most fortunate , happiest time in 300 years .
that he did not take advantage of this unique opportunity goes to show what a poor take on reality he has .
but he viewed himself as more than a ' mere ' politician ; he considered himself more a revolutionary who claimed the moral authority to bend the constitutional state at will and to disregard the conventions of democracy , " the paper wrote . switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung expressed similar sentiments .
" the government not only lost the election because it was confronted with an ' exemplary , comprehensive attack front , ' but also because many polish people were tired of the prime minister 's aggressive , confrontational manner .
in addition , the government 's record was nothing to brag about .
it slid from one domestic crisis into another .
it hardly contributed to the current economic boom in the country and missed the chance to tackle the required reforms .
kaczynski 's government was wrought with scandals , staff suspensions , resignations , allegations , and tactical confusion .
his government stirred up a lot of dust , but did not accomplish much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski lost overwhelmingly the german business paper handelsblatt from düsseldorf looked ahead : " poland is going to need a little time to shed its historical sensitivities , overcome the burdens of transformation and truly become a part of europe .
we should give this country that chance and remain patient - particularly those of us in germany .
we have a historical responsibility toward poland , and we are benefiting tremendously from its integration .
this process will likely go faster with donald tusk at the helm .
it will , in any case , be more pleasant , " the paper noted . the dutch paper de volkskrant took a pragmatic view of poland 's election results .
" it would be a misconception to think that the mood will change completely in the country .
patriotic sentiments are and will remain intense .
warsaw will not suddenly start greeting brussels warmly .
-lsb- tusk 's -rsb- civic platform is a -lrb- neo- -rrb- liberal party with a significant conservative wing .
in addition , president lech kaczynski -lsb- jaroslaw 's twin brother -rsb- is in office until 2010 .
he can to block proposed legislation with his presidential veto power .
while it 's possible to override a veto with a three-fifths majority , frequent repeats could lead to a form of static warfare .
then , poland would be jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski -lrb- jaroslaw 's twin -rrb- is to remain in office until 2010 france 's le figaro was also hesitant to believe poland 's ties with europe would improve overnight .
" after two years of repeated crises , the polish people have now mobilized themselves to bring to an end to a chaotic campaign of shrugging off the country 's legacy of communism , an anticorruption battle worthy of an orwell novel and diplomatic posturings that have left the european union on the edge of a nervous breakdown . … it 's now up to the -lsb- civic platform -rsb- to reach out and repair the damage .
the party has already said its mission is to ' reestablish poland in the heart of europe ' - a declaration of intention received with caution by observers who remember that the conservative wing of this formation was , for a long time , on the same wave length as the kaczynski brothers . " austria 's die presse wrote : " as president and prime minister , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski stole … one thing from all of europe : time .
their election debacle gives us hope that the senseless blockades , historical blame games and embarrassing demands from warsaw will finally come to an end .

" it could have been so easy for the nationalist conservative kaczynski to win .
his country is currently experiencing … its most fortunate , happiest time in 300 years .
that he did not take advantage of this unique opportunity goes to show what a poor take on reality he has .
but he viewed himself as more than a ' mere ' politician ; he considered himself more a revolutionary who claimed the moral authority to bend the constitutional state at will and to disregard the conventions of democracy , " the paper wrote . switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung expressed similar sentiments .
" the government not only lost the election because it was confronted with an ' exemplary , comprehensive attack front , ' but also because many polish people were tired of the prime minister 's aggressive , confrontational manner .
in addition , the government 's record was nothing to brag about .
it slid from one domestic crisis into another .
it hardly contributed to the current economic boom in the country and missed the chance to tackle the required reforms .
kaczynski 's government was wrought with scandals , staff suspensions , resignations , allegations , and tactical confusion .
his government stirred up a lot of dust , but did not accomplish much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski lost overwhelmingly the german business paper handelsblatt from düsseldorf looked ahead : " poland is going to need a little time to shed its historical sensitivities , overcome the burdens of transformation and truly become a part of europe .
we should give this country that chance and remain patient - particularly those of us in germany .
we have a historical responsibility toward poland , and we are benefiting tremendously from its integration .
this process will likely go faster with donald tusk at the helm .
it will , in any case , be more pleasant , " the paper noted . the dutch paper de volkskrant took a pragmatic view of poland 's election results .
" it would be a misconception to think that the mood will change completely in the country .
patriotic sentiments are and will remain intense .
warsaw will not suddenly start greeting brussels warmly .
-lsb- tusk 's -rsb- civic platform is a -lrb- neo- -rrb- liberal party with a significant conservative wing .
in addition , president lech kaczynski -lsb- jaroslaw 's twin brother -rsb- is in office until 2010 .
he can to block proposed legislation with his presidential veto power .
while it 's possible to override a veto with a three-fifths majority , frequent repeats could lead to a form of static warfare .
then , poland would be jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski -lrb- jaroslaw 's twin -rrb- is to remain in office until 2010 france 's le figaro was also hesitant to believe poland 's ties with europe would improve overnight .
" after two years of repeated crises , the polish people have now mobilized themselves to bring to an end to a chaotic campaign of shrugging off the country 's legacy of communism , an anticorruption battle worthy of an orwell novel and diplomatic posturings that have left the european union on the edge of a nervous breakdown . … it 's now up to the -lsb- civic platform -rsb- to reach out and repair the damage .
the party has already said its mission is to ' reestablish poland in the heart of europe ' - a declaration of intention received with caution by observers who remember that the conservative wing of this formation was , for a long time , on the same wave length as the kaczynski brothers . " austria 's die presse wrote : " as president and prime minister , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski stole … one thing from all of europe : time .
their election debacle gives us hope that the senseless blockades , historical blame games and embarrassing demands from warsaw will finally come to an end .
leading politicians , not just in brussels , but in many eu capitals , are now breathing a sigh of relief after the victory of the right-wing liberal civic platform .

the study determined that the lack of specialists was " economically relevant " and that the problem was " putting the brakes on growth , " otremba added . he said the phenomenon was attributable to a structural problem in the german labor market .
the study found that the information and communication industry was particularly endangered because of the lack of specialists in mathematics and computer science .
" we are urgently searching for new workers , " august-wilhelm scheer , the president of bitkom , the federation representing the it , telecommunications and new media industry in germany , told reporters at a computer systems fair in munich on monday .
according to bitkom statistics , around 57 percent of information and communication enterprises needed more personnel while 62 percent admitted that their companies were suffering due to the lack of specialists .
the federation estimates that there are currently 30,000 to 40,000 free places in the it industry .
scheer called on german universities to train more specialists and to promote exceptional students to businesses , as well as for an increased effort to bring in highly-skilled foreigners .
" we need these highly-intelligent foreigners , " scheer said .
" they will help us secure our future . "
existing specialists may flee germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if businesses suffer , their specialists may leave he also warned that if those companies in germany who are lacking specialists did not find people to take the positions , then the enterprises would suffer and the specialists they did have would look for work outside germany .
the federal ministry for economic affairs , which commissioned the iw study , said that it was particularly concerned with the lack of highly-skilled specialists in the industries which are important for germany 's technological progress such as mechanical engineering , the metal and electrical industries and automotive construction .
the bad news is that the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better , with germany 's aging population exacerbating the problem in the future .
statistics show around 970,000 school leavers this year compared with around 800,000 first graders .
martin wansleben , the managing director of the german chamber of commerce and industry , told reporters that the numbers of jobs open to school leavers and qualified parents must be increased and that german institutions should increase their promotion of vocational training schemes .
he also added that more should be done to open up the job market for qualified foreigners . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move paves the way for porsche to take control of europe 's biggest carmaker . the european commission brought the case to the european court of justice in luxembourg , arguing that that the " volkswagen law " violates eu rules on the free movement of capital .
on tuesday , the court voted in favor of the commission and will now order germany to change the law . striking down the law allows porsche to raise its 31-percent stake to a majority .
porsche has made no secret of its desire to expand beyond its traditional luxury sports car market . commenting on the ruling , the company said it had secured enough options to let it " significantly " raise its holding in vw , but did not say whether these would be enough to gain majority control . " there is no decision on how we will proceed , " porsche spokesman frank gaube told reuters news agency in luxembourg . " we will take the decision to the supervisory board and this will be a decision for -lsb- them -rsb- , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of justice deemed the vw law illegal the german government said it accepted the court 's ruling .
" we will start the legislative procedure immediately in order to make the changes , " a spokesman for the german justice ministry told reuters . tight state control the " volkswagen law " was introduced in 1960 as the then state-owned vw , which was founded in the wake of world war ii , was being privatized .
originally , the state government of lower saxony and the federal government each held onto 20 percent of the shares -lrb- the federal government sold its stake in 1965 -rrb- . the crux of the " volkswagen law " is that regardless of the amount of capital it owns , a shareholder can not hold more than 20 percent of the voting rights in the company , making a company takeover impossible . the law also stipulates that lower saxony has the right to appoint two members to vw 's supervisory board , allowing them to block the majority needed to adopt resolutions . after porsche , lower saxony is the second-biggest investor in vw , with 20.3 percent of the capital . porsche takeover expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche has spent more than five billion euros since 2005 amassing its stake in vw porsche has long railed against the restriction on its voting rights . " to have 31 percent of the capital but only 20 percent of the voting rights is clearly discrimination , " said porsche 's chief executive wendelin wiedeking on the eve of the court decision . now that the court has ruled against the law , lower saxony has two choices .
it could either withdraw from vw , or raise its stake by five percent to 25 percent .
under german corporate law , a 25-percent share gives a shareholder a blocking veto . tuesday 's ruling is seen as a test case to establish the extent to which eu governments can protect companies they see as vital to their economy . for years , the european commission has fought to abolish such protectionist laws . similar action has either been taken or threatened by the european commission against spain over allegations it is protecting energy companies like endesa sa , against italy for blocking a takeover attempt of highways company autostrade spa , and against poland for hindering italy 's unicredit spa from consolidating its grip over a local bank . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the study determined that the lack of specialists was " economically relevant " and that the problem was " putting the brakes on growth , " otremba added . he said the phenomenon was attributable to a structural problem in the german labor market .
the study found that the information and communication industry was particularly endangered because of the lack of specialists in mathematics and computer science .
" we are urgently searching for new workers , " august-wilhelm scheer , the president of bitkom , the federation representing the it , telecommunications and new media industry in germany , told reporters at a computer systems fair in munich on monday .

the federation estimates that there are currently 30,000 to 40,000 free places in the it industry .

the federal ministry for economic affairs , which commissioned the iw study , said that it was particularly concerned with the lack of highly-skilled specialists in the industries which are important for germany 's technological progress such as mechanical engineering , the metal and electrical industries and automotive construction .
the bad news is that the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better , with germany 's aging population exacerbating the problem in the future .
statistics show around 970,000 school leavers this year compared with around 800,000 first graders .
martin wansleben , the managing director of the german chamber of commerce and industry , told reporters that the numbers of jobs open to school leavers and qualified parents must be increased and that german institutions should increase their promotion of vocational training schemes .

the study determined that the lack of specialists was " economically relevant " and that the problem was " putting the brakes on growth , " otremba added . he said the phenomenon was attributable to a structural problem in the german labor market .
the study found that the information and communication industry was particularly endangered because of the lack of specialists in mathematics and computer science .
" we are urgently searching for new workers , " august-wilhelm scheer , the president of bitkom , the federation representing the it , telecommunications and new media industry in germany , told reporters at a computer systems fair in munich on monday .
according to bitkom statistics , around 57 percent of information and communication enterprises needed more personnel while 62 percent admitted that their companies were suffering due to the lack of specialists .
the federation estimates that there are currently 30,000 to 40,000 free places in the it industry .
scheer called on german universities to train more specialists and to promote exceptional students to businesses , as well as for an increased effort to bring in highly-skilled foreigners .
" we need these highly-intelligent foreigners , " scheer said .
" they will help us secure our future . "
existing specialists may flee germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if businesses suffer , their specialists may leave he also warned that if those companies in germany who are lacking specialists did not find people to take the positions , then the enterprises would suffer and the specialists they did have would look for work outside germany .
the federal ministry for economic affairs , which commissioned the iw study , said that it was particularly concerned with the lack of highly-skilled specialists in the industries which are important for germany 's technological progress such as mechanical engineering , the metal and electrical industries and automotive construction .
the bad news is that the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better , with germany 's aging population exacerbating the problem in the future .
statistics show around 970,000 school leavers this year compared with around 800,000 first graders .
martin wansleben , the managing director of the german chamber of commerce and industry , told reporters that the numbers of jobs open to school leavers and qualified parents must be increased and that german institutions should increase their promotion of vocational training schemes .
he also added that more should be done to open up the job market for qualified foreigners . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one church has decided to take control and move to where the believers are . these are hard times for christianity in europe .
while it is the world 's most popular faith with some 2.1 billion followers , the recruitment drive in the old world has been in the slow lane for some time .
church attendance is down all over the western world and in germany , rising maintenance costs and dwindling funds have seen parishes shut down churches and sell the buildings for commercial use .
church dug up , ready to roll coining a phrase that references a rival in the faith stakes - " if the mountain wo n't come to muhammad , muhammad must go to the mountain " - one church in germany has given up waiting for its flock to return and has gone of in search of pastures new .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heuersdorf church is making way for a new mine for a church to physically be uprooted and moved , there has to be a pretty good reason and while a lack of congregation may be a good argument , it is not usually enough to justify moving something which weighs a fair few tons .
the reason behind the relocation of the heuersdorf church has as much to do with commerce as it does with spreading the word .
mining company footing the bill the 660-ton stone church is being moved because it was sitting on extensive deposits of lignite , or brown coal , a fuel used in power generation plants .
after an extensive legal battle with the mibrag mining company , the church and 59 residents of the village will be moved 12 kilometers -lrb- 7.5 miles -rrb- to land near leipzig in eastern germany .
the church 's journey to its new home will begin on wednesday .
the 750-year-old church , complete with tiled bell tower , was separated from its foundations and lifted 1.5 meters -lrb- five feet -rrb- onto a massive rolling platform on monday .
the painstakingly slow journey to the village of borna is expected to take about a week at a cost of three million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- .
time will tell if the miraculous relocation rekindles the belief of the lapsed locals . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it could have been so easy for the nationalist conservative kaczynski to win .
his country is currently experiencing … its most fortunate , happiest time in 300 years .
that he did not take advantage of this unique opportunity goes to show what a poor take on reality he has .
but he viewed himself as more than a ' mere ' politician ; he considered himself more a revolutionary who claimed the moral authority to bend the constitutional state at will and to disregard the conventions of democracy , " the paper wrote . switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung expressed similar sentiments .
" the government not only lost the election because it was confronted with an ' exemplary , comprehensive attack front , ' but also because many polish people were tired of the prime minister 's aggressive , confrontational manner .
in addition , the government 's record was nothing to brag about .
it slid from one domestic crisis into another .
it hardly contributed to the current economic boom in the country and missed the chance to tackle the required reforms .
kaczynski 's government was wrought with scandals , staff suspensions , resignations , allegations , and tactical confusion .
his government stirred up a lot of dust , but did not accomplish much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski lost overwhelmingly the german business paper handelsblatt from düsseldorf looked ahead : " poland is going to need a little time to shed its historical sensitivities , overcome the burdens of transformation and truly become a part of europe .
we should give this country that chance and remain patient - particularly those of us in germany .
we have a historical responsibility toward poland , and we are benefiting tremendously from its integration .
this process will likely go faster with donald tusk at the helm .
it will , in any case , be more pleasant , " the paper noted . the dutch paper de volkskrant took a pragmatic view of poland 's election results .
" it would be a misconception to think that the mood will change completely in the country .
patriotic sentiments are and will remain intense .
warsaw will not suddenly start greeting brussels warmly .
-lsb- tusk 's -rsb- civic platform is a -lrb- neo- -rrb- liberal party with a significant conservative wing .
in addition , president lech kaczynski -lsb- jaroslaw 's twin brother -rsb- is in office until 2010 .
he can to block proposed legislation with his presidential veto power .
while it 's possible to override a veto with a three-fifths majority , frequent repeats could lead to a form of static warfare .
then , poland would be jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski -lrb- jaroslaw 's twin -rrb- is to remain in office until 2010 france 's le figaro was also hesitant to believe poland 's ties with europe would improve overnight .
" after two years of repeated crises , the polish people have now mobilized themselves to bring to an end to a chaotic campaign of shrugging off the country 's legacy of communism , an anticorruption battle worthy of an orwell novel and diplomatic posturings that have left the european union on the edge of a nervous breakdown . … it 's now up to the -lsb- civic platform -rsb- to reach out and repair the damage .
the party has already said its mission is to ' reestablish poland in the heart of europe ' - a declaration of intention received with caution by observers who remember that the conservative wing of this formation was , for a long time , on the same wave length as the kaczynski brothers . " austria 's die presse wrote : " as president and prime minister , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski stole … one thing from all of europe : time .
their election debacle gives us hope that the senseless blockades , historical blame games and embarrassing demands from warsaw will finally come to an end .

" we decisively reject these unfounded accusations , " an exterior ministry spokesperson said in beijing .
" we will apply for a clarification from the german government . " remberg told a conference on industrial espionage in berlin on monday that the nature and frequency of the attacks on german companies pointed to a concerted targeting by chinese hackers backed by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel addressed the cyber row on her visit to beijing " in our view , state chinese interests stand behind these digital attacks , " said remberg .
" supporting this view is the intensity , structure and scope of the attacks , and above all the targets , which include -lsb- german -rsb- authorities and companies . " remberg 's statements come barely two months after the german media reported incidents of cyber-spying at german government ministries by computer hackers believed to be linked to the chinese army .
the issue was raised by german chancellor angela merkel when she met chinese president wen jiabao in beijing in august .
china denied the allegations and said all " hacking " behavior was prohibited . since the german reports surfaced , other countries , including the united states and britain , have admitted that their own government agencies have been targeted by hackers backed by the chinese state .
the growing number of allegations thrown china 's way has prompted some to speculate whether a new front of warfare is beginning to open up between states , via the internet . chinese cyber-war theory addressed this belief was addressed by remberg at the berlin conference , but he refused to say whether he thought china 's use of spying technology was part of an internet-based international destabilization campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military secrets are needed to advance china 's forces " some people call this the chinese cyber war , " remberg said , adding that it was important to differentiate between legitimate attempts to gather information on competitors by chinese companies and state-led industrial espionage . however , he was less reticent when it came to his assertions that china was behind the increasing numbers of attempted and successful breaches of internet security in germany . " across the world the people 's republic of china is intensively gathering political , military , corporate-strategic and scientific information in order to bridge their technological gaps as quickly as possible , " remberg said . china 's interest in industrial and government secrets , remberg added , was driven by its desire to become a top global economic power .
to catch up with the west , china needed " a massive transfer of high technology , " he said . astonishing intensity of cyber-attacks on germany remberg astonished the berlin conference by revealing that attacks on german ministries and authorities were being discovered every other day and that the perpetrators appeared unconcerned that the attacks were being discovered .
" every one or two days , new attacks are detected , " he said . he also suggested that china was using classic espionage methods to launch its spy attacks , albeit with the latest technology .
traditional infiltration by agents still occurred , he said , but instead of the spies gaining access to government buildings in person , they now remotely accessed the information they needed from legitimate bases within germany via the internet . " the diplomatic representative offices and chinese media agencies in germany enable the hidden deployment of intelligence agents , " remberg said .
firms in joint ventures with chinese firms were also at risk , he added . spies of many nations after german secrets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spies from many nations are operating in germany as many experts have previously concluded , remberg also said he was sure that the chinese were not alone in hacking german sites .
" russian intelligence agencies are making great efforts in germany to get important information , using both open and conspiratorial methods , in military , political , economic and scientific areas , " he said . remberg also named iran , north korea , pakistan and syria as countries that had sent intelligence agents to germany to procure " dual-use " machinery - which can be used in both civil and military applications - and know-how for illegal weapons technology , including nuclear technology . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it could have been so easy for the nationalist conservative kaczynski to win .
his country is currently experiencing … its most fortunate , happiest time in 300 years .
that he did not take advantage of this unique opportunity goes to show what a poor take on reality he has .
but he viewed himself as more than a ' mere ' politician ; he considered himself more a revolutionary who claimed the moral authority to bend the constitutional state at will and to disregard the conventions of democracy , " the paper wrote . switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung expressed similar sentiments .
" the government not only lost the election because it was confronted with an ' exemplary , comprehensive attack front , ' but also because many polish people were tired of the prime minister 's aggressive , confrontational manner .
in addition , the government 's record was nothing to brag about .
it slid from one domestic crisis into another .
it hardly contributed to the current economic boom in the country and missed the chance to tackle the required reforms .
kaczynski 's government was wrought with scandals , staff suspensions , resignations , allegations , and tactical confusion .
his government stirred up a lot of dust , but did not accomplish much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski lost overwhelmingly the german business paper handelsblatt from düsseldorf looked ahead : " poland is going to need a little time to shed its historical sensitivities , overcome the burdens of transformation and truly become a part of europe .
we should give this country that chance and remain patient - particularly those of us in germany .
we have a historical responsibility toward poland , and we are benefiting tremendously from its integration .
this process will likely go faster with donald tusk at the helm .
it will , in any case , be more pleasant , " the paper noted . the dutch paper de volkskrant took a pragmatic view of poland 's election results .
" it would be a misconception to think that the mood will change completely in the country .
patriotic sentiments are and will remain intense .
warsaw will not suddenly start greeting brussels warmly .

" after two years of repeated crises , the polish people have now mobilized themselves to bring to an end to a chaotic campaign of shrugging off the country 's legacy of communism , an anticorruption battle worthy of an orwell novel and diplomatic posturings that have left the european union on the edge of a nervous breakdown . … it 's now up to the -lsb- civic platform -rsb- to reach out and repair the damage .
the party has already said its mission is to ' reestablish poland in the heart of europe ' - a declaration of intention received with caution by observers who remember that the conservative wing of this formation was , for a long time , on the same wave length as the kaczynski brothers . " austria 's die presse wrote : " as president and prime minister , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski stole … one thing from all of europe : time .
their election debacle gives us hope that the senseless blockades , historical blame games and embarrassing demands from warsaw will finally come to an end .

the city has received positive signals both from the german government and the german olympic committee . " we want to get the olympics to germany .
not only the city of munich but the state of bavaria and the whole german sporting world are behind the effort , " thomas bach , chief of the german olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- , told the dpa news agency . munich mayor christian ude said : " the meeting was a complete success , " referring to the presentation of the feasibility study on monday . the decisive dosb vote about munich 's bid takes place on december 8 in hamburg , with the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- to elect the 2018 winter olympics host city in 2011 . munich hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and , if chosen by the ioc , would be the first city to land the winter games as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a masked terrorist in munich in 1972 the 1972 olympics in munich were marred when members of the israeli olympic team were taken hostage by a palestinian terror organization .
by the end of the ordeal , during which the world held as the showdown was broadcast around the globe , the black september group had murdered 11 israeli athletes and one german policeman .
five of the eight terrorists were killed during a rescue attempt . venues in three areas munich plans a compact concept with three cluster areas for events which , according to bach " meets international requirements . " the ceremonies and ice sports events would take place in munich and all snow events in garmisch-partenkirchen , a venue about 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- away which hosted the 1936 winter olympics .
bob-sledding competitions would be held at the existing venue in königssee in southeast bavaria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing hosts the olympic games in august 2008 " no one doubts our concept anymore , " ude told dpa .
" it prevailed because only a compact concept has a chance to convince the ioc . " other traditional bavarian winter sports venues had initially protested the munich plans . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble 's presence at monday 's presentation of the study also reflected the government 's support of the concept . " the olympic bid offers an outstanding chance to present german sports on the international stage and reinforce the image of germany as a modern country , " schäuble said . bach , who is also on the ioc executive board , said " the dosb welcomes the support from the government and the state of bavaria . "
he also said that munich organizers are prepared for the bid . bildunterschrift : sochi residents on learning they 'd gotten the winter games in 2014 investments needed munich spent some 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 858,000 dollars -rrb- on the feasibility study for the 2018 games . actual bid costs are estimated at 30 million euros .

the move paves the way for porsche to take control of europe 's biggest carmaker . the european commission brought the case to the european court of justice in luxembourg , arguing that that the " volkswagen law " violates eu rules on the free movement of capital .
on tuesday , the court voted in favor of the commission and will now order germany to change the law . striking down the law allows porsche to raise its 31-percent stake to a majority .
porsche has made no secret of its desire to expand beyond its traditional luxury sports car market . commenting on the ruling , the company said it had secured enough options to let it " significantly " raise its holding in vw , but did not say whether these would be enough to gain majority control . " there is no decision on how we will proceed , " porsche spokesman frank gaube told reuters news agency in luxembourg . " we will take the decision to the supervisory board and this will be a decision for -lsb- them -rsb- , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of justice deemed the vw law illegal the german government said it accepted the court 's ruling .
" we will start the legislative procedure immediately in order to make the changes , " a spokesman for the german justice ministry told reuters . tight state control the " volkswagen law " was introduced in 1960 as the then state-owned vw , which was founded in the wake of world war ii , was being privatized .
originally , the state government of lower saxony and the federal government each held onto 20 percent of the shares -lrb- the federal government sold its stake in 1965 -rrb- . the crux of the " volkswagen law " is that regardless of the amount of capital it owns , a shareholder can not hold more than 20 percent of the voting rights in the company , making a company takeover impossible . the law also stipulates that lower saxony has the right to appoint two members to vw 's supervisory board , allowing them to block the majority needed to adopt resolutions . after porsche , lower saxony is the second-biggest investor in vw , with 20.3 percent of the capital . porsche takeover expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche has spent more than five billion euros since 2005 amassing its stake in vw porsche has long railed against the restriction on its voting rights . " to have 31 percent of the capital but only 20 percent of the voting rights is clearly discrimination , " said porsche 's chief executive wendelin wiedeking on the eve of the court decision . now that the court has ruled against the law , lower saxony has two choices .
it could either withdraw from vw , or raise its stake by five percent to 25 percent .
under german corporate law , a 25-percent share gives a shareholder a blocking veto . tuesday 's ruling is seen as a test case to establish the extent to which eu governments can protect companies they see as vital to their economy . for years , the european commission has fought to abolish such protectionist laws . similar action has either been taken or threatened by the european commission against spain over allegations it is protecting energy companies like endesa sa , against italy for blocking a takeover attempt of highways company autostrade spa , and against poland for hindering italy 's unicredit spa from consolidating its grip over a local bank . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the study determined that the lack of specialists was " economically relevant " and that the problem was " putting the brakes on growth , " otremba added . he said the phenomenon was attributable to a structural problem in the german labor market .
the study found that the information and communication industry was particularly endangered because of the lack of specialists in mathematics and computer science .
" we are urgently searching for new workers , " august-wilhelm scheer , the president of bitkom , the federation representing the it , telecommunications and new media industry in germany , told reporters at a computer systems fair in munich on monday .
according to bitkom statistics , around 57 percent of information and communication enterprises needed more personnel while 62 percent admitted that their companies were suffering due to the lack of specialists .
the federation estimates that there are currently 30,000 to 40,000 free places in the it industry .
scheer called on german universities to train more specialists and to promote exceptional students to businesses , as well as for an increased effort to bring in highly-skilled foreigners .
" we need these highly-intelligent foreigners , " scheer said .
" they will help us secure our future . "
existing specialists may flee germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if businesses suffer , their specialists may leave he also warned that if those companies in germany who are lacking specialists did not find people to take the positions , then the enterprises would suffer and the specialists they did have would look for work outside germany .
the federal ministry for economic affairs , which commissioned the iw study , said that it was particularly concerned with the lack of highly-skilled specialists in the industries which are important for germany 's technological progress such as mechanical engineering , the metal and electrical industries and automotive construction .
the bad news is that the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better , with germany 's aging population exacerbating the problem in the future .
statistics show around 970,000 school leavers this year compared with around 800,000 first graders .
martin wansleben , the managing director of the german chamber of commerce and industry , told reporters that the numbers of jobs open to school leavers and qualified parents must be increased and that german institutions should increase their promotion of vocational training schemes .
he also added that more should be done to open up the job market for qualified foreigners . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it could have been so easy for the nationalist conservative kaczynski to win .
his country is currently experiencing … its most fortunate , happiest time in 300 years .
that he did not take advantage of this unique opportunity goes to show what a poor take on reality he has .
but he viewed himself as more than a ' mere ' politician ; he considered himself more a revolutionary who claimed the moral authority to bend the constitutional state at will and to disregard the conventions of democracy , " the paper wrote . switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung expressed similar sentiments .
" the government not only lost the election because it was confronted with an ' exemplary , comprehensive attack front , ' but also because many polish people were tired of the prime minister 's aggressive , confrontational manner .
in addition , the government 's record was nothing to brag about .
it slid from one domestic crisis into another .
it hardly contributed to the current economic boom in the country and missed the chance to tackle the required reforms .
kaczynski 's government was wrought with scandals , staff suspensions , resignations , allegations , and tactical confusion .
his government stirred up a lot of dust , but did not accomplish much . "

we should give this country that chance and remain patient - particularly those of us in germany .
we have a historical responsibility toward poland , and we are benefiting tremendously from its integration .
this process will likely go faster with donald tusk at the helm .
it will , in any case , be more pleasant , " the paper noted . the dutch paper de volkskrant took a pragmatic view of poland 's election results .
" it would be a misconception to think that the mood will change completely in the country .

" after two years of repeated crises , the polish people have now mobilized themselves to bring to an end to a chaotic campaign of shrugging off the country 's legacy of communism , an anticorruption battle worthy of an orwell novel and diplomatic posturings that have left the european union on the edge of a nervous breakdown . … it 's now up to the -lsb- civic platform -rsb- to reach out and repair the damage .
the party has already said its mission is to ' reestablish poland in the heart of europe ' - a declaration of intention received with caution by observers who remember that the conservative wing of this formation was , for a long time , on the same wave length as the kaczynski brothers . " austria 's die presse wrote : " as president and prime minister , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski stole … one thing from all of europe : time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 23.10.2007 china rejects renewed accusations of cyber spying großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's desire to be a top global economic power is said to drive its spying campaign china has protested against new accusations made by a senior german intelligence official that the chinese government is behind almost daily internet espionage attacks on germany . the chinese exterior ministry said on tuesday that it was " confused " by the comments made by hans elmar remberg , vice president of the german office for the protection of the constitution , the country 's domestic intelligence agency . " we decisively reject these unfounded accusations , " an exterior ministry spokesperson said in beijing .
" we will apply for a clarification from the german government . " remberg told a conference on industrial espionage in berlin on monday that the nature and frequency of the attacks on german companies pointed to a concerted targeting by chinese hackers backed by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel addressed the cyber row on her visit to beijing " in our view , state chinese interests stand behind these digital attacks , " said remberg .
" supporting this view is the intensity , structure and scope of the attacks , and above all the targets , which include -lsb- german -rsb- authorities and companies . " remberg 's statements come barely two months after the german media reported incidents of cyber-spying at german government ministries by computer hackers believed to be linked to the chinese army .
the issue was raised by german chancellor angela merkel when she met chinese president wen jiabao in beijing in august .
china denied the allegations and said all " hacking " behavior was prohibited . since the german reports surfaced , other countries , including the united states and britain , have admitted that their own government agencies have been targeted by hackers backed by the chinese state .
the growing number of allegations thrown china 's way has prompted some to speculate whether a new front of warfare is beginning to open up between states , via the internet . chinese cyber-war theory addressed this belief was addressed by remberg at the berlin conference , but he refused to say whether he thought china 's use of spying technology was part of an internet-based international destabilization campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military secrets are needed to advance china 's forces " some people call this the chinese cyber war , " remberg said , adding that it was important to differentiate between legitimate attempts to gather information on competitors by chinese companies and state-led industrial espionage . however , he was less reticent when it came to his assertions that china was behind the increasing numbers of attempted and successful breaches of internet security in germany . " across the world the people 's republic of china is intensively gathering political , military , corporate-strategic and scientific information in order to bridge their technological gaps as quickly as possible , " remberg said . china 's interest in industrial and government secrets , remberg added , was driven by its desire to become a top global economic power .
to catch up with the west , china needed " a massive transfer of high technology , " he said . astonishing intensity of cyber-attacks on germany remberg astonished the berlin conference by revealing that attacks on german ministries and authorities were being discovered every other day and that the perpetrators appeared unconcerned that the attacks were being discovered .
" every one or two days , new attacks are detected , " he said . he also suggested that china was using classic espionage methods to launch its spy attacks , albeit with the latest technology .
traditional infiltration by agents still occurred , he said , but instead of the spies gaining access to government buildings in person , they now remotely accessed the information they needed from legitimate bases within germany via the internet . " the diplomatic representative offices and chinese media agencies in germany enable the hidden deployment of intelligence agents , " remberg said .
firms in joint ventures with chinese firms were also at risk , he added . spies of many nations after german secrets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spies from many nations are operating in germany as many experts have previously concluded , remberg also said he was sure that the chinese were not alone in hacking german sites .
" russian intelligence agencies are making great efforts in germany to get important information , using both open and conspiratorial methods , in military , political , economic and scientific areas , " he said . remberg also named iran , north korea , pakistan and syria as countries that had sent intelligence agents to germany to procure " dual-use " machinery - which can be used in both civil and military applications - and know-how for illegal weapons technology , including nuclear technology . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it could have been so easy for the nationalist conservative kaczynski to win .
his country is currently experiencing … its most fortunate , happiest time in 300 years .
that he did not take advantage of this unique opportunity goes to show what a poor take on reality he has .
but he viewed himself as more than a ' mere ' politician ; he considered himself more a revolutionary who claimed the moral authority to bend the constitutional state at will and to disregard the conventions of democracy , " the paper wrote . switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung expressed similar sentiments .
" the government not only lost the election because it was confronted with an ' exemplary , comprehensive attack front , ' but also because many polish people were tired of the prime minister 's aggressive , confrontational manner .
in addition , the government 's record was nothing to brag about .
it slid from one domestic crisis into another .
it hardly contributed to the current economic boom in the country and missed the chance to tackle the required reforms .
kaczynski 's government was wrought with scandals , staff suspensions , resignations , allegations , and tactical confusion .
his government stirred up a lot of dust , but did not accomplish much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski lost overwhelmingly the german business paper handelsblatt from düsseldorf looked ahead : " poland is going to need a little time to shed its historical sensitivities , overcome the burdens of transformation and truly become a part of europe .
we should give this country that chance and remain patient - particularly those of us in germany .
we have a historical responsibility toward poland , and we are benefiting tremendously from its integration .
this process will likely go faster with donald tusk at the helm .
it will , in any case , be more pleasant , " the paper noted . the dutch paper de volkskrant took a pragmatic view of poland 's election results .
" it would be a misconception to think that the mood will change completely in the country .
patriotic sentiments are and will remain intense .
warsaw will not suddenly start greeting brussels warmly .
-lsb- tusk 's -rsb- civic platform is a -lrb- neo- -rrb- liberal party with a significant conservative wing .
in addition , president lech kaczynski -lsb- jaroslaw 's twin brother -rsb- is in office until 2010 .
he can to block proposed legislation with his presidential veto power .
while it 's possible to override a veto with a three-fifths majority , frequent repeats could lead to a form of static warfare .
then , poland would be jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski -lrb- jaroslaw 's twin -rrb- is to remain in office until 2010 france 's le figaro was also hesitant to believe poland 's ties with europe would improve overnight .
" after two years of repeated crises , the polish people have now mobilized themselves to bring to an end to a chaotic campaign of shrugging off the country 's legacy of communism , an anticorruption battle worthy of an orwell novel and diplomatic posturings that have left the european union on the edge of a nervous breakdown . … it 's now up to the -lsb- civic platform -rsb- to reach out and repair the damage .
the party has already said its mission is to ' reestablish poland in the heart of europe ' - a declaration of intention received with caution by observers who remember that the conservative wing of this formation was , for a long time , on the same wave length as the kaczynski brothers . " austria 's die presse wrote : " as president and prime minister , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski stole … one thing from all of europe : time .
their election debacle gives us hope that the senseless blockades , historical blame games and embarrassing demands from warsaw will finally come to an end .
leading politicians , not just in brussels , but in many eu capitals , are now breathing a sigh of relief after the victory of the right-wing liberal civic platform .

the study determined that the lack of specialists was " economically relevant " and that the problem was " putting the brakes on growth , " otremba added . he said the phenomenon was attributable to a structural problem in the german labor market .
the study found that the information and communication industry was particularly endangered because of the lack of specialists in mathematics and computer science .
" we are urgently searching for new workers , " august-wilhelm scheer , the president of bitkom , the federation representing the it , telecommunications and new media industry in germany , told reporters at a computer systems fair in munich on monday .
according to bitkom statistics , around 57 percent of information and communication enterprises needed more personnel while 62 percent admitted that their companies were suffering due to the lack of specialists .
the federation estimates that there are currently 30,000 to 40,000 free places in the it industry .
scheer called on german universities to train more specialists and to promote exceptional students to businesses , as well as for an increased effort to bring in highly-skilled foreigners .
" we need these highly-intelligent foreigners , " scheer said .
" they will help us secure our future . "
existing specialists may flee germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if businesses suffer , their specialists may leave he also warned that if those companies in germany who are lacking specialists did not find people to take the positions , then the enterprises would suffer and the specialists they did have would look for work outside germany .
the federal ministry for economic affairs , which commissioned the iw study , said that it was particularly concerned with the lack of highly-skilled specialists in the industries which are important for germany 's technological progress such as mechanical engineering , the metal and electrical industries and automotive construction .
the bad news is that the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better , with germany 's aging population exacerbating the problem in the future .
statistics show around 970,000 school leavers this year compared with around 800,000 first graders .
martin wansleben , the managing director of the german chamber of commerce and industry , told reporters that the numbers of jobs open to school leavers and qualified parents must be increased and that german institutions should increase their promotion of vocational training schemes .
he also added that more should be done to open up the job market for qualified foreigners . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we decisively reject these unfounded accusations , " an exterior ministry spokesperson said in beijing .
" we will apply for a clarification from the german government . " remberg told a conference on industrial espionage in berlin on monday that the nature and frequency of the attacks on german companies pointed to a concerted targeting by chinese hackers backed by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel addressed the cyber row on her visit to beijing " in our view , state chinese interests stand behind these digital attacks , " said remberg .
" supporting this view is the intensity , structure and scope of the attacks , and above all the targets , which include -lsb- german -rsb- authorities and companies . " remberg 's statements come barely two months after the german media reported incidents of cyber-spying at german government ministries by computer hackers believed to be linked to the chinese army .
the issue was raised by german chancellor angela merkel when she met chinese president wen jiabao in beijing in august .
china denied the allegations and said all " hacking " behavior was prohibited . since the german reports surfaced , other countries , including the united states and britain , have admitted that their own government agencies have been targeted by hackers backed by the chinese state .
the growing number of allegations thrown china 's way has prompted some to speculate whether a new front of warfare is beginning to open up between states , via the internet . chinese cyber-war theory addressed this belief was addressed by remberg at the berlin conference , but he refused to say whether he thought china 's use of spying technology was part of an internet-based international destabilization campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military secrets are needed to advance china 's forces " some people call this the chinese cyber war , " remberg said , adding that it was important to differentiate between legitimate attempts to gather information on competitors by chinese companies and state-led industrial espionage . however , he was less reticent when it came to his assertions that china was behind the increasing numbers of attempted and successful breaches of internet security in germany . " across the world the people 's republic of china is intensively gathering political , military , corporate-strategic and scientific information in order to bridge their technological gaps as quickly as possible , " remberg said . china 's interest in industrial and government secrets , remberg added , was driven by its desire to become a top global economic power .
to catch up with the west , china needed " a massive transfer of high technology , " he said . astonishing intensity of cyber-attacks on germany remberg astonished the berlin conference by revealing that attacks on german ministries and authorities were being discovered every other day and that the perpetrators appeared unconcerned that the attacks were being discovered .
" every one or two days , new attacks are detected , " he said . he also suggested that china was using classic espionage methods to launch its spy attacks , albeit with the latest technology .
traditional infiltration by agents still occurred , he said , but instead of the spies gaining access to government buildings in person , they now remotely accessed the information they needed from legitimate bases within germany via the internet . " the diplomatic representative offices and chinese media agencies in germany enable the hidden deployment of intelligence agents , " remberg said .
firms in joint ventures with chinese firms were also at risk , he added . spies of many nations after german secrets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spies from many nations are operating in germany as many experts have previously concluded , remberg also said he was sure that the chinese were not alone in hacking german sites .
" russian intelligence agencies are making great efforts in germany to get important information , using both open and conspiratorial methods , in military , political , economic and scientific areas , " he said . remberg also named iran , north korea , pakistan and syria as countries that had sent intelligence agents to germany to procure " dual-use " machinery - which can be used in both civil and military applications - and know-how for illegal weapons technology , including nuclear technology . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" supporting this view is the intensity , structure and scope of the attacks , and above all the targets , which include -lsb- german -rsb- authorities and companies . " remberg 's statements come barely two months after the german media reported incidents of cyber-spying at german government ministries by computer hackers believed to be linked to the chinese army .
the issue was raised by german chancellor angela merkel when she met chinese president wen jiabao in beijing in august .
china denied the allegations and said all " hacking " behavior was prohibited . since the german reports surfaced , other countries , including the united states and britain , have admitted that their own government agencies have been targeted by hackers backed by the chinese state .
the growing number of allegations thrown china 's way has prompted some to speculate whether a new front of warfare is beginning to open up between states , via the internet . chinese cyber-war theory addressed this belief was addressed by remberg at the berlin conference , but he refused to say whether he thought china 's use of spying technology was part of an internet-based international destabilization campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military secrets are needed to advance china 's forces " some people call this the chinese cyber war , " remberg said , adding that it was important to differentiate between legitimate attempts to gather information on competitors by chinese companies and state-led industrial espionage . however , he was less reticent when it came to his assertions that china was behind the increasing numbers of attempted and successful breaches of internet security in germany . " across the world the people 's republic of china is intensively gathering political , military , corporate-strategic and scientific information in order to bridge their technological gaps as quickly as possible , " remberg said . china 's interest in industrial and government secrets , remberg added , was driven by its desire to become a top global economic power .
to catch up with the west , china needed " a massive transfer of high technology , " he said . astonishing intensity of cyber-attacks on germany remberg astonished the berlin conference by revealing that attacks on german ministries and authorities were being discovered every other day and that the perpetrators appeared unconcerned that the attacks were being discovered .
" every one or two days , new attacks are detected , " he said . he also suggested that china was using classic espionage methods to launch its spy attacks , albeit with the latest technology .
traditional infiltration by agents still occurred , he said , but instead of the spies gaining access to government buildings in person , they now remotely accessed the information they needed from legitimate bases within germany via the internet . " the diplomatic representative offices and chinese media agencies in germany enable the hidden deployment of intelligence agents , " remberg said .
firms in joint ventures with chinese firms were also at risk , he added . spies of many nations after german secrets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spies from many nations are operating in germany as many experts have previously concluded , remberg also said he was sure that the chinese were not alone in hacking german sites .
" russian intelligence agencies are making great efforts in germany to get important information , using both open and conspiratorial methods , in military , political , economic and scientific areas , " he said . remberg also named iran , north korea , pakistan and syria as countries that had sent intelligence agents to germany to procure " dual-use " machinery - which can be used in both civil and military applications - and know-how for illegal weapons technology , including nuclear technology . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the olympic bid offers an outstanding chance to present german sports on the international stage and reinforce the image of germany as a modern country , " schäuble said . bach , who is also on the ioc executive board , said " the dosb welcomes the support from the government and the state of bavaria .

the study determined that the lack of specialists was " economically relevant " and that the problem was " putting the brakes on growth , " otremba added . he said the phenomenon was attributable to a structural problem in the german labor market .
the study found that the information and communication industry was particularly endangered because of the lack of specialists in mathematics and computer science .

the federation estimates that there are currently 30,000 to 40,000 free places in the it industry .

the federal ministry for economic affairs , which commissioned the iw study , said that it was particularly concerned with the lack of highly-skilled specialists in the industries which are important for germany 's technological progress such as mechanical engineering , the metal and electrical industries and automotive construction .
the bad news is that the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better , with germany 's aging population exacerbating the problem in the future .

" the first thing i 'm expecting is to show how cycling can be at the forefront - voluntarily - in this area , and rebuild the image " of the sport , bachelot said in the lead-up to the event .
" we want to make this summit a sort of pilot project for the fight against doping , which will be useful for the entire sports world .

" we decisively reject these unfounded accusations , " an exterior ministry spokesperson said in beijing .
" we will apply for a clarification from the german government . " remberg told a conference on industrial espionage in berlin on monday that the nature and frequency of the attacks on german companies pointed to a concerted targeting by chinese hackers backed by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel addressed the cyber row on her visit to beijing " in our view , state chinese interests stand behind these digital attacks , " said remberg .
" supporting this view is the intensity , structure and scope of the attacks , and above all the targets , which include -lsb- german -rsb- authorities and companies . " remberg 's statements come barely two months after the german media reported incidents of cyber-spying at german government ministries by computer hackers believed to be linked to the chinese army .
the issue was raised by german chancellor angela merkel when she met chinese president wen jiabao in beijing in august .
china denied the allegations and said all " hacking " behavior was prohibited . since the german reports surfaced , other countries , including the united states and britain , have admitted that their own government agencies have been targeted by hackers backed by the chinese state .
the growing number of allegations thrown china 's way has prompted some to speculate whether a new front of warfare is beginning to open up between states , via the internet . chinese cyber-war theory addressed this belief was addressed by remberg at the berlin conference , but he refused to say whether he thought china 's use of spying technology was part of an internet-based international destabilization campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military secrets are needed to advance china 's forces " some people call this the chinese cyber war , " remberg said , adding that it was important to differentiate between legitimate attempts to gather information on competitors by chinese companies and state-led industrial espionage . however , he was less reticent when it came to his assertions that china was behind the increasing numbers of attempted and successful breaches of internet security in germany . " across the world the people 's republic of china is intensively gathering political , military , corporate-strategic and scientific information in order to bridge their technological gaps as quickly as possible , " remberg said . china 's interest in industrial and government secrets , remberg added , was driven by its desire to become a top global economic power .
to catch up with the west , china needed " a massive transfer of high technology , " he said . astonishing intensity of cyber-attacks on germany remberg astonished the berlin conference by revealing that attacks on german ministries and authorities were being discovered every other day and that the perpetrators appeared unconcerned that the attacks were being discovered .
" every one or two days , new attacks are detected , " he said . he also suggested that china was using classic espionage methods to launch its spy attacks , albeit with the latest technology .
traditional infiltration by agents still occurred , he said , but instead of the spies gaining access to government buildings in person , they now remotely accessed the information they needed from legitimate bases within germany via the internet . " the diplomatic representative offices and chinese media agencies in germany enable the hidden deployment of intelligence agents , " remberg said .
firms in joint ventures with chinese firms were also at risk , he added . spies of many nations after german secrets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spies from many nations are operating in germany as many experts have previously concluded , remberg also said he was sure that the chinese were not alone in hacking german sites .
" russian intelligence agencies are making great efforts in germany to get important information , using both open and conspiratorial methods , in military , political , economic and scientific areas , " he said . remberg also named iran , north korea , pakistan and syria as countries that had sent intelligence agents to germany to procure " dual-use " machinery - which can be used in both civil and military applications - and know-how for illegal weapons technology , including nuclear technology . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the study determined that the lack of specialists was " economically relevant " and that the problem was " putting the brakes on growth , " otremba added . he said the phenomenon was attributable to a structural problem in the german labor market .
the study found that the information and communication industry was particularly endangered because of the lack of specialists in mathematics and computer science .
" we are urgently searching for new workers , " august-wilhelm scheer , the president of bitkom , the federation representing the it , telecommunications and new media industry in germany , told reporters at a computer systems fair in munich on monday .
according to bitkom statistics , around 57 percent of information and communication enterprises needed more personnel while 62 percent admitted that their companies were suffering due to the lack of specialists .
the federation estimates that there are currently 30,000 to 40,000 free places in the it industry .
scheer called on german universities to train more specialists and to promote exceptional students to businesses , as well as for an increased effort to bring in highly-skilled foreigners .
" we need these highly-intelligent foreigners , " scheer said .
" they will help us secure our future . "
existing specialists may flee germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if businesses suffer , their specialists may leave he also warned that if those companies in germany who are lacking specialists did not find people to take the positions , then the enterprises would suffer and the specialists they did have would look for work outside germany .
the federal ministry for economic affairs , which commissioned the iw study , said that it was particularly concerned with the lack of highly-skilled specialists in the industries which are important for germany 's technological progress such as mechanical engineering , the metal and electrical industries and automotive construction .
the bad news is that the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better , with germany 's aging population exacerbating the problem in the future .
statistics show around 970,000 school leavers this year compared with around 800,000 first graders .
martin wansleben , the managing director of the german chamber of commerce and industry , told reporters that the numbers of jobs open to school leavers and qualified parents must be increased and that german institutions should increase their promotion of vocational training schemes .

" it could have been so easy for the nationalist conservative kaczynski to win .
his country is currently experiencing … its most fortunate , happiest time in 300 years .
that he did not take advantage of this unique opportunity goes to show what a poor take on reality he has .
but he viewed himself as more than a ' mere ' politician ; he considered himself more a revolutionary who claimed the moral authority to bend the constitutional state at will and to disregard the conventions of democracy , " the paper wrote . switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung expressed similar sentiments .
" the government not only lost the election because it was confronted with an ' exemplary , comprehensive attack front , ' but also because many polish people were tired of the prime minister 's aggressive , confrontational manner .
in addition , the government 's record was nothing to brag about .
it slid from one domestic crisis into another .
it hardly contributed to the current economic boom in the country and missed the chance to tackle the required reforms .
kaczynski 's government was wrought with scandals , staff suspensions , resignations , allegations , and tactical confusion .
his government stirred up a lot of dust , but did not accomplish much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski lost overwhelmingly the german business paper handelsblatt from düsseldorf looked ahead : " poland is going to need a little time to shed its historical sensitivities , overcome the burdens of transformation and truly become a part of europe .
we should give this country that chance and remain patient - particularly those of us in germany .
we have a historical responsibility toward poland , and we are benefiting tremendously from its integration .
this process will likely go faster with donald tusk at the helm .
it will , in any case , be more pleasant , " the paper noted . the dutch paper de volkskrant took a pragmatic view of poland 's election results .
" it would be a misconception to think that the mood will change completely in the country .
patriotic sentiments are and will remain intense .
warsaw will not suddenly start greeting brussels warmly .
-lsb- tusk 's -rsb- civic platform is a -lrb- neo- -rrb- liberal party with a significant conservative wing .
in addition , president lech kaczynski -lsb- jaroslaw 's twin brother -rsb- is in office until 2010 .
he can to block proposed legislation with his presidential veto power .
while it 's possible to override a veto with a three-fifths majority , frequent repeats could lead to a form of static warfare .
then , poland would be jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski -lrb- jaroslaw 's twin -rrb- is to remain in office until 2010 france 's le figaro was also hesitant to believe poland 's ties with europe would improve overnight .
" after two years of repeated crises , the polish people have now mobilized themselves to bring to an end to a chaotic campaign of shrugging off the country 's legacy of communism , an anticorruption battle worthy of an orwell novel and diplomatic posturings that have left the european union on the edge of a nervous breakdown . … it 's now up to the -lsb- civic platform -rsb- to reach out and repair the damage .
the party has already said its mission is to ' reestablish poland in the heart of europe ' - a declaration of intention received with caution by observers who remember that the conservative wing of this formation was , for a long time , on the same wave length as the kaczynski brothers . " austria 's die presse wrote : " as president and prime minister , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski stole … one thing from all of europe : time .
their election debacle gives us hope that the senseless blockades , historical blame games and embarrassing demands from warsaw will finally come to an end .

" it could have been so easy for the nationalist conservative kaczynski to win .
his country is currently experiencing … its most fortunate , happiest time in 300 years .
that he did not take advantage of this unique opportunity goes to show what a poor take on reality he has .

" the government not only lost the election because it was confronted with an ' exemplary , comprehensive attack front , ' but also because many polish people were tired of the prime minister 's aggressive , confrontational manner .
in addition , the government 's record was nothing to brag about .
it slid from one domestic crisis into another .
it hardly contributed to the current economic boom in the country and missed the chance to tackle the required reforms .

the study determined that the lack of specialists was " economically relevant " and that the problem was " putting the brakes on growth , " otremba added . he said the phenomenon was attributable to a structural problem in the german labor market .
the study found that the information and communication industry was particularly endangered because of the lack of specialists in mathematics and computer science .
" we are urgently searching for new workers , " august-wilhelm scheer , the president of bitkom , the federation representing the it , telecommunications and new media industry in germany , told reporters at a computer systems fair in munich on monday .
according to bitkom statistics , around 57 percent of information and communication enterprises needed more personnel while 62 percent admitted that their companies were suffering due to the lack of specialists .
the federation estimates that there are currently 30,000 to 40,000 free places in the it industry .
scheer called on german universities to train more specialists and to promote exceptional students to businesses , as well as for an increased effort to bring in highly-skilled foreigners .
" we need these highly-intelligent foreigners , " scheer said .
" they will help us secure our future . "
existing specialists may flee germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if businesses suffer , their specialists may leave he also warned that if those companies in germany who are lacking specialists did not find people to take the positions , then the enterprises would suffer and the specialists they did have would look for work outside germany .
the federal ministry for economic affairs , which commissioned the iw study , said that it was particularly concerned with the lack of highly-skilled specialists in the industries which are important for germany 's technological progress such as mechanical engineering , the metal and electrical industries and automotive construction .
the bad news is that the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better , with germany 's aging population exacerbating the problem in the future .
statistics show around 970,000 school leavers this year compared with around 800,000 first graders .
martin wansleben , the managing director of the german chamber of commerce and industry , told reporters that the numbers of jobs open to school leavers and qualified parents must be increased and that german institutions should increase their promotion of vocational training schemes .
he also added that more should be done to open up the job market for qualified foreigners . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we decisively reject these unfounded accusations , " an exterior ministry spokesperson said in beijing .
" we will apply for a clarification from the german government . " remberg told a conference on industrial espionage in berlin on monday that the nature and frequency of the attacks on german companies pointed to a concerted targeting by chinese hackers backed by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel addressed the cyber row on her visit to beijing " in our view , state chinese interests stand behind these digital attacks , " said remberg .
" supporting this view is the intensity , structure and scope of the attacks , and above all the targets , which include -lsb- german -rsb- authorities and companies . " remberg 's statements come barely two months after the german media reported incidents of cyber-spying at german government ministries by computer hackers believed to be linked to the chinese army .

the study determined that the lack of specialists was " economically relevant " and that the problem was " putting the brakes on growth , " otremba added . he said the phenomenon was attributable to a structural problem in the german labor market .
the study found that the information and communication industry was particularly endangered because of the lack of specialists in mathematics and computer science .
" we are urgently searching for new workers , " august-wilhelm scheer , the president of bitkom , the federation representing the it , telecommunications and new media industry in germany , told reporters at a computer systems fair in munich on monday .
according to bitkom statistics , around 57 percent of information and communication enterprises needed more personnel while 62 percent admitted that their companies were suffering due to the lack of specialists .
the federation estimates that there are currently 30,000 to 40,000 free places in the it industry .
scheer called on german universities to train more specialists and to promote exceptional students to businesses , as well as for an increased effort to bring in highly-skilled foreigners .
" we need these highly-intelligent foreigners , " scheer said .
" they will help us secure our future . "
existing specialists may flee germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if businesses suffer , their specialists may leave he also warned that if those companies in germany who are lacking specialists did not find people to take the positions , then the enterprises would suffer and the specialists they did have would look for work outside germany .
the federal ministry for economic affairs , which commissioned the iw study , said that it was particularly concerned with the lack of highly-skilled specialists in the industries which are important for germany 's technological progress such as mechanical engineering , the metal and electrical industries and automotive construction .
the bad news is that the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better , with germany 's aging population exacerbating the problem in the future .
statistics show around 970,000 school leavers this year compared with around 800,000 first graders .
martin wansleben , the managing director of the german chamber of commerce and industry , told reporters that the numbers of jobs open to school leavers and qualified parents must be increased and that german institutions should increase their promotion of vocational training schemes .
he also added that more should be done to open up the job market for qualified foreigners . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with this upcoming trilateral meeting between the chinese foreign minister yang jiechi , india ’ s external affairs minister pranab mukherjee and their russian counterpart sergei lavrov in china ’ s north eastern city of harbin , a fresh round of dialogue will commence .
professor ajay patnayak , an expert on russian affairs at jawahar lal nehru university in new delhi , explained that the meeting was significant because " china is an emerging power , a neighbour with which india has some border problems " .
he added it would be " good for india to have good neighbourly ties with china " and explained that russia was an old strategic ally for india .
" they share certain common perceptions in central asia and south asia . "
issues of common concern liu jianchao , the chinese foreign ministry spokesman , hinted the focus would be on exchanging views about major international and regional " issues of common concern " .
professor patnayak explained that one of these issues would be terrorism .
" there are small pockets of terrorism both in china and in india , and also in russia and its neighbourhood , which are threatening their regional stability . "
he said they would also discuss the " multi-polar world order , with no power centres " .
energy-hungry the three sides will also explore further co-operation in various fields , including trade , infrastructure , health , it and biotechnology and especially energy .
energy-hungry india and china have in the past expressed an interest in russia 's rich oil and gas reserves .
" russia is the number one supplier of energy , gas and coal .
and russia has possibilities to supply energy to both china and to india .
we see that chinese and indian companies have already begun to explore certain fields in siberia and sakhalin , " explained yevgenii kozhokin , the director of the russian institute of strategic studies in moscow .
counterbalance to us ?
every time the three sides come together for talks , observers speculate that the meetings are aimed at forming an alliance to counter the influence of the united states in the region .
however , professor kozhokin ruled out such notions : " i don ’ t think the three ministers are thinking of confrontation with the us .
i think they have a positive agenda .
all these countries have good ties with the us .
so i don ’ t think they are trying to block the hegemony of the us . "
professor patnayak from india agrees only to a certain extent : " they wo n't build this up as a forum against the us , but in the long-term perspective , they would like to strengthen their position and limit outside interference , and they would like to solve their problems by co-operating among themselves . "
the talks will last until friday .
according to a russian foreign ministry statement , the three sides are expected to sign a joint communiqué , which will state their common vision and identify concrete ways of interacting in future . disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic thai election the international crisis group has published a new report on the upcoming polls in thailand .

professor ajay patnayak , an expert on russian affairs at jawahar lal nehru university in new delhi , explained that the meeting was significant because " china is an emerging power , a neighbour with which india has some border problems " .

i think they have a positive agenda .
all these countries have good ties with the us .
so i don ’ t think they are trying to block the hegemony of the us . "
professor patnayak from india agrees only to a certain extent : " they wo n't build this up as a forum against the us , but in the long-term perspective , they would like to strengthen their position and limit outside interference , and they would like to solve their problems by co-operating among themselves .

" we decisively reject these unfounded accusations , " an exterior ministry spokesperson said in beijing .
" we will apply for a clarification from the german government . " remberg told a conference on industrial espionage in berlin on monday that the nature and frequency of the attacks on german companies pointed to a concerted targeting by chinese hackers backed by the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel addressed the cyber row on her visit to beijing " in our view , state chinese interests stand behind these digital attacks , " said remberg .
" supporting this view is the intensity , structure and scope of the attacks , and above all the targets , which include -lsb- german -rsb- authorities and companies . " remberg 's statements come barely two months after the german media reported incidents of cyber-spying at german government ministries by computer hackers believed to be linked to the chinese army .
the issue was raised by german chancellor angela merkel when she met chinese president wen jiabao in beijing in august .
china denied the allegations and said all " hacking " behavior was prohibited . since the german reports surfaced , other countries , including the united states and britain , have admitted that their own government agencies have been targeted by hackers backed by the chinese state .
the growing number of allegations thrown china 's way has prompted some to speculate whether a new front of warfare is beginning to open up between states , via the internet . chinese cyber-war theory addressed this belief was addressed by remberg at the berlin conference , but he refused to say whether he thought china 's use of spying technology was part of an internet-based international destabilization campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military secrets are needed to advance china 's forces " some people call this the chinese cyber war , " remberg said , adding that it was important to differentiate between legitimate attempts to gather information on competitors by chinese companies and state-led industrial espionage . however , he was less reticent when it came to his assertions that china was behind the increasing numbers of attempted and successful breaches of internet security in germany . " across the world the people 's republic of china is intensively gathering political , military , corporate-strategic and scientific information in order to bridge their technological gaps as quickly as possible , " remberg said . china 's interest in industrial and government secrets , remberg added , was driven by its desire to become a top global economic power .
to catch up with the west , china needed " a massive transfer of high technology , " he said . astonishing intensity of cyber-attacks on germany remberg astonished the berlin conference by revealing that attacks on german ministries and authorities were being discovered every other day and that the perpetrators appeared unconcerned that the attacks were being discovered .
" every one or two days , new attacks are detected , " he said . he also suggested that china was using classic espionage methods to launch its spy attacks , albeit with the latest technology .
traditional infiltration by agents still occurred , he said , but instead of the spies gaining access to government buildings in person , they now remotely accessed the information they needed from legitimate bases within germany via the internet . " the diplomatic representative offices and chinese media agencies in germany enable the hidden deployment of intelligence agents , " remberg said .
firms in joint ventures with chinese firms were also at risk , he added . spies of many nations after german secrets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spies from many nations are operating in germany as many experts have previously concluded , remberg also said he was sure that the chinese were not alone in hacking german sites .
" russian intelligence agencies are making great efforts in germany to get important information , using both open and conspiratorial methods , in military , political , economic and scientific areas , " he said . remberg also named iran , north korea , pakistan and syria as countries that had sent intelligence agents to germany to procure " dual-use " machinery - which can be used in both civil and military applications - and know-how for illegal weapons technology , including nuclear technology . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 , for an eu-wide work permit .
the european " blue card " will simplify entry requirements for highly skilled workers seeking employment in the 27-member bloc . the blue card is designed to attract professionals such as indian computer workers and chinese engineers , most of whom currently prefer to seek employment in the united states , australia or canada . " we are not good enough at attracting highly skilled people , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , who along with franco frattini , eu commissioner in charge of immigration issues , presented the blue card plan in strasbourg in tuesday . too few skilled foreigners according to frattini , highly skilled foreign workers make up 10 percent of the workforce in australia , and 3.5 percent in the us .
" in the eu it 's only 1.7 percent , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue card is named after the blue flag of the eu to qualify for a blue card , applicants would have to have a work contract , professional qualifications and a minimum salary level at least three times the level of existing minimum wages in that country , plus health insurance . in return , its holders would have the right to work across the 27-nation bloc in addition to access to social security , tax and housing benefits .
blue card holders would also be allowed to bring their families to join them within months of applying . the proposals also include special provisions for young professionals and seek to limit the extent to which companies can recruit skilled workers from developing countries that are suffering from so-called " brain drain . " overwhelming bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner franco frattini has been pushing strongly for the blue card according to the commission , member states should set up a simplified " one-stop-shop " system quickly granting white-collar workers a work permit .

but one church has decided to take control and move to where the believers are . these are hard times for christianity in europe .
while it is the world 's most popular faith with some 2.1 billion followers , the recruitment drive in the old world has been in the slow lane for some time .
church attendance is down all over the western world and in germany , rising maintenance costs and dwindling funds have seen parishes shut down churches and sell the buildings for commercial use .
church dug up , ready to roll coining a phrase that references a rival in the faith stakes - " if the mountain wo n't come to muhammad , muhammad must go to the mountain " - one church in germany has given up waiting for its flock to return and has gone of in search of pastures new .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heuersdorf church is making way for a new mine for a church to physically be uprooted and moved , there has to be a pretty good reason and while a lack of congregation may be a good argument , it is not usually enough to justify moving something which weighs a fair few tons .
the reason behind the relocation of the heuersdorf church has as much to do with commerce as it does with spreading the word .
mining company footing the bill the 660-ton stone church is being moved because it was sitting on extensive deposits of lignite , or brown coal , a fuel used in power generation plants .
after an extensive legal battle with the mibrag mining company , the church and 59 residents of the village will be moved 12 kilometers -lrb- 7.5 miles -rrb- to land near leipzig in eastern germany .
the church 's journey to its new home will begin on wednesday .
the 750-year-old church , complete with tiled bell tower , was separated from its foundations and lifted 1.5 meters -lrb- five feet -rrb- onto a massive rolling platform on monday .
the painstakingly slow journey to the village of borna is expected to take about a week at a cost of three million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- .
time will tell if the miraculous relocation rekindles the belief of the lapsed locals . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are not good enough at attracting highly skilled people , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , who along with franco frattini , eu commissioner in charge of immigration issues , presented the blue card plan in strasbourg in tuesday . too few skilled foreigners according to frattini , highly skilled foreign workers make up 10 percent of the workforce in australia , and 3.5 percent in the us .

" the olympic bid offers an outstanding chance to present german sports on the international stage and reinforce the image of germany as a modern country , " schäuble said . bach , who is also on the ioc executive board , said " the dosb welcomes the support from the government and the state of bavaria .

it said : " the new long-term assumption for net migration to the united kingdom is plus 190,000 each year compared with plus 145,000 a year in the previous projections .
" this increase is partly due to taking account of data for two new years - 2004 and 2005 - where net migration to the uk has been at record levels , and partly because of the impact of methodological changes following recent announcements of improvements to the estimation of international migration .

the drug is highly addictive , blights lives , and destroys communities - and according to sean price , chief constable of cleveland , use is now at its highest ever level .
mr price , who has nearly 30 years in the force , told an investigation by bbc file on 4 : " this is the third time since i have been in the police service that crack cocaine has emerged as the drug of choice . "
it is clear that there are very few parts of the uk that have n't experienced some levels of crack cocaine abuse sean price , chief constable of cleveland he added : " i think this probably the highest level of usage i have seen in those three times . "
its danger is no longer confined to the inner cities , he says .
" speaking to my colleagues it is clear that there are very few parts of the uk that have n't experienced some levels of crack cocaine abuse , " said mr price .
his force is at the forefront of the war on crack in the north east with an intensive effort - nicknamed " a dealer a day " - shutting known crack dens and disrupting gangs .
cleveland and other forces dread the gun and gang violence , often with connections to international networks , that can accompany increased drug dealing and abuse .
the police face a tough time controlling this lucrative trade .
like other forces , cleveland 's officers are faced with localities , such as gresham in middlesbrough , where long-suffering residents see crack houses prosper as low prices allow almost anyone to smoke " rock " in homemade pipes .
when i come through brixton at almost any time of the day you usually see groups of drugs dealers valerie shawcross , member of the greater london assembly former addict richard affleck explained : " what helped crack evolve was cheaper prices - you could get £ 10 rocks or £ 5 rocks .
you could get one really good pipe or two average pipes . "
therapists say the drug creates a psychological dependency where one hit is never enough .
the result is a criminal and chaotic lifestyle for addicts who need to binge on the drug to satisfy their cravings .
it creates a ready market for ingenious gangs to exploit .
while in the north east police are trying to stop the gangs getting a toehold , in some parts of london they have taken root .
valerie shawcross , a labour member of the greater london assembly , explained how blatant the trade is even on a busy high street .
" when i come through brixton in the evening , in fact at almost any time of the day , you usually see groups of drugs dealers .
" you can see transactions taking place and this is at one of the busiest transport interchanges in london .
" you 've got commuters and mums and pensioners , thousands of people standing side by side with drug dealers . "
crack samples back in the north east , the dealers have got into marketing by targeting heroin addicts , including prostitutes , with free samples of crack .
according to jessie jo jacobs , who runs a treatment centre in stockton to help women out of a lifestyle of prostitution and drug addiction , this targeting has been catastrophic for many recovering addicts .
crack cocaine had changed the culture of prostitution , she said , adding : " the ones who are working if they 're on a binge they 'll have to go out and perform acts seven , eight , nine and 10 times a night .
" a lot of women who had come off the streets have actually gone back onto the streets .
" as crack 's being introduced into their lives they 've actually gone back over again which is really sad to see . "

mr rudd led mr howard by 58 % to 42 % - a gap of 16 points - according to a newspoll published in the australian daily newspaper .
the gap stood at 12 points a week ago , after mr howard pledged tax cuts on the opening day of his campaign .

mr howard , the 68-year-old leader of the liberal party , is seeking a fifth three-year term in the top job .
but 50-year-old labor party leader mr rudd has led him consistently in polling for several months .
' very cunning ' the opposition leader , who has also unveiled a tax plan , played down the results of the poll .

" i 've got to win 16 seats and what i also know is i 'm up against a very clever and very cunning politician .

health minister tony abbott , meanwhile , described the poll as " radically at odds with the experience that we 've had in the streets as government members over the last couple of weeks " .
the poll , taken just before sunday 's debate between the two contenders , was based on a telephone survey of 1,706 voters .

some 35 % said one doctor was enough and 17 % said permission should not needed at all , an independent poll carried out for the group abortion rights found .
a total of 83 % of the 1,000 people polled saw abortion as a woman 's right .
this month marks the 40th anniversary of the introduction of the 1967 abortion act .
under the terms of the law , a woman must obtain the permission of two doctors before she is allowed a termination , which can be carried out up until 24 weeks .
the poll , which was carried out over the telephone by the market research group gfk nop , is said to be the first to ask the public their thoughts on the " two doctor " rule .

the results process was besieged by delays and saw some 140,000 ballot papers rejected .
it is thought the report will blame confusion over who was in charge .
it is also expected to indicate that the " logical choice " could be to shift power over scottish parliament elections from westminster to holyrood .
election expert ron gould has spearheaded the inquiry , which was sanctioned by the electoral commission .
it will suggest politicians get their heads together while floating the prospect of devolving power to holyrood brian taylor bbc scotland political editor reliving election night chaos mr gould is due to deliver his findings at a news conference in edinburgh at 1100 bst .
the elections saw the introduction of a new design of ballot paper for the parliament vote and a new voting system for the council seats .
in the aftermath of the vote , many blamed the redesign for causing the fiasco .
mr gould , who is the former assistant chief electoral officer of canada , was allowed , along with his team , to scrutinise the rejected ballot papers .
while westminster is in charge of overseeing the holyrood elections , the scottish parliament has control of the council votes .
it is thought the gould report will say there should be a single team in charge .
bbc scotland political editor brian taylor said : " it will suggest politicians get their heads together while floating the prospect of devolving power to holyrood .
" the report will also accuse politicians of paying too much attention to their own party interests instead of the needs of the voters . "

the results process was besieged by delays and saw some 140,000 ballot papers rejected .
it is thought the report will blame confusion over who was in charge .
it is also expected to indicate that the " logical choice " could be to shift power over scottish parliament elections from westminster to holyrood .
election expert ron gould has spearheaded the inquiry , which was sanctioned by the electoral commission .
it will suggest politicians get their heads together while floating the prospect of devolving power to holyrood brian taylor bbc scotland political editor reliving election night chaos mr gould is due to deliver his findings at a news conference in edinburgh at 1100 bst .
the elections saw the introduction of a new design of ballot paper for the parliament vote and a new voting system for the council seats .
in the aftermath of the vote , many blamed the redesign for causing the fiasco .
mr gould , who is the former assistant chief electoral officer of canada , was allowed , along with his team , to scrutinise the rejected ballot papers .
while westminster is in charge of overseeing the holyrood elections , the scottish parliament has control of the council votes .
it is thought the gould report will say there should be a single team in charge .
bbc scotland political editor brian taylor said : " it will suggest politicians get their heads together while floating the prospect of devolving power to holyrood .
" the report will also accuse politicians of paying too much attention to their own party interests instead of the needs of the voters . "
first minister alex salmond has previously said he wanted a judicial review to be carried out into the election after the findings of the current investigation were published .

the 48-year-old had just finished a routine with partner jonathan roberts and fainted during judges ' comments .
the abc programme cut to a commercial break as she recovered , and when the show returned , host tom bergeron told viewers she was fine .
the us version of strictly come dancing is currently drawing regular audiences of up to 35 million people .
' stop breathing ' abc spokeswoman amy astley said : " she was laughing and then sank like a stone .
everyone froze . "
bergeron said : " i want to just quote her exactly .
the first words out of her mouth when she saw us all leaning over her were , ' oh , crap . " '
osmond , part of the famous singing family , was well enough to be awarded seven marks from each of the four judges for the routine .
she explained later in the programme that " once in a while that happens to me when i get winded .
i stop breathing . "
the singer was expected to be given a medical examination as a precaution .
the us and uk versions , which are currently airing alongside each other , both feature len goodman and bruno tonioli on the judging panel .

it comes after independent councillor rhiannon hughes and her entire cabinet were ousted following a vote of no confidence on monday .
ms hughes had been blamed by opponents after critical reports into the county education service by inspectors estyn and a consultative body .
the cabinet could be re-instated , but under new leadership .
ms hughes , said she was " disappointed " to lose the vote of no confidence by 23 votes to 20 and pleaded with the assembly government not to step in .
a council spokesman said a new leader must be elected within three weeks .
in the meantime , the council 's chief executive ian millar has been delegated responsibility to make executive decisions , which would have been taken by the council cabinet .
he tried to distance himself at the time the reports came out but he can not because he is the chief executive ann jones am on ian millar he will be drawing up the education recovery plan with his senior management team , which has a deadline of 5 november .
but ann jones , labour am for the vale of clwyd who called for ms hughes to go before the vote of no confidence , said she believed mr millar should also consider his position .
" he tried to distance himself at the time the reports came out but he can not because he is the chief executive , " she said .
" it is not for me to say whether he should go or not but i think he should be honest with himself as to whether denbighshire local education authority can provide for the children of denbighshire and , at the moment , i do n't think they can . "
ms jones also continued her call for the assembly government and the education minister jane hutt to intervene .
on thursday , the council , which is run by a coalition of independents and conservatives , received a notice of motion signed by 13 members expressing a vote of no confidence in ms hughes and her cabinet .
it was the second such motion within a year .
denbighshire council independents : 18 conservatives : 9 labour : 7 plaid cymru : 7 democratic alliance of wales : 3 non-aligned : 3 ms hughes survived the previous vote against her , but she recently lost the support of her coalition partners after the conservatives joined with labour and plaid cymru .
speaking after the result , she said that good work had been done in denbighshire 's schools , and she would " do the same again " .
asked whether the welsh assembly government should step in and take charge , she said : " i 'm making an absolute heartfelt plea to the assembly - please do n't intervene in denbighshire . "
she added : " we 're now at a position where we have all the information that 's needed to move forward .
there are lots of really good educational things going on in denbighshire . "
she added she " felt sorry " for council officers who " will not have political direction in the next few weeks " .
a crisis meeting held by the council last week accepted " radical change " was needed to improve education in the county and said it would " rigorously implement " the estyn action plan .
" ineffective leadership " two recent reports have criticised the education service and its " ineffective leadership " .
in september , a highly critical report by estyn found failures at the council to address poor performance .
it followed a consultants ' report , which criticised standards in schools .
estyn 's 35-page report said children 's educational performance was below average at the ages of seven , 11 and at 16 when they take their gcses .
in 2006 , denbighshire also came 19th of the 22 authorities in wales for the percentage of students gaining two as / a levels .
the council said it had already begun to address some of the issues and had begun to invest £ 470,000 a year from 2006-07 on to improve attainment at key stage level 3 .
it also said it had improved partnership working with the social services and tackled leadership problems at schools with the worst under attainment .

nottingham city council is worried that rail services to london will not be fast enough when east midlands trains takes over next month .
the new operator has insisted its new timetable will be an improvement and is still open to public consultation .
most trains take two hours to get to london , especially at peak times , city spokesman stephen barker said .
mr barker said the two-hour journey from nottingham to london is not good enough .
it seems the company has decided that the nottingham route will have all the stops stephen barker , nottingham city council " it will soon take several hours to get to paris from london -lrb- on eurostar -rrb- so it seems ridiculous that it will take two hours to get to london from nottingham , " he said .
" nottingham is a core city and a driver of the regional economy and we need fast connections to london .
" it seems the company has decided that the nottingham route will have all the stops .
the derby and sheffield trains are 10 minutes faster between leicester and london than the nottingham trains are . "
a spokesman for east midlands trains said : " in the morning the train service is n't any worse and in the evening we are speeding up the journeys between london and nottingham . "
east midlands trains has promised faster journeys to sheffield - just over two hours - and leicester just over one hour from london as part of a new timetable being introduced in december 2008 .
it is also planning additional early morning trains from derby to cater for morning peak demand and a new daily direct service between london and lincoln .
the new franchise is a combination of the existing midland mainline services from london 's st pancras and the eastern section of central trains .
