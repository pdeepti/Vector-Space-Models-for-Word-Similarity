" abbas seeks halt to israeli settlements as the conference kicked off , abbas called on israel to freeze all settlements in the palestinian territories to allow the newly re-launched peace process to gain a foothold . " i expect a complete halt of all settlement activities without exception , the dismantlement of the 127 wildcat settlements set up since 2001 , the reopening of palestinian institutions closed in jerusalem , the lifting of military barrages , a halt to construction of the separation barrier and the release of prisoners , " abbas told the conference . at a us-sponsored meeting in annapolis , maryland last month , israel and the palestinians pledged to seek a peace deal by the end of next year , relaunching negotiations frozen for seven years . dw staff -lrb- jen / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but more are turning away from traditional forms of religion to find their own path . seventy percent of adults in germany said they were religious , while 18 percent of these are " deeply religious , " reported the bertelsmann foundation in a study to be published on tuesday , dec .
18 . those who characterized themselves as " deeply religious " said they regularly attend worship services , pray often and have deep religious convictions .
another 29 percent of germans identified themselves as not religious . " we can definitely not confirm the long-term extinction of religion that comes up again and again , " said the leader of the study , martin rieger .
" the fact is that there is great stability of religious consciousness among a wide spectrum of social groups , which is very diverse . " the study suggests that young people between 18 and 29 years of age in germany have stronger religious convictions than their parents , though they do n't necessarily act on them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholics showed relatively strong interest in astrology forty-one percent of those surveyed from the 18-29 age bracket said they believe in god and life after death , more than in any other age group .
just over half of the young people said they are religious -lrb- 14 percent highly religious -rrb- , though 50 percent said they seldom or never pray . spirituality strays from tradition forms every fifth person surveyed in germany said that faith should be assembled from various religious teachings according to one 's personal opinion .
furthermore , 11 percent of catholics also reported a belief in astrology , while the number was significantly lower - 6 percent - among non-church members . the stereotype of the elderly being especially religious seems to be only partially true .
one third of those over 60 said they did n't believe in life after death while 18 percent regularly attend a religious service . more than twice as many of the self-professing " deeply religious " germans belonged to the catholic church as those who belong to the protestant church .
germany recognizes both the catholic and a protestant churches and imposes a tax on its members , which is paid back to the churches . approximately two thirds of the country officially belong to one of the two state churches , though membership does n't necessarily have an impact on personal religious convictions or church attendance , according to the study .
one sixth of church members reported being " not religious . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam is the third largest religious group in germany approximately 4 percent of people in germany are muslim - the third largest religious group next to catholicism and protestantism - while 0.3 percent are buddhist and 0.2 percent jewish . former gdr less spiritual than west a divide was apparent in the study between eastern and western germany .
while 78 percent of western germans identified themselves as religious , 21 percent of these as highly religious , the numbers were 36 percent and 8 percent , respectively , in eastern germany .
as in most communist countries , the government took an antagonistic view of religion in the former east germany . differences between the genders were also revealed by the study , with 20 percent of women and 16 percent of men reporting deep religiosity .
contrarily , 23 percent of women and 34 percent of men said they were not religious . the bertelsmann foundation posed nearly 100 questions pertaining to religion to 21,000 adults in 21 countries . nigeria , brazil , india and morocco reported with over 90 percent the highest rates of religiosity .
in europe , germany ranks behind italy and poland , but ahead of great britain and france in terms of the number of practicing believers . in the united states , 89 percent of those surveyed characterized themselves as religious , 62 percent as deeply religious . religious conviction is n't necessarily tied to church membership , according to the report catholics showed relatively strong interest in astrology islam is the third largest religious group in germany dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , pledged $ 7.4 billion -lrb- 5.15 billion euros -rrb- for the palestinians at a donor conference in paris .
will it save the region from a catastrophe ? at the start of the conference on monday , dec .
17 , palestinian president mahmud abbas urged the international community to step up financial aid to the palestinians or risk a " catastrophe . " " without this support , without the payment of aid that will allow the palestinian treasury to fulfill its role , we will be facing a total catastrophe in the west bank and gaza , " abbas told the opening ceremony , at a conference center near the arc de triomphe in paris .
abbas had asked for $ 5.6 billion by 2010 to help develop a viable economy for a future palestinian state . " we are way ahead of this amount , " said palestinian prime minister salam fayyad , whom abbas appointed as palestinian prime minister when hamas seized armed control of the gaza strip . " that 's the most important thing , " fayyad added .
" we see this as an important vote of confidence from the international community .
this conference provided endorsement for our vision of statehood . " the donor conference was the biggest meeting of its kind since 1996 .
some 90 delegations had announced pledges at the one-day gathering .
of the sum promised , $ 3.4 billion is to be directed to the palestinian government 's 2008 budget . tony blair , middle east envoy for the diplomatic " quartet " , said the money would be used for " building the capacity and the institutions for the -lrb- palestinian -rrb- state . " " over the next few months what we have got to show to people is that we are capable of making the difference on the ground , " he said . eu leads donation pledges the european commission pledged to donate $ 650 million in aid for 2008 , while britain announced a three-year aid package of up to $ 490 million .
opening the conference earlier , french president nicolas sarkozy pledged $ 300 million over three years .
germany promised $ 200 million by 2010 and sweden offered $ 300 million in 2007 and 2008 . the united states promised $ 555 million for 2008 .
saudi arabia was to provide $ 500 million over three years , diplomats said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the money was to support the reform and development program of the palestinian government . but she also called for israel to cease blockading the palestinian economy and to halt the building of settlements in the west bank . " the development plan can only be effective if the economic development of palestine is no longer hindered , if the building of settlements by israel is stopped and if the inner-palestinian divide can be overcome , " she said . the money was intended to improve the miserable conditions under which palestinians were living and to support the israeli-palestinian peace process , wieczorek-zeul said from berlin . sarkozy proposal gets rise from hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can high-level meetings help bring about mideast peace ?
wieczorek-zeul 's calls for a halt to israeli settlements in the west bank and gaza was echoed by french president nicolas sarkozy . in his address to the opening ceremony , sarkozy said " the paris conference must accompany the progressive construction of a modern state . " he called for the creation of an international force to beef up the palestinian security services , " when the time comes and when the conditions are right . " " the palestinian services need to reform , to become more professional .
in parallel , israel must withdraw from the west bank , " sarkozy said . the radical islamist group hamas slammed the french proposal , saying an international force in the mideast would amount to " blatant interference " in internal affairs . israel claims commitment to independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom of movement for palestinians is a big issue .
here , a gaza check-point israel responded by saying it is committed to the establishment of an independent and viable palestinian state . israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said israel wants " the obstacles to the palestinian economy and daily life to be removed . " " we have no desire to control palestinian lives , " she added .
" we do not want the image of israel in the palestinian mind to be a soldier at a checkpoint . " abbas seeks halt to israeli settlements as the conference kicked off , abbas called on israel to freeze all settlements in the palestinian territories to allow the newly re-launched peace process to gain a foothold . " i expect a complete halt of all settlement activities without exception , the dismantlement of the 127 wildcat settlements set up since 2001 , the reopening of palestinian institutions closed in jerusalem , the lifting of military barrages , a halt to construction of the separation barrier and the release of prisoners , " abbas told the conference . at a us-sponsored meeting in annapolis , maryland last month , israel and the palestinians pledged to seek a peace deal by the end of next year , relaunching negotiations frozen for seven years . dw staff -lrb- jen / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this potentially stinky question arose when police in the western german city of bielefeld stopped a man carrying two heavy garbage bags stuffed with athletic socks . at least the 172 pairs of soccer socks were clean .
one shudders to imagine the collective smell of 344 dirty athletic socks .
in fact , the socks in question were brand-stinking new .
and that left a 30-year-old man with some explaining to do , given that socks are normally considered a re-usable commodity .
police stopped the man as he walked down the street weighed down by two lumpy garbage bags on monday , dec .
17 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe he just did n't want to do laundry ... ever again one can only imagine the possible excuses : maybe he wanted to avoid doing laundry .
this general aversion to dealing with washing machines has led many other men to throw away what they could easily wash and reuse .
or maybe the man 's girlfriend had barred all stiff , stinky socks from entering the apartment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 17.12.2007 opinion : mandate for kyoto successor redeems bali failure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the progress made in bali was minimal at best , writes dw 's jens thurau .
but the mandate for a kyoto successor treaty by 2009 and the isolation of the us delegation were two lights in the dark . four reports from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , a g8 summit in heiligendamm , a nobel peace prize for al gore and a world climate council - never before has there been so much talk about reducing greenhouse gases as in 2007 . then the environment ministers meet in blistering hot bali with more journalists than have ever attended a climate conference and the result is a minimal consensus . not a single reduction goal for after 2010 is included in the final text , although such goals have been the topic of discussion for weeks - even months - and warnings from scientists who have been recognized with the very highest prizes can be found in a one-and-a-half-line footnote . it 's the same old situation that 's to blame : the sacred oath that the wealthy states made at the environment summit in rio in 1992 to set a good example in cutting emissions has n't been kept .
the industrialized countries have lost valuable time - or , like the us and russia , simply approach the climate challenge with demonstrative apathy . for this reason , the emerging nations refuse - not without good reason - to risk the bit of prosperity they 've finally managed to attain by making commitments to climate protection . practically every climate conference ends in the same way : the us , with countries like canada and russia on its side , facing off against the developing nations .
it was no different this time . in a certain way , the ambitious europeans also bear some of the guilt .
they 're constantly naming the most extensive goals , but only a few eu states - including germany - will fulfill the aims of the kyoto protocol by 2012 . poor countries are fully aware of that . nevertheless , two aspects make the results of the bali conference just barely tolerable .
as expected , the mandate was issued to negotiate a successor treaty to kyoto by 2009 .
and , as india proposed a text change at the end of the conference , the us delegation , which rejected the proposal , had to come to terms with their exaggerated arrogance toward the third world .
no one , not even eternal allies canada or russia , stood by the americans , who ultimately gave up their resistance . in the end , the at least symbolic victory should give the developing countries , which are most burdened by climate change , more self-confidence . dw-tv 's correspondent and environment expert jens thurau reported on the un climate conference from bali . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany hails bali outcome as better than expected german environment minister sigmar gabriel welcomed the outcome of the un climate change conference on saturday after a grueling all-night finish in which the negotiating countries ironed out a last-minute compromise .

but france signed a nuclear deal with libya last week and russia just delivered nuclear fuel to iran . frank-walter steinmeier opposed offering nuclear power assistance to middle eastern countries in an interview with the monday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . " i can not support using nuclear power as the solution to the world 's energy problems or scattering nuclear power stations over regions that lack the competence to deal with this technology and where there is insufficient certainty about political stability , " steinmeier said . he had been asked about his opinion on the deal french president nicolas sarkozy signed last week with libyan president moammar el gadhafi to deliver one or more nuclear reactors to the northern african country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , seen here with gadhafi , has promised nuclear reactors to libya however , steinmeier conceded that certain exceptions could be made .
he added that germany had been involved in negotiations with iran and offers had been made to provide assistance in establishing a civil nuclear power program in the country . russian sends nuclear fuel to iran the foreign minister 's statements coincide with the delivery of russian nuclear fuel to iran 's bushehr atomic power station on monday , which was confirmed by officials in both countries .
after several further deliveries , the plant will be ready for service in about six months . russia said that tehran had promised the fuel would not be used for military purposes and that it had called on iran to halt its uranium enrichment program . " we believe that qualitatively the new conditions have been created which will allow iran to take the steps which are demanded of it … for the restoration of trust in the peaceful nature of the iranian nuclear program , " said the russian foreign ministry in a statement . a top iranian official rejected the demand from russia , saying his country refused to halt its uranium enrichment program .
the united states and its allies have suspected that iran 's uranium program was being used to build an atomic weapon and not solely to provide its population with energy . russia 's delivery had been delayed for months due to international negotiations surrounding iran 's nuclear program and warnings from the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier does n't see eye to eye with the chancellor earlier this month , a us security report concluded that , contrary to previous information , iran had ceased its military nuclear program in 2003 . steinmeier said the report took off some pressure and that he saw " great readiness " on the part of the us to use the time gained by knowing that iran is n't currently a nuclear power , but doubted whether tehran would show the same willingness . steinmeier too russia-friendly , say critics in the same interview , the foreign minister took a soft line with russia , despite monday 's delivery of nuclear fuel , saying that germany should develop a thriving relationship with the former soviet power . " this perspective does n't require a certificate on the quality of the russian form of government , " he said , deliberately contradicting chancellor angela merkel , who commented following last month 's parliamentary elections that russia was n't a democracy . " without a doubt , a great degree of stability has been achieved in russia during the eight years of putin 's presidency , " added steinmeier , who is a member of germany 's social democratic party .
he has been accused by his christian democratic coalition partners of being too friendly with russia . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the birds with lowered levels of foxp2 imitated their tutor 's song imprecisely and sang more variably than other baby birds whose genetic levels had not been modified .

will it save the region from a catastrophe ? at the start of the conference on monday , dec .
17 , palestinian president mahmud abbas urged the international community to step up financial aid to the palestinians or risk a " catastrophe . " " without this support , without the payment of aid that will allow the palestinian treasury to fulfill its role , we will be facing a total catastrophe in the west bank and gaza , " abbas told the opening ceremony , at a conference center near the arc de triomphe in paris .
abbas had asked for $ 5.6 billion by 2010 to help develop a viable economy for a future palestinian state . " we are way ahead of this amount , " said palestinian prime minister salam fayyad , whom abbas appointed as palestinian prime minister when hamas seized armed control of the gaza strip . " that 's the most important thing , " fayyad added .
" we see this as an important vote of confidence from the international community .
this conference provided endorsement for our vision of statehood . " the donor conference was the biggest meeting of its kind since 1996 .
some 90 delegations had announced pledges at the one-day gathering .
of the sum promised , $ 3.4 billion is to be directed to the palestinian government 's 2008 budget . tony blair , middle east envoy for the diplomatic " quartet " , said the money would be used for " building the capacity and the institutions for the -lrb- palestinian -rrb- state . " " over the next few months what we have got to show to people is that we are capable of making the difference on the ground , " he said . eu leads donation pledges the european commission pledged to donate $ 650 million in aid for 2008 , while britain announced a three-year aid package of up to $ 490 million .

germany promised $ 200 million by 2010 and sweden offered $ 300 million in 2007 and 2008 . the united states promised $ 555 million for 2008 .
saudi arabia was to provide $ 500 million over three years , diplomats said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the money was to support the reform and development program of the palestinian government . but she also called for israel to cease blockading the palestinian economy and to halt the building of settlements in the west bank . " the development plan can only be effective if the economic development of palestine is no longer hindered , if the building of settlements by israel is stopped and if the inner-palestinian divide can be overcome , " she said . the money was intended to improve the miserable conditions under which palestinians were living and to support the israeli-palestinian peace process , wieczorek-zeul said from berlin . sarkozy proposal gets rise from hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can high-level meetings help bring about mideast peace ?
wieczorek-zeul 's calls for a halt to israeli settlements in the west bank and gaza was echoed by french president nicolas sarkozy . in his address to the opening ceremony , sarkozy said " the paris conference must accompany the progressive construction of a modern state . " he called for the creation of an international force to beef up the palestinian security services , " when the time comes and when the conditions are right . " " the palestinian services need to reform , to become more professional .
in parallel , israel must withdraw from the west bank , " sarkozy said . the radical islamist group hamas slammed the french proposal , saying an international force in the mideast would amount to " blatant interference " in internal affairs . israel claims commitment to independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom of movement for palestinians is a big issue .
here , a gaza check-point israel responded by saying it is committed to the establishment of an independent and viable palestinian state . israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said israel wants " the obstacles to the palestinian economy and daily life to be removed . " " we have no desire to control palestinian lives , " she added .
" we do not want the image of israel in the palestinian mind to be a soldier at a checkpoint . " abbas seeks halt to israeli settlements as the conference kicked off , abbas called on israel to freeze all settlements in the palestinian territories to allow the newly re-launched peace process to gain a foothold . " i expect a complete halt of all settlement activities without exception , the dismantlement of the 127 wildcat settlements set up since 2001 , the reopening of palestinian institutions closed in jerusalem , the lifting of military barrages , a halt to construction of the separation barrier and the release of prisoners , " abbas told the conference . at a us-sponsored meeting in annapolis , maryland last month , israel and the palestinians pledged to seek a peace deal by the end of next year , relaunching negotiations frozen for seven years . dw staff -lrb- jen / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but france signed a nuclear deal with libya last week and russia just delivered nuclear fuel to iran . frank-walter steinmeier opposed offering nuclear power assistance to middle eastern countries in an interview with the monday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . " i can not support using nuclear power as the solution to the world 's energy problems or scattering nuclear power stations over regions that lack the competence to deal with this technology and where there is insufficient certainty about political stability , " steinmeier said . he had been asked about his opinion on the deal french president nicolas sarkozy signed last week with libyan president moammar el gadhafi to deliver one or more nuclear reactors to the northern african country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , seen here with gadhafi , has promised nuclear reactors to libya however , steinmeier conceded that certain exceptions could be made .
he added that germany had been involved in negotiations with iran and offers had been made to provide assistance in establishing a civil nuclear power program in the country . russian sends nuclear fuel to iran the foreign minister 's statements coincide with the delivery of russian nuclear fuel to iran 's bushehr atomic power station on monday , which was confirmed by officials in both countries .
after several further deliveries , the plant will be ready for service in about six months . russia said that tehran had promised the fuel would not be used for military purposes and that it had called on iran to halt its uranium enrichment program . " we believe that qualitatively the new conditions have been created which will allow iran to take the steps which are demanded of it … for the restoration of trust in the peaceful nature of the iranian nuclear program , " said the russian foreign ministry in a statement . a top iranian official rejected the demand from russia , saying his country refused to halt its uranium enrichment program .
the united states and its allies have suspected that iran 's uranium program was being used to build an atomic weapon and not solely to provide its population with energy . russia 's delivery had been delayed for months due to international negotiations surrounding iran 's nuclear program and warnings from the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier does n't see eye to eye with the chancellor earlier this month , a us security report concluded that , contrary to previous information , iran had ceased its military nuclear program in 2003 . steinmeier said the report took off some pressure and that he saw " great readiness " on the part of the us to use the time gained by knowing that iran is n't currently a nuclear power , but doubted whether tehran would show the same willingness . steinmeier too russia-friendly , say critics in the same interview , the foreign minister took a soft line with russia , despite monday 's delivery of nuclear fuel , saying that germany should develop a thriving relationship with the former soviet power . " this perspective does n't require a certificate on the quality of the russian form of government , " he said , deliberately contradicting chancellor angela merkel , who commented following last month 's parliamentary elections that russia was n't a democracy . " without a doubt , a great degree of stability has been achieved in russia during the eight years of putin 's presidency , " added steinmeier , who is a member of germany 's social democratic party .
he has been accused by his christian democratic coalition partners of being too friendly with russia . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i can not support using nuclear power as the solution to the world 's energy problems or scattering nuclear power stations over regions that lack the competence to deal with this technology and where there is insufficient certainty about political stability , " steinmeier said . he had been asked about his opinion on the deal french president nicolas sarkozy signed last week with libyan president moammar el gadhafi to deliver one or more nuclear reactors to the northern african country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , seen here with gadhafi , has promised nuclear reactors to libya however , steinmeier conceded that certain exceptions could be made .
he added that germany had been involved in negotiations with iran and offers had been made to provide assistance in establishing a civil nuclear power program in the country . russian sends nuclear fuel to iran the foreign minister 's statements coincide with the delivery of russian nuclear fuel to iran 's bushehr atomic power station on monday , which was confirmed by officials in both countries .
after several further deliveries , the plant will be ready for service in about six months . russia said that tehran had promised the fuel would not be used for military purposes and that it had called on iran to halt its uranium enrichment program . " we believe that qualitatively the new conditions have been created which will allow iran to take the steps which are demanded of it … for the restoration of trust in the peaceful nature of the iranian nuclear program , " said the russian foreign ministry in a statement . a top iranian official rejected the demand from russia , saying his country refused to halt its uranium enrichment program .
the united states and its allies have suspected that iran 's uranium program was being used to build an atomic weapon and not solely to provide its population with energy . russia 's delivery had been delayed for months due to international negotiations surrounding iran 's nuclear program and warnings from the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier does n't see eye to eye with the chancellor earlier this month , a us security report concluded that , contrary to previous information , iran had ceased its military nuclear program in 2003 . steinmeier said the report took off some pressure and that he saw " great readiness " on the part of the us to use the time gained by knowing that iran is n't currently a nuclear power , but doubted whether tehran would show the same willingness . steinmeier too russia-friendly , say critics in the same interview , the foreign minister took a soft line with russia , despite monday 's delivery of nuclear fuel , saying that germany should develop a thriving relationship with the former soviet power . " this perspective does n't require a certificate on the quality of the russian form of government , " he said , deliberately contradicting chancellor angela merkel , who commented following last month 's parliamentary elections that russia was n't a democracy . " without a doubt , a great degree of stability has been achieved in russia during the eight years of putin 's presidency , " added steinmeier , who is a member of germany 's social democratic party .
he has been accused by his christian democratic coalition partners of being too friendly with russia . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to information from german public broadcaster ard , spirit made airbus an offer on friday , dec .
14 . expertise in carbon-fiber technology wichita , kansas based spirit is known for its expertise in modern carbon-fiber technology , which is expected to play an important role in the construction of future airbus models . the expertise , along with a desire to move some production to dollar-based zones , put spirit ahead of german bidders , reports said . avoiding the currency squeeze the head of airbus parent company eads , louis gallois , said earlier this month that the aerospace giant had " no choice " but to shift some production by airbus to dollar-based zones to soften the financial impact of a soaring euro . airbus sells its planes in dollars but its costs are in the european single currency .
with the dollar steadily depreciating against the euro , airbus earnings have plummeted . three german factories - in augsburg , nordenham and varung - are up for sale .

other than spirit , germany 's mt aerospace is bidding for the airbus factories .
but observers say the concern is too small for such a massive takeover . overall , airbus plans to shed 10,000 jobs and sell a total of six factories as part of its " power8 " restructuring plan , which was prompted by severe problems encountered with its a380 superjumbo jet program . spirit aerosysteems has a very close working relationship with airbus rival boeing , reports said .

but the mandate for a kyoto successor treaty by 2009 and the isolation of the us delegation were two lights in the dark . four reports from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , a g8 summit in heiligendamm , a nobel peace prize for al gore and a world climate council - never before has there been so much talk about reducing greenhouse gases as in 2007 . then the environment ministers meet in blistering hot bali with more journalists than have ever attended a climate conference and the result is a minimal consensus . not a single reduction goal for after 2010 is included in the final text , although such goals have been the topic of discussion for weeks - even months - and warnings from scientists who have been recognized with the very highest prizes can be found in a one-and-a-half-line footnote . it 's the same old situation that 's to blame : the sacred oath that the wealthy states made at the environment summit in rio in 1992 to set a good example in cutting emissions has n't been kept .
the industrialized countries have lost valuable time - or , like the us and russia , simply approach the climate challenge with demonstrative apathy . for this reason , the emerging nations refuse - not without good reason - to risk the bit of prosperity they 've finally managed to attain by making commitments to climate protection . practically every climate conference ends in the same way : the us , with countries like canada and russia on its side , facing off against the developing nations .
it was no different this time . in a certain way , the ambitious europeans also bear some of the guilt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 17.12.2007 opinion : mandate for kyoto successor redeems bali failure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the progress made in bali was minimal at best , writes dw 's jens thurau .
but the mandate for a kyoto successor treaty by 2009 and the isolation of the us delegation were two lights in the dark . four reports from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , a g8 summit in heiligendamm , a nobel peace prize for al gore and a world climate council - never before has there been so much talk about reducing greenhouse gases as in 2007 . then the environment ministers meet in blistering hot bali with more journalists than have ever attended a climate conference and the result is a minimal consensus . not a single reduction goal for after 2010 is included in the final text , although such goals have been the topic of discussion for weeks - even months - and warnings from scientists who have been recognized with the very highest prizes can be found in a one-and-a-half-line footnote . it 's the same old situation that 's to blame : the sacred oath that the wealthy states made at the environment summit in rio in 1992 to set a good example in cutting emissions has n't been kept .
the industrialized countries have lost valuable time - or , like the us and russia , simply approach the climate challenge with demonstrative apathy . for this reason , the emerging nations refuse - not without good reason - to risk the bit of prosperity they 've finally managed to attain by making commitments to climate protection . practically every climate conference ends in the same way : the us , with countries like canada and russia on its side , facing off against the developing nations .
it was no different this time . in a certain way , the ambitious europeans also bear some of the guilt .
they 're constantly naming the most extensive goals , but only a few eu states - including germany - will fulfill the aims of the kyoto protocol by 2012 . poor countries are fully aware of that . nevertheless , two aspects make the results of the bali conference just barely tolerable .
as expected , the mandate was issued to negotiate a successor treaty to kyoto by 2009 .
and , as india proposed a text change at the end of the conference , the us delegation , which rejected the proposal , had to come to terms with their exaggerated arrogance toward the third world .
no one , not even eternal allies canada or russia , stood by the americans , who ultimately gave up their resistance . in the end , the at least symbolic victory should give the developing countries , which are most burdened by climate change , more self-confidence . dw-tv 's correspondent and environment expert jens thurau reported on the un climate conference from bali . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 17.12.2007 every fifth german professes " deep religious " convictions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religious conviction is n't necessarily tied to church membership , according to the report germans , particularly women , young people and catholics , are more religious than originally thought , according to a new study .
but more are turning away from traditional forms of religion to find their own path . seventy percent of adults in germany said they were religious , while 18 percent of these are " deeply religious , " reported the bertelsmann foundation in a study to be published on tuesday , dec .
18 . those who characterized themselves as " deeply religious " said they regularly attend worship services , pray often and have deep religious convictions .
another 29 percent of germans identified themselves as not religious . " we can definitely not confirm the long-term extinction of religion that comes up again and again , " said the leader of the study , martin rieger .
" the fact is that there is great stability of religious consciousness among a wide spectrum of social groups , which is very diverse . " the study suggests that young people between 18 and 29 years of age in germany have stronger religious convictions than their parents , though they do n't necessarily act on them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholics showed relatively strong interest in astrology forty-one percent of those surveyed from the 18-29 age bracket said they believe in god and life after death , more than in any other age group .
just over half of the young people said they are religious -lrb- 14 percent highly religious -rrb- , though 50 percent said they seldom or never pray . spirituality strays from tradition forms every fifth person surveyed in germany said that faith should be assembled from various religious teachings according to one 's personal opinion .
furthermore , 11 percent of catholics also reported a belief in astrology , while the number was significantly lower - 6 percent - among non-church members . the stereotype of the elderly being especially religious seems to be only partially true .
one third of those over 60 said they did n't believe in life after death while 18 percent regularly attend a religious service . more than twice as many of the self-professing " deeply religious " germans belonged to the catholic church as those who belong to the protestant church .
germany recognizes both the catholic and a protestant churches and imposes a tax on its members , which is paid back to the churches . approximately two thirds of the country officially belong to one of the two state churches , though membership does n't necessarily have an impact on personal religious convictions or church attendance , according to the study .
one sixth of church members reported being " not religious . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam is the third largest religious group in germany approximately 4 percent of people in germany are muslim - the third largest religious group next to catholicism and protestantism - while 0.3 percent are buddhist and 0.2 percent jewish . former gdr less spiritual than west a divide was apparent in the study between eastern and western germany .

but more are turning away from traditional forms of religion to find their own path . seventy percent of adults in germany said they were religious , while 18 percent of these are " deeply religious , " reported the bertelsmann foundation in a study to be published on tuesday , dec .
18 . those who characterized themselves as " deeply religious " said they regularly attend worship services , pray often and have deep religious convictions .
another 29 percent of germans identified themselves as not religious . " we can definitely not confirm the long-term extinction of religion that comes up again and again , " said the leader of the study , martin rieger .
" the fact is that there is great stability of religious consciousness among a wide spectrum of social groups , which is very diverse . " the study suggests that young people between 18 and 29 years of age in germany have stronger religious convictions than their parents , though they do n't necessarily act on them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholics showed relatively strong interest in astrology forty-one percent of those surveyed from the 18-29 age bracket said they believe in god and life after death , more than in any other age group .
just over half of the young people said they are religious -lrb- 14 percent highly religious -rrb- , though 50 percent said they seldom or never pray . spirituality strays from tradition forms every fifth person surveyed in germany said that faith should be assembled from various religious teachings according to one 's personal opinion .
furthermore , 11 percent of catholics also reported a belief in astrology , while the number was significantly lower - 6 percent - among non-church members . the stereotype of the elderly being especially religious seems to be only partially true .
one third of those over 60 said they did n't believe in life after death while 18 percent regularly attend a religious service . more than twice as many of the self-professing " deeply religious " germans belonged to the catholic church as those who belong to the protestant church .
germany recognizes both the catholic and a protestant churches and imposes a tax on its members , which is paid back to the churches . approximately two thirds of the country officially belong to one of the two state churches , though membership does n't necessarily have an impact on personal religious convictions or church attendance , according to the study .
one sixth of church members reported being " not religious . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam is the third largest religious group in germany approximately 4 percent of people in germany are muslim - the third largest religious group next to catholicism and protestantism - while 0.3 percent are buddhist and 0.2 percent jewish . former gdr less spiritual than west a divide was apparent in the study between eastern and western germany .
while 78 percent of western germans identified themselves as religious , 21 percent of these as highly religious , the numbers were 36 percent and 8 percent , respectively , in eastern germany .
as in most communist countries , the government took an antagonistic view of religion in the former east germany . differences between the genders were also revealed by the study , with 20 percent of women and 16 percent of men reporting deep religiosity .
contrarily , 23 percent of women and 34 percent of men said they were not religious . the bertelsmann foundation posed nearly 100 questions pertaining to religion to 21,000 adults in 21 countries . nigeria , brazil , india and morocco reported with over 90 percent the highest rates of religiosity .
in europe , germany ranks behind italy and poland , but ahead of great britain and france in terms of the number of practicing believers . in the united states , 89 percent of those surveyed characterized themselves as religious , 62 percent as deeply religious . religious conviction is n't necessarily tied to church membership , according to the report catholics showed relatively strong interest in astrology islam is the third largest religious group in germany dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , palestinian president mahmud abbas urged the international community to step up financial aid to the palestinians or risk a " catastrophe . " " without this support , without the payment of aid that will allow the palestinian treasury to fulfill its role , we will be facing a total catastrophe in the west bank and gaza , " abbas told the opening ceremony , at a conference center near the arc de triomphe in paris .
abbas had asked for $ 5.6 billion by 2010 to help develop a viable economy for a future palestinian state . " we are way ahead of this amount , " said palestinian prime minister salam fayyad , whom abbas appointed as palestinian prime minister when hamas seized armed control of the gaza strip . " that 's the most important thing , " fayyad added .
" we see this as an important vote of confidence from the international community .
this conference provided endorsement for our vision of statehood . " the donor conference was the biggest meeting of its kind since 1996 .
some 90 delegations had announced pledges at the one-day gathering .
of the sum promised , $ 3.4 billion is to be directed to the palestinian government 's 2008 budget . tony blair , middle east envoy for the diplomatic " quartet " , said the money would be used for " building the capacity and the institutions for the -lrb- palestinian -rrb- state . " " over the next few months what we have got to show to people is that we are capable of making the difference on the ground , " he said . eu leads donation pledges the european commission pledged to donate $ 650 million in aid for 2008 , while britain announced a three-year aid package of up to $ 490 million .
opening the conference earlier , french president nicolas sarkozy pledged $ 300 million over three years .
germany promised $ 200 million by 2010 and sweden offered $ 300 million in 2007 and 2008 . the united states promised $ 555 million for 2008 .
saudi arabia was to provide $ 500 million over three years , diplomats said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the money was to support the reform and development program of the palestinian government . but she also called for israel to cease blockading the palestinian economy and to halt the building of settlements in the west bank . " the development plan can only be effective if the economic development of palestine is no longer hindered , if the building of settlements by israel is stopped and if the inner-palestinian divide can be overcome , " she said . the money was intended to improve the miserable conditions under which palestinians were living and to support the israeli-palestinian peace process , wieczorek-zeul said from berlin . sarkozy proposal gets rise from hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can high-level meetings help bring about mideast peace ?
wieczorek-zeul 's calls for a halt to israeli settlements in the west bank and gaza was echoed by french president nicolas sarkozy . in his address to the opening ceremony , sarkozy said " the paris conference must accompany the progressive construction of a modern state . " he called for the creation of an international force to beef up the palestinian security services , " when the time comes and when the conditions are right . " " the palestinian services need to reform , to become more professional .
in parallel , israel must withdraw from the west bank , " sarkozy said . the radical islamist group hamas slammed the french proposal , saying an international force in the mideast would amount to " blatant interference " in internal affairs . israel claims commitment to independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom of movement for palestinians is a big issue .
here , a gaza check-point israel responded by saying it is committed to the establishment of an independent and viable palestinian state . israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said israel wants " the obstacles to the palestinian economy and daily life to be removed . " " we have no desire to control palestinian lives , " she added .
" we do not want the image of israel in the palestinian mind to be a soldier at a checkpoint . " abbas seeks halt to israeli settlements as the conference kicked off , abbas called on israel to freeze all settlements in the palestinian territories to allow the newly re-launched peace process to gain a foothold . " i expect a complete halt of all settlement activities without exception , the dismantlement of the 127 wildcat settlements set up since 2001 , the reopening of palestinian institutions closed in jerusalem , the lifting of military barrages , a halt to construction of the separation barrier and the release of prisoners , " abbas told the conference . at a us-sponsored meeting in annapolis , maryland last month , israel and the palestinians pledged to seek a peace deal by the end of next year , relaunching negotiations frozen for seven years . dw staff -lrb- jen / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , pledged $ 7.4 billion -lrb- 5.15 billion euros -rrb- for the palestinians at a donor conference in paris .
will it save the region from a catastrophe ? at the start of the conference on monday , dec .
17 , palestinian president mahmud abbas urged the international community to step up financial aid to the palestinians or risk a " catastrophe . " " without this support , without the payment of aid that will allow the palestinian treasury to fulfill its role , we will be facing a total catastrophe in the west bank and gaza , " abbas told the opening ceremony , at a conference center near the arc de triomphe in paris .
abbas had asked for $ 5.6 billion by 2010 to help develop a viable economy for a future palestinian state . " we are way ahead of this amount , " said palestinian prime minister salam fayyad , whom abbas appointed as palestinian prime minister when hamas seized armed control of the gaza strip . " that 's the most important thing , " fayyad added .
" we see this as an important vote of confidence from the international community .
this conference provided endorsement for our vision of statehood . " the donor conference was the biggest meeting of its kind since 1996 .
some 90 delegations had announced pledges at the one-day gathering .
of the sum promised , $ 3.4 billion is to be directed to the palestinian government 's 2008 budget . tony blair , middle east envoy for the diplomatic " quartet " , said the money would be used for " building the capacity and the institutions for the -lrb- palestinian -rrb- state . " " over the next few months what we have got to show to people is that we are capable of making the difference on the ground , " he said . eu leads donation pledges the european commission pledged to donate $ 650 million in aid for 2008 , while britain announced a three-year aid package of up to $ 490 million .
opening the conference earlier , french president nicolas sarkozy pledged $ 300 million over three years .
germany promised $ 200 million by 2010 and sweden offered $ 300 million in 2007 and 2008 . the united states promised $ 555 million for 2008 .
saudi arabia was to provide $ 500 million over three years , diplomats said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the money was to support the reform and development program of the palestinian government . but she also called for israel to cease blockading the palestinian economy and to halt the building of settlements in the west bank . " the development plan can only be effective if the economic development of palestine is no longer hindered , if the building of settlements by israel is stopped and if the inner-palestinian divide can be overcome , " she said . the money was intended to improve the miserable conditions under which palestinians were living and to support the israeli-palestinian peace process , wieczorek-zeul said from berlin . sarkozy proposal gets rise from hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can high-level meetings help bring about mideast peace ?
wieczorek-zeul 's calls for a halt to israeli settlements in the west bank and gaza was echoed by french president nicolas sarkozy . in his address to the opening ceremony , sarkozy said " the paris conference must accompany the progressive construction of a modern state . " he called for the creation of an international force to beef up the palestinian security services , " when the time comes and when the conditions are right . " " the palestinian services need to reform , to become more professional .
in parallel , israel must withdraw from the west bank , " sarkozy said . the radical islamist group hamas slammed the french proposal , saying an international force in the mideast would amount to " blatant interference " in internal affairs . israel claims commitment to independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom of movement for palestinians is a big issue .
here , a gaza check-point israel responded by saying it is committed to the establishment of an independent and viable palestinian state . israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said israel wants " the obstacles to the palestinian economy and daily life to be removed . " " we have no desire to control palestinian lives , " she added .
" we do not want the image of israel in the palestinian mind to be a soldier at a checkpoint . " abbas seeks halt to israeli settlements as the conference kicked off , abbas called on israel to freeze all settlements in the palestinian territories to allow the newly re-launched peace process to gain a foothold . " i expect a complete halt of all settlement activities without exception , the dismantlement of the 127 wildcat settlements set up since 2001 , the reopening of palestinian institutions closed in jerusalem , the lifting of military barrages , a halt to construction of the separation barrier and the release of prisoners , " abbas told the conference . at a us-sponsored meeting in annapolis , maryland last month , israel and the palestinians pledged to seek a peace deal by the end of next year , relaunching negotiations frozen for seven years . dw staff -lrb- jen / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as expected , the mandate was issued to negotiate a successor treaty to kyoto by 2009 .
and , as india proposed a text change at the end of the conference , the us delegation , which rejected the proposal , had to come to terms with their exaggerated arrogance toward the third world .
no one , not even eternal allies canada or russia , stood by the americans , who ultimately gave up their resistance . in the end , the at least symbolic victory should give the developing countries , which are most burdened by climate change , more self-confidence . dw-tv 's correspondent and environment expert jens thurau reported on the un climate conference from bali . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 . airbus boss thomas enders could be days away from selling four of the aircraft maker 's factories to us company spirit aero systems , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus chief enders could sign the deal before christmas on sunday in hamburg , airbus spokesman tore prang told the paper that although negotiations were well advanced , an agreement had yet to be signed .
according to information from german public broadcaster ard , spirit made airbus an offer on friday , dec .
14 . expertise in carbon-fiber technology wichita , kansas based spirit is known for its expertise in modern carbon-fiber technology , which is expected to play an important role in the construction of future airbus models . the expertise , along with a desire to move some production to dollar-based zones , put spirit ahead of german bidders , reports said . avoiding the currency squeeze the head of airbus parent company eads , louis gallois , said earlier this month that the aerospace giant had " no choice " but to shift some production by airbus to dollar-based zones to soften the financial impact of a soaring euro . airbus sells its planes in dollars but its costs are in the european single currency .
with the dollar steadily depreciating against the euro , airbus earnings have plummeted . three german factories - in augsburg , nordenham and varung - are up for sale .
a british factory , in filton , is also part of the deal . unions oppose sale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company hit snags when making the massive a380 unions representing airbus employees are opposed to the spirit deal , according to news reports .

other than spirit , germany 's mt aerospace is bidding for the airbus factories .
but observers say the concern is too small for such a massive takeover . overall , airbus plans to shed 10,000 jobs and sell a total of six factories as part of its " power8 " restructuring plan , which was prompted by severe problems encountered with its a380 superjumbo jet program . spirit aerosysteems has a very close working relationship with airbus rival boeing , reports said .

will it save the region from a catastrophe ? at the start of the conference on monday , dec .
17 , palestinian president mahmud abbas urged the international community to step up financial aid to the palestinians or risk a " catastrophe . " " without this support , without the payment of aid that will allow the palestinian treasury to fulfill its role , we will be facing a total catastrophe in the west bank and gaza , " abbas told the opening ceremony , at a conference center near the arc de triomphe in paris .
abbas had asked for $ 5.6 billion by 2010 to help develop a viable economy for a future palestinian state . " we are way ahead of this amount , " said palestinian prime minister salam fayyad , whom abbas appointed as palestinian prime minister when hamas seized armed control of the gaza strip . " that 's the most important thing , " fayyad added .
" we see this as an important vote of confidence from the international community .
this conference provided endorsement for our vision of statehood . " the donor conference was the biggest meeting of its kind since 1996 .
some 90 delegations had announced pledges at the one-day gathering .
of the sum promised , $ 3.4 billion is to be directed to the palestinian government 's 2008 budget . tony blair , middle east envoy for the diplomatic " quartet " , said the money would be used for " building the capacity and the institutions for the -lrb- palestinian -rrb- state . " " over the next few months what we have got to show to people is that we are capable of making the difference on the ground , " he said . eu leads donation pledges the european commission pledged to donate $ 650 million in aid for 2008 , while britain announced a three-year aid package of up to $ 490 million .
opening the conference earlier , french president nicolas sarkozy pledged $ 300 million over three years .
germany promised $ 200 million by 2010 and sweden offered $ 300 million in 2007 and 2008 . the united states promised $ 555 million for 2008 .
saudi arabia was to provide $ 500 million over three years , diplomats said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the money was to support the reform and development program of the palestinian government . but she also called for israel to cease blockading the palestinian economy and to halt the building of settlements in the west bank . " the development plan can only be effective if the economic development of palestine is no longer hindered , if the building of settlements by israel is stopped and if the inner-palestinian divide can be overcome , " she said . the money was intended to improve the miserable conditions under which palestinians were living and to support the israeli-palestinian peace process , wieczorek-zeul said from berlin . sarkozy proposal gets rise from hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can high-level meetings help bring about mideast peace ?
wieczorek-zeul 's calls for a halt to israeli settlements in the west bank and gaza was echoed by french president nicolas sarkozy . in his address to the opening ceremony , sarkozy said " the paris conference must accompany the progressive construction of a modern state . " he called for the creation of an international force to beef up the palestinian security services , " when the time comes and when the conditions are right . " " the palestinian services need to reform , to become more professional .
in parallel , israel must withdraw from the west bank , " sarkozy said . the radical islamist group hamas slammed the french proposal , saying an international force in the mideast would amount to " blatant interference " in internal affairs . israel claims commitment to independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom of movement for palestinians is a big issue .
here , a gaza check-point israel responded by saying it is committed to the establishment of an independent and viable palestinian state . israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said israel wants " the obstacles to the palestinian economy and daily life to be removed . " " we have no desire to control palestinian lives , " she added .
" we do not want the image of israel in the palestinian mind to be a soldier at a checkpoint . " abbas seeks halt to israeli settlements as the conference kicked off , abbas called on israel to freeze all settlements in the palestinian territories to allow the newly re-launched peace process to gain a foothold . " i expect a complete halt of all settlement activities without exception , the dismantlement of the 127 wildcat settlements set up since 2001 , the reopening of palestinian institutions closed in jerusalem , the lifting of military barrages , a halt to construction of the separation barrier and the release of prisoners , " abbas told the conference . at a us-sponsored meeting in annapolis , maryland last month , israel and the palestinians pledged to seek a peace deal by the end of next year , relaunching negotiations frozen for seven years . dw staff -lrb- jen / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 . expertise in carbon-fiber technology wichita , kansas based spirit is known for its expertise in modern carbon-fiber technology , which is expected to play an important role in the construction of future airbus models . the expertise , along with a desire to move some production to dollar-based zones , put spirit ahead of german bidders , reports said . avoiding the currency squeeze the head of airbus parent company eads , louis gallois , said earlier this month that the aerospace giant had " no choice " but to shift some production by airbus to dollar-based zones to soften the financial impact of a soaring euro . airbus sells its planes in dollars but its costs are in the european single currency .

but more are turning away from traditional forms of religion to find their own path . seventy percent of adults in germany said they were religious , while 18 percent of these are " deeply religious , " reported the bertelsmann foundation in a study to be published on tuesday , dec .
18 . those who characterized themselves as " deeply religious " said they regularly attend worship services , pray often and have deep religious convictions .

17 , pledged $ 7.4 billion -lrb- 5.15 billion euros -rrb- for the palestinians at a donor conference in paris .
will it save the region from a catastrophe ? at the start of the conference on monday , dec .
17 , palestinian president mahmud abbas urged the international community to step up financial aid to the palestinians or risk a " catastrophe . " " without this support , without the payment of aid that will allow the palestinian treasury to fulfill its role , we will be facing a total catastrophe in the west bank and gaza , " abbas told the opening ceremony , at a conference center near the arc de triomphe in paris .
abbas had asked for $ 5.6 billion by 2010 to help develop a viable economy for a future palestinian state . " we are way ahead of this amount , " said palestinian prime minister salam fayyad , whom abbas appointed as palestinian prime minister when hamas seized armed control of the gaza strip . " that 's the most important thing , " fayyad added .
" we see this as an important vote of confidence from the international community .
this conference provided endorsement for our vision of statehood . " the donor conference was the biggest meeting of its kind since 1996 .
some 90 delegations had announced pledges at the one-day gathering .
of the sum promised , $ 3.4 billion is to be directed to the palestinian government 's 2008 budget . tony blair , middle east envoy for the diplomatic " quartet " , said the money would be used for " building the capacity and the institutions for the -lrb- palestinian -rrb- state . " " over the next few months what we have got to show to people is that we are capable of making the difference on the ground , " he said . eu leads donation pledges the european commission pledged to donate $ 650 million in aid for 2008 , while britain announced a three-year aid package of up to $ 490 million .
opening the conference earlier , french president nicolas sarkozy pledged $ 300 million over three years .
germany promised $ 200 million by 2010 and sweden offered $ 300 million in 2007 and 2008 . the united states promised $ 555 million for 2008 .
saudi arabia was to provide $ 500 million over three years , diplomats said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the money was to support the reform and development program of the palestinian government . but she also called for israel to cease blockading the palestinian economy and to halt the building of settlements in the west bank . " the development plan can only be effective if the economic development of palestine is no longer hindered , if the building of settlements by israel is stopped and if the inner-palestinian divide can be overcome , " she said . the money was intended to improve the miserable conditions under which palestinians were living and to support the israeli-palestinian peace process , wieczorek-zeul said from berlin . sarkozy proposal gets rise from hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can high-level meetings help bring about mideast peace ?
wieczorek-zeul 's calls for a halt to israeli settlements in the west bank and gaza was echoed by french president nicolas sarkozy . in his address to the opening ceremony , sarkozy said " the paris conference must accompany the progressive construction of a modern state . " he called for the creation of an international force to beef up the palestinian security services , " when the time comes and when the conditions are right . " " the palestinian services need to reform , to become more professional .
in parallel , israel must withdraw from the west bank , " sarkozy said . the radical islamist group hamas slammed the french proposal , saying an international force in the mideast would amount to " blatant interference " in internal affairs . israel claims commitment to independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom of movement for palestinians is a big issue .
here , a gaza check-point israel responded by saying it is committed to the establishment of an independent and viable palestinian state . israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said israel wants " the obstacles to the palestinian economy and daily life to be removed . " " we have no desire to control palestinian lives , " she added .
" we do not want the image of israel in the palestinian mind to be a soldier at a checkpoint . " abbas seeks halt to israeli settlements as the conference kicked off , abbas called on israel to freeze all settlements in the palestinian territories to allow the newly re-launched peace process to gain a foothold . " i expect a complete halt of all settlement activities without exception , the dismantlement of the 127 wildcat settlements set up since 2001 , the reopening of palestinian institutions closed in jerusalem , the lifting of military barrages , a halt to construction of the separation barrier and the release of prisoners , " abbas told the conference . at a us-sponsored meeting in annapolis , maryland last month , israel and the palestinians pledged to seek a peace deal by the end of next year , relaunching negotiations frozen for seven years . dw staff -lrb- jen / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , pledged $ 7.4 billion -lrb- 5.15 billion euros -rrb- for the palestinians at a donor conference in paris .
will it save the region from a catastrophe ? at the start of the conference on monday , dec .
17 , palestinian president mahmud abbas urged the international community to step up financial aid to the palestinians or risk a " catastrophe . " " without this support , without the payment of aid that will allow the palestinian treasury to fulfill its role , we will be facing a total catastrophe in the west bank and gaza , " abbas told the opening ceremony , at a conference center near the arc de triomphe in paris .
abbas had asked for $ 5.6 billion by 2010 to help develop a viable economy for a future palestinian state . " we are way ahead of this amount , " said palestinian prime minister salam fayyad , whom abbas appointed as palestinian prime minister when hamas seized armed control of the gaza strip . " that 's the most important thing , " fayyad added .
" we see this as an important vote of confidence from the international community .
this conference provided endorsement for our vision of statehood . " the donor conference was the biggest meeting of its kind since 1996 .
some 90 delegations had announced pledges at the one-day gathering .
of the sum promised , $ 3.4 billion is to be directed to the palestinian government 's 2008 budget . tony blair , middle east envoy for the diplomatic " quartet " , said the money would be used for " building the capacity and the institutions for the -lrb- palestinian -rrb- state . " " over the next few months what we have got to show to people is that we are capable of making the difference on the ground , " he said . eu leads donation pledges the european commission pledged to donate $ 650 million in aid for 2008 , while britain announced a three-year aid package of up to $ 490 million .
opening the conference earlier , french president nicolas sarkozy pledged $ 300 million over three years .
germany promised $ 200 million by 2010 and sweden offered $ 300 million in 2007 and 2008 . the united states promised $ 555 million for 2008 .
saudi arabia was to provide $ 500 million over three years , diplomats said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the money was to support the reform and development program of the palestinian government . but she also called for israel to cease blockading the palestinian economy and to halt the building of settlements in the west bank . " the development plan can only be effective if the economic development of palestine is no longer hindered , if the building of settlements by israel is stopped and if the inner-palestinian divide can be overcome , " she said . the money was intended to improve the miserable conditions under which palestinians were living and to support the israeli-palestinian peace process , wieczorek-zeul said from berlin . sarkozy proposal gets rise from hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can high-level meetings help bring about mideast peace ?
wieczorek-zeul 's calls for a halt to israeli settlements in the west bank and gaza was echoed by french president nicolas sarkozy . in his address to the opening ceremony , sarkozy said " the paris conference must accompany the progressive construction of a modern state . " he called for the creation of an international force to beef up the palestinian security services , " when the time comes and when the conditions are right . " " the palestinian services need to reform , to become more professional .
in parallel , israel must withdraw from the west bank , " sarkozy said . the radical islamist group hamas slammed the french proposal , saying an international force in the mideast would amount to " blatant interference " in internal affairs . israel claims commitment to independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom of movement for palestinians is a big issue .
here , a gaza check-point israel responded by saying it is committed to the establishment of an independent and viable palestinian state . israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said israel wants " the obstacles to the palestinian economy and daily life to be removed . " " we have no desire to control palestinian lives , " she added .
" we do not want the image of israel in the palestinian mind to be a soldier at a checkpoint . " abbas seeks halt to israeli settlements as the conference kicked off , abbas called on israel to freeze all settlements in the palestinian territories to allow the newly re-launched peace process to gain a foothold . " i expect a complete halt of all settlement activities without exception , the dismantlement of the 127 wildcat settlements set up since 2001 , the reopening of palestinian institutions closed in jerusalem , the lifting of military barrages , a halt to construction of the separation barrier and the release of prisoners , " abbas told the conference . at a us-sponsored meeting in annapolis , maryland last month , israel and the palestinians pledged to seek a peace deal by the end of next year , relaunching negotiations frozen for seven years . dw staff -lrb- jen / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , pledged $ 7.4 billion -lrb- 5.15 billion euros -rrb- for the palestinians at a donor conference in paris .
will it save the region from a catastrophe ? at the start of the conference on monday , dec .
17 , palestinian president mahmud abbas urged the international community to step up financial aid to the palestinians or risk a " catastrophe . " " without this support , without the payment of aid that will allow the palestinian treasury to fulfill its role , we will be facing a total catastrophe in the west bank and gaza , " abbas told the opening ceremony , at a conference center near the arc de triomphe in paris .
abbas had asked for $ 5.6 billion by 2010 to help develop a viable economy for a future palestinian state . " we are way ahead of this amount , " said palestinian prime minister salam fayyad , whom abbas appointed as palestinian prime minister when hamas seized armed control of the gaza strip . " that 's the most important thing , " fayyad added .
" we see this as an important vote of confidence from the international community .
this conference provided endorsement for our vision of statehood . " the donor conference was the biggest meeting of its kind since 1996 .
some 90 delegations had announced pledges at the one-day gathering .
of the sum promised , $ 3.4 billion is to be directed to the palestinian government 's 2008 budget . tony blair , middle east envoy for the diplomatic " quartet " , said the money would be used for " building the capacity and the institutions for the -lrb- palestinian -rrb- state . " " over the next few months what we have got to show to people is that we are capable of making the difference on the ground , " he said . eu leads donation pledges the european commission pledged to donate $ 650 million in aid for 2008 , while britain announced a three-year aid package of up to $ 490 million .
opening the conference earlier , french president nicolas sarkozy pledged $ 300 million over three years .
germany promised $ 200 million by 2010 and sweden offered $ 300 million in 2007 and 2008 . the united states promised $ 555 million for 2008 .
saudi arabia was to provide $ 500 million over three years , diplomats said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the money was to support the reform and development program of the palestinian government . but she also called for israel to cease blockading the palestinian economy and to halt the building of settlements in the west bank . " the development plan can only be effective if the economic development of palestine is no longer hindered , if the building of settlements by israel is stopped and if the inner-palestinian divide can be overcome , " she said . the money was intended to improve the miserable conditions under which palestinians were living and to support the israeli-palestinian peace process , wieczorek-zeul said from berlin . sarkozy proposal gets rise from hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can high-level meetings help bring about mideast peace ?
wieczorek-zeul 's calls for a halt to israeli settlements in the west bank and gaza was echoed by french president nicolas sarkozy . in his address to the opening ceremony , sarkozy said " the paris conference must accompany the progressive construction of a modern state . " he called for the creation of an international force to beef up the palestinian security services , " when the time comes and when the conditions are right . " " the palestinian services need to reform , to become more professional .
in parallel , israel must withdraw from the west bank , " sarkozy said . the radical islamist group hamas slammed the french proposal , saying an international force in the mideast would amount to " blatant interference " in internal affairs . israel claims commitment to independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom of movement for palestinians is a big issue .
here , a gaza check-point israel responded by saying it is committed to the establishment of an independent and viable palestinian state . israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said israel wants " the obstacles to the palestinian economy and daily life to be removed . " " we have no desire to control palestinian lives , " she added .
" we do not want the image of israel in the palestinian mind to be a soldier at a checkpoint . " abbas seeks halt to israeli settlements as the conference kicked off , abbas called on israel to freeze all settlements in the palestinian territories to allow the newly re-launched peace process to gain a foothold . " i expect a complete halt of all settlement activities without exception , the dismantlement of the 127 wildcat settlements set up since 2001 , the reopening of palestinian institutions closed in jerusalem , the lifting of military barrages , a halt to construction of the separation barrier and the release of prisoners , " abbas told the conference . at a us-sponsored meeting in annapolis , maryland last month , israel and the palestinians pledged to seek a peace deal by the end of next year , relaunching negotiations frozen for seven years . dw staff -lrb- jen / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he added that germany had been involved in negotiations with iran and offers had been made to provide assistance in establishing a civil nuclear power program in the country . russian sends nuclear fuel to iran the foreign minister 's statements coincide with the delivery of russian nuclear fuel to iran 's bushehr atomic power station on monday , which was confirmed by officials in both countries .
after several further deliveries , the plant will be ready for service in about six months . russia said that tehran had promised the fuel would not be used for military purposes and that it had called on iran to halt its uranium enrichment program .

the united states and its allies have suspected that iran 's uranium program was being used to build an atomic weapon and not solely to provide its population with energy . russia 's delivery had been delayed for months due to international negotiations surrounding iran 's nuclear program and warnings from the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier does n't see eye to eye with the chancellor earlier this month , a us security report concluded that , contrary to previous information , iran had ceased its military nuclear program in 2003 . steinmeier said the report took off some pressure and that he saw " great readiness " on the part of the us to use the time gained by knowing that iran is n't currently a nuclear power , but doubted whether tehran would show the same willingness . steinmeier too russia-friendly , say critics in the same interview , the foreign minister took a soft line with russia , despite monday 's delivery of nuclear fuel , saying that germany should develop a thriving relationship with the former soviet power . " this perspective does n't require a certificate on the quality of the russian form of government , " he said , deliberately contradicting chancellor angela merkel , who commented following last month 's parliamentary elections that russia was n't a democracy . " without a doubt , a great degree of stability has been achieved in russia during the eight years of putin 's presidency , " added steinmeier , who is a member of germany 's social democratic party .

" the development plan can only be effective if the economic development of palestine is no longer hindered , if the building of settlements by israel is stopped and if the inner-palestinian divide can be overcome , " she said . the money was intended to improve the miserable conditions under which palestinians were living and to support the israeli-palestinian peace process , wieczorek-zeul said from berlin . sarkozy proposal gets rise from hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can high-level meetings help bring about mideast peace ?
wieczorek-zeul 's calls for a halt to israeli settlements in the west bank and gaza was echoed by french president nicolas sarkozy . in his address to the opening ceremony , sarkozy said " the paris conference must accompany the progressive construction of a modern state . " he called for the creation of an international force to beef up the palestinian security services , " when the time comes and when the conditions are right . " " the palestinian services need to reform , to become more professional .
in parallel , israel must withdraw from the west bank , " sarkozy said . the radical islamist group hamas slammed the french proposal , saying an international force in the mideast would amount to " blatant interference " in internal affairs . israel claims commitment to independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom of movement for palestinians is a big issue .
here , a gaza check-point israel responded by saying it is committed to the establishment of an independent and viable palestinian state . israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said israel wants " the obstacles to the palestinian economy and daily life to be removed . " " we have no desire to control palestinian lives , " she added .
" we do not want the image of israel in the palestinian mind to be a soldier at a checkpoint . " abbas seeks halt to israeli settlements as the conference kicked off , abbas called on israel to freeze all settlements in the palestinian territories to allow the newly re-launched peace process to gain a foothold . " i expect a complete halt of all settlement activities without exception , the dismantlement of the 127 wildcat settlements set up since 2001 , the reopening of palestinian institutions closed in jerusalem , the lifting of military barrages , a halt to construction of the separation barrier and the release of prisoners , " abbas told the conference . at a us-sponsored meeting in annapolis , maryland last month , israel and the palestinians pledged to seek a peace deal by the end of next year , relaunching negotiations frozen for seven years . dw staff -lrb- jen / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to various media reports he was abducted by armed gunmen on sunday , dec .

the munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung reported the man is a bavarian who had settled in afghanistan 's western herat province . " he decided to stay in herat and married an afghan woman , " green helmets founder rupert neudeck told the associated press .
" we are very worried . " afghanistan 's mnister of commerce and industry amin farhang said he got to know the german carpenter through the man 's work to get official government recognition for the aid organization .

" he is a very nice , very engaged german muslim . " farhang said he would do everything possible to make sure the man was released .
farhang said he did n't believe the man was kidnapped by the taliban , but rather by a criminal gang wanting money . a german engineer was kidnapped in afghanistan in july .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 17.12.2007 opinion : mandate for kyoto successor redeems bali failure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the progress made in bali was minimal at best , writes dw 's jens thurau .
but the mandate for a kyoto successor treaty by 2009 and the isolation of the us delegation were two lights in the dark . four reports from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , a g8 summit in heiligendamm , a nobel peace prize for al gore and a world climate council - never before has there been so much talk about reducing greenhouse gases as in 2007 . then the environment ministers meet in blistering hot bali with more journalists than have ever attended a climate conference and the result is a minimal consensus . not a single reduction goal for after 2010 is included in the final text , although such goals have been the topic of discussion for weeks - even months - and warnings from scientists who have been recognized with the very highest prizes can be found in a one-and-a-half-line footnote . it 's the same old situation that 's to blame : the sacred oath that the wealthy states made at the environment summit in rio in 1992 to set a good example in cutting emissions has n't been kept .
the industrialized countries have lost valuable time - or , like the us and russia , simply approach the climate challenge with demonstrative apathy . for this reason , the emerging nations refuse - not without good reason - to risk the bit of prosperity they 've finally managed to attain by making commitments to climate protection . practically every climate conference ends in the same way : the us , with countries like canada and russia on its side , facing off against the developing nations .
it was no different this time . in a certain way , the ambitious europeans also bear some of the guilt .
they 're constantly naming the most extensive goals , but only a few eu states - including germany - will fulfill the aims of the kyoto protocol by 2012 . poor countries are fully aware of that . nevertheless , two aspects make the results of the bali conference just barely tolerable .
as expected , the mandate was issued to negotiate a successor treaty to kyoto by 2009 .
and , as india proposed a text change at the end of the conference , the us delegation , which rejected the proposal , had to come to terms with their exaggerated arrogance toward the third world .
no one , not even eternal allies canada or russia , stood by the americans , who ultimately gave up their resistance . in the end , the at least symbolic victory should give the developing countries , which are most burdened by climate change , more self-confidence . dw-tv 's correspondent and environment expert jens thurau reported on the un climate conference from bali . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany hails bali outcome as better than expected german environment minister sigmar gabriel welcomed the outcome of the un climate change conference on saturday after a grueling all-night finish in which the negotiating countries ironed out a last-minute compromise .
-lrb- 15.12.2007 -rrb- carbon footprints trample on climate conference 's aims most environmental activists flew to the un climate change conference , leaving behind a huge carbon footprint .

but france signed a nuclear deal with libya last week and russia just delivered nuclear fuel to iran . frank-walter steinmeier opposed offering nuclear power assistance to middle eastern countries in an interview with the monday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . " i can not support using nuclear power as the solution to the world 's energy problems or scattering nuclear power stations over regions that lack the competence to deal with this technology and where there is insufficient certainty about political stability , " steinmeier said . he had been asked about his opinion on the deal french president nicolas sarkozy signed last week with libyan president moammar el gadhafi to deliver one or more nuclear reactors to the northern african country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , seen here with gadhafi , has promised nuclear reactors to libya however , steinmeier conceded that certain exceptions could be made .
he added that germany had been involved in negotiations with iran and offers had been made to provide assistance in establishing a civil nuclear power program in the country . russian sends nuclear fuel to iran the foreign minister 's statements coincide with the delivery of russian nuclear fuel to iran 's bushehr atomic power station on monday , which was confirmed by officials in both countries .

this potentially stinky question arose when police in the western german city of bielefeld stopped a man carrying two heavy garbage bags stuffed with athletic socks . at least the 172 pairs of soccer socks were clean .
one shudders to imagine the collective smell of 344 dirty athletic socks .
in fact , the socks in question were brand-stinking new .

or maybe the man 's girlfriend had barred all stiff , stinky socks from entering the apartment .
possibly there was a guinness world records attempt in the making .
or maybe he simply had a lot of soccer playing fans on his christmas list .
whatever his story , police did n't buy it .
after listening to the man 's " conflicting statements " about the origin of the socks , police decided they had been stolen .
they eventually determined the socks had been swiped from a container at a trucking company where they were awaiting shipment .

but more are turning away from traditional forms of religion to find their own path . seventy percent of adults in germany said they were religious , while 18 percent of these are " deeply religious , " reported the bertelsmann foundation in a study to be published on tuesday , dec .
18 . those who characterized themselves as " deeply religious " said they regularly attend worship services , pray often and have deep religious convictions .
another 29 percent of germans identified themselves as not religious . " we can definitely not confirm the long-term extinction of religion that comes up again and again , " said the leader of the study , martin rieger .
" the fact is that there is great stability of religious consciousness among a wide spectrum of social groups , which is very diverse . " the study suggests that young people between 18 and 29 years of age in germany have stronger religious convictions than their parents , though they do n't necessarily act on them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholics showed relatively strong interest in astrology forty-one percent of those surveyed from the 18-29 age bracket said they believe in god and life after death , more than in any other age group .
just over half of the young people said they are religious -lrb- 14 percent highly religious -rrb- , though 50 percent said they seldom or never pray . spirituality strays from tradition forms every fifth person surveyed in germany said that faith should be assembled from various religious teachings according to one 's personal opinion .
furthermore , 11 percent of catholics also reported a belief in astrology , while the number was significantly lower - 6 percent - among non-church members . the stereotype of the elderly being especially religious seems to be only partially true .
one third of those over 60 said they did n't believe in life after death while 18 percent regularly attend a religious service . more than twice as many of the self-professing " deeply religious " germans belonged to the catholic church as those who belong to the protestant church .
germany recognizes both the catholic and a protestant churches and imposes a tax on its members , which is paid back to the churches . approximately two thirds of the country officially belong to one of the two state churches , though membership does n't necessarily have an impact on personal religious convictions or church attendance , according to the study .
one sixth of church members reported being " not religious . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam is the third largest religious group in germany approximately 4 percent of people in germany are muslim - the third largest religious group next to catholicism and protestantism - while 0.3 percent are buddhist and 0.2 percent jewish . former gdr less spiritual than west a divide was apparent in the study between eastern and western germany .
while 78 percent of western germans identified themselves as religious , 21 percent of these as highly religious , the numbers were 36 percent and 8 percent , respectively , in eastern germany .
as in most communist countries , the government took an antagonistic view of religion in the former east germany . differences between the genders were also revealed by the study , with 20 percent of women and 16 percent of men reporting deep religiosity .
contrarily , 23 percent of women and 34 percent of men said they were not religious . the bertelsmann foundation posed nearly 100 questions pertaining to religion to 21,000 adults in 21 countries . nigeria , brazil , india and morocco reported with over 90 percent the highest rates of religiosity .
in europe , germany ranks behind italy and poland , but ahead of great britain and france in terms of the number of practicing believers . in the united states , 89 percent of those surveyed characterized themselves as religious , 62 percent as deeply religious . religious conviction is n't necessarily tied to church membership , according to the report catholics showed relatively strong interest in astrology islam is the third largest religious group in germany dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 17.12.2007 eu , germany , others pledge billions in aid to palestinians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians had a reason to celebrate on monday international donors , including the eu and germany , on monday , dec .
17 , pledged $ 7.4 billion -lrb- 5.15 billion euros -rrb- for the palestinians at a donor conference in paris .
will it save the region from a catastrophe ? at the start of the conference on monday , dec .
17 , palestinian president mahmud abbas urged the international community to step up financial aid to the palestinians or risk a " catastrophe . " " without this support , without the payment of aid that will allow the palestinian treasury to fulfill its role , we will be facing a total catastrophe in the west bank and gaza , " abbas told the opening ceremony , at a conference center near the arc de triomphe in paris .
abbas had asked for $ 5.6 billion by 2010 to help develop a viable economy for a future palestinian state . " we are way ahead of this amount , " said palestinian prime minister salam fayyad , whom abbas appointed as palestinian prime minister when hamas seized armed control of the gaza strip . " that 's the most important thing , " fayyad added .
" we see this as an important vote of confidence from the international community .
this conference provided endorsement for our vision of statehood . " the donor conference was the biggest meeting of its kind since 1996 .
some 90 delegations had announced pledges at the one-day gathering .
of the sum promised , $ 3.4 billion is to be directed to the palestinian government 's 2008 budget . tony blair , middle east envoy for the diplomatic " quartet " , said the money would be used for " building the capacity and the institutions for the -lrb- palestinian -rrb- state . " " over the next few months what we have got to show to people is that we are capable of making the difference on the ground , " he said . eu leads donation pledges the european commission pledged to donate $ 650 million in aid for 2008 , while britain announced a three-year aid package of up to $ 490 million .
opening the conference earlier , french president nicolas sarkozy pledged $ 300 million over three years .
germany promised $ 200 million by 2010 and sweden offered $ 300 million in 2007 and 2008 . the united states promised $ 555 million for 2008 .
saudi arabia was to provide $ 500 million over three years , diplomats said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the money was to support the reform and development program of the palestinian government . but she also called for israel to cease blockading the palestinian economy and to halt the building of settlements in the west bank . " the development plan can only be effective if the economic development of palestine is no longer hindered , if the building of settlements by israel is stopped and if the inner-palestinian divide can be overcome , " she said . the money was intended to improve the miserable conditions under which palestinians were living and to support the israeli-palestinian peace process , wieczorek-zeul said from berlin . sarkozy proposal gets rise from hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can high-level meetings help bring about mideast peace ?
wieczorek-zeul 's calls for a halt to israeli settlements in the west bank and gaza was echoed by french president nicolas sarkozy . in his address to the opening ceremony , sarkozy said " the paris conference must accompany the progressive construction of a modern state . " he called for the creation of an international force to beef up the palestinian security services , " when the time comes and when the conditions are right . " " the palestinian services need to reform , to become more professional .
in parallel , israel must withdraw from the west bank , " sarkozy said . the radical islamist group hamas slammed the french proposal , saying an international force in the mideast would amount to " blatant interference " in internal affairs . israel claims commitment to independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom of movement for palestinians is a big issue .
here , a gaza check-point israel responded by saying it is committed to the establishment of an independent and viable palestinian state . israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said israel wants " the obstacles to the palestinian economy and daily life to be removed . " " we have no desire to control palestinian lives , " she added .
" we do not want the image of israel in the palestinian mind to be a soldier at a checkpoint . " abbas seeks halt to israeli settlements as the conference kicked off , abbas called on israel to freeze all settlements in the palestinian territories to allow the newly re-launched peace process to gain a foothold . " i expect a complete halt of all settlement activities without exception , the dismantlement of the 127 wildcat settlements set up since 2001 , the reopening of palestinian institutions closed in jerusalem , the lifting of military barrages , a halt to construction of the separation barrier and the release of prisoners , " abbas told the conference . at a us-sponsored meeting in annapolis , maryland last month , israel and the palestinians pledged to seek a peace deal by the end of next year , relaunching negotiations frozen for seven years . dw staff -lrb- jen / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 17.12.2007 every fifth german professes " deep religious " convictions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religious conviction is n't necessarily tied to church membership , according to the report germans , particularly women , young people and catholics , are more religious than originally thought , according to a new study .
but more are turning away from traditional forms of religion to find their own path . seventy percent of adults in germany said they were religious , while 18 percent of these are " deeply religious , " reported the bertelsmann foundation in a study to be published on tuesday , dec .
18 . those who characterized themselves as " deeply religious " said they regularly attend worship services , pray often and have deep religious convictions .
another 29 percent of germans identified themselves as not religious . " we can definitely not confirm the long-term extinction of religion that comes up again and again , " said the leader of the study , martin rieger .
" the fact is that there is great stability of religious consciousness among a wide spectrum of social groups , which is very diverse . " the study suggests that young people between 18 and 29 years of age in germany have stronger religious convictions than their parents , though they do n't necessarily act on them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholics showed relatively strong interest in astrology forty-one percent of those surveyed from the 18-29 age bracket said they believe in god and life after death , more than in any other age group .
just over half of the young people said they are religious -lrb- 14 percent highly religious -rrb- , though 50 percent said they seldom or never pray . spirituality strays from tradition forms every fifth person surveyed in germany said that faith should be assembled from various religious teachings according to one 's personal opinion .
furthermore , 11 percent of catholics also reported a belief in astrology , while the number was significantly lower - 6 percent - among non-church members . the stereotype of the elderly being especially religious seems to be only partially true .
one third of those over 60 said they did n't believe in life after death while 18 percent regularly attend a religious service . more than twice as many of the self-professing " deeply religious " germans belonged to the catholic church as those who belong to the protestant church .
germany recognizes both the catholic and a protestant churches and imposes a tax on its members , which is paid back to the churches . approximately two thirds of the country officially belong to one of the two state churches , though membership does n't necessarily have an impact on personal religious convictions or church attendance , according to the study .
one sixth of church members reported being " not religious . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam is the third largest religious group in germany approximately 4 percent of people in germany are muslim - the third largest religious group next to catholicism and protestantism - while 0.3 percent are buddhist and 0.2 percent jewish . former gdr less spiritual than west a divide was apparent in the study between eastern and western germany .
while 78 percent of western germans identified themselves as religious , 21 percent of these as highly religious , the numbers were 36 percent and 8 percent , respectively , in eastern germany .
as in most communist countries , the government took an antagonistic view of religion in the former east germany . differences between the genders were also revealed by the study , with 20 percent of women and 16 percent of men reporting deep religiosity .
contrarily , 23 percent of women and 34 percent of men said they were not religious . the bertelsmann foundation posed nearly 100 questions pertaining to religion to 21,000 adults in 21 countries . nigeria , brazil , india and morocco reported with over 90 percent the highest rates of religiosity .
in europe , germany ranks behind italy and poland , but ahead of great britain and france in terms of the number of practicing believers . in the united states , 89 percent of those surveyed characterized themselves as religious , 62 percent as deeply religious . religious conviction is n't necessarily tied to church membership , according to the report catholics showed relatively strong interest in astrology islam is the third largest religious group in germany dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to information from german public broadcaster ard , spirit made airbus an offer on friday , dec .
14 . expertise in carbon-fiber technology wichita , kansas based spirit is known for its expertise in modern carbon-fiber technology , which is expected to play an important role in the construction of future airbus models . the expertise , along with a desire to move some production to dollar-based zones , put spirit ahead of german bidders , reports said . avoiding the currency squeeze the head of airbus parent company eads , louis gallois , said earlier this month that the aerospace giant had " no choice " but to shift some production by airbus to dollar-based zones to soften the financial impact of a soaring euro . airbus sells its planes in dollars but its costs are in the european single currency .
with the dollar steadily depreciating against the euro , airbus earnings have plummeted . three german factories - in augsburg , nordenham and varung - are up for sale .
a british factory , in filton , is also part of the deal . unions oppose sale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company hit snags when making the massive a380 unions representing airbus employees are opposed to the spirit deal , according to news reports .

other than spirit , germany 's mt aerospace is bidding for the airbus factories .
but observers say the concern is too small for such a massive takeover . overall , airbus plans to shed 10,000 jobs and sell a total of six factories as part of its " power8 " restructuring plan , which was prompted by severe problems encountered with its a380 superjumbo jet program . spirit aerosysteems has a very close working relationship with airbus rival boeing , reports said .

this potentially stinky question arose when police in the western german city of bielefeld stopped a man carrying two heavy garbage bags stuffed with athletic socks . at least the 172 pairs of soccer socks were clean .
one shudders to imagine the collective smell of 344 dirty athletic socks .
in fact , the socks in question were brand-stinking new .
and that left a 30-year-old man with some explaining to do , given that socks are normally considered a re-usable commodity .
police stopped the man as he walked down the street weighed down by two lumpy garbage bags on monday , dec .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe he just did n't want to do laundry ... ever again one can only imagine the possible excuses : maybe he wanted to avoid doing laundry .
this general aversion to dealing with washing machines has led many other men to throw away what they could easily wash and reuse .
or maybe the man 's girlfriend had barred all stiff , stinky socks from entering the apartment .
possibly there was a guinness world records attempt in the making .
or maybe he simply had a lot of soccer playing fans on his christmas list .
whatever his story , police did n't buy it .
after listening to the man 's " conflicting statements " about the origin of the socks , police decided they had been stolen .
they eventually determined the socks had been swiped from a container at a trucking company where they were awaiting shipment .
police said that the man , said to be a drug addict , had hoped to make money for his habit by selling the socks . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but france signed a nuclear deal with libya last week and russia just delivered nuclear fuel to iran . frank-walter steinmeier opposed offering nuclear power assistance to middle eastern countries in an interview with the monday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . " i can not support using nuclear power as the solution to the world 's energy problems or scattering nuclear power stations over regions that lack the competence to deal with this technology and where there is insufficient certainty about political stability , " steinmeier said . he had been asked about his opinion on the deal french president nicolas sarkozy signed last week with libyan president moammar el gadhafi to deliver one or more nuclear reactors to the northern african country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , seen here with gadhafi , has promised nuclear reactors to libya however , steinmeier conceded that certain exceptions could be made .
he added that germany had been involved in negotiations with iran and offers had been made to provide assistance in establishing a civil nuclear power program in the country . russian sends nuclear fuel to iran the foreign minister 's statements coincide with the delivery of russian nuclear fuel to iran 's bushehr atomic power station on monday , which was confirmed by officials in both countries .
after several further deliveries , the plant will be ready for service in about six months . russia said that tehran had promised the fuel would not be used for military purposes and that it had called on iran to halt its uranium enrichment program . " we believe that qualitatively the new conditions have been created which will allow iran to take the steps which are demanded of it … for the restoration of trust in the peaceful nature of the iranian nuclear program , " said the russian foreign ministry in a statement . a top iranian official rejected the demand from russia , saying his country refused to halt its uranium enrichment program .
the united states and its allies have suspected that iran 's uranium program was being used to build an atomic weapon and not solely to provide its population with energy . russia 's delivery had been delayed for months due to international negotiations surrounding iran 's nuclear program and warnings from the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier does n't see eye to eye with the chancellor earlier this month , a us security report concluded that , contrary to previous information , iran had ceased its military nuclear program in 2003 . steinmeier said the report took off some pressure and that he saw " great readiness " on the part of the us to use the time gained by knowing that iran is n't currently a nuclear power , but doubted whether tehran would show the same willingness . steinmeier too russia-friendly , say critics in the same interview , the foreign minister took a soft line with russia , despite monday 's delivery of nuclear fuel , saying that germany should develop a thriving relationship with the former soviet power . " this perspective does n't require a certificate on the quality of the russian form of government , " he said , deliberately contradicting chancellor angela merkel , who commented following last month 's parliamentary elections that russia was n't a democracy . " without a doubt , a great degree of stability has been achieved in russia during the eight years of putin 's presidency , " added steinmeier , who is a member of germany 's social democratic party .
he has been accused by his christian democratic coalition partners of being too friendly with russia . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but france signed a nuclear deal with libya last week and russia just delivered nuclear fuel to iran . frank-walter steinmeier opposed offering nuclear power assistance to middle eastern countries in an interview with the monday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . " i can not support using nuclear power as the solution to the world 's energy problems or scattering nuclear power stations over regions that lack the competence to deal with this technology and where there is insufficient certainty about political stability , " steinmeier said . he had been asked about his opinion on the deal french president nicolas sarkozy signed last week with libyan president moammar el gadhafi to deliver one or more nuclear reactors to the northern african country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , seen here with gadhafi , has promised nuclear reactors to libya however , steinmeier conceded that certain exceptions could be made .
he added that germany had been involved in negotiations with iran and offers had been made to provide assistance in establishing a civil nuclear power program in the country . russian sends nuclear fuel to iran the foreign minister 's statements coincide with the delivery of russian nuclear fuel to iran 's bushehr atomic power station on monday , which was confirmed by officials in both countries .
after several further deliveries , the plant will be ready for service in about six months . russia said that tehran had promised the fuel would not be used for military purposes and that it had called on iran to halt its uranium enrichment program . " we believe that qualitatively the new conditions have been created which will allow iran to take the steps which are demanded of it … for the restoration of trust in the peaceful nature of the iranian nuclear program , " said the russian foreign ministry in a statement . a top iranian official rejected the demand from russia , saying his country refused to halt its uranium enrichment program .
the united states and its allies have suspected that iran 's uranium program was being used to build an atomic weapon and not solely to provide its population with energy . russia 's delivery had been delayed for months due to international negotiations surrounding iran 's nuclear program and warnings from the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier does n't see eye to eye with the chancellor earlier this month , a us security report concluded that , contrary to previous information , iran had ceased its military nuclear program in 2003 . steinmeier said the report took off some pressure and that he saw " great readiness " on the part of the us to use the time gained by knowing that iran is n't currently a nuclear power , but doubted whether tehran would show the same willingness . steinmeier too russia-friendly , say critics in the same interview , the foreign minister took a soft line with russia , despite monday 's delivery of nuclear fuel , saying that germany should develop a thriving relationship with the former soviet power . " this perspective does n't require a certificate on the quality of the russian form of government , " he said , deliberately contradicting chancellor angela merkel , who commented following last month 's parliamentary elections that russia was n't a democracy . " without a doubt , a great degree of stability has been achieved in russia during the eight years of putin 's presidency , " added steinmeier , who is a member of germany 's social democratic party .

this potentially stinky question arose when police in the western german city of bielefeld stopped a man carrying two heavy garbage bags stuffed with athletic socks . at least the 172 pairs of soccer socks were clean .
one shudders to imagine the collective smell of 344 dirty athletic socks .
in fact , the socks in question were brand-stinking new .
and that left a 30-year-old man with some explaining to do , given that socks are normally considered a re-usable commodity .
police stopped the man as he walked down the street weighed down by two lumpy garbage bags on monday , dec .

this general aversion to dealing with washing machines has led many other men to throw away what they could easily wash and reuse .
or maybe the man 's girlfriend had barred all stiff , stinky socks from entering the apartment .
possibly there was a guinness world records attempt in the making .
or maybe he simply had a lot of soccer playing fans on his christmas list .
whatever his story , police did n't buy it .
after listening to the man 's " conflicting statements " about the origin of the socks , police decided they had been stolen .
they eventually determined the socks had been swiped from a container at a trucking company where they were awaiting shipment .
police said that the man , said to be a drug addict , had hoped to make money for his habit by selling the socks . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this potentially stinky question arose when police in the western german city of bielefeld stopped a man carrying two heavy garbage bags stuffed with athletic socks . at least the 172 pairs of soccer socks were clean .
one shudders to imagine the collective smell of 344 dirty athletic socks .
in fact , the socks in question were brand-stinking new .
and that left a 30-year-old man with some explaining to do , given that socks are normally considered a re-usable commodity .
police stopped the man as he walked down the street weighed down by two lumpy garbage bags on monday , dec .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe he just did n't want to do laundry ... ever again one can only imagine the possible excuses : maybe he wanted to avoid doing laundry .
this general aversion to dealing with washing machines has led many other men to throw away what they could easily wash and reuse .
or maybe the man 's girlfriend had barred all stiff , stinky socks from entering the apartment .
possibly there was a guinness world records attempt in the making .
or maybe he simply had a lot of soccer playing fans on his christmas list .
whatever his story , police did n't buy it .
after listening to the man 's " conflicting statements " about the origin of the socks , police decided they had been stolen .
they eventually determined the socks had been swiped from a container at a trucking company where they were awaiting shipment .
police said that the man , said to be a drug addict , had hoped to make money for his habit by selling the socks . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but more are turning away from traditional forms of religion to find their own path . seventy percent of adults in germany said they were religious , while 18 percent of these are " deeply religious , " reported the bertelsmann foundation in a study to be published on tuesday , dec .
18 . those who characterized themselves as " deeply religious " said they regularly attend worship services , pray often and have deep religious convictions .
another 29 percent of germans identified themselves as not religious . " we can definitely not confirm the long-term extinction of religion that comes up again and again , " said the leader of the study , martin rieger .
" the fact is that there is great stability of religious consciousness among a wide spectrum of social groups , which is very diverse .

one third of those over 60 said they did n't believe in life after death while 18 percent regularly attend a religious service . more than twice as many of the self-professing " deeply religious " germans belonged to the catholic church as those who belong to the protestant church .
germany recognizes both the catholic and a protestant churches and imposes a tax on its members , which is paid back to the churches . approximately two thirds of the country officially belong to one of the two state churches , though membership does n't necessarily have an impact on personal religious convictions or church attendance , according to the study .

16 . airbus boss thomas enders could be days away from selling four of the aircraft maker 's factories to us company spirit aero systems , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus chief enders could sign the deal before christmas on sunday in hamburg , airbus spokesman tore prang told the paper that although negotiations were well advanced , an agreement had yet to be signed .
according to information from german public broadcaster ard , spirit made airbus an offer on friday , dec .
14 . expertise in carbon-fiber technology wichita , kansas based spirit is known for its expertise in modern carbon-fiber technology , which is expected to play an important role in the construction of future airbus models . the expertise , along with a desire to move some production to dollar-based zones , put spirit ahead of german bidders , reports said . avoiding the currency squeeze the head of airbus parent company eads , louis gallois , said earlier this month that the aerospace giant had " no choice " but to shift some production by airbus to dollar-based zones to soften the financial impact of a soaring euro . airbus sells its planes in dollars but its costs are in the european single currency .
with the dollar steadily depreciating against the euro , airbus earnings have plummeted . three german factories - in augsburg , nordenham and varung - are up for sale .
a british factory , in filton , is also part of the deal . unions oppose sale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company hit snags when making the massive a380 unions representing airbus employees are opposed to the spirit deal , according to news reports .
marina lensky , from the french union cfdt , told the press last week that workers " did not trust " spirit management to retain jobs " the french , english and german unions agree that spirit should not be chosen " to buy the factories , she told reporters .
other than spirit , germany 's mt aerospace is bidding for the airbus factories .
but observers say the concern is too small for such a massive takeover . overall , airbus plans to shed 10,000 jobs and sell a total of six factories as part of its " power8 " restructuring plan , which was prompted by severe problems encountered with its a380 superjumbo jet program . spirit aerosysteems has a very close working relationship with airbus rival boeing , reports said .
but it is also an airbus supplier . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de airbus head calls for production move to united states building aircraft in the euro zone is becoming financially impossible , said the head of airbus .
the likely result will be a partial shift of production to the united states to take advantage of the weak dollar .

but more are turning away from traditional forms of religion to find their own path . seventy percent of adults in germany said they were religious , while 18 percent of these are " deeply religious , " reported the bertelsmann foundation in a study to be published on tuesday , dec .

another 29 percent of germans identified themselves as not religious . " we can definitely not confirm the long-term extinction of religion that comes up again and again , " said the leader of the study , martin rieger .
" the fact is that there is great stability of religious consciousness among a wide spectrum of social groups , which is very diverse .

one third of those over 60 said they did n't believe in life after death while 18 percent regularly attend a religious service . more than twice as many of the self-professing " deeply religious " germans belonged to the catholic church as those who belong to the protestant church .
germany recognizes both the catholic and a protestant churches and imposes a tax on its members , which is paid back to the churches . approximately two thirds of the country officially belong to one of the two state churches , though membership does n't necessarily have an impact on personal religious convictions or church attendance , according to the study .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 17.12.2007 every fifth german professes " deep religious " convictions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religious conviction is n't necessarily tied to church membership , according to the report germans , particularly women , young people and catholics , are more religious than originally thought , according to a new study .
but more are turning away from traditional forms of religion to find their own path . seventy percent of adults in germany said they were religious , while 18 percent of these are " deeply religious , " reported the bertelsmann foundation in a study to be published on tuesday , dec .
18 . those who characterized themselves as " deeply religious " said they regularly attend worship services , pray often and have deep religious convictions .
another 29 percent of germans identified themselves as not religious . " we can definitely not confirm the long-term extinction of religion that comes up again and again , " said the leader of the study , martin rieger .
" the fact is that there is great stability of religious consciousness among a wide spectrum of social groups , which is very diverse . " the study suggests that young people between 18 and 29 years of age in germany have stronger religious convictions than their parents , though they do n't necessarily act on them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholics showed relatively strong interest in astrology forty-one percent of those surveyed from the 18-29 age bracket said they believe in god and life after death , more than in any other age group .
just over half of the young people said they are religious -lrb- 14 percent highly religious -rrb- , though 50 percent said they seldom or never pray . spirituality strays from tradition forms every fifth person surveyed in germany said that faith should be assembled from various religious teachings according to one 's personal opinion .
furthermore , 11 percent of catholics also reported a belief in astrology , while the number was significantly lower - 6 percent - among non-church members . the stereotype of the elderly being especially religious seems to be only partially true .
one third of those over 60 said they did n't believe in life after death while 18 percent regularly attend a religious service . more than twice as many of the self-professing " deeply religious " germans belonged to the catholic church as those who belong to the protestant church .
germany recognizes both the catholic and a protestant churches and imposes a tax on its members , which is paid back to the churches . approximately two thirds of the country officially belong to one of the two state churches , though membership does n't necessarily have an impact on personal religious convictions or church attendance , according to the study .
one sixth of church members reported being " not religious . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam is the third largest religious group in germany approximately 4 percent of people in germany are muslim - the third largest religious group next to catholicism and protestantism - while 0.3 percent are buddhist and 0.2 percent jewish . former gdr less spiritual than west a divide was apparent in the study between eastern and western germany .
while 78 percent of western germans identified themselves as religious , 21 percent of these as highly religious , the numbers were 36 percent and 8 percent , respectively , in eastern germany .
as in most communist countries , the government took an antagonistic view of religion in the former east germany . differences between the genders were also revealed by the study , with 20 percent of women and 16 percent of men reporting deep religiosity .
contrarily , 23 percent of women and 34 percent of men said they were not religious . the bertelsmann foundation posed nearly 100 questions pertaining to religion to 21,000 adults in 21 countries . nigeria , brazil , india and morocco reported with over 90 percent the highest rates of religiosity .
in europe , germany ranks behind italy and poland , but ahead of great britain and france in terms of the number of practicing believers . in the united states , 89 percent of those surveyed characterized themselves as religious , 62 percent as deeply religious . religious conviction is n't necessarily tied to church membership , according to the report catholics showed relatively strong interest in astrology islam is the third largest religious group in germany dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , pledged $ 7.4 billion -lrb- 5.15 billion euros -rrb- for the palestinians at a donor conference in paris .
will it save the region from a catastrophe ? at the start of the conference on monday , dec .
17 , palestinian president mahmud abbas urged the international community to step up financial aid to the palestinians or risk a " catastrophe . " " without this support , without the payment of aid that will allow the palestinian treasury to fulfill its role , we will be facing a total catastrophe in the west bank and gaza , " abbas told the opening ceremony , at a conference center near the arc de triomphe in paris .
abbas had asked for $ 5.6 billion by 2010 to help develop a viable economy for a future palestinian state . " we are way ahead of this amount , " said palestinian prime minister salam fayyad , whom abbas appointed as palestinian prime minister when hamas seized armed control of the gaza strip . " that 's the most important thing , " fayyad added .
" we see this as an important vote of confidence from the international community .
this conference provided endorsement for our vision of statehood . " the donor conference was the biggest meeting of its kind since 1996 .
some 90 delegations had announced pledges at the one-day gathering .
of the sum promised , $ 3.4 billion is to be directed to the palestinian government 's 2008 budget . tony blair , middle east envoy for the diplomatic " quartet " , said the money would be used for " building the capacity and the institutions for the -lrb- palestinian -rrb- state . " " over the next few months what we have got to show to people is that we are capable of making the difference on the ground , " he said . eu leads donation pledges the european commission pledged to donate $ 650 million in aid for 2008 , while britain announced a three-year aid package of up to $ 490 million .
opening the conference earlier , french president nicolas sarkozy pledged $ 300 million over three years .
germany promised $ 200 million by 2010 and sweden offered $ 300 million in 2007 and 2008 . the united states promised $ 555 million for 2008 .
saudi arabia was to provide $ 500 million over three years , diplomats said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the money was to support the reform and development program of the palestinian government . but she also called for israel to cease blockading the palestinian economy and to halt the building of settlements in the west bank . " the development plan can only be effective if the economic development of palestine is no longer hindered , if the building of settlements by israel is stopped and if the inner-palestinian divide can be overcome , " she said . the money was intended to improve the miserable conditions under which palestinians were living and to support the israeli-palestinian peace process , wieczorek-zeul said from berlin . sarkozy proposal gets rise from hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can high-level meetings help bring about mideast peace ?
wieczorek-zeul 's calls for a halt to israeli settlements in the west bank and gaza was echoed by french president nicolas sarkozy . in his address to the opening ceremony , sarkozy said " the paris conference must accompany the progressive construction of a modern state . " he called for the creation of an international force to beef up the palestinian security services , " when the time comes and when the conditions are right . " " the palestinian services need to reform , to become more professional .
in parallel , israel must withdraw from the west bank , " sarkozy said . the radical islamist group hamas slammed the french proposal , saying an international force in the mideast would amount to " blatant interference " in internal affairs . israel claims commitment to independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom of movement for palestinians is a big issue .
here , a gaza check-point israel responded by saying it is committed to the establishment of an independent and viable palestinian state . israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said israel wants " the obstacles to the palestinian economy and daily life to be removed . " " we have no desire to control palestinian lives , " she added .
" we do not want the image of israel in the palestinian mind to be a soldier at a checkpoint . " abbas seeks halt to israeli settlements as the conference kicked off , abbas called on israel to freeze all settlements in the palestinian territories to allow the newly re-launched peace process to gain a foothold . " i expect a complete halt of all settlement activities without exception , the dismantlement of the 127 wildcat settlements set up since 2001 , the reopening of palestinian institutions closed in jerusalem , the lifting of military barrages , a halt to construction of the separation barrier and the release of prisoners , " abbas told the conference . at a us-sponsored meeting in annapolis , maryland last month , israel and the palestinians pledged to seek a peace deal by the end of next year , relaunching negotiations frozen for seven years . dw staff -lrb- jen / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , pledged $ 7.4 billion -lrb- 5.15 billion euros -rrb- for the palestinians at a donor conference in paris .
will it save the region from a catastrophe ? at the start of the conference on monday , dec .
17 , palestinian president mahmud abbas urged the international community to step up financial aid to the palestinians or risk a " catastrophe . " " without this support , without the payment of aid that will allow the palestinian treasury to fulfill its role , we will be facing a total catastrophe in the west bank and gaza , " abbas told the opening ceremony , at a conference center near the arc de triomphe in paris .
abbas had asked for $ 5.6 billion by 2010 to help develop a viable economy for a future palestinian state . " we are way ahead of this amount , " said palestinian prime minister salam fayyad , whom abbas appointed as palestinian prime minister when hamas seized armed control of the gaza strip . " that 's the most important thing , " fayyad added .
" we see this as an important vote of confidence from the international community .
this conference provided endorsement for our vision of statehood . " the donor conference was the biggest meeting of its kind since 1996 .
some 90 delegations had announced pledges at the one-day gathering .
of the sum promised , $ 3.4 billion is to be directed to the palestinian government 's 2008 budget . tony blair , middle east envoy for the diplomatic " quartet " , said the money would be used for " building the capacity and the institutions for the -lrb- palestinian -rrb- state . " " over the next few months what we have got to show to people is that we are capable of making the difference on the ground , " he said . eu leads donation pledges the european commission pledged to donate $ 650 million in aid for 2008 , while britain announced a three-year aid package of up to $ 490 million .
opening the conference earlier , french president nicolas sarkozy pledged $ 300 million over three years .
germany promised $ 200 million by 2010 and sweden offered $ 300 million in 2007 and 2008 . the united states promised $ 555 million for 2008 .
saudi arabia was to provide $ 500 million over three years , diplomats said . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the money was to support the reform and development program of the palestinian government . but she also called for israel to cease blockading the palestinian economy and to halt the building of settlements in the west bank . " the development plan can only be effective if the economic development of palestine is no longer hindered , if the building of settlements by israel is stopped and if the inner-palestinian divide can be overcome , " she said . the money was intended to improve the miserable conditions under which palestinians were living and to support the israeli-palestinian peace process , wieczorek-zeul said from berlin . sarkozy proposal gets rise from hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can high-level meetings help bring about mideast peace ?
wieczorek-zeul 's calls for a halt to israeli settlements in the west bank and gaza was echoed by french president nicolas sarkozy . in his address to the opening ceremony , sarkozy said " the paris conference must accompany the progressive construction of a modern state . " he called for the creation of an international force to beef up the palestinian security services , " when the time comes and when the conditions are right . " " the palestinian services need to reform , to become more professional .
in parallel , israel must withdraw from the west bank , " sarkozy said . the radical islamist group hamas slammed the french proposal , saying an international force in the mideast would amount to " blatant interference " in internal affairs . israel claims commitment to independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom of movement for palestinians is a big issue .
here , a gaza check-point israel responded by saying it is committed to the establishment of an independent and viable palestinian state . israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said israel wants " the obstacles to the palestinian economy and daily life to be removed . " " we have no desire to control palestinian lives , " she added .
" we do not want the image of israel in the palestinian mind to be a soldier at a checkpoint . " abbas seeks halt to israeli settlements as the conference kicked off , abbas called on israel to freeze all settlements in the palestinian territories to allow the newly re-launched peace process to gain a foothold . " i expect a complete halt of all settlement activities without exception , the dismantlement of the 127 wildcat settlements set up since 2001 , the reopening of palestinian institutions closed in jerusalem , the lifting of military barrages , a halt to construction of the separation barrier and the release of prisoners , " abbas told the conference . at a us-sponsored meeting in annapolis , maryland last month , israel and the palestinians pledged to seek a peace deal by the end of next year , relaunching negotiations frozen for seven years . dw staff -lrb- jen / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 17.12.2007 every fifth german professes " deep religious " convictions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religious conviction is n't necessarily tied to church membership , according to the report germans , particularly women , young people and catholics , are more religious than originally thought , according to a new study .
but more are turning away from traditional forms of religion to find their own path . seventy percent of adults in germany said they were religious , while 18 percent of these are " deeply religious , " reported the bertelsmann foundation in a study to be published on tuesday , dec .
18 . those who characterized themselves as " deeply religious " said they regularly attend worship services , pray often and have deep religious convictions .
another 29 percent of germans identified themselves as not religious . " we can definitely not confirm the long-term extinction of religion that comes up again and again , " said the leader of the study , martin rieger .
" the fact is that there is great stability of religious consciousness among a wide spectrum of social groups , which is very diverse . " the study suggests that young people between 18 and 29 years of age in germany have stronger religious convictions than their parents , though they do n't necessarily act on them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholics showed relatively strong interest in astrology forty-one percent of those surveyed from the 18-29 age bracket said they believe in god and life after death , more than in any other age group .
just over half of the young people said they are religious -lrb- 14 percent highly religious -rrb- , though 50 percent said they seldom or never pray . spirituality strays from tradition forms every fifth person surveyed in germany said that faith should be assembled from various religious teachings according to one 's personal opinion .
furthermore , 11 percent of catholics also reported a belief in astrology , while the number was significantly lower - 6 percent - among non-church members . the stereotype of the elderly being especially religious seems to be only partially true .
one third of those over 60 said they did n't believe in life after death while 18 percent regularly attend a religious service . more than twice as many of the self-professing " deeply religious " germans belonged to the catholic church as those who belong to the protestant church .
germany recognizes both the catholic and a protestant churches and imposes a tax on its members , which is paid back to the churches . approximately two thirds of the country officially belong to one of the two state churches , though membership does n't necessarily have an impact on personal religious convictions or church attendance , according to the study .
one sixth of church members reported being " not religious . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam is the third largest religious group in germany approximately 4 percent of people in germany are muslim - the third largest religious group next to catholicism and protestantism - while 0.3 percent are buddhist and 0.2 percent jewish . former gdr less spiritual than west a divide was apparent in the study between eastern and western germany .
while 78 percent of western germans identified themselves as religious , 21 percent of these as highly religious , the numbers were 36 percent and 8 percent , respectively , in eastern germany .
as in most communist countries , the government took an antagonistic view of religion in the former east germany . differences between the genders were also revealed by the study , with 20 percent of women and 16 percent of men reporting deep religiosity .
contrarily , 23 percent of women and 34 percent of men said they were not religious . the bertelsmann foundation posed nearly 100 questions pertaining to religion to 21,000 adults in 21 countries . nigeria , brazil , india and morocco reported with over 90 percent the highest rates of religiosity .
in europe , germany ranks behind italy and poland , but ahead of great britain and france in terms of the number of practicing believers . in the united states , 89 percent of those surveyed characterized themselves as religious , 62 percent as deeply religious . religious conviction is n't necessarily tied to church membership , according to the report catholics showed relatively strong interest in astrology islam is the third largest religious group in germany dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 17.12.2007 opinion : mandate for kyoto successor redeems bali failure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the progress made in bali was minimal at best , writes dw 's jens thurau .
but the mandate for a kyoto successor treaty by 2009 and the isolation of the us delegation were two lights in the dark . four reports from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , a g8 summit in heiligendamm , a nobel peace prize for al gore and a world climate council - never before has there been so much talk about reducing greenhouse gases as in 2007 . then the environment ministers meet in blistering hot bali with more journalists than have ever attended a climate conference and the result is a minimal consensus . not a single reduction goal for after 2010 is included in the final text , although such goals have been the topic of discussion for weeks - even months - and warnings from scientists who have been recognized with the very highest prizes can be found in a one-and-a-half-line footnote . it 's the same old situation that 's to blame : the sacred oath that the wealthy states made at the environment summit in rio in 1992 to set a good example in cutting emissions has n't been kept .
the industrialized countries have lost valuable time - or , like the us and russia , simply approach the climate challenge with demonstrative apathy . for this reason , the emerging nations refuse - not without good reason - to risk the bit of prosperity they 've finally managed to attain by making commitments to climate protection . practically every climate conference ends in the same way : the us , with countries like canada and russia on its side , facing off against the developing nations .
it was no different this time . in a certain way , the ambitious europeans also bear some of the guilt .
they 're constantly naming the most extensive goals , but only a few eu states - including germany - will fulfill the aims of the kyoto protocol by 2012 . poor countries are fully aware of that . nevertheless , two aspects make the results of the bali conference just barely tolerable .
as expected , the mandate was issued to negotiate a successor treaty to kyoto by 2009 .
and , as india proposed a text change at the end of the conference , the us delegation , which rejected the proposal , had to come to terms with their exaggerated arrogance toward the third world .
no one , not even eternal allies canada or russia , stood by the americans , who ultimately gave up their resistance . in the end , the at least symbolic victory should give the developing countries , which are most burdened by climate change , more self-confidence . dw-tv 's correspondent and environment expert jens thurau reported on the un climate conference from bali . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 17.12.2007 opinion : mandate for kyoto successor redeems bali failure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the progress made in bali was minimal at best , writes dw 's jens thurau .
but the mandate for a kyoto successor treaty by 2009 and the isolation of the us delegation were two lights in the dark . four reports from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , a g8 summit in heiligendamm , a nobel peace prize for al gore and a world climate council - never before has there been so much talk about reducing greenhouse gases as in 2007 . then the environment ministers meet in blistering hot bali with more journalists than have ever attended a climate conference and the result is a minimal consensus . not a single reduction goal for after 2010 is included in the final text , although such goals have been the topic of discussion for weeks - even months - and warnings from scientists who have been recognized with the very highest prizes can be found in a one-and-a-half-line footnote . it 's the same old situation that 's to blame : the sacred oath that the wealthy states made at the environment summit in rio in 1992 to set a good example in cutting emissions has n't been kept .
the industrialized countries have lost valuable time - or , like the us and russia , simply approach the climate challenge with demonstrative apathy . for this reason , the emerging nations refuse - not without good reason - to risk the bit of prosperity they 've finally managed to attain by making commitments to climate protection . practically every climate conference ends in the same way : the us , with countries like canada and russia on its side , facing off against the developing nations .
it was no different this time . in a certain way , the ambitious europeans also bear some of the guilt .
they 're constantly naming the most extensive goals , but only a few eu states - including germany - will fulfill the aims of the kyoto protocol by 2012 . poor countries are fully aware of that . nevertheless , two aspects make the results of the bali conference just barely tolerable .
as expected , the mandate was issued to negotiate a successor treaty to kyoto by 2009 .
and , as india proposed a text change at the end of the conference , the us delegation , which rejected the proposal , had to come to terms with their exaggerated arrogance toward the third world .
no one , not even eternal allies canada or russia , stood by the americans , who ultimately gave up their resistance . in the end , the at least symbolic victory should give the developing countries , which are most burdened by climate change , more self-confidence . dw-tv 's correspondent and environment expert jens thurau reported on the un climate conference from bali . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 . airbus boss thomas enders could be days away from selling four of the aircraft maker 's factories to us company spirit aero systems , the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus chief enders could sign the deal before christmas on sunday in hamburg , airbus spokesman tore prang told the paper that although negotiations were well advanced , an agreement had yet to be signed .
according to information from german public broadcaster ard , spirit made airbus an offer on friday , dec .
14 . expertise in carbon-fiber technology wichita , kansas based spirit is known for its expertise in modern carbon-fiber technology , which is expected to play an important role in the construction of future airbus models . the expertise , along with a desire to move some production to dollar-based zones , put spirit ahead of german bidders , reports said . avoiding the currency squeeze the head of airbus parent company eads , louis gallois , said earlier this month that the aerospace giant had " no choice " but to shift some production by airbus to dollar-based zones to soften the financial impact of a soaring euro . airbus sells its planes in dollars but its costs are in the european single currency .
with the dollar steadily depreciating against the euro , airbus earnings have plummeted . three german factories - in augsburg , nordenham and varung - are up for sale .
a british factory , in filton , is also part of the deal . unions oppose sale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company hit snags when making the massive a380 unions representing airbus employees are opposed to the spirit deal , according to news reports .
marina lensky , from the french union cfdt , told the press last week that workers " did not trust " spirit management to retain jobs " the french , english and german unions agree that spirit should not be chosen " to buy the factories , she told reporters .
other than spirit , germany 's mt aerospace is bidding for the airbus factories .
but observers say the concern is too small for such a massive takeover . overall , airbus plans to shed 10,000 jobs and sell a total of six factories as part of its " power8 " restructuring plan , which was prompted by severe problems encountered with its a380 superjumbo jet program . spirit aerosysteems has a very close working relationship with airbus rival boeing , reports said .

kathryn fleet , 42 , from tredegar , blaenau gwent was found to be a match for kirsty , a student in swansea , after she suffered renal failure in april .
it is set to be the 100th transplant performed at the university hospital of wales in cardiff this year .
kirsty said she was excited to be getting her health back on track and about going back to college .
" i want to get back to university in september and get back to being the normal me , " she said .
' frightening moment ' kirsty , who is currently on dialysis three times a week , said she became unwell after attending a college ball eight months ago .
" i was violently sick the next day and the following week i just kept being sick and having really bad nosebleeds .
" i came home for easter and two weeks later i was in hospital hearing i had kidney failure , " kirsty added .
mrs fleet described her daughter 's diagnosis as a " frightening moment " .
" she had a throat infection but she was n't getting better and she 's never normally ill , but she was sleepy all the time and when she was awake she was being sick , " mrs fleet said .
kirsty fleet was told she would have to wait three years for a donor her daughter was given a blood test and within hours she was called to the hospital , underwent dialysis and had two blood transfusions .
after they took a biopsy of her kidneys , kirsty was told they were 70 % scarred .
she later learned that rather than having to wait for over three years for a kidney donor she was told of the possibility of having a live transplant .
all members of kirsty 's family , including her father mark , 21-year-old sister jodie and 18-year-old brother joel were compatible as donors , but mrs fleet was advised to go ahead with the transplant .
it is expected the whole process will take about 12 hours .
" mam will go down at around eight o 'clock in the morning and the operation will last for around three to four hours , " kirsty said .
" then they 'll call me down just as mam 's out of theatre and then i 'll go in because they do n't like leaving the kidney outside the body for too long .

kathryn fleet , 42 , from tredegar , blaenau gwent was found to be a match for kirsty , a student in swansea , after she suffered renal failure in april .
it is set to be the 100th transplant performed at the university hospital of wales in cardiff this year .
kirsty said she was excited to be getting her health back on track and about going back to college .
" i want to get back to university in september and get back to being the normal me , " she said .
' frightening moment ' kirsty , who is currently on dialysis three times a week , said she became unwell after attending a college ball eight months ago .
" i was violently sick the next day and the following week i just kept being sick and having really bad nosebleeds .
" i came home for easter and two weeks later i was in hospital hearing i had kidney failure , " kirsty added .
mrs fleet described her daughter 's diagnosis as a " frightening moment " .
" she had a throat infection but she was n't getting better and she 's never normally ill , but she was sleepy all the time and when she was awake she was being sick , " mrs fleet said .
kirsty fleet was told she would have to wait three years for a donor her daughter was given a blood test and within hours she was called to the hospital , underwent dialysis and had two blood transfusions .
after they took a biopsy of her kidneys , kirsty was told they were 70 % scarred .
she later learned that rather than having to wait for over three years for a kidney donor she was told of the possibility of having a live transplant .
all members of kirsty 's family , including her father mark , 21-year-old sister jodie and 18-year-old brother joel were compatible as donors , but mrs fleet was advised to go ahead with the transplant .
it is expected the whole process will take about 12 hours .
" mam will go down at around eight o 'clock in the morning and the operation will last for around three to four hours , " kirsty said .
" then they 'll call me down just as mam 's out of theatre and then i 'll go in because they do n't like leaving the kidney outside the body for too long .
" i should be back on the ward by around eight o 'clock at night - it 's a 12-hour job really , " she said .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- can a village really make you healthy ?

by nick triggle health reporter , bbc news the government is keen to see a series of healthy towns set up to combat the uk 's growing obesity problem .
ministers say we should learn from places in finland and france , but a buckinghamshire village has also been pioneering the approach .
you only need to look at the signposts in fairford leys to see that it is different .
the blue signs may seem fairly normal on first glance .
but they have actually been designed for cyclists , giving details on the time it takes to various landmarks .
it is just one of many initiatives aimed at encouraging the residents in the 1,900-home village to live healthy lives .
nestled on the outskirts of aylesbury , fairford leys has been built over the last 10 years on what was farmland owned by the ernest cook trust , a charity set up to promote the well-being of communities .
when selling the land to developers , the trust set down strict criteria saying how it should be designed .
it covers every aspect of the village from the victorian-style lamp-posts to the colour of railings .
restrictions it means that if residents even want to change the style of their windows they have to apply for permission .
but the restrictions have also ensured the developers built what today would be considered a " healthy town " .
indeed , encouraging healthy lifestyles was one of the main aims of the 1989 masterplan , which stressed the need to create a place where the " motor car was not allowed to dominate " . "
my oldest is always out on his bike with his friends and once my youngest two are older i will use the cycle routes " ann-marie jones , resident guy greaves , an adviser to ernest cook for the past 17 years , said : " the idea was to create a sustainable community .
" we wanted people to be active so while we accommodated the car , the village has actually been designed so that it is easier to walk or cycle round than drive . "
that has been achieved by avoiding the cul-de-sacs and dead ends so common in towns up-and-down the country .
instead , paths and cycle routes criss-cross the village , allowing easy , direct access to the local amenities , while motorists have to wind round the residential streets .
the village also boasts countless playgrounds , a skate-park and health centre .
there is even a sports pavilion surrounded by pitches , which is home to fairford 's three under 17 football teams - a remarkable number for a village of its size .
praise and the design certainly seems to have had the desired effect .
fairford leys was praised in a recent report by the commission for the built environment , a government advisory body , for creating a healthy community .
experts said the design was " likely to promote the higher levels of daily physical activity across the whole spectrum of residents , from children to the elderly " .
and local residents support this view .
ann-marie jones , a young mother of three who moved to fairford leys in 2001 , said : " i find it very time consuming using the car trying to find parking spaces and then having to unload children .
" it is just much easier to walk or bus .
" my oldest is always out on his bike with his friends and once my youngest two are older i will use the cycle routes . "
and andy pohler , 40 , who has lived in the village for the last seven years and runs the fairford leys website , added : " fairford leys is a fantastic place to live .
at the weekend , you see lots of children outside playing outside .
" it is important to create that sort of feel because it does encourage people to be healthy .
fashion buoyed by the success of fairford leys , aylesbury district council , in partnership with buckinghamshire county council , is planning to create other " healthy communities " .
building work is already starting on a development to the north of aylesbury and the council also has its sights on another plot to the south .
john byrne , head of planning at aylesbury council , said : " the idea of creating a healthy environment is in fashion now , but it was unheard of when fairford leys was being planned in the 1980s .
" ernest cook was 10 years ahead of its time really .
as a landowner they were able to lay down stipulations that local authorities could n't .
" nowadays the climate has changed .
" it is now being recognised that we should be trying to prevent ill-health , rather than just providing facilities to treat people when they are broken .
" and good planning can play a key role in that . "

by nick triggle health reporter , bbc news the government is keen to see a series of healthy towns set up to combat the uk 's growing obesity problem .
ministers say we should learn from places in finland and france , but a buckinghamshire village has also been pioneering the approach .
the signposts have been designed for cyclists not motorists you only need to look at the signposts in fairford leys to see that it is different .
the blue signs may seem fairly normal on first glance .
but they have actually been designed for cyclists , giving details on the time it takes to various landmarks .
it is just one of many initiatives aimed at encouraging the residents in the 1,900-home village to live healthy lives .
nestled on the outskirts of aylesbury , fairford leys has been built over the last 10 years on what was farmland owned by the ernest cook trust , a charity set up to promote the well-being of communities .
when selling the land to developers , the trust set down strict criteria saying how it should be designed .
it covers every aspect of the village from the victorian-style lamp-posts to the colour of railings .
restrictions it means that if residents even want to change the style of their windows they have to apply for permission .
but the restrictions have also ensured the developers built what today would be considered a " healthy town " .
indeed , encouraging healthy lifestyles was one of the main aims of the 1989 masterplan , which stressed the need to create a place where the " motor car was not allowed to dominate " .
my oldest is always out on his bike with his friends and once my youngest two are older i will use the cycle routes ann-marie jones , resident guy greaves , an adviser to ernest cook for the past 17 years , said : " the idea was to create a sustainable community .
" we wanted people to be active so while we accommodated the car , the village has actually been designed so that it is easier to walk or cycle round than drive . "
that has been achieved by avoiding the cul-de-sacs and dead ends so common in towns up-and-down the country .
instead , paths and cycle routes criss-cross the village , allowing easy , direct access to the local amenities , while motorists have to wind round the residential streets .
the village also boasts countless playgrounds , a skate-park and health centre .
there is even a sports pavilion surrounded by pitches , which is home to fairford 's three under 17 football teams - a remarkable number for a village of its size .
praise and the design certainly seems to have had the desired effect .
fairford leys was praised in a recent report by the commission for the built environment , a government advisory body , for creating a healthy community .
experts said the design was " likely to promote the higher levels of daily physical activity across the whole spectrum of residents , from children to the elderly " .
the council is planning to build more " healthy communities " and local residents support this view .
ann-marie jones , a young mother of three who moved to fairford leys in 2001 , said : " i find it very time consuming using the car trying to find parking spaces and then having to unload children .
" it is just much easier to walk or bus .
" my oldest is always out on his bike with his friends and once my youngest two are older i will use the cycle routes . "
and andy pohler , 40 , who has lived in the village for the last seven years and runs the fairford leys website , added : " fairford leys is a fantastic place to live .
at the weekend , you see lots of children outside playing outside .
" it is important to create that sort of feel because it does encourage people to be healthy .
fashion buoyed by the success of fairford leys , aylesbury district council , in partnership with buckinghamshire county council , is planning to create other " healthy communities " .
building work is already starting on a development to the north of aylesbury and the council also has its sights on another plot to the south .
it is often easier to walk around the village than drive john byrne , head of planning at aylesbury council , said : " the idea of creating a healthy environment is in fashion now , but it was unheard of when fairford leys was being planned in the 1980s .
" ernest cook was 10 years ahead of its time really .
as a landowner they were able to lay down stipulations that local authorities could n't .
" nowadays the climate has changed .
" it is now being recognised that we should be trying to prevent ill-health , rather than just providing facilities to treat people when they are broken .
" and good planning can play a key role in that . "

the decision to investigate lee myung-bak comes just two days before wednesday 's polls .
mr lee was recently cleared of links to an alleged fraud to fix stock prices .
but the scandal resurfaced on sunday , when a video emerged in which mr lee said he had established the company at the centre of the allegations .
rival lawmakers have come to blows in parliament in recent days as members of mr lee 's grand national party -lrb- gnp -rrb- tried to stop rival united new democratic party -lrb- undp -rrb- lawmakers from voting in the special counsel .
accusations a 65-year-old former hyundai executive who served as mayor of seoul , mr lee is tipped to win wednesday 's election .
opinion polls show he has more than double the support of any other candidate .
the huge gap between mr lee and his rivals is all the more remarkable because of the accusations of property speculation , tax evasion and fraud that have dogged his campaign .
the current president , roh moo-hyun , ends his term in february and can not seek re-election .
a victory by mr lee would see the gnp return to power for the first time in a decade .
on sunday , mr roh asked justice minister chung soung-jin to consider re-opening the investigation into mr lee 's alleged links to a fraud case concerning an investment firm called bbk .
mr lee had previously said he had nothing to do with the company , but his opponents say the video clip which surfaced on sunday proves he was lying .
in return , the gnp has accused mr roh of meddling in the election .
early on monday the justice ministry rejected mr roh 's call to reopen the fraud probe , saying prosecutors had already looked into the case .
but an official said the ministry would accept an independent counsel " if parliament introduces it " - which is what the parliament has now voted to do .

mr mcleod said redundancy notices were being issued to 25 staff .

mr mcleod said : " unfortunately the public are going to be denied the chance to visit a very interesting and exciting place , which we need to get developed .
" we need to get all the local authorities together to see what they way forward is . "
the site narrowly missed out on a £ 2m windfall , when it was featured on the bbc 's restoration - but it failed to win enough public votes .
