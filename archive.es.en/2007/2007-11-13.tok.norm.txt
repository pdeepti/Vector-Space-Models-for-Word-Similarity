but would that secure his position for euro 2008 ? jens lehmann may be top dog for germany at the moment , but he 's barely even second fiddle for english club arsenal .
he has n't played a match for the gunners since early this season , and that 's raised the question of whether germany should stay true to a keeper who 's not on the pitch week in and week out . " i would like to play again as soon as possible , " lehmann told the german soccer magazine kicker on monday , nov .

they also foresee giving brussels the ability to overturn national regulators ' decisions and would create an eu telecommunications watchdog organization .

demands for independence are heating up , even as the international community is divided on whether it 's good for the region . time is running out for an agreement on kosovo .
the troika of the european union , the united states and russia overseeing current talks on kosovo has made no progress and is up against a dec .
10 deadline set by the united nations to issue its final report .
the us has continued to advocate independence while russia opposes it and europe remains divided on the issue . the eu has promised that the troika will take a " more proactive attitude " in negotiating with serbia and kosovo , a spokeswoman for the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana said monday , nov .
12 .
not only that , but the troika will present concrete proposals next week to bridge the impasse , the spokeswoman said . independent streak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has administered kosovo since 1999 but experts wonder if it will be enough after many rounds of negotiations have failed to find a compromise and both the serbian and kosovar fronts look hardened . " preserving kosovo and the serb republic -lsb- the eastern half of bosnia-herzegovina -rsb- are now the most important goals of our state and national policy , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica told reuters news agency last week . there are some signs that kosovo 's albanian politicians , increasingly calling for independence in recent weeks , are running out of patience after years of negotiations . prime minister agim ceku said kosovo was willing to wait until december before unilaterally declaring independence , but not much longer . " it is better to ask for an apology than for permission , " ceku said in an interview last week with the new york times .
" the time for a decision has come . " veton surroi , a member of the kosovo albanian 's negotiating team and leader of the opposition ora party , also said he 's unwilling to wait on washington much longer . " kosovo 's assembly should set the independence date before christmas , " surroi told the balkan investigative reporting network recently . campaign rhetoric heats up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pristina is a city in limbo some of the recent calls for independence can be attributed to the country 's upcoming elections , which will take place saturday . " it 's mainly campaign rhetoric , " said ilir dugolli , a senior researcher at the pristina-based kosovar institute for policy research and development -lrb- kipred -rrb- , of the calls for independence .
" but there 's anxiety as well . " judging from the broad public support for independence , politicians are wise to reiterate their demand for it , he said .

nato said there is no evidence of abuse . amnesty international said no safeguards exist to ensure that detainees turned over to afghan authorities are safe from abuse .
amnesty urged the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- to stop prisoner transfers immediately .
the report named afghanistan 's national directorate of security -lrb- nds -rrb- as a major offender , saying prisoners were exposed to whipping , beatings , food deprivation and exposure to extreme cold .
the agency " currently poses a serious threat to those in its custody , " the amnesty report said .
isaf has 40,000 troops in afghanistan from 37 countries .
britain , canada , denmark , the netherlands and norway have signed agreements on prisoner transfers , according to amnesty .
germany , belgium , france and sweden are considering similar measures .
agreements not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf has 40,000 troops in afghanistan the report , which was released tuesday , nov .
13 , detailed allegations of afghan torture of several detainees handed over by canadian troops to the nds .
the agreements do not exempt countries from their obligations towards prisoners , claudio cordone , amnesty 's senior research director , told reuters .
" these agreements are supposed to ensure that detainees are treated in accordance with international standards but have proved to be inadequate , " he said . " such transfers should be suspended until effective safeguards are in place . "
the german government was also criticized for not providing any information on prisoners it hands over to the afghans .
the ministry of defense refuses to release the exact number or whereabouts of prisoners , said barbara lochbihler , who heads amnesty international in germany .
this makes it impossible to monitor treatment .
amnesty said the agreements isaf countries have with afghanistan do not prevent detainees from being put in situations where they could face " torture or other ill-treatment . "
safeguards lacking for prisoner transfers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty wants more training for afghan prison staff isaf is providing support for president hamid karzai 's weak central government .
but a taliban-led insurgency continues .
amnesty called on isaf to declare an immediate " moratorium on any further transfers of detainees to the afghan authorities and -lsb- to -rsb- take responsibility for the custody of such detainees until effective safeguards against torture and other ill-treatment are introduced in the afghan detention system . "
agreements alone would not guarantee prisoners ' proper treatment by afghan authorities , amnesty said , adding that isaf also needed to help train afghan prison staff and reform the detention system .
all prisons should allow independent monitors to check on the conditions , and the nds also needed reform , the group said .
nato rebuffs criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is part of the nato peacekeeping force nato spokesman james appathurai said the military alliance has no evidence of prisoner abuse and no plans to build jails .
" nato has no proof of ill treatment or of torture of detainees that its forces have transferred to the afghans , " he said .
" it 's true there are concerns .
this is precisely why the allies have invested , and a lot , in the reform of the afghan institutions , including the nds .
it 's the only appropriate and acceptable way to improve the situation . "
afghanistan is a sovereign country , he said .

nato said there is no evidence of abuse . amnesty international said no safeguards exist to ensure that detainees turned over to afghan authorities are safe from abuse .
amnesty urged the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- to stop prisoner transfers immediately .
the report named afghanistan 's national directorate of security -lrb- nds -rrb- as a major offender , saying prisoners were exposed to whipping , beatings , food deprivation and exposure to extreme cold .
the agency " currently poses a serious threat to those in its custody , " the amnesty report said .
isaf has 40,000 troops in afghanistan from 37 countries .
britain , canada , denmark , the netherlands and norway have signed agreements on prisoner transfers , according to amnesty .
germany , belgium , france and sweden are considering similar measures .

the agreements do not exempt countries from their obligations towards prisoners , claudio cordone , amnesty 's senior research director , told reuters .
" these agreements are supposed to ensure that detainees are treated in accordance with international standards but have proved to be inadequate , " he said . " such transfers should be suspended until effective safeguards are in place . "
the german government was also criticized for not providing any information on prisoners it hands over to the afghans .
the ministry of defense refuses to release the exact number or whereabouts of prisoners , said barbara lochbihler , who heads amnesty international in germany .
this makes it impossible to monitor treatment .
amnesty said the agreements isaf countries have with afghanistan do not prevent detainees from being put in situations where they could face " torture or other ill-treatment . "
safeguards lacking for prisoner transfers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty wants more training for afghan prison staff isaf is providing support for president hamid karzai 's weak central government .

amnesty called on isaf to declare an immediate " moratorium on any further transfers of detainees to the afghan authorities and -lsb- to -rsb- take responsibility for the custody of such detainees until effective safeguards against torture and other ill-treatment are introduced in the afghan detention system . "
agreements alone would not guarantee prisoners ' proper treatment by afghan authorities , amnesty said , adding that isaf also needed to help train afghan prison staff and reform the detention system .
all prisons should allow independent monitors to check on the conditions , and the nds also needed reform , the group said .
nato rebuffs criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is part of the nato peacekeeping force nato spokesman james appathurai said the military alliance has no evidence of prisoner abuse and no plans to build jails .

but not all the member states like the idea . the proposals would allow national regulators to split the network and retail divisions of providers deemed to have too much influence .
they also foresee giving brussels the ability to overturn national regulators ' decisions and would create an eu telecommunications watchdog organization . " from today onwards , a single market without borders for europe 's telecoms operators and consumers is not only a dream , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in a statement introducing the proposals on tuesday , nov .
13 . advocates said the changes are also needed to increase investment in sectors like broadband internet access and diversify the market , a step eu telecoms commissioner viviane reding said the regulations would make . revolutionary plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new plans would help people communicate better , reding said " the changes the commission is presenting today in the telecoms rules is bound to revolutionize the european telecoms sector , " she told reporters .
" -lsb- the reform -rsb- will increase competition , leading to more innovation and investments , and it will help european citizens to get the most out of modern communication systems . " reding also said the shake-up would " revolutionize europe 's telecom 's sector and help it compete better with other continents in terms of globalization . " industry analysts said the measures are aimed primarily at curbing the influence of giant former-monopoly companies like germany 's deutsche telekom , which sharply criticized the plan . " the proposals of the commission will hinder investments of billions , " deutsche telekom said in a statement . long way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plans do n't sit well with big companies like telekom the new rules , which could take effect by the end of 2009 , have to be approved by the governments and parliaments of eu member states .
analysts said it 's highly unlikely that countries like germany , france and spain will let the plans go through in their current form . " reticence is warranted , " the german economy ministry said in a terse statement . critics , many of whom work for companies such as deutsche telekom , say the proposal would decrease investment in emerging technologies by increasing uncertainty on the market .
there is also resistance to the idea of giving even more power to brussels . " instead of helping get rid of the current competition problems , the new proposals needlessly risk hurting competition and will inevitably lead to more bureaucracy , decreased efficiency and loss of power for national regulators , as well as the elimination of jobs , " jürgen grützner , head of the german association of telecommunications and service providers , told the ap news agency . but representatives of new companies that compete with former monopolies welcomed the measures , saying that they would bolster competition and increase investment . " it 's very good news for competition and for investments in high speed broadband , " ilsa godlovitch of the european competitive telecommunications association ecta , which represents smaller telecommunication companies , told reuters . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not all the member states like the idea . the proposals would allow national regulators to split the network and retail divisions of providers deemed to have too much influence .
they also foresee giving brussels the ability to overturn national regulators ' decisions and would create an eu telecommunications watchdog organization . " from today onwards , a single market without borders for europe 's telecoms operators and consumers is not only a dream , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in a statement introducing the proposals on tuesday , nov .
13 . advocates said the changes are also needed to increase investment in sectors like broadband internet access and diversify the market , a step eu telecoms commissioner viviane reding said the regulations would make . revolutionary plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new plans would help people communicate better , reding said " the changes the commission is presenting today in the telecoms rules is bound to revolutionize the european telecoms sector , " she told reporters .
" -lsb- the reform -rsb- will increase competition , leading to more innovation and investments , and it will help european citizens to get the most out of modern communication systems . " reding also said the shake-up would " revolutionize europe 's telecom 's sector and help it compete better with other continents in terms of globalization . " industry analysts said the measures are aimed primarily at curbing the influence of giant former-monopoly companies like germany 's deutsche telekom , which sharply criticized the plan . " the proposals of the commission will hinder investments of billions , " deutsche telekom said in a statement . long way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plans do n't sit well with big companies like telekom the new rules , which could take effect by the end of 2009 , have to be approved by the governments and parliaments of eu member states .
analysts said it 's highly unlikely that countries like germany , france and spain will let the plans go through in their current form . " reticence is warranted , " the german economy ministry said in a terse statement . critics , many of whom work for companies such as deutsche telekom , say the proposal would decrease investment in emerging technologies by increasing uncertainty on the market .
there is also resistance to the idea of giving even more power to brussels . " instead of helping get rid of the current competition problems , the new proposals needlessly risk hurting competition and will inevitably lead to more bureaucracy , decreased efficiency and loss of power for national regulators , as well as the elimination of jobs , " jürgen grützner , head of the german association of telecommunications and service providers , told the ap news agency . but representatives of new companies that compete with former monopolies welcomed the measures , saying that they would bolster competition and increase investment .

demands for independence are heating up , even as the international community is divided on whether it 's good for the region . time is running out for an agreement on kosovo .
the troika of the european union , the united states and russia overseeing current talks on kosovo has made no progress and is up against a dec .
10 deadline set by the united nations to issue its final report .
the us has continued to advocate independence while russia opposes it and europe remains divided on the issue . the eu has promised that the troika will take a " more proactive attitude " in negotiating with serbia and kosovo , a spokeswoman for the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana said monday , nov .
12 .
not only that , but the troika will present concrete proposals next week to bridge the impasse , the spokeswoman said . independent streak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has administered kosovo since 1999 but experts wonder if it will be enough after many rounds of negotiations have failed to find a compromise and both the serbian and kosovar fronts look hardened . " preserving kosovo and the serb republic -lsb- the eastern half of bosnia-herzegovina -rsb- are now the most important goals of our state and national policy , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica told reuters news agency last week . there are some signs that kosovo 's albanian politicians , increasingly calling for independence in recent weeks , are running out of patience after years of negotiations . prime minister agim ceku said kosovo was willing to wait until december before unilaterally declaring independence , but not much longer . " it is better to ask for an apology than for permission , " ceku said in an interview last week with the new york times .
" the time for a decision has come . " veton surroi , a member of the kosovo albanian 's negotiating team and leader of the opposition ora party , also said he 's unwilling to wait on washington much longer . " kosovo 's assembly should set the independence date before christmas , " surroi told the balkan investigative reporting network recently . campaign rhetoric heats up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pristina is a city in limbo some of the recent calls for independence can be attributed to the country 's upcoming elections , which will take place saturday . " it 's mainly campaign rhetoric , " said ilir dugolli , a senior researcher at the pristina-based kosovar institute for policy research and development -lrb- kipred -rrb- , of the calls for independence .
" but there 's anxiety as well . " judging from the broad public support for independence , politicians are wise to reiterate their demand for it , he said .
independence is a plank in all of kosovo 's major political parties ' platforms and is consistently supported by well over 90 percent of the kosovo albanian population , polls have shown . far-reaching consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writing is on the wall ?
this one says " no negotiations - self determination " any compromise short of independence would be a " very bitter pill to swallow " for most politicians , dugolli said , adding that the longer it takes , the more politicians will feel under pressure to give up on the negotiating process . russia has been the main international opponent of allowing the mainly muslim kosovo independence from orthodox serbia .
moscow is afraid it would encourage separatist movements in georgia , chechnya or even the basque region of spain . but a " domino theory " is a little bit too simplistic for such a complex region , said christophe solioz , an expert on kosovo at the center for european integration strategies -lrb- ceis -rrb- . a complex history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a funeral ceremony for 30 kosovo albanians killed during the 1998-99 war that killed thousands kosovo came under un administration in 1999 , a result of the fighting and ethnic cleansing that marked the breakup of yugoslavia .
russia supports serbia 's claim to the region of 2 million , which contains ethnic serbian enclaves .
europe is divided on the issue with several countries , including greece , cyprus , and romania , refusing to recognize kosovo without a un security council agreement . eu diplomats are currently working to get consensus within the bloc on how to react if kosovo were to declare independence , said center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- analyst gergana noutcheva . in the european union , which recently reported on rampant corruption and organized crime in kosovo , the official line remains support for a negotiated settlement .
but some countries are trying to move the bloc towards acknowledging that kosovo independence is the only thing that will bring security and stability to the region , noutcheva said . while kosovo albanian politicians have said they wo n't accept anything less than full independence , " this could also be a bargaining position , " noutcheva said .
" of course they will insist on full independence until the very end .
that is not to say that this is what will happen . " hong kong , germany possible examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demand self-determination , will it come in 2020 ?
while no proposals have officially been announced , insiders say several compromises are under discussion .
one possible scenario - a variation of which was proposed by serbia - uses hong kong as a model .
kosovo would be under serbian rule , but would have extensive self-government rights .
in 2020 , kosovo would then be allowed to vote in a referendum on whether to gain full independence . another idea the troika has discussed , according to diplomats , is a variation of the agreement reached between the two germanys in 1972 , known as the grundlagenvertrag , or basic treaty .
in this treaty , west germany recognized the existence of the german democratic republic in everything but law . eu envoy wolfgang ischinger " is looking for models on which to draw inspiration , " one diplomat told the afp news agency , on condition of anonymity .
" he has found a certain inspiration in this very particular case of the two germanys . " whatever the inspiration , solioz of ceis said a compromise is essential in kosovo .
he said kosovo should be given special status as an eu region with a referendum date set for 2020 . " sooner or later you ca n't play any games anymore , " solioz said .

demands for independence are heating up , even as the international community is divided on whether it 's good for the region . time is running out for an agreement on kosovo .
the troika of the european union , the united states and russia overseeing current talks on kosovo has made no progress and is up against a dec .
10 deadline set by the united nations to issue its final report .
the us has continued to advocate independence while russia opposes it and europe remains divided on the issue . the eu has promised that the troika will take a " more proactive attitude " in negotiating with serbia and kosovo , a spokeswoman for the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana said monday , nov .
12 .
not only that , but the troika will present concrete proposals next week to bridge the impasse , the spokeswoman said . independent streak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has administered kosovo since 1999 but experts wonder if it will be enough after many rounds of negotiations have failed to find a compromise and both the serbian and kosovar fronts look hardened . " preserving kosovo and the serb republic -lsb- the eastern half of bosnia-herzegovina -rsb- are now the most important goals of our state and national policy , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica told reuters news agency last week . there are some signs that kosovo 's albanian politicians , increasingly calling for independence in recent weeks , are running out of patience after years of negotiations . prime minister agim ceku said kosovo was willing to wait until december before unilaterally declaring independence , but not much longer . " it is better to ask for an apology than for permission , " ceku said in an interview last week with the new york times .
" the time for a decision has come . " veton surroi , a member of the kosovo albanian 's negotiating team and leader of the opposition ora party , also said he 's unwilling to wait on washington much longer . " kosovo 's assembly should set the independence date before christmas , " surroi told the balkan investigative reporting network recently . campaign rhetoric heats up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pristina is a city in limbo some of the recent calls for independence can be attributed to the country 's upcoming elections , which will take place saturday . " it 's mainly campaign rhetoric , " said ilir dugolli , a senior researcher at the pristina-based kosovar institute for policy research and development -lrb- kipred -rrb- , of the calls for independence .
" but there 's anxiety as well . " judging from the broad public support for independence , politicians are wise to reiterate their demand for it , he said .
independence is a plank in all of kosovo 's major political parties ' platforms and is consistently supported by well over 90 percent of the kosovo albanian population , polls have shown . far-reaching consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writing is on the wall ?
this one says " no negotiations - self determination " any compromise short of independence would be a " very bitter pill to swallow " for most politicians , dugolli said , adding that the longer it takes , the more politicians will feel under pressure to give up on the negotiating process . russia has been the main international opponent of allowing the mainly muslim kosovo independence from orthodox serbia .
moscow is afraid it would encourage separatist movements in georgia , chechnya or even the basque region of spain . but a " domino theory " is a little bit too simplistic for such a complex region , said christophe solioz , an expert on kosovo at the center for european integration strategies -lrb- ceis -rrb- . a complex history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a funeral ceremony for 30 kosovo albanians killed during the 1998-99 war that killed thousands kosovo came under un administration in 1999 , a result of the fighting and ethnic cleansing that marked the breakup of yugoslavia .
russia supports serbia 's claim to the region of 2 million , which contains ethnic serbian enclaves .
europe is divided on the issue with several countries , including greece , cyprus , and romania , refusing to recognize kosovo without a un security council agreement . eu diplomats are currently working to get consensus within the bloc on how to react if kosovo were to declare independence , said center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- analyst gergana noutcheva . in the european union , which recently reported on rampant corruption and organized crime in kosovo , the official line remains support for a negotiated settlement .
but some countries are trying to move the bloc towards acknowledging that kosovo independence is the only thing that will bring security and stability to the region , noutcheva said . while kosovo albanian politicians have said they wo n't accept anything less than full independence , " this could also be a bargaining position , " noutcheva said .
" of course they will insist on full independence until the very end .
that is not to say that this is what will happen . " hong kong , germany possible examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demand self-determination , will it come in 2020 ?
while no proposals have officially been announced , insiders say several compromises are under discussion .
one possible scenario - a variation of which was proposed by serbia - uses hong kong as a model .
kosovo would be under serbian rule , but would have extensive self-government rights .
in 2020 , kosovo would then be allowed to vote in a referendum on whether to gain full independence . another idea the troika has discussed , according to diplomats , is a variation of the agreement reached between the two germanys in 1972 , known as the grundlagenvertrag , or basic treaty .
in this treaty , west germany recognized the existence of the german democratic republic in everything but law . eu envoy wolfgang ischinger " is looking for models on which to draw inspiration , " one diplomat told the afp news agency , on condition of anonymity .
" he has found a certain inspiration in this very particular case of the two germanys . " whatever the inspiration , solioz of ceis said a compromise is essential in kosovo .
he said kosovo should be given special status as an eu region with a referendum date set for 2020 . " sooner or later you ca n't play any games anymore , " solioz said .

nato said there is no evidence of abuse . amnesty international said no safeguards exist to ensure that detainees turned over to afghan authorities are safe from abuse .
amnesty urged the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- to stop prisoner transfers immediately .

the agency " currently poses a serious threat to those in its custody , " the amnesty report said .
isaf has 40,000 troops in afghanistan from 37 countries .

nato said there is no evidence of abuse . amnesty international said no safeguards exist to ensure that detainees turned over to afghan authorities are safe from abuse .
amnesty urged the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- to stop prisoner transfers immediately .
the report named afghanistan 's national directorate of security -lrb- nds -rrb- as a major offender , saying prisoners were exposed to whipping , beatings , food deprivation and exposure to extreme cold .
the agency " currently poses a serious threat to those in its custody , " the amnesty report said .
isaf has 40,000 troops in afghanistan from 37 countries .
britain , canada , denmark , the netherlands and norway have signed agreements on prisoner transfers , according to amnesty .
germany , belgium , france and sweden are considering similar measures .
agreements not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf has 40,000 troops in afghanistan the report , which was released tuesday , nov .
13 , detailed allegations of afghan torture of several detainees handed over by canadian troops to the nds .
the agreements do not exempt countries from their obligations towards prisoners , claudio cordone , amnesty 's senior research director , told reuters .
" these agreements are supposed to ensure that detainees are treated in accordance with international standards but have proved to be inadequate , " he said . " such transfers should be suspended until effective safeguards are in place . "
the german government was also criticized for not providing any information on prisoners it hands over to the afghans .
the ministry of defense refuses to release the exact number or whereabouts of prisoners , said barbara lochbihler , who heads amnesty international in germany .
this makes it impossible to monitor treatment .
amnesty said the agreements isaf countries have with afghanistan do not prevent detainees from being put in situations where they could face " torture or other ill-treatment . "
safeguards lacking for prisoner transfers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty wants more training for afghan prison staff isaf is providing support for president hamid karzai 's weak central government .
but a taliban-led insurgency continues .
amnesty called on isaf to declare an immediate " moratorium on any further transfers of detainees to the afghan authorities and -lsb- to -rsb- take responsibility for the custody of such detainees until effective safeguards against torture and other ill-treatment are introduced in the afghan detention system . "
agreements alone would not guarantee prisoners ' proper treatment by afghan authorities , amnesty said , adding that isaf also needed to help train afghan prison staff and reform the detention system .
all prisons should allow independent monitors to check on the conditions , and the nds also needed reform , the group said .
nato rebuffs criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is part of the nato peacekeeping force nato spokesman james appathurai said the military alliance has no evidence of prisoner abuse and no plans to build jails .
" nato has no proof of ill treatment or of torture of detainees that its forces have transferred to the afghans , " he said .
" it 's true there are concerns .
this is precisely why the allies have invested , and a lot , in the reform of the afghan institutions , including the nds .
it 's the only appropriate and acceptable way to improve the situation . "
afghanistan is a sovereign country , he said .
" it 's not up to nato to put a parallel detention system in place on afghan territory , " appathurai said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i 'm glad , " schweisfurth told munich 's abendzeitung newspaper . basic customers had put on the heat with their pocketbooks - buying less to show their displeasure over the possible buy-out and the aggressive business policies pursued by schwarz , which owns the hugely successful discount grocery chain lidl . though basic had been seeking outside capital in order to expand , it bowed to customers and blocked the further sale of its shares to schwarz . " the customers have won , " schweisfurth said this week .
" this is the first time in history that they have voted with their shopping lists on how organic farming should work . " take-over would have had negative effect in a press release on friday , nov .
9 , basic had said , " we underestimated the psychological effect that a buy-out of our stores would have . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bionade is another organic product that has boomed recently the schwarz group had begun buying into basic in february , raising its stake to 23 percent , at which point it began putting forward proposals for a buy-out . basic management and customers became incensed and some suppliers refused to continue business with the chain . the berliner zeitung newspaper commented that the turn-about showed the power of consumer pressure . " the idea that a company worth billions , which is known for its poor working conditions and tough buying policies , should bully its way into the organic sector did not suit them , " the paper noted . not only does the organic label stand for healthy food , but also for ethical practices and the careful use of resources , the berliner zeitung added .
pullout requires slower expansion basic has now said it would slow its plans for rapid expansion .
rather than the 25 to 50 stores it had intended to open annually after the schwarz take-over , it will now open only five to 10 per year . the company said it hoped the move reinforced the trust customers and suppliers originally had in basic . basic is the second largest german organic foods supermarket chain after alnatura , and had a turnover of 73 million euros in 2006 , as reported by ap news agency . the market in germany for organically grown food grew by 18 percent last year , with the rapid increase forcing retailers to seek suppliers abroad , according to the dpa news agency . at the same time , the amount of organic-farmed area rose by only 2.3 percent , or around 4.9 percent of the total area cultivated in germany , creating tight market conditions . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his party and the national government announced his successors on tuesday , nov .
13 . müntefering told a press conference in berlin that his decision to resign was personal . " one does n't like to discuss these issues , but my wife has been gravely ill for some time , " müntefering said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering said he could n't fulfill his duties to both the government and his wife müntefering 's wife , ankepetra , has been sick with cancer for a number of years .
müntefering said she had undergone five operations since 2001 and that it was becoming untenable to hold his political positions and support his wife at the same time . the deputy chancellor emphatically ruled out a political motive for his decision to step down .
he said his resignation would come into effect as of the nov .
21 . " bridge builder " müntefering has played a key role in holding together the so-called left-right " grand coalition " government , but it has also been an awkward role .
müntefering has been described as chancellor angela merkel 's right-hand man , despite the fact that merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is the main political rival of müntefering 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering played an important role in reaching compromises with merkel 's cdu michael dauderstedt , from the frederick ebert foundation , a spd-aligned think tank , said the resignation was a blow to germany 's grand coalition government . " müntefering was more to the center than other larger parts of the spd and probably some parts of the cdu left wing , " dauderstedt said .
" he was very well positioned to function as a kind of bridge or consensus builder . " for this reason , müntefering is likely to be missed by both political allies and rivals alike .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said his party respected the vice chancellor 's decision to step down , and called müntefering an " important support " in the " successful work of the coalition . " coalition on the rocks ? peter ramsauer of merkel 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , said he did n't see the resignation of müntefering as posing any danger to the survival of the grand coalition . " this does n't mean that things will now go downhill , " ramsauer said tuesday in berlin .
" there are other people who will step up to fill müntefering 's role . " two candidates have already been chosen to replace müntefering in his key roles .
spd chief kurt beck said tuesday that parliamentary group leader olaf scholz would take the post of labor minister , while foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier would assume the position of deputy chancellor . friction in the spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck knew of müntefering 's decision before it was made public müntefering 's departure follows a public power struggle with beck over the future direction of the spd . müntefering was forced to accede to party demands last month and back proposals to unwind key aspects of former chancellor gerhard schröder 's labor market reforms .

" i 'm glad , " schweisfurth told munich 's abendzeitung newspaper . basic customers had put on the heat with their pocketbooks - buying less to show their displeasure over the possible buy-out and the aggressive business policies pursued by schwarz , which owns the hugely successful discount grocery chain lidl . though basic had been seeking outside capital in order to expand , it bowed to customers and blocked the further sale of its shares to schwarz . " the customers have won , " schweisfurth said this week .
" this is the first time in history that they have voted with their shopping lists on how organic farming should work . " take-over would have had negative effect in a press release on friday , nov .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bionade is another organic product that has boomed recently the schwarz group had begun buying into basic in february , raising its stake to 23 percent , at which point it began putting forward proposals for a buy-out . basic management and customers became incensed and some suppliers refused to continue business with the chain . the berliner zeitung newspaper commented that the turn-about showed the power of consumer pressure . " the idea that a company worth billions , which is known for its poor working conditions and tough buying policies , should bully its way into the organic sector did not suit them , " the paper noted . not only does the organic label stand for healthy food , but also for ethical practices and the careful use of resources , the berliner zeitung added .
pullout requires slower expansion basic has now said it would slow its plans for rapid expansion .
rather than the 25 to 50 stores it had intended to open annually after the schwarz take-over , it will now open only five to 10 per year . the company said it hoped the move reinforced the trust customers and suppliers originally had in basic . basic is the second largest german organic foods supermarket chain after alnatura , and had a turnover of 73 million euros in 2006 , as reported by ap news agency . the market in germany for organically grown food grew by 18 percent last year , with the rapid increase forcing retailers to seek suppliers abroad , according to the dpa news agency . at the same time , the amount of organic-farmed area rose by only 2.3 percent , or around 4.9 percent of the total area cultivated in germany , creating tight market conditions . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

demands for independence are heating up , even as the international community is divided on whether it 's good for the region . time is running out for an agreement on kosovo .
the troika of the european union , the united states and russia overseeing current talks on kosovo has made no progress and is up against a dec .

the us has continued to advocate independence while russia opposes it and europe remains divided on the issue . the eu has promised that the troika will take a " more proactive attitude " in negotiating with serbia and kosovo , a spokeswoman for the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana said monday , nov .

not only that , but the troika will present concrete proposals next week to bridge the impasse , the spokeswoman said . independent streak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has administered kosovo since 1999 but experts wonder if it will be enough after many rounds of negotiations have failed to find a compromise and both the serbian and kosovar fronts look hardened . " preserving kosovo and the serb republic -lsb- the eastern half of bosnia-herzegovina -rsb- are now the most important goals of our state and national policy , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica told reuters news agency last week . there are some signs that kosovo 's albanian politicians , increasingly calling for independence in recent weeks , are running out of patience after years of negotiations . prime minister agim ceku said kosovo was willing to wait until december before unilaterally declaring independence , but not much longer . " it is better to ask for an apology than for permission , " ceku said in an interview last week with the new york times .
" the time for a decision has come . " veton surroi , a member of the kosovo albanian 's negotiating team and leader of the opposition ora party , also said he 's unwilling to wait on washington much longer .

" it 's mainly campaign rhetoric , " said ilir dugolli , a senior researcher at the pristina-based kosovar institute for policy research and development -lrb- kipred -rrb- , of the calls for independence .
" but there 's anxiety as well . " judging from the broad public support for independence , politicians are wise to reiterate their demand for it , he said .
independence is a plank in all of kosovo 's major political parties ' platforms and is consistently supported by well over 90 percent of the kosovo albanian population , polls have shown . far-reaching consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writing is on the wall ?
this one says " no negotiations - self determination " any compromise short of independence would be a " very bitter pill to swallow " for most politicians , dugolli said , adding that the longer it takes , the more politicians will feel under pressure to give up on the negotiating process . russia has been the main international opponent of allowing the mainly muslim kosovo independence from orthodox serbia .
moscow is afraid it would encourage separatist movements in georgia , chechnya or even the basque region of spain . but a " domino theory " is a little bit too simplistic for such a complex region , said christophe solioz , an expert on kosovo at the center for european integration strategies -lrb- ceis -rrb- . a complex history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a funeral ceremony for 30 kosovo albanians killed during the 1998-99 war that killed thousands kosovo came under un administration in 1999 , a result of the fighting and ethnic cleansing that marked the breakup of yugoslavia .
russia supports serbia 's claim to the region of 2 million , which contains ethnic serbian enclaves .
europe is divided on the issue with several countries , including greece , cyprus , and romania , refusing to recognize kosovo without a un security council agreement . eu diplomats are currently working to get consensus within the bloc on how to react if kosovo were to declare independence , said center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- analyst gergana noutcheva . in the european union , which recently reported on rampant corruption and organized crime in kosovo , the official line remains support for a negotiated settlement .
but some countries are trying to move the bloc towards acknowledging that kosovo independence is the only thing that will bring security and stability to the region , noutcheva said . while kosovo albanian politicians have said they wo n't accept anything less than full independence , " this could also be a bargaining position , " noutcheva said .
" of course they will insist on full independence until the very end .
that is not to say that this is what will happen . " hong kong , germany possible examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demand self-determination , will it come in 2020 ?
while no proposals have officially been announced , insiders say several compromises are under discussion .
one possible scenario - a variation of which was proposed by serbia - uses hong kong as a model .
kosovo would be under serbian rule , but would have extensive self-government rights .
in 2020 , kosovo would then be allowed to vote in a referendum on whether to gain full independence . another idea the troika has discussed , according to diplomats , is a variation of the agreement reached between the two germanys in 1972 , known as the grundlagenvertrag , or basic treaty .
in this treaty , west germany recognized the existence of the german democratic republic in everything but law . eu envoy wolfgang ischinger " is looking for models on which to draw inspiration , " one diplomat told the afp news agency , on condition of anonymity .
" he has found a certain inspiration in this very particular case of the two germanys . " whatever the inspiration , solioz of ceis said a compromise is essential in kosovo .
he said kosovo should be given special status as an eu region with a referendum date set for 2020 . " sooner or later you ca n't play any games anymore , " solioz said .

" i 'm glad , " schweisfurth told munich 's abendzeitung newspaper . basic customers had put on the heat with their pocketbooks - buying less to show their displeasure over the possible buy-out and the aggressive business policies pursued by schwarz , which owns the hugely successful discount grocery chain lidl . though basic had been seeking outside capital in order to expand , it bowed to customers and blocked the further sale of its shares to schwarz . " the customers have won , " schweisfurth said this week .
" this is the first time in history that they have voted with their shopping lists on how organic farming should work . " take-over would have had negative effect in a press release on friday , nov .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bionade is another organic product that has boomed recently the schwarz group had begun buying into basic in february , raising its stake to 23 percent , at which point it began putting forward proposals for a buy-out . basic management and customers became incensed and some suppliers refused to continue business with the chain . the berliner zeitung newspaper commented that the turn-about showed the power of consumer pressure . " the idea that a company worth billions , which is known for its poor working conditions and tough buying policies , should bully its way into the organic sector did not suit them , " the paper noted . not only does the organic label stand for healthy food , but also for ethical practices and the careful use of resources , the berliner zeitung added .
pullout requires slower expansion basic has now said it would slow its plans for rapid expansion .
rather than the 25 to 50 stores it had intended to open annually after the schwarz take-over , it will now open only five to 10 per year . the company said it hoped the move reinforced the trust customers and suppliers originally had in basic . basic is the second largest german organic foods supermarket chain after alnatura , and had a turnover of 73 million euros in 2006 , as reported by ap news agency . the market in germany for organically grown food grew by 18 percent last year , with the rapid increase forcing retailers to seek suppliers abroad , according to the dpa news agency . at the same time , the amount of organic-farmed area rose by only 2.3 percent , or around 4.9 percent of the total area cultivated in germany , creating tight market conditions . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato said there is no evidence of abuse . amnesty international said no safeguards exist to ensure that detainees turned over to afghan authorities are safe from abuse .
amnesty urged the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- to stop prisoner transfers immediately .

agreements not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf has 40,000 troops in afghanistan the report , which was released tuesday , nov .
13 , detailed allegations of afghan torture of several detainees handed over by canadian troops to the nds .
the agreements do not exempt countries from their obligations towards prisoners , claudio cordone , amnesty 's senior research director , told reuters .
" these agreements are supposed to ensure that detainees are treated in accordance with international standards but have proved to be inadequate , " he said . " such transfers should be suspended until effective safeguards are in place . "
the german government was also criticized for not providing any information on prisoners it hands over to the afghans .
the ministry of defense refuses to release the exact number or whereabouts of prisoners , said barbara lochbihler , who heads amnesty international in germany .
this makes it impossible to monitor treatment .
amnesty said the agreements isaf countries have with afghanistan do not prevent detainees from being put in situations where they could face " torture or other ill-treatment . "
safeguards lacking for prisoner transfers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty wants more training for afghan prison staff isaf is providing support for president hamid karzai 's weak central government .
but a taliban-led insurgency continues .
amnesty called on isaf to declare an immediate " moratorium on any further transfers of detainees to the afghan authorities and -lsb- to -rsb- take responsibility for the custody of such detainees until effective safeguards against torture and other ill-treatment are introduced in the afghan detention system . "
agreements alone would not guarantee prisoners ' proper treatment by afghan authorities , amnesty said , adding that isaf also needed to help train afghan prison staff and reform the detention system .
all prisons should allow independent monitors to check on the conditions , and the nds also needed reform , the group said .
nato rebuffs criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is part of the nato peacekeeping force nato spokesman james appathurai said the military alliance has no evidence of prisoner abuse and no plans to build jails .
" nato has no proof of ill treatment or of torture of detainees that its forces have transferred to the afghans , " he said .

" i 'm glad , " schweisfurth told munich 's abendzeitung newspaper . basic customers had put on the heat with their pocketbooks - buying less to show their displeasure over the possible buy-out and the aggressive business policies pursued by schwarz , which owns the hugely successful discount grocery chain lidl . though basic had been seeking outside capital in order to expand , it bowed to customers and blocked the further sale of its shares to schwarz . " the customers have won , " schweisfurth said this week .
" this is the first time in history that they have voted with their shopping lists on how organic farming should work . " take-over would have had negative effect in a press release on friday , nov .
9 , basic had said , " we underestimated the psychological effect that a buy-out of our stores would have . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bionade is another organic product that has boomed recently the schwarz group had begun buying into basic in february , raising its stake to 23 percent , at which point it began putting forward proposals for a buy-out . basic management and customers became incensed and some suppliers refused to continue business with the chain . the berliner zeitung newspaper commented that the turn-about showed the power of consumer pressure . " the idea that a company worth billions , which is known for its poor working conditions and tough buying policies , should bully its way into the organic sector did not suit them , " the paper noted . not only does the organic label stand for healthy food , but also for ethical practices and the careful use of resources , the berliner zeitung added .
pullout requires slower expansion basic has now said it would slow its plans for rapid expansion .
rather than the 25 to 50 stores it had intended to open annually after the schwarz take-over , it will now open only five to 10 per year . the company said it hoped the move reinforced the trust customers and suppliers originally had in basic . basic is the second largest german organic foods supermarket chain after alnatura , and had a turnover of 73 million euros in 2006 , as reported by ap news agency . the market in germany for organically grown food grew by 18 percent last year , with the rapid increase forcing retailers to seek suppliers abroad , according to the dpa news agency . at the same time , the amount of organic-farmed area rose by only 2.3 percent , or around 4.9 percent of the total area cultivated in germany , creating tight market conditions . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pullout requires slower expansion basic has now said it would slow its plans for rapid expansion .
rather than the 25 to 50 stores it had intended to open annually after the schwarz take-over , it will now open only five to 10 per year . the company said it hoped the move reinforced the trust customers and suppliers originally had in basic . basic is the second largest german organic foods supermarket chain after alnatura , and had a turnover of 73 million euros in 2006 , as reported by ap news agency . the market in germany for organically grown food grew by 18 percent last year , with the rapid increase forcing retailers to seek suppliers abroad , according to the dpa news agency . at the same time , the amount of organic-farmed area rose by only 2.3 percent , or around 4.9 percent of the total area cultivated in germany , creating tight market conditions . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us has continued to advocate independence while russia opposes it and europe remains divided on the issue . the eu has promised that the troika will take a " more proactive attitude " in negotiating with serbia and kosovo , a spokeswoman for the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana said monday , nov .
12 .
not only that , but the troika will present concrete proposals next week to bridge the impasse , the spokeswoman said . independent streak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has administered kosovo since 1999 but experts wonder if it will be enough after many rounds of negotiations have failed to find a compromise and both the serbian and kosovar fronts look hardened . " preserving kosovo and the serb republic -lsb- the eastern half of bosnia-herzegovina -rsb- are now the most important goals of our state and national policy , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica told reuters news agency last week . there are some signs that kosovo 's albanian politicians , increasingly calling for independence in recent weeks , are running out of patience after years of negotiations . prime minister agim ceku said kosovo was willing to wait until december before unilaterally declaring independence , but not much longer . " it is better to ask for an apology than for permission , " ceku said in an interview last week with the new york times .
" the time for a decision has come . " veton surroi , a member of the kosovo albanian 's negotiating team and leader of the opposition ora party , also said he 's unwilling to wait on washington much longer . " kosovo 's assembly should set the independence date before christmas , " surroi told the balkan investigative reporting network recently . campaign rhetoric heats up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pristina is a city in limbo some of the recent calls for independence can be attributed to the country 's upcoming elections , which will take place saturday . " it 's mainly campaign rhetoric , " said ilir dugolli , a senior researcher at the pristina-based kosovar institute for policy research and development -lrb- kipred -rrb- , of the calls for independence .
" but there 's anxiety as well . " judging from the broad public support for independence , politicians are wise to reiterate their demand for it , he said .
independence is a plank in all of kosovo 's major political parties ' platforms and is consistently supported by well over 90 percent of the kosovo albanian population , polls have shown . far-reaching consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writing is on the wall ?
this one says " no negotiations - self determination " any compromise short of independence would be a " very bitter pill to swallow " for most politicians , dugolli said , adding that the longer it takes , the more politicians will feel under pressure to give up on the negotiating process . russia has been the main international opponent of allowing the mainly muslim kosovo independence from orthodox serbia .
moscow is afraid it would encourage separatist movements in georgia , chechnya or even the basque region of spain . but a " domino theory " is a little bit too simplistic for such a complex region , said christophe solioz , an expert on kosovo at the center for european integration strategies -lrb- ceis -rrb- . a complex history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a funeral ceremony for 30 kosovo albanians killed during the 1998-99 war that killed thousands kosovo came under un administration in 1999 , a result of the fighting and ethnic cleansing that marked the breakup of yugoslavia .
russia supports serbia 's claim to the region of 2 million , which contains ethnic serbian enclaves .
europe is divided on the issue with several countries , including greece , cyprus , and romania , refusing to recognize kosovo without a un security council agreement . eu diplomats are currently working to get consensus within the bloc on how to react if kosovo were to declare independence , said center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- analyst gergana noutcheva . in the european union , which recently reported on rampant corruption and organized crime in kosovo , the official line remains support for a negotiated settlement .
but some countries are trying to move the bloc towards acknowledging that kosovo independence is the only thing that will bring security and stability to the region , noutcheva said . while kosovo albanian politicians have said they wo n't accept anything less than full independence , " this could also be a bargaining position , " noutcheva said .
" of course they will insist on full independence until the very end .
that is not to say that this is what will happen . " hong kong , germany possible examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demand self-determination , will it come in 2020 ?
while no proposals have officially been announced , insiders say several compromises are under discussion .
one possible scenario - a variation of which was proposed by serbia - uses hong kong as a model .
kosovo would be under serbian rule , but would have extensive self-government rights .
in 2020 , kosovo would then be allowed to vote in a referendum on whether to gain full independence . another idea the troika has discussed , according to diplomats , is a variation of the agreement reached between the two germanys in 1972 , known as the grundlagenvertrag , or basic treaty .
in this treaty , west germany recognized the existence of the german democratic republic in everything but law . eu envoy wolfgang ischinger " is looking for models on which to draw inspiration , " one diplomat told the afp news agency , on condition of anonymity .
" he has found a certain inspiration in this very particular case of the two germanys . " whatever the inspiration , solioz of ceis said a compromise is essential in kosovo .
he said kosovo should be given special status as an eu region with a referendum date set for 2020 . " sooner or later you ca n't play any games anymore , " solioz said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 13.11.2007 lehmann willing to drop down a division for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann 's benching has created an issue for germany jens lehmann has told a german soccer magazine that he would transfer to a second-division club in a bid to retain his status as germany 's starting keeper .
but would that secure his position for euro 2008 ? jens lehmann may be top dog for germany at the moment , but he 's barely even second fiddle for english club arsenal .
he has n't played a match for the gunners since early this season , and that 's raised the question of whether germany should stay true to a keeper who 's not on the pitch week in and week out . " i would like to play again as soon as possible , " lehmann told the german soccer magazine kicker on monday , nov .
12 .
" the bundesliga is attractive and always an option - perhaps even in the second division .
in any case , i want to go to euro 2008 .
playing there was always my goal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann may not have too many matches left in an arsenal uniform the 38-year-old lehmann was effectively demoted at arsenal after a bad mistake against blackburn in august cost the gunners points .
at the time , the club claimed he had an elbow injury , but he 's now clearly become second choice to spaniard manuel almunia . with arsenal undefeated , leading the premiership and already through to the knock-out round of the champions league , no one in london is clamoring for lehmann 's return .
gunners ' coach arsene wenger said he still considers the german a valuable part of the team , but the moody keeper probably did n't help his cause in a recent televised outburst in which he accused wenger of " humiliating him . " the stand-off has led many soccer experts in germany to say lehmann needs to change clubs - or germany needs to change starting keepers . uncertainties abound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german number two , timo hildebrand , has also had problems german national coach joachim löw plans to start lehmann in germany 's match this weekend against cyprus .
but he says he also intends to review the situation at year 's end . " we always said we would sit down and discuss the situation during the winter break , " löw told the german sports agency sid .
" he knows it will be difficult to play in the european championship if he has n't played for his club eight months before that . " a new club could solve that dilemma , but it is unclear where lehmann would go .
none of the bundesliga 's first-division clubs have an obvious need for a new goalkeeper , and thus far none of the bigger second-division teams has indicated an interest in taking on lehmann 's salary . it is equally unclear , however , who would take over if lehmann should fail to find a home and lose his starting job for germany .
germany 's number two , timo hildebrand , has hard a hard time establishing himself at valencia and has let in a lot of goals when he has played . meanwhile germany 's current third choice , robert enke , plays for middle-of-the-pack hanover and has never really been tested at the international level . youth solution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's neuer might get a call-up it 's ironic that germany has a question mark between the posts .
the country continues to churn out high-quality goalkeepers , and a number of national sides - most notably england - would leap at the chance to nominate any of the regular net-minders in the bundesliga . in essence , germany is spoilt for choice , and that 's led some commentators to suggest that one of the country 's younger keepers be promoted to the national team . schalke 's manuel neuer has often been mooted .
the 21-year-old was voted the bundesliga 's best keeper last season but has been hit by a couple of high-profile mistakes lately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's adler could also be an option another option would be 22-year-old rene adler of leverkusen .
he 's impressed everyone this season and put on another terrific performance against wolfsburg in his side 's last match . should lehmann fail to find playing time , neuer or adler could find himself in possession of an unexpected ticket to euro 2008 . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 13.11.2007 lehmann willing to drop down a division for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann 's benching has created an issue for germany jens lehmann has told a german soccer magazine that he would transfer to a second-division club in a bid to retain his status as germany 's starting keeper .
but would that secure his position for euro 2008 ? jens lehmann may be top dog for germany at the moment , but he 's barely even second fiddle for english club arsenal .
he has n't played a match for the gunners since early this season , and that 's raised the question of whether germany should stay true to a keeper who 's not on the pitch week in and week out . " i would like to play again as soon as possible , " lehmann told the german soccer magazine kicker on monday , nov .
12 .
" the bundesliga is attractive and always an option - perhaps even in the second division .
in any case , i want to go to euro 2008 .
playing there was always my goal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann may not have too many matches left in an arsenal uniform the 38-year-old lehmann was effectively demoted at arsenal after a bad mistake against blackburn in august cost the gunners points .
at the time , the club claimed he had an elbow injury , but he 's now clearly become second choice to spaniard manuel almunia . with arsenal undefeated , leading the premiership and already through to the knock-out round of the champions league , no one in london is clamoring for lehmann 's return .
gunners ' coach arsene wenger said he still considers the german a valuable part of the team , but the moody keeper probably did n't help his cause in a recent televised outburst in which he accused wenger of " humiliating him . " the stand-off has led many soccer experts in germany to say lehmann needs to change clubs - or germany needs to change starting keepers . uncertainties abound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german number two , timo hildebrand , has also had problems german national coach joachim löw plans to start lehmann in germany 's match this weekend against cyprus .
but he says he also intends to review the situation at year 's end . " we always said we would sit down and discuss the situation during the winter break , " löw told the german sports agency sid .
" he knows it will be difficult to play in the european championship if he has n't played for his club eight months before that . " a new club could solve that dilemma , but it is unclear where lehmann would go .
none of the bundesliga 's first-division clubs have an obvious need for a new goalkeeper , and thus far none of the bigger second-division teams has indicated an interest in taking on lehmann 's salary . it is equally unclear , however , who would take over if lehmann should fail to find a home and lose his starting job for germany .
germany 's number two , timo hildebrand , has hard a hard time establishing himself at valencia and has let in a lot of goals when he has played . meanwhile germany 's current third choice , robert enke , plays for middle-of-the-pack hanover and has never really been tested at the international level . youth solution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's neuer might get a call-up it 's ironic that germany has a question mark between the posts .
the country continues to churn out high-quality goalkeepers , and a number of national sides - most notably england - would leap at the chance to nominate any of the regular net-minders in the bundesliga . in essence , germany is spoilt for choice , and that 's led some commentators to suggest that one of the country 's younger keepers be promoted to the national team . schalke 's manuel neuer has often been mooted .
the 21-year-old was voted the bundesliga 's best keeper last season but has been hit by a couple of high-profile mistakes lately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's adler could also be an option another option would be 22-year-old rene adler of leverkusen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 13.11.2007 lehmann willing to drop down a division for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann 's benching has created an issue for germany jens lehmann has told a german soccer magazine that he would transfer to a second-division club in a bid to retain his status as germany 's starting keeper .
but would that secure his position for euro 2008 ? jens lehmann may be top dog for germany at the moment , but he 's barely even second fiddle for english club arsenal .
he has n't played a match for the gunners since early this season , and that 's raised the question of whether germany should stay true to a keeper who 's not on the pitch week in and week out . " i would like to play again as soon as possible , " lehmann told the german soccer magazine kicker on monday , nov .
12 .
" the bundesliga is attractive and always an option - perhaps even in the second division .
in any case , i want to go to euro 2008 .
playing there was always my goal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann may not have too many matches left in an arsenal uniform the 38-year-old lehmann was effectively demoted at arsenal after a bad mistake against blackburn in august cost the gunners points .
at the time , the club claimed he had an elbow injury , but he 's now clearly become second choice to spaniard manuel almunia . with arsenal undefeated , leading the premiership and already through to the knock-out round of the champions league , no one in london is clamoring for lehmann 's return .
gunners ' coach arsene wenger said he still considers the german a valuable part of the team , but the moody keeper probably did n't help his cause in a recent televised outburst in which he accused wenger of " humiliating him . " the stand-off has led many soccer experts in germany to say lehmann needs to change clubs - or germany needs to change starting keepers . uncertainties abound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german number two , timo hildebrand , has also had problems german national coach joachim löw plans to start lehmann in germany 's match this weekend against cyprus .
but he says he also intends to review the situation at year 's end . " we always said we would sit down and discuss the situation during the winter break , " löw told the german sports agency sid .
" he knows it will be difficult to play in the european championship if he has n't played for his club eight months before that . " a new club could solve that dilemma , but it is unclear where lehmann would go .
none of the bundesliga 's first-division clubs have an obvious need for a new goalkeeper , and thus far none of the bigger second-division teams has indicated an interest in taking on lehmann 's salary . it is equally unclear , however , who would take over if lehmann should fail to find a home and lose his starting job for germany .
germany 's number two , timo hildebrand , has hard a hard time establishing himself at valencia and has let in a lot of goals when he has played . meanwhile germany 's current third choice , robert enke , plays for middle-of-the-pack hanover and has never really been tested at the international level . youth solution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's neuer might get a call-up it 's ironic that germany has a question mark between the posts .
the country continues to churn out high-quality goalkeepers , and a number of national sides - most notably england - would leap at the chance to nominate any of the regular net-minders in the bundesliga . in essence , germany is spoilt for choice , and that 's led some commentators to suggest that one of the country 's younger keepers be promoted to the national team . schalke 's manuel neuer has often been mooted .
the 21-year-old was voted the bundesliga 's best keeper last season but has been hit by a couple of high-profile mistakes lately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's adler could also be an option another option would be 22-year-old rene adler of leverkusen .
he 's impressed everyone this season and put on another terrific performance against wolfsburg in his side 's last match . should lehmann fail to find playing time , neuer or adler could find himself in possession of an unexpected ticket to euro 2008 . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we 're clearing up the shore and the water and we 're pumping oil out from a tanker damaged in the storm , " oleg mitvol , deputy head of the russian government 's environmental monitoring agency , told afp . " if that 2,000-ton spill moves further into the sea of azov , there will be serious environmental consequences , " mitvol added .

" some of these petroleum products can sink to levels in the water , particularly those without oxygen , and they will not dissolve , and just stay there for dozens of years , " he explained to dpa . sergei golubchikov , an environmental scientist , also told dpa that dozens of kilometers of seashore had been or soon would be polluted . the largest section was last reported to be in the middle of kerch strait and slowly drifting toward the russian shoreline . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but would that secure his position for euro 2008 ? jens lehmann may be top dog for germany at the moment , but he 's barely even second fiddle for english club arsenal .
he has n't played a match for the gunners since early this season , and that 's raised the question of whether germany should stay true to a keeper who 's not on the pitch week in and week out . " i would like to play again as soon as possible , " lehmann told the german soccer magazine kicker on monday , nov .

gunners ' coach arsene wenger said he still considers the german a valuable part of the team , but the moody keeper probably did n't help his cause in a recent televised outburst in which he accused wenger of " humiliating him .

none of the bundesliga 's first-division clubs have an obvious need for a new goalkeeper , and thus far none of the bigger second-division teams has indicated an interest in taking on lehmann 's salary . it is equally unclear , however , who would take over if lehmann should fail to find a home and lose his starting job for germany .
germany 's number two , timo hildebrand , has hard a hard time establishing himself at valencia and has let in a lot of goals when he has played . meanwhile germany 's current third choice , robert enke , plays for middle-of-the-pack hanover and has never really been tested at the international level . youth solution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's neuer might get a call-up it 's ironic that germany has a question mark between the posts .

but would that secure his position for euro 2008 ? jens lehmann may be top dog for germany at the moment , but he 's barely even second fiddle for english club arsenal .
he has n't played a match for the gunners since early this season , and that 's raised the question of whether germany should stay true to a keeper who 's not on the pitch week in and week out . " i would like to play again as soon as possible , " lehmann told the german soccer magazine kicker on monday , nov .
12 .
" the bundesliga is attractive and always an option - perhaps even in the second division .
in any case , i want to go to euro 2008 .
playing there was always my goal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann may not have too many matches left in an arsenal uniform the 38-year-old lehmann was effectively demoted at arsenal after a bad mistake against blackburn in august cost the gunners points .
at the time , the club claimed he had an elbow injury , but he 's now clearly become second choice to spaniard manuel almunia . with arsenal undefeated , leading the premiership and already through to the knock-out round of the champions league , no one in london is clamoring for lehmann 's return .
gunners ' coach arsene wenger said he still considers the german a valuable part of the team , but the moody keeper probably did n't help his cause in a recent televised outburst in which he accused wenger of " humiliating him . " the stand-off has led many soccer experts in germany to say lehmann needs to change clubs - or germany needs to change starting keepers . uncertainties abound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german number two , timo hildebrand , has also had problems german national coach joachim löw plans to start lehmann in germany 's match this weekend against cyprus .
but he says he also intends to review the situation at year 's end . " we always said we would sit down and discuss the situation during the winter break , " löw told the german sports agency sid .
" he knows it will be difficult to play in the european championship if he has n't played for his club eight months before that . " a new club could solve that dilemma , but it is unclear where lehmann would go .
none of the bundesliga 's first-division clubs have an obvious need for a new goalkeeper , and thus far none of the bigger second-division teams has indicated an interest in taking on lehmann 's salary . it is equally unclear , however , who would take over if lehmann should fail to find a home and lose his starting job for germany .
germany 's number two , timo hildebrand , has hard a hard time establishing himself at valencia and has let in a lot of goals when he has played . meanwhile germany 's current third choice , robert enke , plays for middle-of-the-pack hanover and has never really been tested at the international level . youth solution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's neuer might get a call-up it 's ironic that germany has a question mark between the posts .
the country continues to churn out high-quality goalkeepers , and a number of national sides - most notably england - would leap at the chance to nominate any of the regular net-minders in the bundesliga . in essence , germany is spoilt for choice , and that 's led some commentators to suggest that one of the country 's younger keepers be promoted to the national team . schalke 's manuel neuer has often been mooted .
the 21-year-old was voted the bundesliga 's best keeper last season but has been hit by a couple of high-profile mistakes lately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's adler could also be an option another option would be 22-year-old rene adler of leverkusen .

his party and the national government announced his successors on tuesday , nov .

" one does n't like to discuss these issues , but my wife has been gravely ill for some time , " müntefering said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering said he could n't fulfill his duties to both the government and his wife müntefering 's wife , ankepetra , has been sick with cancer for a number of years .

he said his resignation would come into effect as of the nov .
21 . " bridge builder " müntefering has played a key role in holding together the so-called left-right " grand coalition " government , but it has also been an awkward role .
müntefering has been described as chancellor angela merkel 's right-hand man , despite the fact that merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is the main political rival of müntefering 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering played an important role in reaching compromises with merkel 's cdu michael dauderstedt , from the frederick ebert foundation , a spd-aligned think tank , said the resignation was a blow to germany 's grand coalition government . " müntefering was more to the center than other larger parts of the spd and probably some parts of the cdu left wing , " dauderstedt said .
" he was very well positioned to function as a kind of bridge or consensus builder . " for this reason , müntefering is likely to be missed by both political allies and rivals alike .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said his party respected the vice chancellor 's decision to step down , and called müntefering an " important support " in the " successful work of the coalition . " coalition on the rocks ? peter ramsauer of merkel 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , said he did n't see the resignation of müntefering as posing any danger to the survival of the grand coalition . " this does n't mean that things will now go downhill , " ramsauer said tuesday in berlin .
" there are other people who will step up to fill müntefering 's role . " two candidates have already been chosen to replace müntefering in his key roles .
spd chief kurt beck said tuesday that parliamentary group leader olaf scholz would take the post of labor minister , while foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier would assume the position of deputy chancellor . friction in the spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck knew of müntefering 's decision before it was made public müntefering 's departure follows a public power struggle with beck over the future direction of the spd . müntefering was forced to accede to party demands last month and back proposals to unwind key aspects of former chancellor gerhard schröder 's labor market reforms .
it has been speculated that the loss of this ideological battle within the party also contributed to müntefering 's decision to step down . dw staff -lrb- nw , th , ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the time for a decision has come . " veton surroi , a member of the kosovo albanian 's negotiating team and leader of the opposition ora party , also said he 's unwilling to wait on washington much longer .

demands for independence are heating up , even as the international community is divided on whether it 's good for the region . time is running out for an agreement on kosovo .
the troika of the european union , the united states and russia overseeing current talks on kosovo has made no progress and is up against a dec .
10 deadline set by the united nations to issue its final report .
the us has continued to advocate independence while russia opposes it and europe remains divided on the issue . the eu has promised that the troika will take a " more proactive attitude " in negotiating with serbia and kosovo , a spokeswoman for the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana said monday , nov .
12 .
not only that , but the troika will present concrete proposals next week to bridge the impasse , the spokeswoman said . independent streak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has administered kosovo since 1999 but experts wonder if it will be enough after many rounds of negotiations have failed to find a compromise and both the serbian and kosovar fronts look hardened . " preserving kosovo and the serb republic -lsb- the eastern half of bosnia-herzegovina -rsb- are now the most important goals of our state and national policy , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica told reuters news agency last week . there are some signs that kosovo 's albanian politicians , increasingly calling for independence in recent weeks , are running out of patience after years of negotiations . prime minister agim ceku said kosovo was willing to wait until december before unilaterally declaring independence , but not much longer . " it is better to ask for an apology than for permission , " ceku said in an interview last week with the new york times .
" the time for a decision has come . " veton surroi , a member of the kosovo albanian 's negotiating team and leader of the opposition ora party , also said he 's unwilling to wait on washington much longer . " kosovo 's assembly should set the independence date before christmas , " surroi told the balkan investigative reporting network recently . campaign rhetoric heats up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pristina is a city in limbo some of the recent calls for independence can be attributed to the country 's upcoming elections , which will take place saturday . " it 's mainly campaign rhetoric , " said ilir dugolli , a senior researcher at the pristina-based kosovar institute for policy research and development -lrb- kipred -rrb- , of the calls for independence .
" but there 's anxiety as well . " judging from the broad public support for independence , politicians are wise to reiterate their demand for it , he said .
independence is a plank in all of kosovo 's major political parties ' platforms and is consistently supported by well over 90 percent of the kosovo albanian population , polls have shown . far-reaching consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writing is on the wall ?
this one says " no negotiations - self determination " any compromise short of independence would be a " very bitter pill to swallow " for most politicians , dugolli said , adding that the longer it takes , the more politicians will feel under pressure to give up on the negotiating process . russia has been the main international opponent of allowing the mainly muslim kosovo independence from orthodox serbia .
moscow is afraid it would encourage separatist movements in georgia , chechnya or even the basque region of spain . but a " domino theory " is a little bit too simplistic for such a complex region , said christophe solioz , an expert on kosovo at the center for european integration strategies -lrb- ceis -rrb- . a complex history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a funeral ceremony for 30 kosovo albanians killed during the 1998-99 war that killed thousands kosovo came under un administration in 1999 , a result of the fighting and ethnic cleansing that marked the breakup of yugoslavia .
russia supports serbia 's claim to the region of 2 million , which contains ethnic serbian enclaves .
europe is divided on the issue with several countries , including greece , cyprus , and romania , refusing to recognize kosovo without a un security council agreement . eu diplomats are currently working to get consensus within the bloc on how to react if kosovo were to declare independence , said center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- analyst gergana noutcheva . in the european union , which recently reported on rampant corruption and organized crime in kosovo , the official line remains support for a negotiated settlement .
but some countries are trying to move the bloc towards acknowledging that kosovo independence is the only thing that will bring security and stability to the region , noutcheva said . while kosovo albanian politicians have said they wo n't accept anything less than full independence , " this could also be a bargaining position , " noutcheva said .
" of course they will insist on full independence until the very end .
that is not to say that this is what will happen . " hong kong , germany possible examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demand self-determination , will it come in 2020 ?
while no proposals have officially been announced , insiders say several compromises are under discussion .
one possible scenario - a variation of which was proposed by serbia - uses hong kong as a model .
kosovo would be under serbian rule , but would have extensive self-government rights .
in 2020 , kosovo would then be allowed to vote in a referendum on whether to gain full independence . another idea the troika has discussed , according to diplomats , is a variation of the agreement reached between the two germanys in 1972 , known as the grundlagenvertrag , or basic treaty .
in this treaty , west germany recognized the existence of the german democratic republic in everything but law . eu envoy wolfgang ischinger " is looking for models on which to draw inspiration , " one diplomat told the afp news agency , on condition of anonymity .
" he has found a certain inspiration in this very particular case of the two germanys . " whatever the inspiration , solioz of ceis said a compromise is essential in kosovo .
he said kosovo should be given special status as an eu region with a referendum date set for 2020 . " sooner or later you ca n't play any games anymore , " solioz said .

" preserving kosovo and the serb republic -lsb- the eastern half of bosnia-herzegovina -rsb- are now the most important goals of our state and national policy , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica told reuters news agency last week . there are some signs that kosovo 's albanian politicians , increasingly calling for independence in recent weeks , are running out of patience after years of negotiations . prime minister agim ceku said kosovo was willing to wait until december before unilaterally declaring independence , but not much longer . " it is better to ask for an apology than for permission , " ceku said in an interview last week with the new york times .
" the time for a decision has come . " veton surroi , a member of the kosovo albanian 's negotiating team and leader of the opposition ora party , also said he 's unwilling to wait on washington much longer . " kosovo 's assembly should set the independence date before christmas , " surroi told the balkan investigative reporting network recently . campaign rhetoric heats up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pristina is a city in limbo some of the recent calls for independence can be attributed to the country 's upcoming elections , which will take place saturday . " it 's mainly campaign rhetoric , " said ilir dugolli , a senior researcher at the pristina-based kosovar institute for policy research and development -lrb- kipred -rrb- , of the calls for independence .
" but there 's anxiety as well . " judging from the broad public support for independence , politicians are wise to reiterate their demand for it , he said .
independence is a plank in all of kosovo 's major political parties ' platforms and is consistently supported by well over 90 percent of the kosovo albanian population , polls have shown . far-reaching consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writing is on the wall ?
this one says " no negotiations - self determination " any compromise short of independence would be a " very bitter pill to swallow " for most politicians , dugolli said , adding that the longer it takes , the more politicians will feel under pressure to give up on the negotiating process . russia has been the main international opponent of allowing the mainly muslim kosovo independence from orthodox serbia .
moscow is afraid it would encourage separatist movements in georgia , chechnya or even the basque region of spain . but a " domino theory " is a little bit too simplistic for such a complex region , said christophe solioz , an expert on kosovo at the center for european integration strategies -lrb- ceis -rrb- . a complex history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a funeral ceremony for 30 kosovo albanians killed during the 1998-99 war that killed thousands kosovo came under un administration in 1999 , a result of the fighting and ethnic cleansing that marked the breakup of yugoslavia .
russia supports serbia 's claim to the region of 2 million , which contains ethnic serbian enclaves .
europe is divided on the issue with several countries , including greece , cyprus , and romania , refusing to recognize kosovo without a un security council agreement . eu diplomats are currently working to get consensus within the bloc on how to react if kosovo were to declare independence , said center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- analyst gergana noutcheva . in the european union , which recently reported on rampant corruption and organized crime in kosovo , the official line remains support for a negotiated settlement .
but some countries are trying to move the bloc towards acknowledging that kosovo independence is the only thing that will bring security and stability to the region , noutcheva said . while kosovo albanian politicians have said they wo n't accept anything less than full independence , " this could also be a bargaining position , " noutcheva said .
" of course they will insist on full independence until the very end .
that is not to say that this is what will happen . " hong kong , germany possible examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demand self-determination , will it come in 2020 ?
while no proposals have officially been announced , insiders say several compromises are under discussion .
one possible scenario - a variation of which was proposed by serbia - uses hong kong as a model .
kosovo would be under serbian rule , but would have extensive self-government rights .
in 2020 , kosovo would then be allowed to vote in a referendum on whether to gain full independence . another idea the troika has discussed , according to diplomats , is a variation of the agreement reached between the two germanys in 1972 , known as the grundlagenvertrag , or basic treaty .
in this treaty , west germany recognized the existence of the german democratic republic in everything but law . eu envoy wolfgang ischinger " is looking for models on which to draw inspiration , " one diplomat told the afp news agency , on condition of anonymity .
" he has found a certain inspiration in this very particular case of the two germanys . " whatever the inspiration , solioz of ceis said a compromise is essential in kosovo .
he said kosovo should be given special status as an eu region with a referendum date set for 2020 . " sooner or later you ca n't play any games anymore , " solioz said .
" you have to play the diplomatic card and you must have a strategy . " trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato said there is no evidence of abuse . amnesty international said no safeguards exist to ensure that detainees turned over to afghan authorities are safe from abuse .
amnesty urged the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- to stop prisoner transfers immediately .
the report named afghanistan 's national directorate of security -lrb- nds -rrb- as a major offender , saying prisoners were exposed to whipping , beatings , food deprivation and exposure to extreme cold .
the agency " currently poses a serious threat to those in its custody , " the amnesty report said .
isaf has 40,000 troops in afghanistan from 37 countries .
britain , canada , denmark , the netherlands and norway have signed agreements on prisoner transfers , according to amnesty .
germany , belgium , france and sweden are considering similar measures .
agreements not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf has 40,000 troops in afghanistan the report , which was released tuesday , nov .
13 , detailed allegations of afghan torture of several detainees handed over by canadian troops to the nds .
the agreements do not exempt countries from their obligations towards prisoners , claudio cordone , amnesty 's senior research director , told reuters .
" these agreements are supposed to ensure that detainees are treated in accordance with international standards but have proved to be inadequate , " he said . " such transfers should be suspended until effective safeguards are in place . "
the german government was also criticized for not providing any information on prisoners it hands over to the afghans .
the ministry of defense refuses to release the exact number or whereabouts of prisoners , said barbara lochbihler , who heads amnesty international in germany .
this makes it impossible to monitor treatment .
amnesty said the agreements isaf countries have with afghanistan do not prevent detainees from being put in situations where they could face " torture or other ill-treatment . "
safeguards lacking for prisoner transfers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty wants more training for afghan prison staff isaf is providing support for president hamid karzai 's weak central government .
but a taliban-led insurgency continues .
amnesty called on isaf to declare an immediate " moratorium on any further transfers of detainees to the afghan authorities and -lsb- to -rsb- take responsibility for the custody of such detainees until effective safeguards against torture and other ill-treatment are introduced in the afghan detention system . "

demands for independence are heating up , even as the international community is divided on whether it 's good for the region . time is running out for an agreement on kosovo .
the troika of the european union , the united states and russia overseeing current talks on kosovo has made no progress and is up against a dec .
10 deadline set by the united nations to issue its final report .
the us has continued to advocate independence while russia opposes it and europe remains divided on the issue . the eu has promised that the troika will take a " more proactive attitude " in negotiating with serbia and kosovo , a spokeswoman for the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana said monday , nov .
12 .
not only that , but the troika will present concrete proposals next week to bridge the impasse , the spokeswoman said . independent streak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has administered kosovo since 1999 but experts wonder if it will be enough after many rounds of negotiations have failed to find a compromise and both the serbian and kosovar fronts look hardened . " preserving kosovo and the serb republic -lsb- the eastern half of bosnia-herzegovina -rsb- are now the most important goals of our state and national policy , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica told reuters news agency last week . there are some signs that kosovo 's albanian politicians , increasingly calling for independence in recent weeks , are running out of patience after years of negotiations . prime minister agim ceku said kosovo was willing to wait until december before unilaterally declaring independence , but not much longer . " it is better to ask for an apology than for permission , " ceku said in an interview last week with the new york times .
" the time for a decision has come . " veton surroi , a member of the kosovo albanian 's negotiating team and leader of the opposition ora party , also said he 's unwilling to wait on washington much longer . " kosovo 's assembly should set the independence date before christmas , " surroi told the balkan investigative reporting network recently . campaign rhetoric heats up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pristina is a city in limbo some of the recent calls for independence can be attributed to the country 's upcoming elections , which will take place saturday . " it 's mainly campaign rhetoric , " said ilir dugolli , a senior researcher at the pristina-based kosovar institute for policy research and development -lrb- kipred -rrb- , of the calls for independence .
" but there 's anxiety as well . " judging from the broad public support for independence , politicians are wise to reiterate their demand for it , he said .
independence is a plank in all of kosovo 's major political parties ' platforms and is consistently supported by well over 90 percent of the kosovo albanian population , polls have shown . far-reaching consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writing is on the wall ?
this one says " no negotiations - self determination " any compromise short of independence would be a " very bitter pill to swallow " for most politicians , dugolli said , adding that the longer it takes , the more politicians will feel under pressure to give up on the negotiating process . russia has been the main international opponent of allowing the mainly muslim kosovo independence from orthodox serbia .
moscow is afraid it would encourage separatist movements in georgia , chechnya or even the basque region of spain . but a " domino theory " is a little bit too simplistic for such a complex region , said christophe solioz , an expert on kosovo at the center for european integration strategies -lrb- ceis -rrb- . a complex history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a funeral ceremony for 30 kosovo albanians killed during the 1998-99 war that killed thousands kosovo came under un administration in 1999 , a result of the fighting and ethnic cleansing that marked the breakup of yugoslavia .
russia supports serbia 's claim to the region of 2 million , which contains ethnic serbian enclaves .
europe is divided on the issue with several countries , including greece , cyprus , and romania , refusing to recognize kosovo without a un security council agreement . eu diplomats are currently working to get consensus within the bloc on how to react if kosovo were to declare independence , said center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- analyst gergana noutcheva . in the european union , which recently reported on rampant corruption and organized crime in kosovo , the official line remains support for a negotiated settlement .
but some countries are trying to move the bloc towards acknowledging that kosovo independence is the only thing that will bring security and stability to the region , noutcheva said . while kosovo albanian politicians have said they wo n't accept anything less than full independence , " this could also be a bargaining position , " noutcheva said .
" of course they will insist on full independence until the very end .
that is not to say that this is what will happen . " hong kong , germany possible examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demand self-determination , will it come in 2020 ?
while no proposals have officially been announced , insiders say several compromises are under discussion .
one possible scenario - a variation of which was proposed by serbia - uses hong kong as a model .
kosovo would be under serbian rule , but would have extensive self-government rights .
in 2020 , kosovo would then be allowed to vote in a referendum on whether to gain full independence . another idea the troika has discussed , according to diplomats , is a variation of the agreement reached between the two germanys in 1972 , known as the grundlagenvertrag , or basic treaty .
in this treaty , west germany recognized the existence of the german democratic republic in everything but law . eu envoy wolfgang ischinger " is looking for models on which to draw inspiration , " one diplomat told the afp news agency , on condition of anonymity .
" he has found a certain inspiration in this very particular case of the two germanys . " whatever the inspiration , solioz of ceis said a compromise is essential in kosovo .
he said kosovo should be given special status as an eu region with a referendum date set for 2020 . " sooner or later you ca n't play any games anymore , " solioz said .

" kosovo 's assembly should set the independence date before christmas , " surroi told the balkan investigative reporting network recently . campaign rhetoric heats up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pristina is a city in limbo some of the recent calls for independence can be attributed to the country 's upcoming elections , which will take place saturday . " it 's mainly campaign rhetoric , " said ilir dugolli , a senior researcher at the pristina-based kosovar institute for policy research and development -lrb- kipred -rrb- , of the calls for independence .
" but there 's anxiety as well . " judging from the broad public support for independence , politicians are wise to reiterate their demand for it , he said .
independence is a plank in all of kosovo 's major political parties ' platforms and is consistently supported by well over 90 percent of the kosovo albanian population , polls have shown . far-reaching consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writing is on the wall ?
this one says " no negotiations - self determination " any compromise short of independence would be a " very bitter pill to swallow " for most politicians , dugolli said , adding that the longer it takes , the more politicians will feel under pressure to give up on the negotiating process . russia has been the main international opponent of allowing the mainly muslim kosovo independence from orthodox serbia .
moscow is afraid it would encourage separatist movements in georgia , chechnya or even the basque region of spain . but a " domino theory " is a little bit too simplistic for such a complex region , said christophe solioz , an expert on kosovo at the center for european integration strategies -lrb- ceis -rrb- . a complex history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a funeral ceremony for 30 kosovo albanians killed during the 1998-99 war that killed thousands kosovo came under un administration in 1999 , a result of the fighting and ethnic cleansing that marked the breakup of yugoslavia .
russia supports serbia 's claim to the region of 2 million , which contains ethnic serbian enclaves .
europe is divided on the issue with several countries , including greece , cyprus , and romania , refusing to recognize kosovo without a un security council agreement . eu diplomats are currently working to get consensus within the bloc on how to react if kosovo were to declare independence , said center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- analyst gergana noutcheva . in the european union , which recently reported on rampant corruption and organized crime in kosovo , the official line remains support for a negotiated settlement .
but some countries are trying to move the bloc towards acknowledging that kosovo independence is the only thing that will bring security and stability to the region , noutcheva said . while kosovo albanian politicians have said they wo n't accept anything less than full independence , " this could also be a bargaining position , " noutcheva said .
" of course they will insist on full independence until the very end .
that is not to say that this is what will happen . " hong kong , germany possible examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demand self-determination , will it come in 2020 ?
while no proposals have officially been announced , insiders say several compromises are under discussion .
one possible scenario - a variation of which was proposed by serbia - uses hong kong as a model .
kosovo would be under serbian rule , but would have extensive self-government rights .
in 2020 , kosovo would then be allowed to vote in a referendum on whether to gain full independence . another idea the troika has discussed , according to diplomats , is a variation of the agreement reached between the two germanys in 1972 , known as the grundlagenvertrag , or basic treaty .
in this treaty , west germany recognized the existence of the german democratic republic in everything but law . eu envoy wolfgang ischinger " is looking for models on which to draw inspiration , " one diplomat told the afp news agency , on condition of anonymity .
" he has found a certain inspiration in this very particular case of the two germanys . " whatever the inspiration , solioz of ceis said a compromise is essential in kosovo .
he said kosovo should be given special status as an eu region with a referendum date set for 2020 . " sooner or later you ca n't play any games anymore , " solioz said .

" preserving kosovo and the serb republic -lsb- the eastern half of bosnia-herzegovina -rsb- are now the most important goals of our state and national policy , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica told reuters news agency last week . there are some signs that kosovo 's albanian politicians , increasingly calling for independence in recent weeks , are running out of patience after years of negotiations . prime minister agim ceku said kosovo was willing to wait until december before unilaterally declaring independence , but not much longer .

13 , to clean up a massive oil spill , russian and ukrainian environmentalists have predicted that the ecological impact of the spill in the black sea will be long-term . waves caused an oil tanker to split in two on sunday allowing some 2,000 tons of heating oil to spill into the kerch strait that connects the black sea and the sea of azov .
the waterway between russia and ukraine is an important migration route for birds and home to the black sea porpoise . high winds have caused helicopters to be grounded , but clean-up efforts by russian and ukrainian soldiers and civilians are continuing with use vehicles along beaches .
the interfax news agency reported that about 200 tons of oil had been removed from the water by midday on tuesday . on the weekend , the 100 kph -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- gales that causing the tanker to split also prompted four other ships to sink and drove another 15 vessels aground . sailors still missing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ships battled high seas as a winter storm slammed into the crimean peninsula sunday rescuers saved 36 other crew members from the shipwrecks on sunday .
but 20 sailors were still missing from the wrecks , while the bodies of three were washed ashore on monday on the tuzla spit , near the maritime border between russia and ex-soviet ukraine . " the clean-up of the water is going to take six months , and a complete clean-up of the coastal areas is going to take decades , " environmentalist aleksander minin told dpa news agency . thousands of bird have died regional governor alexander tkachyov told afp news agency that 30,000 birds had already died . on the tuzla spit , near the location of the spill , an afp reporter saw some 200 emergency workers , soldiers and volunteers shoveling sand and seaweed caked with fuel oil into trucks . " we 're clearing up the shore and the water and we 're pumping oil out from a tanker damaged in the storm , " oleg mitvol , deputy head of the russian government 's environmental monitoring agency , told afp . " if that 2,000-ton spill moves further into the sea of azov , there will be serious environmental consequences , " mitvol added .
" it has a fragile ecosystem . " oil wo n't budge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil is continuing to wash up on the shore near port kavkaz much of the water in the black sea - generally at depths below 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- - can not support life due to a high concentration of hydrogen sulfide and low levels of oxygen . if the oil from the spill sinks , it could remain there almost indefinitely until returned to the surface or land by currents , minin said . " some of these petroleum products can sink to levels in the water , particularly those without oxygen , and they will not dissolve , and just stay there for dozens of years , " he explained to dpa . sergei golubchikov , an environmental scientist , also told dpa that dozens of kilometers of seashore had been or soon would be polluted . the largest section was last reported to be in the middle of kerch strait and slowly drifting toward the russian shoreline . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato said there is no evidence of abuse . amnesty international said no safeguards exist to ensure that detainees turned over to afghan authorities are safe from abuse .
amnesty urged the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- to stop prisoner transfers immediately .
the report named afghanistan 's national directorate of security -lrb- nds -rrb- as a major offender , saying prisoners were exposed to whipping , beatings , food deprivation and exposure to extreme cold .
the agency " currently poses a serious threat to those in its custody , " the amnesty report said .
isaf has 40,000 troops in afghanistan from 37 countries .
britain , canada , denmark , the netherlands and norway have signed agreements on prisoner transfers , according to amnesty .

the agreements do not exempt countries from their obligations towards prisoners , claudio cordone , amnesty 's senior research director , told reuters .
" these agreements are supposed to ensure that detainees are treated in accordance with international standards but have proved to be inadequate , " he said . " such transfers should be suspended until effective safeguards are in place . "
the german government was also criticized for not providing any information on prisoners it hands over to the afghans .
the ministry of defense refuses to release the exact number or whereabouts of prisoners , said barbara lochbihler , who heads amnesty international in germany .
this makes it impossible to monitor treatment .
amnesty said the agreements isaf countries have with afghanistan do not prevent detainees from being put in situations where they could face " torture or other ill-treatment . "
safeguards lacking for prisoner transfers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty wants more training for afghan prison staff isaf is providing support for president hamid karzai 's weak central government .

amnesty called on isaf to declare an immediate " moratorium on any further transfers of detainees to the afghan authorities and -lsb- to -rsb- take responsibility for the custody of such detainees until effective safeguards against torture and other ill-treatment are introduced in the afghan detention system . "
agreements alone would not guarantee prisoners ' proper treatment by afghan authorities , amnesty said , adding that isaf also needed to help train afghan prison staff and reform the detention system .
all prisons should allow independent monitors to check on the conditions , and the nds also needed reform , the group said .
nato rebuffs criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is part of the nato peacekeeping force nato spokesman james appathurai said the military alliance has no evidence of prisoner abuse and no plans to build jails .

the agreements do not exempt countries from their obligations towards prisoners , claudio cordone , amnesty 's senior research director , told reuters .
" these agreements are supposed to ensure that detainees are treated in accordance with international standards but have proved to be inadequate , " he said . " such transfers should be suspended until effective safeguards are in place . "
the german government was also criticized for not providing any information on prisoners it hands over to the afghans .
the ministry of defense refuses to release the exact number or whereabouts of prisoners , said barbara lochbihler , who heads amnesty international in germany .

amnesty called on isaf to declare an immediate " moratorium on any further transfers of detainees to the afghan authorities and -lsb- to -rsb- take responsibility for the custody of such detainees until effective safeguards against torture and other ill-treatment are introduced in the afghan detention system . "
agreements alone would not guarantee prisoners ' proper treatment by afghan authorities , amnesty said , adding that isaf also needed to help train afghan prison staff and reform the detention system .
all prisons should allow independent monitors to check on the conditions , and the nds also needed reform , the group said .

" i 'm glad , " schweisfurth told munich 's abendzeitung newspaper . basic customers had put on the heat with their pocketbooks - buying less to show their displeasure over the possible buy-out and the aggressive business policies pursued by schwarz , which owns the hugely successful discount grocery chain lidl . though basic had been seeking outside capital in order to expand , it bowed to customers and blocked the further sale of its shares to schwarz . " the customers have won , " schweisfurth said this week .
" this is the first time in history that they have voted with their shopping lists on how organic farming should work . " take-over would have had negative effect in a press release on friday , nov .
9 , basic had said , " we underestimated the psychological effect that a buy-out of our stores would have . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bionade is another organic product that has boomed recently the schwarz group had begun buying into basic in february , raising its stake to 23 percent , at which point it began putting forward proposals for a buy-out . basic management and customers became incensed and some suppliers refused to continue business with the chain . the berliner zeitung newspaper commented that the turn-about showed the power of consumer pressure . " the idea that a company worth billions , which is known for its poor working conditions and tough buying policies , should bully its way into the organic sector did not suit them , " the paper noted . not only does the organic label stand for healthy food , but also for ethical practices and the careful use of resources , the berliner zeitung added .
pullout requires slower expansion basic has now said it would slow its plans for rapid expansion .
rather than the 25 to 50 stores it had intended to open annually after the schwarz take-over , it will now open only five to 10 per year . the company said it hoped the move reinforced the trust customers and suppliers originally had in basic . basic is the second largest german organic foods supermarket chain after alnatura , and had a turnover of 73 million euros in 2006 , as reported by ap news agency . the market in germany for organically grown food grew by 18 percent last year , with the rapid increase forcing retailers to seek suppliers abroad , according to the dpa news agency . at the same time , the amount of organic-farmed area rose by only 2.3 percent , or around 4.9 percent of the total area cultivated in germany , creating tight market conditions . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but would that secure his position for euro 2008 ? jens lehmann may be top dog for germany at the moment , but he 's barely even second fiddle for english club arsenal .
he has n't played a match for the gunners since early this season , and that 's raised the question of whether germany should stay true to a keeper who 's not on the pitch week in and week out . " i would like to play again as soon as possible , " lehmann told the german soccer magazine kicker on monday , nov .
12 .
" the bundesliga is attractive and always an option - perhaps even in the second division .
in any case , i want to go to euro 2008 .
playing there was always my goal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann may not have too many matches left in an arsenal uniform the 38-year-old lehmann was effectively demoted at arsenal after a bad mistake against blackburn in august cost the gunners points .
at the time , the club claimed he had an elbow injury , but he 's now clearly become second choice to spaniard manuel almunia . with arsenal undefeated , leading the premiership and already through to the knock-out round of the champions league , no one in london is clamoring for lehmann 's return .
gunners ' coach arsene wenger said he still considers the german a valuable part of the team , but the moody keeper probably did n't help his cause in a recent televised outburst in which he accused wenger of " humiliating him . " the stand-off has led many soccer experts in germany to say lehmann needs to change clubs - or germany needs to change starting keepers . uncertainties abound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german number two , timo hildebrand , has also had problems german national coach joachim löw plans to start lehmann in germany 's match this weekend against cyprus .
but he says he also intends to review the situation at year 's end . " we always said we would sit down and discuss the situation during the winter break , " löw told the german sports agency sid .
" he knows it will be difficult to play in the european championship if he has n't played for his club eight months before that . " a new club could solve that dilemma , but it is unclear where lehmann would go .
none of the bundesliga 's first-division clubs have an obvious need for a new goalkeeper , and thus far none of the bigger second-division teams has indicated an interest in taking on lehmann 's salary . it is equally unclear , however , who would take over if lehmann should fail to find a home and lose his starting job for germany .
germany 's number two , timo hildebrand , has hard a hard time establishing himself at valencia and has let in a lot of goals when he has played . meanwhile germany 's current third choice , robert enke , plays for middle-of-the-pack hanover and has never really been tested at the international level . youth solution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's neuer might get a call-up it 's ironic that germany has a question mark between the posts .
the country continues to churn out high-quality goalkeepers , and a number of national sides - most notably england - would leap at the chance to nominate any of the regular net-minders in the bundesliga . in essence , germany is spoilt for choice , and that 's led some commentators to suggest that one of the country 's younger keepers be promoted to the national team . schalke 's manuel neuer has often been mooted .
the 21-year-old was voted the bundesliga 's best keeper last season but has been hit by a couple of high-profile mistakes lately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's adler could also be an option another option would be 22-year-old rene adler of leverkusen .

his party and the national government announced his successors on tuesday , nov .
13 . müntefering told a press conference in berlin that his decision to resign was personal . " one does n't like to discuss these issues , but my wife has been gravely ill for some time , " müntefering said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering said he could n't fulfill his duties to both the government and his wife müntefering 's wife , ankepetra , has been sick with cancer for a number of years .
müntefering said she had undergone five operations since 2001 and that it was becoming untenable to hold his political positions and support his wife at the same time . the deputy chancellor emphatically ruled out a political motive for his decision to step down .
he said his resignation would come into effect as of the nov .
21 . " bridge builder " müntefering has played a key role in holding together the so-called left-right " grand coalition " government , but it has also been an awkward role .
müntefering has been described as chancellor angela merkel 's right-hand man , despite the fact that merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is the main political rival of müntefering 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering played an important role in reaching compromises with merkel 's cdu michael dauderstedt , from the frederick ebert foundation , a spd-aligned think tank , said the resignation was a blow to germany 's grand coalition government . " müntefering was more to the center than other larger parts of the spd and probably some parts of the cdu left wing , " dauderstedt said .
" he was very well positioned to function as a kind of bridge or consensus builder . " for this reason , müntefering is likely to be missed by both political allies and rivals alike .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said his party respected the vice chancellor 's decision to step down , and called müntefering an " important support " in the " successful work of the coalition . " coalition on the rocks ? peter ramsauer of merkel 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , said he did n't see the resignation of müntefering as posing any danger to the survival of the grand coalition . " this does n't mean that things will now go downhill , " ramsauer said tuesday in berlin .
" there are other people who will step up to fill müntefering 's role . " two candidates have already been chosen to replace müntefering in his key roles .
spd chief kurt beck said tuesday that parliamentary group leader olaf scholz would take the post of labor minister , while foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier would assume the position of deputy chancellor . friction in the spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck knew of müntefering 's decision before it was made public müntefering 's departure follows a public power struggle with beck over the future direction of the spd . müntefering was forced to accede to party demands last month and back proposals to unwind key aspects of former chancellor gerhard schröder 's labor market reforms .
it has been speculated that the loss of this ideological battle within the party also contributed to müntefering 's decision to step down . dw staff -lrb- nw , th , ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we 're clearing up the shore and the water and we 're pumping oil out from a tanker damaged in the storm , " oleg mitvol , deputy head of the russian government 's environmental monitoring agency , told afp .

" some of these petroleum products can sink to levels in the water , particularly those without oxygen , and they will not dissolve , and just stay there for dozens of years , " he explained to dpa . sergei golubchikov , an environmental scientist , also told dpa that dozens of kilometers of seashore had been or soon would be polluted . the largest section was last reported to be in the middle of kerch strait and slowly drifting toward the russian shoreline . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in certain circumstances , the telephone conversations of lawyers , journalists and doctors may also be bugged . currently , some journalists say police have already been listening into their conversations . according to the tagesschau online portal of german public broadcaster ard , police have eavesdropped on conversations of two journalists and two lawyers to pursue investigations of two suspected left-wing radicals . one of the journalists works for tagesschau , another works for public broadcaster norddeutscher rundfunk -lrb- ndr -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists said they they were pursuing research that had nothing to do with investigations ndr staff were able to review the transcriptions of its reporter 's telephone conversations with sources in northern germany .
according to the files , the schleswig-holstein state office of criminal investigation was commissioned by the federal prosecutor 's office in karlsruhe to listen in on the ndr journalist . jobst plog , director of ndr , said that " should the suspicion against security officials be confirmed , it would be a massive assault on press freedom . " suspected of aiming to create terrorist organization according to ndr , federal prosecutors ' investigations of the two alleged radicals revolved around events leading up to last june 's group of eight summit of highly industrialized nations in germany .
the two suspected radicals were thought to have been planning to create a terrorist organization . ndr 's journalist has reported on political extremism in his work for years , and his research on the phone may have lead to links involving the two police suspects . according to the tagesschau reporter , who was permitted to look into the police file on his telephone conversations , the calls ' content was in no way connected to police investigations , but instead , concerned more editorial and journalistic matters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a prosecutor said the police ca n't always tell what will be important to a case authorities have also allegedly listened in on conversations among some journalists working for berlin 's daily tagesspiegel , according to an ard report .
the online portal of the daily tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- has also reported that some of its journalists ' conversations have been recorded . the taz reported that wire taps had been placed on the suspects ' phones , not those of journalists , but added that police should not have listened to the calls after it was clear the suspects were talking to journalists . " no malice intended " a spokesman for the federal prosecutor 's office told taz that officials would check into the allegations of eavesdropping , but said " no malice was intended . " he pointed out that telephone conversations are recorded by machines , and also said that police officers who transcribe the recordings can not always recognize what is " relevant to an investigation or not .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 13.11.2007 lehmann willing to drop down a division for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann 's benching has created an issue for germany jens lehmann has told a german soccer magazine that he would transfer to a second-division club in a bid to retain his status as germany 's starting keeper .
but would that secure his position for euro 2008 ? jens lehmann may be top dog for germany at the moment , but he 's barely even second fiddle for english club arsenal .
he has n't played a match for the gunners since early this season , and that 's raised the question of whether germany should stay true to a keeper who 's not on the pitch week in and week out . " i would like to play again as soon as possible , " lehmann told the german soccer magazine kicker on monday , nov .
12 .
" the bundesliga is attractive and always an option - perhaps even in the second division .
in any case , i want to go to euro 2008 .
playing there was always my goal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann may not have too many matches left in an arsenal uniform the 38-year-old lehmann was effectively demoted at arsenal after a bad mistake against blackburn in august cost the gunners points .
at the time , the club claimed he had an elbow injury , but he 's now clearly become second choice to spaniard manuel almunia . with arsenal undefeated , leading the premiership and already through to the knock-out round of the champions league , no one in london is clamoring for lehmann 's return .
gunners ' coach arsene wenger said he still considers the german a valuable part of the team , but the moody keeper probably did n't help his cause in a recent televised outburst in which he accused wenger of " humiliating him . " the stand-off has led many soccer experts in germany to say lehmann needs to change clubs - or germany needs to change starting keepers . uncertainties abound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german number two , timo hildebrand , has also had problems german national coach joachim löw plans to start lehmann in germany 's match this weekend against cyprus .
but he says he also intends to review the situation at year 's end . " we always said we would sit down and discuss the situation during the winter break , " löw told the german sports agency sid .
" he knows it will be difficult to play in the european championship if he has n't played for his club eight months before that . " a new club could solve that dilemma , but it is unclear where lehmann would go .
none of the bundesliga 's first-division clubs have an obvious need for a new goalkeeper , and thus far none of the bigger second-division teams has indicated an interest in taking on lehmann 's salary . it is equally unclear , however , who would take over if lehmann should fail to find a home and lose his starting job for germany .
germany 's number two , timo hildebrand , has hard a hard time establishing himself at valencia and has let in a lot of goals when he has played . meanwhile germany 's current third choice , robert enke , plays for middle-of-the-pack hanover and has never really been tested at the international level . youth solution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's neuer might get a call-up it 's ironic that germany has a question mark between the posts .
the country continues to churn out high-quality goalkeepers , and a number of national sides - most notably england - would leap at the chance to nominate any of the regular net-minders in the bundesliga . in essence , germany is spoilt for choice , and that 's led some commentators to suggest that one of the country 's younger keepers be promoted to the national team . schalke 's manuel neuer has often been mooted .
the 21-year-old was voted the bundesliga 's best keeper last season but has been hit by a couple of high-profile mistakes lately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's adler could also be an option another option would be 22-year-old rene adler of leverkusen .
he 's impressed everyone this season and put on another terrific performance against wolfsburg in his side 's last match . should lehmann fail to find playing time , neuer or adler could find himself in possession of an unexpected ticket to euro 2008 . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in certain circumstances , the telephone conversations of lawyers , journalists and doctors may also be bugged . currently , some journalists say police have already been listening into their conversations . according to the tagesschau online portal of german public broadcaster ard , police have eavesdropped on conversations of two journalists and two lawyers to pursue investigations of two suspected left-wing radicals . one of the journalists works for tagesschau , another works for public broadcaster norddeutscher rundfunk -lrb- ndr -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists said they they were pursuing research that had nothing to do with investigations ndr staff were able to review the transcriptions of its reporter 's telephone conversations with sources in northern germany .
according to the files , the schleswig-holstein state office of criminal investigation was commissioned by the federal prosecutor 's office in karlsruhe to listen in on the ndr journalist . jobst plog , director of ndr , said that " should the suspicion against security officials be confirmed , it would be a massive assault on press freedom . " suspected of aiming to create terrorist organization according to ndr , federal prosecutors ' investigations of the two alleged radicals revolved around events leading up to last june 's group of eight summit of highly industrialized nations in germany .

but not all the member states like the idea . the proposals would allow national regulators to split the network and retail divisions of providers deemed to have too much influence .
they also foresee giving brussels the ability to overturn national regulators ' decisions and would create an eu telecommunications watchdog organization . " from today onwards , a single market without borders for europe 's telecoms operators and consumers is not only a dream , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in a statement introducing the proposals on tuesday , nov .
13 . advocates said the changes are also needed to increase investment in sectors like broadband internet access and diversify the market , a step eu telecoms commissioner viviane reding said the regulations would make . revolutionary plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new plans would help people communicate better , reding said " the changes the commission is presenting today in the telecoms rules is bound to revolutionize the european telecoms sector , " she told reporters .
" -lsb- the reform -rsb- will increase competition , leading to more innovation and investments , and it will help european citizens to get the most out of modern communication systems . " reding also said the shake-up would " revolutionize europe 's telecom 's sector and help it compete better with other continents in terms of globalization . " industry analysts said the measures are aimed primarily at curbing the influence of giant former-monopoly companies like germany 's deutsche telekom , which sharply criticized the plan . " the proposals of the commission will hinder investments of billions , " deutsche telekom said in a statement . long way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plans do n't sit well with big companies like telekom the new rules , which could take effect by the end of 2009 , have to be approved by the governments and parliaments of eu member states .
analysts said it 's highly unlikely that countries like germany , france and spain will let the plans go through in their current form . " reticence is warranted , " the german economy ministry said in a terse statement . critics , many of whom work for companies such as deutsche telekom , say the proposal would decrease investment in emerging technologies by increasing uncertainty on the market .
there is also resistance to the idea of giving even more power to brussels . " instead of helping get rid of the current competition problems , the new proposals needlessly risk hurting competition and will inevitably lead to more bureaucracy , decreased efficiency and loss of power for national regulators , as well as the elimination of jobs , " jürgen grützner , head of the german association of telecommunications and service providers , told the ap news agency . but representatives of new companies that compete with former monopolies welcomed the measures , saying that they would bolster competition and increase investment .

in certain circumstances , the telephone conversations of lawyers , journalists and doctors may also be bugged . currently , some journalists say police have already been listening into their conversations . according to the tagesschau online portal of german public broadcaster ard , police have eavesdropped on conversations of two journalists and two lawyers to pursue investigations of two suspected left-wing radicals . one of the journalists works for tagesschau , another works for public broadcaster norddeutscher rundfunk -lrb- ndr -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists said they they were pursuing research that had nothing to do with investigations ndr staff were able to review the transcriptions of its reporter 's telephone conversations with sources in northern germany .
according to the files , the schleswig-holstein state office of criminal investigation was commissioned by the federal prosecutor 's office in karlsruhe to listen in on the ndr journalist . jobst plog , director of ndr , said that " should the suspicion against security officials be confirmed , it would be a massive assault on press freedom . " suspected of aiming to create terrorist organization according to ndr , federal prosecutors ' investigations of the two alleged radicals revolved around events leading up to last june 's group of eight summit of highly industrialized nations in germany .
the two suspected radicals were thought to have been planning to create a terrorist organization . ndr 's journalist has reported on political extremism in his work for years , and his research on the phone may have lead to links involving the two police suspects . according to the tagesschau reporter , who was permitted to look into the police file on his telephone conversations , the calls ' content was in no way connected to police investigations , but instead , concerned more editorial and journalistic matters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a prosecutor said the police ca n't always tell what will be important to a case authorities have also allegedly listened in on conversations among some journalists working for berlin 's daily tagesspiegel , according to an ard report .

but would that secure his position for euro 2008 ? jens lehmann may be top dog for germany at the moment , but he 's barely even second fiddle for english club arsenal .
he has n't played a match for the gunners since early this season , and that 's raised the question of whether germany should stay true to a keeper who 's not on the pitch week in and week out . " i would like to play again as soon as possible , " lehmann told the german soccer magazine kicker on monday , nov .
12 .
" the bundesliga is attractive and always an option - perhaps even in the second division .
in any case , i want to go to euro 2008 .
playing there was always my goal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann may not have too many matches left in an arsenal uniform the 38-year-old lehmann was effectively demoted at arsenal after a bad mistake against blackburn in august cost the gunners points .
at the time , the club claimed he had an elbow injury , but he 's now clearly become second choice to spaniard manuel almunia . with arsenal undefeated , leading the premiership and already through to the knock-out round of the champions league , no one in london is clamoring for lehmann 's return .
gunners ' coach arsene wenger said he still considers the german a valuable part of the team , but the moody keeper probably did n't help his cause in a recent televised outburst in which he accused wenger of " humiliating him . " the stand-off has led many soccer experts in germany to say lehmann needs to change clubs - or germany needs to change starting keepers . uncertainties abound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german number two , timo hildebrand , has also had problems german national coach joachim löw plans to start lehmann in germany 's match this weekend against cyprus .
but he says he also intends to review the situation at year 's end . " we always said we would sit down and discuss the situation during the winter break , " löw told the german sports agency sid .
" he knows it will be difficult to play in the european championship if he has n't played for his club eight months before that . " a new club could solve that dilemma , but it is unclear where lehmann would go .
none of the bundesliga 's first-division clubs have an obvious need for a new goalkeeper , and thus far none of the bigger second-division teams has indicated an interest in taking on lehmann 's salary . it is equally unclear , however , who would take over if lehmann should fail to find a home and lose his starting job for germany .
germany 's number two , timo hildebrand , has hard a hard time establishing himself at valencia and has let in a lot of goals when he has played . meanwhile germany 's current third choice , robert enke , plays for middle-of-the-pack hanover and has never really been tested at the international level . youth solution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's neuer might get a call-up it 's ironic that germany has a question mark between the posts .
the country continues to churn out high-quality goalkeepers , and a number of national sides - most notably england - would leap at the chance to nominate any of the regular net-minders in the bundesliga . in essence , germany is spoilt for choice , and that 's led some commentators to suggest that one of the country 's younger keepers be promoted to the national team . schalke 's manuel neuer has often been mooted .
the 21-year-old was voted the bundesliga 's best keeper last season but has been hit by a couple of high-profile mistakes lately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's adler could also be an option another option would be 22-year-old rene adler of leverkusen .
he 's impressed everyone this season and put on another terrific performance against wolfsburg in his side 's last match . should lehmann fail to find playing time , neuer or adler could find himself in possession of an unexpected ticket to euro 2008 . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the stand-off has led many soccer experts in germany to say lehmann needs to change clubs - or germany needs to change starting keepers . uncertainties abound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german number two , timo hildebrand , has also had problems german national coach joachim löw plans to start lehmann in germany 's match this weekend against cyprus .
but he says he also intends to review the situation at year 's end . " we always said we would sit down and discuss the situation during the winter break , " löw told the german sports agency sid .
" he knows it will be difficult to play in the european championship if he has n't played for his club eight months before that . " a new club could solve that dilemma , but it is unclear where lehmann would go .
none of the bundesliga 's first-division clubs have an obvious need for a new goalkeeper , and thus far none of the bigger second-division teams has indicated an interest in taking on lehmann 's salary . it is equally unclear , however , who would take over if lehmann should fail to find a home and lose his starting job for germany .
germany 's number two , timo hildebrand , has hard a hard time establishing himself at valencia and has let in a lot of goals when he has played . meanwhile germany 's current third choice , robert enke , plays for middle-of-the-pack hanover and has never really been tested at the international level . youth solution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's neuer might get a call-up it 's ironic that germany has a question mark between the posts .
the country continues to churn out high-quality goalkeepers , and a number of national sides - most notably england - would leap at the chance to nominate any of the regular net-minders in the bundesliga . in essence , germany is spoilt for choice , and that 's led some commentators to suggest that one of the country 's younger keepers be promoted to the national team . schalke 's manuel neuer has often been mooted .
the 21-year-old was voted the bundesliga 's best keeper last season but has been hit by a couple of high-profile mistakes lately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's adler could also be an option another option would be 22-year-old rene adler of leverkusen .
he 's impressed everyone this season and put on another terrific performance against wolfsburg in his side 's last match . should lehmann fail to find playing time , neuer or adler could find himself in possession of an unexpected ticket to euro 2008 . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the waterway between russia and ukraine is an important migration route for birds and home to the black sea porpoise . high winds have caused helicopters to be grounded , but clean-up efforts by russian and ukrainian soldiers and civilians are continuing with use vehicles along beaches .
the interfax news agency reported that about 200 tons of oil had been removed from the water by midday on tuesday . on the weekend , the 100 kph -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- gales that causing the tanker to split also prompted four other ships to sink and drove another 15 vessels aground . sailors still missing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ships battled high seas as a winter storm slammed into the crimean peninsula sunday rescuers saved 36 other crew members from the shipwrecks on sunday .
but 20 sailors were still missing from the wrecks , while the bodies of three were washed ashore on monday on the tuzla spit , near the maritime border between russia and ex-soviet ukraine . " the clean-up of the water is going to take six months , and a complete clean-up of the coastal areas is going to take decades , " environmentalist aleksander minin told dpa news agency . thousands of bird have died regional governor alexander tkachyov told afp news agency that 30,000 birds had already died . on the tuzla spit , near the location of the spill , an afp reporter saw some 200 emergency workers , soldiers and volunteers shoveling sand and seaweed caked with fuel oil into trucks . " we 're clearing up the shore and the water and we 're pumping oil out from a tanker damaged in the storm , " oleg mitvol , deputy head of the russian government 's environmental monitoring agency , told afp . " if that 2,000-ton spill moves further into the sea of azov , there will be serious environmental consequences , " mitvol added .

" some of these petroleum products can sink to levels in the water , particularly those without oxygen , and they will not dissolve , and just stay there for dozens of years , " he explained to dpa . sergei golubchikov , an environmental scientist , also told dpa that dozens of kilometers of seashore had been or soon would be polluted . the largest section was last reported to be in the middle of kerch strait and slowly drifting toward the russian shoreline . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in certain circumstances , the telephone conversations of lawyers , journalists and doctors may also be bugged . currently , some journalists say police have already been listening into their conversations . according to the tagesschau online portal of german public broadcaster ard , police have eavesdropped on conversations of two journalists and two lawyers to pursue investigations of two suspected left-wing radicals . one of the journalists works for tagesschau , another works for public broadcaster norddeutscher rundfunk -lrb- ndr -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists said they they were pursuing research that had nothing to do with investigations ndr staff were able to review the transcriptions of its reporter 's telephone conversations with sources in northern germany .
according to the files , the schleswig-holstein state office of criminal investigation was commissioned by the federal prosecutor 's office in karlsruhe to listen in on the ndr journalist . jobst plog , director of ndr , said that " should the suspicion against security officials be confirmed , it would be a massive assault on press freedom . " suspected of aiming to create terrorist organization according to ndr , federal prosecutors ' investigations of the two alleged radicals revolved around events leading up to last june 's group of eight summit of highly industrialized nations in germany .
the two suspected radicals were thought to have been planning to create a terrorist organization . ndr 's journalist has reported on political extremism in his work for years , and his research on the phone may have lead to links involving the two police suspects . according to the tagesschau reporter , who was permitted to look into the police file on his telephone conversations , the calls ' content was in no way connected to police investigations , but instead , concerned more editorial and journalistic matters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a prosecutor said the police ca n't always tell what will be important to a case authorities have also allegedly listened in on conversations among some journalists working for berlin 's daily tagesspiegel , according to an ard report .
the online portal of the daily tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- has also reported that some of its journalists ' conversations have been recorded . the taz reported that wire taps had been placed on the suspects ' phones , not those of journalists , but added that police should not have listened to the calls after it was clear the suspects were talking to journalists . " no malice intended " a spokesman for the federal prosecutor 's office told taz that officials would check into the allegations of eavesdropping , but said " no malice was intended . " he pointed out that telephone conversations are recorded by machines , and also said that police officers who transcribe the recordings can not always recognize what is " relevant to an investigation or not .

but not all the member states like the idea . the proposals would allow national regulators to split the network and retail divisions of providers deemed to have too much influence .
they also foresee giving brussels the ability to overturn national regulators ' decisions and would create an eu telecommunications watchdog organization . " from today onwards , a single market without borders for europe 's telecoms operators and consumers is not only a dream , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in a statement introducing the proposals on tuesday , nov .

" -lsb- the reform -rsb- will increase competition , leading to more innovation and investments , and it will help european citizens to get the most out of modern communication systems . " reding also said the shake-up would " revolutionize europe 's telecom 's sector and help it compete better with other continents in terms of globalization . " industry analysts said the measures are aimed primarily at curbing the influence of giant former-monopoly companies like germany 's deutsche telekom , which sharply criticized the plan . " the proposals of the commission will hinder investments of billions , " deutsche telekom said in a statement . long way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plans do n't sit well with big companies like telekom the new rules , which could take effect by the end of 2009 , have to be approved by the governments and parliaments of eu member states .
analysts said it 's highly unlikely that countries like germany , france and spain will let the plans go through in their current form . " reticence is warranted , " the german economy ministry said in a terse statement . critics , many of whom work for companies such as deutsche telekom , say the proposal would decrease investment in emerging technologies by increasing uncertainty on the market .
there is also resistance to the idea of giving even more power to brussels . " instead of helping get rid of the current competition problems , the new proposals needlessly risk hurting competition and will inevitably lead to more bureaucracy , decreased efficiency and loss of power for national regulators , as well as the elimination of jobs , " jürgen grützner , head of the german association of telecommunications and service providers , told the ap news agency . but representatives of new companies that compete with former monopolies welcomed the measures , saying that they would bolster competition and increase investment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 13.11.2007 lehmann willing to drop down a division for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann 's benching has created an issue for germany jens lehmann has told a german soccer magazine that he would transfer to a second-division club in a bid to retain his status as germany 's starting keeper .
but would that secure his position for euro 2008 ? jens lehmann may be top dog for germany at the moment , but he 's barely even second fiddle for english club arsenal .
he has n't played a match for the gunners since early this season , and that 's raised the question of whether germany should stay true to a keeper who 's not on the pitch week in and week out . " i would like to play again as soon as possible , " lehmann told the german soccer magazine kicker on monday , nov .
12 .
" the bundesliga is attractive and always an option - perhaps even in the second division .
in any case , i want to go to euro 2008 .
playing there was always my goal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann may not have too many matches left in an arsenal uniform the 38-year-old lehmann was effectively demoted at arsenal after a bad mistake against blackburn in august cost the gunners points .
at the time , the club claimed he had an elbow injury , but he 's now clearly become second choice to spaniard manuel almunia . with arsenal undefeated , leading the premiership and already through to the knock-out round of the champions league , no one in london is clamoring for lehmann 's return .
gunners ' coach arsene wenger said he still considers the german a valuable part of the team , but the moody keeper probably did n't help his cause in a recent televised outburst in which he accused wenger of " humiliating him . " the stand-off has led many soccer experts in germany to say lehmann needs to change clubs - or germany needs to change starting keepers . uncertainties abound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german number two , timo hildebrand , has also had problems german national coach joachim löw plans to start lehmann in germany 's match this weekend against cyprus .
but he says he also intends to review the situation at year 's end . " we always said we would sit down and discuss the situation during the winter break , " löw told the german sports agency sid .
" he knows it will be difficult to play in the european championship if he has n't played for his club eight months before that . " a new club could solve that dilemma , but it is unclear where lehmann would go .
none of the bundesliga 's first-division clubs have an obvious need for a new goalkeeper , and thus far none of the bigger second-division teams has indicated an interest in taking on lehmann 's salary . it is equally unclear , however , who would take over if lehmann should fail to find a home and lose his starting job for germany .
germany 's number two , timo hildebrand , has hard a hard time establishing himself at valencia and has let in a lot of goals when he has played . meanwhile germany 's current third choice , robert enke , plays for middle-of-the-pack hanover and has never really been tested at the international level . youth solution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's neuer might get a call-up it 's ironic that germany has a question mark between the posts .
the country continues to churn out high-quality goalkeepers , and a number of national sides - most notably england - would leap at the chance to nominate any of the regular net-minders in the bundesliga . in essence , germany is spoilt for choice , and that 's led some commentators to suggest that one of the country 's younger keepers be promoted to the national team . schalke 's manuel neuer has often been mooted .
the 21-year-old was voted the bundesliga 's best keeper last season but has been hit by a couple of high-profile mistakes lately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's adler could also be an option another option would be 22-year-old rene adler of leverkusen .
he 's impressed everyone this season and put on another terrific performance against wolfsburg in his side 's last match . should lehmann fail to find playing time , neuer or adler could find himself in possession of an unexpected ticket to euro 2008 . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but would that secure his position for euro 2008 ? jens lehmann may be top dog for germany at the moment , but he 's barely even second fiddle for english club arsenal .
he has n't played a match for the gunners since early this season , and that 's raised the question of whether germany should stay true to a keeper who 's not on the pitch week in and week out . " i would like to play again as soon as possible , " lehmann told the german soccer magazine kicker on monday , nov .
12 .
" the bundesliga is attractive and always an option - perhaps even in the second division .
in any case , i want to go to euro 2008 .
playing there was always my goal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann may not have too many matches left in an arsenal uniform the 38-year-old lehmann was effectively demoted at arsenal after a bad mistake against blackburn in august cost the gunners points .
at the time , the club claimed he had an elbow injury , but he 's now clearly become second choice to spaniard manuel almunia . with arsenal undefeated , leading the premiership and already through to the knock-out round of the champions league , no one in london is clamoring for lehmann 's return .
gunners ' coach arsene wenger said he still considers the german a valuable part of the team , but the moody keeper probably did n't help his cause in a recent televised outburst in which he accused wenger of " humiliating him . " the stand-off has led many soccer experts in germany to say lehmann needs to change clubs - or germany needs to change starting keepers . uncertainties abound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german number two , timo hildebrand , has also had problems german national coach joachim löw plans to start lehmann in germany 's match this weekend against cyprus .
but he says he also intends to review the situation at year 's end . " we always said we would sit down and discuss the situation during the winter break , " löw told the german sports agency sid .
" he knows it will be difficult to play in the european championship if he has n't played for his club eight months before that . " a new club could solve that dilemma , but it is unclear where lehmann would go .
none of the bundesliga 's first-division clubs have an obvious need for a new goalkeeper , and thus far none of the bigger second-division teams has indicated an interest in taking on lehmann 's salary . it is equally unclear , however , who would take over if lehmann should fail to find a home and lose his starting job for germany .
germany 's number two , timo hildebrand , has hard a hard time establishing himself at valencia and has let in a lot of goals when he has played . meanwhile germany 's current third choice , robert enke , plays for middle-of-the-pack hanover and has never really been tested at the international level . youth solution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's neuer might get a call-up it 's ironic that germany has a question mark between the posts .
the country continues to churn out high-quality goalkeepers , and a number of national sides - most notably england - would leap at the chance to nominate any of the regular net-minders in the bundesliga . in essence , germany is spoilt for choice , and that 's led some commentators to suggest that one of the country 's younger keepers be promoted to the national team . schalke 's manuel neuer has often been mooted .
the 21-year-old was voted the bundesliga 's best keeper last season but has been hit by a couple of high-profile mistakes lately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's adler could also be an option another option would be 22-year-old rene adler of leverkusen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 13.11.2007 lehmann willing to drop down a division for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann 's benching has created an issue for germany jens lehmann has told a german soccer magazine that he would transfer to a second-division club in a bid to retain his status as germany 's starting keeper .
but would that secure his position for euro 2008 ? jens lehmann may be top dog for germany at the moment , but he 's barely even second fiddle for english club arsenal .
he has n't played a match for the gunners since early this season , and that 's raised the question of whether germany should stay true to a keeper who 's not on the pitch week in and week out . " i would like to play again as soon as possible , " lehmann told the german soccer magazine kicker on monday , nov .
12 .
" the bundesliga is attractive and always an option - perhaps even in the second division .
in any case , i want to go to euro 2008 .
playing there was always my goal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann may not have too many matches left in an arsenal uniform the 38-year-old lehmann was effectively demoted at arsenal after a bad mistake against blackburn in august cost the gunners points .
at the time , the club claimed he had an elbow injury , but he 's now clearly become second choice to spaniard manuel almunia . with arsenal undefeated , leading the premiership and already through to the knock-out round of the champions league , no one in london is clamoring for lehmann 's return .
gunners ' coach arsene wenger said he still considers the german a valuable part of the team , but the moody keeper probably did n't help his cause in a recent televised outburst in which he accused wenger of " humiliating him . " the stand-off has led many soccer experts in germany to say lehmann needs to change clubs - or germany needs to change starting keepers . uncertainties abound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german number two , timo hildebrand , has also had problems german national coach joachim löw plans to start lehmann in germany 's match this weekend against cyprus .
but he says he also intends to review the situation at year 's end . " we always said we would sit down and discuss the situation during the winter break , " löw told the german sports agency sid .
" he knows it will be difficult to play in the european championship if he has n't played for his club eight months before that . " a new club could solve that dilemma , but it is unclear where lehmann would go .
none of the bundesliga 's first-division clubs have an obvious need for a new goalkeeper , and thus far none of the bigger second-division teams has indicated an interest in taking on lehmann 's salary . it is equally unclear , however , who would take over if lehmann should fail to find a home and lose his starting job for germany .
germany 's number two , timo hildebrand , has hard a hard time establishing himself at valencia and has let in a lot of goals when he has played . meanwhile germany 's current third choice , robert enke , plays for middle-of-the-pack hanover and has never really been tested at the international level . youth solution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's neuer might get a call-up it 's ironic that germany has a question mark between the posts .
the country continues to churn out high-quality goalkeepers , and a number of national sides - most notably england - would leap at the chance to nominate any of the regular net-minders in the bundesliga . in essence , germany is spoilt for choice , and that 's led some commentators to suggest that one of the country 's younger keepers be promoted to the national team . schalke 's manuel neuer has often been mooted .
the 21-year-old was voted the bundesliga 's best keeper last season but has been hit by a couple of high-profile mistakes lately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's adler could also be an option another option would be 22-year-old rene adler of leverkusen .
he 's impressed everyone this season and put on another terrific performance against wolfsburg in his side 's last match . should lehmann fail to find playing time , neuer or adler could find himself in possession of an unexpected ticket to euro 2008 . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in certain circumstances , the telephone conversations of lawyers , journalists and doctors may also be bugged . currently , some journalists say police have already been listening into their conversations . according to the tagesschau online portal of german public broadcaster ard , police have eavesdropped on conversations of two journalists and two lawyers to pursue investigations of two suspected left-wing radicals . one of the journalists works for tagesschau , another works for public broadcaster norddeutscher rundfunk -lrb- ndr -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists said they they were pursuing research that had nothing to do with investigations ndr staff were able to review the transcriptions of its reporter 's telephone conversations with sources in northern germany .
according to the files , the schleswig-holstein state office of criminal investigation was commissioned by the federal prosecutor 's office in karlsruhe to listen in on the ndr journalist . jobst plog , director of ndr , said that " should the suspicion against security officials be confirmed , it would be a massive assault on press freedom . " suspected of aiming to create terrorist organization according to ndr , federal prosecutors ' investigations of the two alleged radicals revolved around events leading up to last june 's group of eight summit of highly industrialized nations in germany .
the two suspected radicals were thought to have been planning to create a terrorist organization . ndr 's journalist has reported on political extremism in his work for years , and his research on the phone may have lead to links involving the two police suspects . according to the tagesschau reporter , who was permitted to look into the police file on his telephone conversations , the calls ' content was in no way connected to police investigations , but instead , concerned more editorial and journalistic matters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a prosecutor said the police ca n't always tell what will be important to a case authorities have also allegedly listened in on conversations among some journalists working for berlin 's daily tagesspiegel , according to an ard report .
the online portal of the daily tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- has also reported that some of its journalists ' conversations have been recorded . the taz reported that wire taps had been placed on the suspects ' phones , not those of journalists , but added that police should not have listened to the calls after it was clear the suspects were talking to journalists . " no malice intended " a spokesman for the federal prosecutor 's office told taz that officials would check into the allegations of eavesdropping , but said " no malice was intended . " he pointed out that telephone conversations are recorded by machines , and also said that police officers who transcribe the recordings can not always recognize what is " relevant to an investigation or not .

demands for independence are heating up , even as the international community is divided on whether it 's good for the region . time is running out for an agreement on kosovo .
the troika of the european union , the united states and russia overseeing current talks on kosovo has made no progress and is up against a dec .
10 deadline set by the united nations to issue its final report .
the us has continued to advocate independence while russia opposes it and europe remains divided on the issue . the eu has promised that the troika will take a " more proactive attitude " in negotiating with serbia and kosovo , a spokeswoman for the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana said monday , nov .
12 .
not only that , but the troika will present concrete proposals next week to bridge the impasse , the spokeswoman said . independent streak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has administered kosovo since 1999 but experts wonder if it will be enough after many rounds of negotiations have failed to find a compromise and both the serbian and kosovar fronts look hardened . " preserving kosovo and the serb republic -lsb- the eastern half of bosnia-herzegovina -rsb- are now the most important goals of our state and national policy , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica told reuters news agency last week . there are some signs that kosovo 's albanian politicians , increasingly calling for independence in recent weeks , are running out of patience after years of negotiations . prime minister agim ceku said kosovo was willing to wait until december before unilaterally declaring independence , but not much longer . " it is better to ask for an apology than for permission , " ceku said in an interview last week with the new york times .
" the time for a decision has come . " veton surroi , a member of the kosovo albanian 's negotiating team and leader of the opposition ora party , also said he 's unwilling to wait on washington much longer . " kosovo 's assembly should set the independence date before christmas , " surroi told the balkan investigative reporting network recently . campaign rhetoric heats up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pristina is a city in limbo some of the recent calls for independence can be attributed to the country 's upcoming elections , which will take place saturday . " it 's mainly campaign rhetoric , " said ilir dugolli , a senior researcher at the pristina-based kosovar institute for policy research and development -lrb- kipred -rrb- , of the calls for independence .
" but there 's anxiety as well . " judging from the broad public support for independence , politicians are wise to reiterate their demand for it , he said .
independence is a plank in all of kosovo 's major political parties ' platforms and is consistently supported by well over 90 percent of the kosovo albanian population , polls have shown . far-reaching consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writing is on the wall ?
this one says " no negotiations - self determination " any compromise short of independence would be a " very bitter pill to swallow " for most politicians , dugolli said , adding that the longer it takes , the more politicians will feel under pressure to give up on the negotiating process . russia has been the main international opponent of allowing the mainly muslim kosovo independence from orthodox serbia .
moscow is afraid it would encourage separatist movements in georgia , chechnya or even the basque region of spain . but a " domino theory " is a little bit too simplistic for such a complex region , said christophe solioz , an expert on kosovo at the center for european integration strategies -lrb- ceis -rrb- . a complex history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a funeral ceremony for 30 kosovo albanians killed during the 1998-99 war that killed thousands kosovo came under un administration in 1999 , a result of the fighting and ethnic cleansing that marked the breakup of yugoslavia .
russia supports serbia 's claim to the region of 2 million , which contains ethnic serbian enclaves .
europe is divided on the issue with several countries , including greece , cyprus , and romania , refusing to recognize kosovo without a un security council agreement . eu diplomats are currently working to get consensus within the bloc on how to react if kosovo were to declare independence , said center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- analyst gergana noutcheva . in the european union , which recently reported on rampant corruption and organized crime in kosovo , the official line remains support for a negotiated settlement .
but some countries are trying to move the bloc towards acknowledging that kosovo independence is the only thing that will bring security and stability to the region , noutcheva said . while kosovo albanian politicians have said they wo n't accept anything less than full independence , " this could also be a bargaining position , " noutcheva said .
" of course they will insist on full independence until the very end .
that is not to say that this is what will happen . " hong kong , germany possible examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demand self-determination , will it come in 2020 ?
while no proposals have officially been announced , insiders say several compromises are under discussion .
one possible scenario - a variation of which was proposed by serbia - uses hong kong as a model .
kosovo would be under serbian rule , but would have extensive self-government rights .
in 2020 , kosovo would then be allowed to vote in a referendum on whether to gain full independence . another idea the troika has discussed , according to diplomats , is a variation of the agreement reached between the two germanys in 1972 , known as the grundlagenvertrag , or basic treaty .
in this treaty , west germany recognized the existence of the german democratic republic in everything but law . eu envoy wolfgang ischinger " is looking for models on which to draw inspiration , " one diplomat told the afp news agency , on condition of anonymity .
" he has found a certain inspiration in this very particular case of the two germanys . " whatever the inspiration , solioz of ceis said a compromise is essential in kosovo .
he said kosovo should be given special status as an eu region with a referendum date set for 2020 . " sooner or later you ca n't play any games anymore , " solioz said .

europe is divided on the issue with several countries , including greece , cyprus , and romania , refusing to recognize kosovo without a un security council agreement . eu diplomats are currently working to get consensus within the bloc on how to react if kosovo were to declare independence , said center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- analyst gergana noutcheva . in the european union , which recently reported on rampant corruption and organized crime in kosovo , the official line remains support for a negotiated settlement .
but some countries are trying to move the bloc towards acknowledging that kosovo independence is the only thing that will bring security and stability to the region , noutcheva said . while kosovo albanian politicians have said they wo n't accept anything less than full independence , " this could also be a bargaining position , " noutcheva said .
" of course they will insist on full independence until the very end .
that is not to say that this is what will happen . " hong kong , germany possible examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demand self-determination , will it come in 2020 ?
while no proposals have officially been announced , insiders say several compromises are under discussion .
one possible scenario - a variation of which was proposed by serbia - uses hong kong as a model .
kosovo would be under serbian rule , but would have extensive self-government rights .
in 2020 , kosovo would then be allowed to vote in a referendum on whether to gain full independence . another idea the troika has discussed , according to diplomats , is a variation of the agreement reached between the two germanys in 1972 , known as the grundlagenvertrag , or basic treaty .
in this treaty , west germany recognized the existence of the german democratic republic in everything but law . eu envoy wolfgang ischinger " is looking for models on which to draw inspiration , " one diplomat told the afp news agency , on condition of anonymity .
" he has found a certain inspiration in this very particular case of the two germanys . " whatever the inspiration , solioz of ceis said a compromise is essential in kosovo .
he said kosovo should be given special status as an eu region with a referendum date set for 2020 . " sooner or later you ca n't play any games anymore , " solioz said .

demands for independence are heating up , even as the international community is divided on whether it 's good for the region . time is running out for an agreement on kosovo .
the troika of the european union , the united states and russia overseeing current talks on kosovo has made no progress and is up against a dec .
10 deadline set by the united nations to issue its final report .
the us has continued to advocate independence while russia opposes it and europe remains divided on the issue . the eu has promised that the troika will take a " more proactive attitude " in negotiating with serbia and kosovo , a spokeswoman for the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana said monday , nov .
12 .
not only that , but the troika will present concrete proposals next week to bridge the impasse , the spokeswoman said . independent streak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has administered kosovo since 1999 but experts wonder if it will be enough after many rounds of negotiations have failed to find a compromise and both the serbian and kosovar fronts look hardened . " preserving kosovo and the serb republic -lsb- the eastern half of bosnia-herzegovina -rsb- are now the most important goals of our state and national policy , " serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica told reuters news agency last week . there are some signs that kosovo 's albanian politicians , increasingly calling for independence in recent weeks , are running out of patience after years of negotiations . prime minister agim ceku said kosovo was willing to wait until december before unilaterally declaring independence , but not much longer . " it is better to ask for an apology than for permission , " ceku said in an interview last week with the new york times .
" the time for a decision has come . " veton surroi , a member of the kosovo albanian 's negotiating team and leader of the opposition ora party , also said he 's unwilling to wait on washington much longer .

" but there 's anxiety as well . " judging from the broad public support for independence , politicians are wise to reiterate their demand for it , he said .

this one says " no negotiations - self determination " any compromise short of independence would be a " very bitter pill to swallow " for most politicians , dugolli said , adding that the longer it takes , the more politicians will feel under pressure to give up on the negotiating process . russia has been the main international opponent of allowing the mainly muslim kosovo independence from orthodox serbia .

but not all the member states like the idea . the proposals would allow national regulators to split the network and retail divisions of providers deemed to have too much influence .
they also foresee giving brussels the ability to overturn national regulators ' decisions and would create an eu telecommunications watchdog organization . " from today onwards , a single market without borders for europe 's telecoms operators and consumers is not only a dream , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in a statement introducing the proposals on tuesday , nov .
13 . advocates said the changes are also needed to increase investment in sectors like broadband internet access and diversify the market , a step eu telecoms commissioner viviane reding said the regulations would make . revolutionary plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new plans would help people communicate better , reding said " the changes the commission is presenting today in the telecoms rules is bound to revolutionize the european telecoms sector , " she told reporters .
" -lsb- the reform -rsb- will increase competition , leading to more innovation and investments , and it will help european citizens to get the most out of modern communication systems . " reding also said the shake-up would " revolutionize europe 's telecom 's sector and help it compete better with other continents in terms of globalization . " industry analysts said the measures are aimed primarily at curbing the influence of giant former-monopoly companies like germany 's deutsche telekom , which sharply criticized the plan . " the proposals of the commission will hinder investments of billions , " deutsche telekom said in a statement . long way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plans do n't sit well with big companies like telekom the new rules , which could take effect by the end of 2009 , have to be approved by the governments and parliaments of eu member states .
analysts said it 's highly unlikely that countries like germany , france and spain will let the plans go through in their current form . " reticence is warranted , " the german economy ministry said in a terse statement . critics , many of whom work for companies such as deutsche telekom , say the proposal would decrease investment in emerging technologies by increasing uncertainty on the market .
there is also resistance to the idea of giving even more power to brussels . " instead of helping get rid of the current competition problems , the new proposals needlessly risk hurting competition and will inevitably lead to more bureaucracy , decreased efficiency and loss of power for national regulators , as well as the elimination of jobs , " jürgen grützner , head of the german association of telecommunications and service providers , told the ap news agency . but representatives of new companies that compete with former monopolies welcomed the measures , saying that they would bolster competition and increase investment . " it 's very good news for competition and for investments in high speed broadband , " ilsa godlovitch of the european competitive telecommunications association ecta , which represents smaller telecommunication companies , told reuters . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato said there is no evidence of abuse . amnesty international said no safeguards exist to ensure that detainees turned over to afghan authorities are safe from abuse .
amnesty urged the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- to stop prisoner transfers immediately .
the report named afghanistan 's national directorate of security -lrb- nds -rrb- as a major offender , saying prisoners were exposed to whipping , beatings , food deprivation and exposure to extreme cold .
the agency " currently poses a serious threat to those in its custody , " the amnesty report said .
isaf has 40,000 troops in afghanistan from 37 countries .
britain , canada , denmark , the netherlands and norway have signed agreements on prisoner transfers , according to amnesty .
germany , belgium , france and sweden are considering similar measures .
agreements not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf has 40,000 troops in afghanistan the report , which was released tuesday , nov .
13 , detailed allegations of afghan torture of several detainees handed over by canadian troops to the nds .
the agreements do not exempt countries from their obligations towards prisoners , claudio cordone , amnesty 's senior research director , told reuters .
" these agreements are supposed to ensure that detainees are treated in accordance with international standards but have proved to be inadequate , " he said . " such transfers should be suspended until effective safeguards are in place . "
the german government was also criticized for not providing any information on prisoners it hands over to the afghans .
the ministry of defense refuses to release the exact number or whereabouts of prisoners , said barbara lochbihler , who heads amnesty international in germany .
this makes it impossible to monitor treatment .
amnesty said the agreements isaf countries have with afghanistan do not prevent detainees from being put in situations where they could face " torture or other ill-treatment . "
safeguards lacking for prisoner transfers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty wants more training for afghan prison staff isaf is providing support for president hamid karzai 's weak central government .
but a taliban-led insurgency continues .
amnesty called on isaf to declare an immediate " moratorium on any further transfers of detainees to the afghan authorities and -lsb- to -rsb- take responsibility for the custody of such detainees until effective safeguards against torture and other ill-treatment are introduced in the afghan detention system . "
agreements alone would not guarantee prisoners ' proper treatment by afghan authorities , amnesty said , adding that isaf also needed to help train afghan prison staff and reform the detention system .
all prisons should allow independent monitors to check on the conditions , and the nds also needed reform , the group said .
nato rebuffs criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is part of the nato peacekeeping force nato spokesman james appathurai said the military alliance has no evidence of prisoner abuse and no plans to build jails .
" nato has no proof of ill treatment or of torture of detainees that its forces have transferred to the afghans , " he said .
" it 's true there are concerns .
this is precisely why the allies have invested , and a lot , in the reform of the afghan institutions , including the nds .
it 's the only appropriate and acceptable way to improve the situation . "

nato said there is no evidence of abuse . amnesty international said no safeguards exist to ensure that detainees turned over to afghan authorities are safe from abuse .
amnesty urged the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- to stop prisoner transfers immediately .
the report named afghanistan 's national directorate of security -lrb- nds -rrb- as a major offender , saying prisoners were exposed to whipping , beatings , food deprivation and exposure to extreme cold .
the agency " currently poses a serious threat to those in its custody , " the amnesty report said .
isaf has 40,000 troops in afghanistan from 37 countries .
britain , canada , denmark , the netherlands and norway have signed agreements on prisoner transfers , according to amnesty .
germany , belgium , france and sweden are considering similar measures .
agreements not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf has 40,000 troops in afghanistan the report , which was released tuesday , nov .
13 , detailed allegations of afghan torture of several detainees handed over by canadian troops to the nds .
the agreements do not exempt countries from their obligations towards prisoners , claudio cordone , amnesty 's senior research director , told reuters .
" these agreements are supposed to ensure that detainees are treated in accordance with international standards but have proved to be inadequate , " he said . " such transfers should be suspended until effective safeguards are in place . "
the german government was also criticized for not providing any information on prisoners it hands over to the afghans .
the ministry of defense refuses to release the exact number or whereabouts of prisoners , said barbara lochbihler , who heads amnesty international in germany .
this makes it impossible to monitor treatment .
amnesty said the agreements isaf countries have with afghanistan do not prevent detainees from being put in situations where they could face " torture or other ill-treatment . "
safeguards lacking for prisoner transfers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty wants more training for afghan prison staff isaf is providing support for president hamid karzai 's weak central government .
but a taliban-led insurgency continues .
amnesty called on isaf to declare an immediate " moratorium on any further transfers of detainees to the afghan authorities and -lsb- to -rsb- take responsibility for the custody of such detainees until effective safeguards against torture and other ill-treatment are introduced in the afghan detention system . "
agreements alone would not guarantee prisoners ' proper treatment by afghan authorities , amnesty said , adding that isaf also needed to help train afghan prison staff and reform the detention system .
all prisons should allow independent monitors to check on the conditions , and the nds also needed reform , the group said .

the health alcohol alliance says 13 children are admitted to hospital every day as a result of britain 's growing alcohol misuse .
it wants tv adverts for alcohol banned before 9pm and stronger health warnings to be placed on promotional material .
ministers said concerted action was planned to address alcohol problems .
graph showing price of drink against alcohol-related deaths the alliance has been formed by medical organisations and charities to increase pressure on the government to curb excessive drinking and provide more resources for alcohol-related health problems .
it calls for the government to adopt a twin strategy of increasing tax and reducing the easy availability of alcohol .
if you look at the burden of damage to society , it 's hugely greater for alcohol than for drugs .
professor ian gilmore royal college of physicians young addicts beat the bottle send us your comments the alliance says increasing the price of alcohol by 10 % could cut all alcohol-related deaths by between 10 % and 30 % .
its get tough on alcohol message is echoed in a report published on tuesday by the nuffield council on bioethics , which also proposes raising prices and restricting pub opening hours .
the charity alcohol concern said the price of all alcohol in shops has barely changed since the mid-1990s - with some wines and lagers becoming cheaper .
at the same time licensing laws have been relaxed , allowing longer opening hours for many pubs and bars .
any move to increase taxes on alcohol is likely to meet with strong resistance from industry groups .
even before the launch of the alliance , five drinks industry bodies have written a joint letter warning that the campaign could make matters worse , based on the experiences of other countries .
and the british beer and pub association says the uk has the second highest level of taxation on alcohol in europe , and raising prices through higher taxes would restrict consumer choice .
but professor ian gilmore , president of the royal college of physicians and chairman of the health alcohol alliance , said it was time to treat alcohol in a similar way to drugs .
" if you look at the burden of damage to society , it 's hugely greater for alcohol than for drugs , " he said .
" but the majority of money has always gone on drugs , partly because of the strong link to crime . "
hard to get help professor gilmore said that , in some parts of the country , doctors find it hard to get help for patients with alcohol-related problems , even though two thirds of people with a drug problem can access specific services .
he said the finnish experience - where health problems soared after alcohol tax was cut by 40 % - showed a hike in taxes was likely to have a positive effect .
the number of alcohol-related deaths has more than doubled from 4,144 in 1991 to 8,386 in 2005 .

the alcohol health alliance says the government should no longer rely on voluntary agreements with the alcohol industry to curb potentially harmful practices .
government strategy the government has recently beefed up its home office target for reducing harm from alcohol .
it has also introduced a cross-departmental alcohol strategy .
this includes a public information campaign to promote sensible drinking , an independent review of alcohol pricing and promotion , toughened enforcement of underage sales by retailers and plans to introduce more help for people who want to drink less .
dawn primarolo , the public health minister , said the government had introduced a comprehensive strategy to tackle problem drinking .
she said tax on alcohol in the uk was already the second highest in europe , and only about 1 % of pubs had extended opening hours since extended licensing laws were introduced .
a bigger problem was the discounting of prices by supermarkets and off licences .
she said : " we 're looking at where it 's available , who it 's available to , how it 's being marketed , what the targeting is and what we can do to give clear messages and to make those who are selling it responsible . "

" on monday i 'd get to school and i 'd think : i ca n't wait for friday to come so i can drink again , " he adds .
" friday and saturday nights were a way to escape by drinking and get away from all the stress of school .
i 'd live for the weekends .
" i 'd get an older person to buy it for me .
i 'd just stand outside the shop and they 'd get it for me .
" i 'd just sit in the park until about 0100 drinking .
my mum and dad were always asleep so i 'd just come in , have something to eat and go straight to bed so they never knew really what state i was coming home in . "
mike is now back at school .
he 's doing an apprenticeship to become a carpenter while studying for his gcses at the same time .
" i 'm just glad i do n't do it anymore , " he says .
" i 'm getting on back at school .

mr williams died in may , aged 50 , after a two-year battle against cancer .
the businessman 's village church in nearby berriew and a community centre near newtown are among those to benefit , each receiving £ 100,000 .
cancer research uk , which has been left £ 250,000 , is also remembered in his will .
but his legacy ensures a future for five organisations in his home village of berriew , near welshpool , and nearby dolfor , near newtown .
berriew 's community centre , recreation association , its st beuno 's church and dolfor community hall trust receives £ 100,000 each .
meanwhile , berriew 's pentre llifior methodist chapel has been given £ 20,000 .
st beuno 's church in berriew receives £ 100,000 in a statement , mr williams ' family said he was a modest and private person who built up a successful manufacturing business .
" he had a favourite saying that the success of his business was made through the efforts and hard work of local people and it seemed only right to him that local organisations should receive the benefits , " the family added .
former am glyn davies , who lives in berriew and founded the recreation association 30 years ago , said mr williams ' bequest was a " magnificent gesture " .
" this is a continuation of the sort of support haydn gave the village over many years , " said mr davies .
" this is a magnificent gesture on his part . "
he added : " his overriding quality was that he did not change even when he became successful .
he was always willing to share his good fortune . "
mr williams was managing director of welshpool firm technocover , which manufactures security doors and access chambers .
after losing his job in 1993 , he used his redundancy money to establish the company which now employs about 200 people , and is one of the fastest growing companies in the uk .
the firm sponsors welshpool town football club and newtown rugby club .

as a hospital doctor i see people in their twenties and thirties every month with liver disease .
more and more young people , especially young women , are developing this silent disease , often without the faintest idea their drinking was harmful .
however , with health scare stories abounding in the press every day , you could be forgiven for thinking that the only way to live a long and happy life is to give up all the things that make life so enjoyable in the first place .
drinking alcohol is very much part of our culture and therefore any health advice needs to be constructive rather than prohibitive or we all switch off .
so here are my top tips for safer drinking so that you can continue to have a good time but not suffer as a result : do know how much you are consuming ?
do you actually know how much alcohol you are consuming ?
current safe drinking guidelines recommend 14 units and 21 units weekly for women and men respectively but gone are the days when a glass of wine contained a unit and a pint of beer contained two .
the average bottle of wine contains nine units of alcohol meaning a large glass may contain as many as four , whilst strong draft beers contain four units a pint .
add up how many units you drank last night .
you may be surprised .
eat , drink and be merry drinking with food , as most europeans do , reduces the amount of alcohol you absorb , spreads the alcohol over an evening and is less likely to leave you feeling ghastly the next morning .
so do as the europeans do !
keep yourself watered alternating alcohol with water or soft drinks will reduce the amount of alcohol you consume , give you a longer fun evening out and protect you from the ravages of alcohol-induced dehydration .
ever thought you were dying the morning after ?
wonder why ?
during heavy drinking , the kidneys work hard to get rid of alcohol and its associated toxins and need to get rid of a lot of water to do so .
this leads to dehydration , headache and nausea .
by the end of the evening , those pints of water you drink just before going to bed are unlikely to be too much help ; the stomach , paralysed by the alcohol , may fail to absorb the water and sometimes you may see those bed time drinks again - the next morning .
give it a break the liver is an amazing organ so give it a rest .
from the production of antibodies to fight off infection to the processing of food to enable you to grow to its role as the waste disposal and detoxification unit within the body , the liver has a multitude of vital functions .
also , unlike other organs , the liver has the ability to re-grow or regenerate after suffering damage .
however , even it has its limits .
damage it too much and permanent scarring will occur and eventually it will fail .
so , have several days a week where you drink no alcohol to allow your liver to regenerate .
treat it well and it 'll last you a lifetime .
know when to stop worryingly , physical signs and symptoms of liver damage are almost always non-existent until the damage is irreversible .
by the time jaundice -lrb- yellowing of the eyes and skin -rrb- , swelling of the abdomen with fluid -lrb- ascites -rrb- , bleeding from the stomach or confusion -lrb- encephalopathy -rrb- occur , it may already be too late .
so if alcohol is affecting your home life , job , relationships or finances , its time to cut down .
if you 're worried , there is lots of health and advice out there so dealing with it now will be a great investment for your future .

too much can be bad news as a hospital doctor i see people in their twenties and thirties every month with liver disease .
more and more young people , especially young women , are developing this silent disease , often without the faintest idea their drinking was harmful .
however , with health scare stories abounding in the press every day , you could be forgiven for thinking that the only way to live a long and happy life is to give up all the things that make life so enjoyable in the first place .
drinking alcohol is very much part of our culture and therefore any health advice needs to be constructive rather than prohibitive or we all switch off .
so here are my top tips for safer drinking so that you can continue to have a good time but not suffer as a result : do know how much you are consuming ?
do you actually know how much alcohol you are consuming ?
current safe drinking guidelines recommend 14 units and 21 units weekly for women and men respectively but gone are the days when a glass of wine contained a unit and a pint of beer contained two .
the average bottle of wine contains nine units of alcohol meaning a large glass may contain as many as four , whilst strong draft beers contain four units a pint .
add up how many units you drank last night .
you may be surprised .
eat , drink and be merry drinking with food , as most europeans do , reduces the amount of alcohol you absorb , spreads the alcohol over an evening and is less likely to leave you feeling ghastly the next morning .
so do as the europeans do !
keep yourself watered alternating alcohol with water or soft drinks will reduce the amount of alcohol you consume , give you a longer fun evening out and protect you from the ravages of alcohol-induced dehydration .
ever thought you were dying the morning after ?
wonder why ?
during heavy drinking , the kidneys work hard to get rid of alcohol and its associated toxins and need to get rid of a lot of water to do so .
this leads to dehydration , headache and nausea .
by the end of the evening , those pints of water you drink just before going to bed are unlikely to be too much help ; the stomach , paralysed by the alcohol , may fail to absorb the water and sometimes you may see those bed time drinks again - the next morning .
give it a break the liver is an amazing organ so give it a rest .
from the production of antibodies to fight off infection to the processing of food to enable you to grow to its role as the waste disposal and detoxification unit within the body , the liver has a multitude of vital functions .
also , unlike other organs , the liver has the ability to re-grow or regenerate after suffering damage .
however , even it has its limits .
damage it too much and permanent scarring will occur and eventually it will fail .
so , have several days a week where you drink no alcohol to allow your liver to regenerate .
treat it well and it 'll last you a lifetime .
know when to stop worryingly , physical signs and symptoms of liver damage are almost always non-existent until the damage is irreversible .
by the time jaundice -lrb- yellowing of the eyes and skin -rrb- , swelling of the abdomen with fluid -lrb- ascites -rrb- , bleeding from the stomach or confusion -lrb- encephalopathy -rrb- occur , it may already be too late .
so if alcohol is affecting your home life , job , relationships or finances , its time to cut down .
if you 're worried , there is lots of health and advice out there so dealing with it now will be a great investment for your future .

researchers looked at 450 children - half of whom had adhd - and found an average delay of three years in the development of the cortex .
this , the brain 's outer mantle , is key for both attention and planning .
researchers say the proceedings of the national academy of sciences study may pave the way for new treatments .
the team from the national institute of mental health -lrb- nimh -rrb- looked at when and where the brain reached peak " thickness " , a marker of maturity .
among the 223 youngsters with adhd , half of 40,000 cortex sites examined reached peak thickness at 10.5 , compared to age 7.5 in a matched group without the disorder .
it will be a long time before we see the implications of their findings for clinical practice professor anita thapar but the researchers did find that despite the delay , the brain does follow a normal pattern of development .
" finding a normal pattern of cortex maturation , albeit delayed , in children with adhd should be reassuring to families and could help to explain why many youth eventually seem to grow out of the disorder , " said philip shaw , the lead researcher .
finding out why future studies will now look into why the delay happens , and examine ways of boosting recovery .
however uk experts warned that the findings do not indicate that children with adhd " catch up " after the three year delay , as the brains of children without the disorder will continue to advance .
" during these later stages of development the cortex of the brain gets thinner due to a process called pruning which occurs as the brain refines its connections and becomes more organized , " said dr david coghill of the university of dundee .
" so what will be happening is that whilst the children with adhd 's brains are still growing , the brains of the children without adhd are starting this process of pruning . "
this , he added , meant " adolescents with adhd remain behind on many of the important skills like memory , impulse control and planning " .
professor anita thapar of cardiff university school of medicine said the findings were " interesting and useful " .
" but it will be a long time before we see the implications of their findings for clinical practice " .

researchers looked at 450 children - half of whom had adhd - and found an average delay of three years in the development of the cortex .
this , the brain 's outer mantle , is key for both attention and planning .
researchers say the proceedings of the national academy of sciences study may pave the way for new treatments .
the team from the national institute of mental health -lrb- nimh -rrb- looked at when and where the brain reached peak " thickness " , a marker of maturity .
among the 223 youngsters with adhd , half of 40,000 cortex sites examined reached peak thickness at 10.5 , compared to age 7.5 in a matched group without the disorder .
it will be a long time before we see the implications of their findings for clinical practice professor anita thapar but the researchers did find that despite the delay , the brain does follow a normal pattern of development .
" finding a normal pattern of cortex maturation , albeit delayed , in children with adhd should be reassuring to families and could help to explain why many youth eventually seem to grow out of the disorder , " said philip shaw , the lead researcher .
finding out why future studies will now look into why the delay happens , and examine ways of boosting recovery .
however uk experts warned that the findings do not indicate that children with adhd " catch up " after the three year delay , as the brains of children without the disorder will continue to advance .
" during these later stages of development the cortex of the brain gets thinner due to a process called pruning which occurs as the brain refines its connections and becomes more organized , " said dr david coghill of the university of dundee .
" so what will be happening is that whilst the children with adhd 's brains are still growing , the brains of the children without adhd are starting this process of pruning . "
this , he added , meant " adolescents with adhd remain behind on many of the important skills like memory , impulse control and planning " .
professor anita thapar of cardiff university school of medicine said the findings were " interesting and useful " .
" but it will be a long time before we see the implications of their findings for clinical practice " .

the h5 strain was found in turkeys at redgrave park farm near diss .
all birds on the farm , which include ducks and geese , are to be slaughtered .
a 3km protection zone and a 10km surveillance zone have been set up .
the government could not yet confirm if the birds had the highly pathogenic h5n1 strain , a spokeswoman said .
police officers have been seen at the entrance to the farm , and vehicles are being sprayed with a jet hose . "
obviously this is another huge blow to the farming industry , which is still dealing with the effects of bluetongue and foot and mouth " national farmers ' union president latest blow for farmers reaction in quotes a statement issued by the department for environment food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- said that preliminary tests showed the turkeys had the h5 strain of bird flu .
it is not yet known whether it is h5n1 , which has killed some 200 people worldwide .
all birds are being slaughtered at the premises , and defra said it was consulting on what further measures may be needed .
it is expected that all the birds will be gassed and then put in sealed containers , officials said .
the birds include approximately 5,000 turkeys , 1,000 ducks and 500 geese , a defra spokeswoman added .
inside the zones , bird movements will be restricted and all birds must be housed or isolated from contact with wild birds .
all poultry keepers on the british poultry register will be notified and eu officials have been informed .
' huge blow ' geoffrey buchanan , operations director of redgrave poultry , which rents the farm , said that all employees at the site had been given antiviral drugs as a precaution .
he added that all the birds on the site were now indoors , and that he hoped this would be a contained outbreak .
national farmers ' union president peter kendall said : " obviously this is another huge blow to the farming industry , which is still dealing with the effects of bluetongue and foot-and-mouth . "
acting chief veterinary officer fred landeg said that laboratory results on what type of bird flu it was were expected " in the next 24 hours " .
defra officials said that 10 % of birds in one shed died over one night .
susan watts , science editor of the bbc 's newsnight , said that this would seem to suggest that the outbreak involved a highly pathogenic strain of the virus .
mr landeg told bbc radio 5live that the disease was discovered on sunday by a vet , who noticed that there had been an increasing number of deaths among turkeys in one of the five sheds on the farm .
results on monday morning showed that the flu was of the h5 type - but more tests were needed to ascertain whether it is the dangerous variant .
he said that the risk of bird flu spreading was increased during the autumn months because of wild bird migration .
mr landeg confirmed that the affected birds were free-range - meaning they had access to the outdoors and may have been of greater risk of catching the disease .
small proportion a statement released on behalf of poultry producer bernard matthews said the affected farm was not owned by the company , and none of the firm 's farms fell within the exclusion zone .
earlier this year bird flu was discovered at a bernard matthews turkey farm in suffolk .
more than 160,000 birds were killed after an outbreak of the virulent h5n1 strain of the disease on the farm in february .
the food standards agency reassured consumers that there was no threat to human health so long as eggs and poultry were properly cooked .
and national farmers ' union poultry board chairman charles bourns insisted that turkey supply over christmas would not be affected .
he added that the cull accounted for only a small proportion of the 10m festive turkeys sold each year .

this was followed by hull and barking and dangenham in london .
affluent areas , mostly in the south of england , were least likely to be affected .
copd is the uk 's fifth biggest killer , causing more deaths in england and wales than breast and prostate cancer combined .

" if people with copd can be diagnosed earlier , we could dramatically reduce the death rate and human suffering from this debilitating disease . "
health minister ann keen said copd was a priority for the nhs .
she said : " there are currently millions of people suffering with the disease in england .
" the department is making good progress with the development of a new national services framework -lrb- nsf -rrb- for patients with copd , working with healthcare professionals , such as nurse specialists , service users and carers , with publication scheduled for the end of next year .
" the nsf will help support improvements to care ensuring better management of the disease and wider choice of care for patients , where and when they want it . "

by chris summers bbc news simply carrying a gun now carries a mandatory minimum sentence of five years - so who does it and why ?
computer games - harmless fun or dangerous breeding ground ?
guns can provide an intoxicating and almost pornographic attraction to young men who often feel powerless , according to academics in the field .
last year a team of criminologists from portsmouth university researched gun crime in a project funded by the home office .
they interviewed 80 men in prison who had become involved in gun crime .
' power ' asked about what attracted him to guns , tommy , a london-born crack addict and armed robber , said : " the control , the power you have got when you have got that in your hand . "
that power was crudely illustrated at a recent trial at the old bailey .
gun criminals timy -lrb- left -rrb- and diamond babamuboni were convicted of manslaughter at the old bailey in december 2006 the trial was shown footage of timy , 15 , tormenting a friend with a gun they were sentenced as juveniles despite the police 's suspicions that they lied about their ages is it wrong to blame hip hop ?
the jury was shown footage from a mobile phone of a boy pointing a sawn-off shotgun at a terrified former friend who was forced to strip to his underpants as his tormentors laughed .
timy babamuboni , who was aged 15 , swore on the bible he was not the boy in the footage , but he was shown to be a liar and was later convicted of the manslaughter of a woman shot dead as she held a baby at a christening party in south london .
posturing gavin hales , a criminologist who led the portsmouth university study , said police frequently came across mobile phone footage of young men posturing with guns , which may be real or imitation .
in may this year police swooped on homes in ellesmere port , cheshire , after discovering footage of youths posturing with a weapon .
it turned out to be an imitation weapon .
things have changed a great deal since the 1960s and 1970s , when gun crime was generally restricted to armed robberies , usually by career criminals and often using shotguns .
boys from ellesmere port , cheshire , show off an imitation gun in the 1980s and 1990s the number of armed robberies fell away as more and more criminals moved into the drugs trade .
despite the 1997 ban on handguns - introduced after the dunblane massacre - the crooks increasingly favoured pistols and revolvers , which were easier to hide and more " fashionable " .
some politicians have pointed the finger at hollywood films , violent computer games and the posturing - often with guns - on hip-hop videos .
last year tory leader david cameron criticised bbc radio 1 for playing songs which he said " encouraged the carrying of guns and knives " .
average age falling in the past 15 years there has been a noticeable rise in black-on-black gun crime , which was recognised when the metropolitan police launched operation trident in response to appeals by the black community .
but despite mr cameron 's recent " anarchy in the uk " rhetoric , the problem pre-dates the labour government .
in march and april 1997 - under a conservative government - there were 10 murders by gun in england alone .
we have noticed for a couple of years now that the ages of people involved in gun crime is reducing and it 's something that we have been deeply concerned about det ch supt helen ball what does seem to have changed in the past decade is the average age of both offenders and victims , which has come down considerably .
the average age of the victims in those 10 murders in the spring of 1997 was 29 and the youngest was aged 19 .
ten years on , if you look at the gun deaths that took place in june and july 2007 the average age of the five victims had fallen to 25 and that falls to 20 if 47-year-old boxer james oyebola is excluded .
the advertising watchdog is investigating this film poster detective chief superintendent helen ball , who heads up operation trident , recently told bbc radio five live : " we have noticed for a couple of years now that the ages of people involved in gun crime is reducing and it 's something that we have been deeply concerned about and until we are able to tackle that trend i am not sure that we will be able to be confident in solving this problem . "
she said the proportion of victims who were teenagers had risen from 19 % to 31 % in the last four years .
she said there were many reasons for young people getting involved , but two significant factors were exclusion from school and copying the offending of older siblings .
lack of ' self-love ' the reverend nims obunge , the chief executive of the peace alliance , said many young people suffered from low self-esteem and this absence of " self-love " was key .
he said : " when young people do n't feel a sense of love for themselves , the absence of value for their lives ... that is dangerous . "
' postcode territoriality ' mr obunge added : " another big thing is the sense of territoriality - some call it gang culture - which has kicked off in a big way in recent years . "
gun crime continues to attract youths despite warnings mr hales said the emergence of so-called " postcode territoriality " did raise difficult questions .
he said : " is it a fad ?
it may be part of youth culture which may disappear very quickly , but it is a worry . "
mr hales said there was increasing evidence of an " arms race " in some communities , with youths turning from knives to guns and then to even more powerful weapons .
some youths claim this arms race forces them to carry guns for protection .
but detective chief inspector john lyons , of greater manchester police 's armed crime unit , was dismissive of that argument .
the other day i had a journalist ask me what it was like living in the ' triangle of death ' erinma bell he said : " if you are not swimming in the pool with the sharks , you do n't need to behave like a shark .
" you might have a gun for self-defence if you are a drug dealer , but you are just as likely to have it to make sure you get paid . "
but manchester community worker erinma bell said there needed to be more emphasis on positive aspects of life in inner city communities such as moss side and longsight and she blamed the media for perpetuating negative images .
" the other day i had a journalist ask me what it was like living in the ' triangle of death ' .
the media should stop perpetuating these labels , " she said .
she said many of the youths in areas plagued by gun crime simply needed to be given real achievable alternatives as well as positive role models .
lack of opportunity ms bell has set up a work experience programme at construction company laing o 'rourke and she said this sort of thing could transform the aspirations of young people in areas like moss side .
craze 24 , a hip-hop mc from brixton , south london , agrees there is a lack of positive role models and said : " the local role models are drug dealers , with their big gold chains , their flash cars and their money .
" the young kids too often want to be like them rather than someone who is studying every day for a proper job which might take years .
there is too much of a ' get-rich-quick ' mentality . "
he said the mandatory five-year sentence for carrying a gun was just not enough .
" they need to make it 10 years to really scare these kids , " he said .
richard garside , director of the centre for crime and justice studies , said the fact young black men were statistically over-represented among gun crime victims should not lead to misleading analysis .
he said : " i do n't think anybody is seriously suggesting there is a gun-carrying gene that black people inherit that white people do n't .
so whatever we are saying about young black men , it 's not related to their blackness . "
mr garside said the high rate of gun crime in black communities was more to do with the fact the victims tended to live in inner city areas with a lack of social and economic opportunity .

by chris summers bbc news simply carrying a gun now carries a mandatory minimum sentence of five years - so who does it and why ?
computer games - harmless fun or dangerous breeding ground ?
guns can provide an intoxicating and almost pornographic attraction to young men who often feel powerless , according to academics in the field .
last year a team of criminologists from portsmouth university researched gun crime in a project funded by the home office .
they interviewed 80 men in prison who had become involved in gun crime .
' power ' asked about what attracted him to guns , tommy , a london-born crack addict and armed robber , said : " the control , the power you have got when you have got that in your hand . "
that power was crudely illustrated at a recent trial at the old bailey .
gun criminals timy -lrb- left -rrb- and diamond babamuboni were convicted of manslaughter at the old bailey in december 2006 the trial was shown footage of timy , 15 , tormenting a friend with a gun they were sentenced as juveniles despite the police 's suspicions that they lied about their ages is it wrong to blame hip hop ?
the jury was shown footage from a mobile phone of a boy pointing a sawn-off shotgun at a terrified former friend who was forced to strip to his underpants as his tormentors laughed .
timy babamuboni , who was aged 15 , swore on the bible he was not the boy in the footage , but he was shown to be a liar and was later convicted of the manslaughter of a woman shot dead as she held a baby at a christening party in south london .
posturing gavin hales , a criminologist who led the portsmouth university study , said police frequently came across mobile phone footage of young men posturing with guns , which may be real or imitation .
in may this year police swooped on homes in ellesmere port , cheshire , after discovering footage of youths posturing with a weapon .
it turned out to be an imitation weapon .
things have changed a great deal since the 1960s and 1970s , when gun crime was generally restricted to armed robberies , usually by career criminals and often using shotguns .
boys from ellesmere port , cheshire , show off an imitation gun in the 1980s and 1990s the number of armed robberies fell away as more and more criminals moved into the drugs trade .
despite the 1997 ban on handguns - introduced after the dunblane massacre - the crooks increasingly favoured pistols and revolvers , which were easier to hide and more " fashionable " .
some politicians have pointed the finger at hollywood films , violent computer games and the posturing - often with guns - on hip-hop videos .
last year tory leader david cameron criticised bbc radio 1 for playing songs which he said " encouraged the carrying of guns and knives " .
average age falling in the past 15 years there has been a noticeable rise in black-on-black gun crime , which was recognised when the metropolitan police launched operation trident in response to appeals by the black community .
but despite mr cameron 's recent " anarchy in the uk " rhetoric , the problem pre-dates the labour government .
in march and april 1997 - under a conservative government - there were 10 murders by gun in england alone .
we have noticed for a couple of years now that the ages of people involved in gun crime is reducing and it 's something that we have been deeply concerned about det ch supt helen ball what does seem to have changed in the past decade is the average age of both offenders and victims , which has come down considerably .
the average age of the victims in those 10 murders in the spring of 1997 was 29 and the youngest was aged 19 .
ten years on , if you look at the gun deaths that took place in june and july 2007 the average age of the five victims had fallen to 25 and that falls to 20 if 47-year-old boxer james oyebola is excluded .
the advertising watchdog is investigating this film poster detective chief superintendent helen ball , who heads up operation trident , recently told bbc radio five live : " we have noticed for a couple of years now that the ages of people involved in gun crime is reducing and it 's something that we have been deeply concerned about and until we are able to tackle that trend i am not sure that we will be able to be confident in solving this problem . "
she said the proportion of victims who were teenagers had risen from 19 % to 31 % in the last four years .
she said there were many reasons for young people getting involved , but two significant factors were exclusion from school and copying the offending of older siblings .
lack of ' self-love ' the reverend nims obunge , the chief executive of the peace alliance , said many young people suffered from low self-esteem and this absence of " self-love " was key .
he said : " when young people do n't feel a sense of love for themselves , the absence of value for their lives ... that is dangerous . "
' postcode territoriality ' mr obunge added : " another big thing is the sense of territoriality - some call it gang culture - which has kicked off in a big way in recent years . "
gun crime continues to attract youths despite warnings mr hales said the emergence of so-called " postcode territoriality " did raise difficult questions .
he said : " is it a fad ?
it may be part of youth culture which may disappear very quickly , but it is a worry . "
mr hales said there was increasing evidence of an " arms race " in some communities , with youths turning from knives to guns and then to even more powerful weapons .
some youths claim this arms race forces them to carry guns for protection .
but detective chief inspector john lyons , of greater manchester police 's armed crime unit , was dismissive of that argument .
the other day i had a journalist ask me what it was like living in the ' triangle of death ' erinma bell he said : " if you are not swimming in the pool with the sharks , you do n't need to behave like a shark .
" you might have a gun for self-defence if you are a drug dealer , but you are just as likely to have it to make sure you get paid . "
but manchester community worker erinma bell said there needed to be more emphasis on positive aspects of life in inner city communities such as moss side and longsight and she blamed the media for perpetuating negative images .
" the other day i had a journalist ask me what it was like living in the ' triangle of death ' .
the media should stop perpetuating these labels , " she said .
she said many of the youths in areas plagued by gun crime simply needed to be given real achievable alternatives as well as positive role models .
lack of opportunity ms bell has set up a work experience programme at construction company laing o 'rourke and she said this sort of thing could transform the aspirations of young people in areas like moss side .
craze 24 , a hip-hop mc from brixton , south london , agrees there is a lack of positive role models and said : " the local role models are drug dealers , with their big gold chains , their flash cars and their money .
" the young kids too often want to be like them rather than someone who is studying every day for a proper job which might take years .
there is too much of a ' get-rich-quick ' mentality . "
he said the mandatory five-year sentence for carrying a gun was just not enough .
" they need to make it 10 years to really scare these kids , " he said .
richard garside , director of the centre for crime and justice studies , said the fact young black men were statistically over-represented among gun crime victims should not lead to misleading analysis .
he said : " i do n't think anybody is seriously suggesting there is a gun-carrying gene that black people inherit that white people do n't .
so whatever we are saying about young black men , it 's not related to their blackness . "
mr garside said the high rate of gun crime in black communities was more to do with the fact the victims tended to live in inner city areas with a lack of social and economic opportunity .

gun criminals timy -lrb- left -rrb- and diamond babamuboni were convicted of manslaughter at the old bailey in december 2006 the trial was shown footage of timy , 15 , tormenting a friend with a gun they were sentenced as juveniles despite the police 's suspicions that they lied about their ages is it wrong to blame hip hop ?
the jury was shown footage from a mobile phone of a boy pointing a sawn-off shotgun at a terrified former friend who was forced to strip to his underpants as his tormentors laughed .
timy babamuboni , who was aged 15 , swore on the bible he was not the boy in the footage , but he was shown to be a liar and was later convicted of the manslaughter of a woman shot dead as she held a baby at a christening party in south london .
posturing gavin hales , a criminologist who led the portsmouth university study , said police frequently came across mobile phone footage of young men posturing with guns , which may be real or imitation .
in may this year police swooped on homes in ellesmere port , cheshire , after discovering footage of youths posturing with a weapon .
it turned out to be an imitation weapon .
things have changed a great deal since the 1960s and 1970s , when gun crime was generally restricted to armed robberies , usually by career criminals and often using shotguns .
boys from ellesmere port , cheshire , show off an imitation gun in the 1980s and 1990s the number of armed robberies fell away as more and more criminals moved into the drugs trade .
despite the 1997 ban on handguns - introduced after the dunblane massacre - the crooks increasingly favoured pistols and revolvers , which were easier to hide and more " fashionable " .
some politicians have pointed the finger at hollywood films , violent computer games and the posturing - often with guns - on hip-hop videos .
last year tory leader david cameron criticised bbc radio 1 for playing songs which he said " encouraged the carrying of guns and knives " .
average age falling in the past 15 years there has been a noticeable rise in black-on-black gun crime , which was recognised when the metropolitan police launched operation trident in response to appeals by the black community .
but despite mr cameron 's recent " anarchy in the uk " rhetoric , the problem pre-dates the labour government .
in march and april 1997 - under a conservative government - there were 10 murders by gun in england alone .
we have noticed for a couple of years now that the ages of people involved in gun crime is reducing and it 's something that we have been deeply concerned about det ch supt helen ball what does seem to have changed in the past decade is the average age of both offenders and victims , which has come down considerably .
the average age of the victims in those 10 murders in the spring of 1997 was 29 and the youngest was aged 19 .
ten years on , if you look at the gun deaths that took place in june and july 2007 the average age of the five victims had fallen to 25 and that falls to 20 if 47-year-old boxer james oyebola is excluded .
the advertising watchdog is investigating this film poster detective chief superintendent helen ball , who heads up operation trident , recently told bbc radio five live : " we have noticed for a couple of years now that the ages of people involved in gun crime is reducing and it 's something that we have been deeply concerned about and until we are able to tackle that trend i am not sure that we will be able to be confident in solving this problem . "
she said the proportion of victims who were teenagers had risen from 19 % to 31 % in the last four years .
she said there were many reasons for young people getting involved , but two significant factors were exclusion from school and copying the offending of older siblings .
lack of ' self-love ' the reverend nims obunge , the chief executive of the peace alliance , said many young people suffered from low self-esteem and this absence of " self-love " was key .
he said : " when young people do n't feel a sense of love for themselves , the absence of value for their lives ... that is dangerous . "
' postcode territoriality ' mr obunge added : " another big thing is the sense of territoriality - some call it gang culture - which has kicked off in a big way in recent years . "
gun crime continues to attract youths despite warnings mr hales said the emergence of so-called " postcode territoriality " did raise difficult questions .
he said : " is it a fad ?
it may be part of youth culture which may disappear very quickly , but it is a worry . "
mr hales said there was increasing evidence of an " arms race " in some communities , with youths turning from knives to guns and then to even more powerful weapons .
some youths claim this arms race forces them to carry guns for protection .
but detective chief inspector john lyons , of greater manchester police 's armed crime unit , was dismissive of that argument .
the other day i had a journalist ask me what it was like living in the ' triangle of death ' erinma bell he said : " if you are not swimming in the pool with the sharks , you do n't need to behave like a shark .
" you might have a gun for self-defence if you are a drug dealer , but you are just as likely to have it to make sure you get paid . "
but manchester community worker erinma bell said there needed to be more emphasis on positive aspects of life in inner city communities such as moss side and longsight and she blamed the media for perpetuating negative images .
" the other day i had a journalist ask me what it was like living in the ' triangle of death ' .
the media should stop perpetuating these labels , " she said .
she said many of the youths in areas plagued by gun crime simply needed to be given real achievable alternatives as well as positive role models .
lack of opportunity ms bell has set up a work experience programme at construction company laing o 'rourke and she said this sort of thing could transform the aspirations of young people in areas like moss side .
craze 24 , a hip-hop mc from brixton , south london , agrees there is a lack of positive role models and said : " the local role models are drug dealers , with their big gold chains , their flash cars and their money .
" the young kids too often want to be like them rather than someone who is studying every day for a proper job which might take years .
there is too much of a ' get-rich-quick ' mentality . "
he said the mandatory five-year sentence for carrying a gun was just not enough .
" they need to make it 10 years to really scare these kids , " he said .
richard garside , director of the centre for crime and justice studies , said the fact young black men were statistically over-represented among gun crime victims should not lead to misleading analysis .
he said : " i do n't think anybody is seriously suggesting there is a gun-carrying gene that black people inherit that white people do n't .
so whatever we are saying about young black men , it 's not related to their blackness . "
mr garside said the high rate of gun crime in black communities was more to do with the fact the victims tended to live in inner city areas with a lack of social and economic opportunity .

guns can provide an intoxicating and almost pornographic attraction to young men who often feel powerless , according to academics in the field .

they interviewed 80 men in prison who had become involved in gun crime .

we have noticed for a couple of years now that the ages of people involved in gun crime is reducing and it 's something that we have been deeply concerned about det ch supt helen ball what does seem to have changed in the past decade is the average age of both offenders and victims , which has come down considerably .
the average age of the victims in those 10 murders in the spring of 1997 was 29 and the youngest was aged 19 .
ten years on , if you look at the gun deaths that took place in june and july 2007 the average age of the five victims had fallen to 25 and that falls to 20 if 47-year-old boxer james oyebola is excluded .
the advertising watchdog is investigating this film poster detective chief superintendent helen ball , who heads up operation trident , recently told bbc radio five live : " we have noticed for a couple of years now that the ages of people involved in gun crime is reducing and it 's something that we have been deeply concerned about and until we are able to tackle that trend i am not sure that we will be able to be confident in solving this problem . "
she said the proportion of victims who were teenagers had risen from 19 % to 31 % in the last four years .
she said there were many reasons for young people getting involved , but two significant factors were exclusion from school and copying the offending of older siblings .
lack of ' self-love ' the reverend nims obunge , the chief executive of the peace alliance , said many young people suffered from low self-esteem and this absence of " self-love " was key .
he said : " when young people do n't feel a sense of love for themselves , the absence of value for their lives ... that is dangerous . "
' postcode territoriality ' mr obunge added : " another big thing is the sense of territoriality - some call it gang culture - which has kicked off in a big way in recent years . "
gun crime continues to attract youths despite warnings mr hales said the emergence of so-called " postcode territoriality " did raise difficult questions .
he said : " is it a fad ?
it may be part of youth culture which may disappear very quickly , but it is a worry . "
mr hales said there was increasing evidence of an " arms race " in some communities , with youths turning from knives to guns and then to even more powerful weapons .
some youths claim this arms race forces them to carry guns for protection .
but detective chief inspector john lyons , of greater manchester police 's armed crime unit , was dismissive of that argument .
the other day i had a journalist ask me what it was like living in the ' triangle of death ' erinma bell he said : " if you are not swimming in the pool with the sharks , you do n't need to behave like a shark .
" you might have a gun for self-defence if you are a drug dealer , but you are just as likely to have it to make sure you get paid . "
but manchester community worker erinma bell said there needed to be more emphasis on positive aspects of life in inner city communities such as moss side and longsight and she blamed the media for perpetuating negative images .
" the other day i had a journalist ask me what it was like living in the ' triangle of death ' .
the media should stop perpetuating these labels , " she said .
she said many of the youths in areas plagued by gun crime simply needed to be given real achievable alternatives as well as positive role models .
lack of opportunity ms bell has set up a work experience programme at construction company laing o 'rourke and she said this sort of thing could transform the aspirations of young people in areas like moss side .
craze 24 , a hip-hop mc from brixton , south london , agrees there is a lack of positive role models and said : " the local role models are drug dealers , with their big gold chains , their flash cars and their money .
" the young kids too often want to be like them rather than someone who is studying every day for a proper job which might take years .
there is too much of a ' get-rich-quick ' mentality . "
he said the mandatory five-year sentence for carrying a gun was just not enough .
" they need to make it 10 years to really scare these kids , " he said .
richard garside , director of the centre for crime and justice studies , said the fact young black men were statistically over-represented among gun crime victims should not lead to misleading analysis .
he said : " i do n't think anybody is seriously suggesting there is a gun-carrying gene that black people inherit that white people do n't .
so whatever we are saying about young black men , it 's not related to their blackness . "
mr garside said the high rate of gun crime in black communities was more to do with the fact the victims tended to live in inner city areas with a lack of social and economic opportunity .

by chris summers bbc news simply carrying a gun now carries a mandatory minimum sentence of five years - so who does it and why ?
computer games - harmless fun or dangerous breeding ground ?
guns can provide an intoxicating and almost pornographic attraction to young men who often feel powerless , according to academics in the field .
last year a team of criminologists from portsmouth university researched gun crime in a project funded by the home office .
they interviewed 80 men in prison who had become involved in gun crime .
' power ' asked about what attracted him to guns , tommy , a london-born crack addict and armed robber , said : " the control , the power you have got when you have got that in your hand . "
that power was crudely illustrated at a recent trial at the old bailey .
gun criminals timy -lrb- left -rrb- and diamond babamuboni were convicted of manslaughter at the old bailey in december 2006 the trial was shown footage of timy , 15 , tormenting a friend with a gun they were sentenced as juveniles despite the police 's suspicions that they lied about their ages is it wrong to blame hip hop ?
the jury was shown footage from a mobile phone of a boy pointing a sawn-off shotgun at a terrified former friend who was forced to strip to his underpants as his tormentors laughed .
timy babamuboni , who was aged 15 , swore on the bible he was not the boy in the footage , but he was shown to be a liar and was later convicted of the manslaughter of a woman shot dead as she held a baby at a christening party in south london .
posturing gavin hales , a criminologist who led the portsmouth university study , said police frequently came across mobile phone footage of young men posturing with guns , which may be real or imitation .
in may this year police swooped on homes in ellesmere port , cheshire , after discovering footage of youths posturing with a weapon .
it turned out to be an imitation weapon .
things have changed a great deal since the 1960s and 1970s , when gun crime was generally restricted to armed robberies , usually by career criminals and often using shotguns .
boys from ellesmere port , cheshire , show off an imitation gun in the 1980s and 1990s the number of armed robberies fell away as more and more criminals moved into the drugs trade .
despite the 1997 ban on handguns - introduced after the dunblane massacre - the crooks increasingly favoured pistols and revolvers , which were easier to hide and more " fashionable " .
some politicians have pointed the finger at hollywood films , violent computer games and the posturing - often with guns - on hip-hop videos .
last year tory leader david cameron criticised bbc radio 1 for playing songs which he said " encouraged the carrying of guns and knives " .
average age falling in the past 15 years there has been a noticeable rise in black-on-black gun crime , which was recognised when the metropolitan police launched operation trident in response to appeals by the black community .

" the other day i had a journalist ask me what it was like living in the ' triangle of death ' .

by chris summers bbc news simply carrying a gun now carries a mandatory minimum sentence of five years - so who does it and why ?
computer games - harmless fun or dangerous breeding ground ?
guns can provide an intoxicating and almost pornographic attraction to young men who often feel powerless , according to academics in the field .
last year a team of criminologists from portsmouth university researched gun crime in a project funded by the home office .
they interviewed 80 men in prison who had become involved in gun crime .
' power ' asked about what attracted him to guns , tommy , a london-born crack addict and armed robber , said : " the control , the power you have got when you have got that in your hand . "
that power was crudely illustrated at a recent trial at the old bailey .
gun criminals timy -lrb- left -rrb- and diamond babamuboni were convicted of manslaughter at the old bailey in december 2006 the trial was shown footage of timy , 15 , tormenting a friend with a gun they were sentenced as juveniles despite the police 's suspicions that they lied about their ages is it wrong to blame hip hop ?
the jury was shown footage from a mobile phone of a boy pointing a sawn-off shotgun at a terrified former friend who was forced to strip to his underpants as his tormentors laughed .
timy babamuboni , who was aged 15 , swore on the bible he was not the boy in the footage , but he was shown to be a liar and was later convicted of the manslaughter of a woman shot dead as she held a baby at a christening party in south london .
posturing gavin hales , a criminologist who led the portsmouth university study , said police frequently came across mobile phone footage of young men posturing with guns , which may be real or imitation .
in may this year police swooped on homes in ellesmere port , cheshire , after discovering footage of youths posturing with a weapon .
it turned out to be an imitation weapon .
things have changed a great deal since the 1960s and 1970s , when gun crime was generally restricted to armed robberies , usually by career criminals and often using shotguns .
boys from ellesmere port , cheshire , show off an imitation gun in the 1980s and 1990s the number of armed robberies fell away as more and more criminals moved into the drugs trade .
despite the 1997 ban on handguns - introduced after the dunblane massacre - the crooks increasingly favoured pistols and revolvers , which were easier to hide and more " fashionable " .
some politicians have pointed the finger at hollywood films , violent computer games and the posturing - often with guns - on hip-hop videos .
last year tory leader david cameron criticised bbc radio 1 for playing songs which he said " encouraged the carrying of guns and knives " .
average age falling in the past 15 years there has been a noticeable rise in black-on-black gun crime , which was recognised when the metropolitan police launched operation trident in response to appeals by the black community .
but despite mr cameron 's recent " anarchy in the uk " rhetoric , the problem pre-dates the labour government .
in march and april 1997 - under a conservative government - there were 10 murders by gun in england alone .
we have noticed for a couple of years now that the ages of people involved in gun crime is reducing and it 's something that we have been deeply concerned about det ch supt helen ball what does seem to have changed in the past decade is the average age of both offenders and victims , which has come down considerably .
the average age of the victims in those 10 murders in the spring of 1997 was 29 and the youngest was aged 19 .
ten years on , if you look at the gun deaths that took place in june and july 2007 the average age of the five victims had fallen to 25 and that falls to 20 if 47-year-old boxer james oyebola is excluded .
the advertising watchdog is investigating this film poster detective chief superintendent helen ball , who heads up operation trident , recently told bbc radio five live : " we have noticed for a couple of years now that the ages of people involved in gun crime is reducing and it 's something that we have been deeply concerned about and until we are able to tackle that trend i am not sure that we will be able to be confident in solving this problem . "
she said the proportion of victims who were teenagers had risen from 19 % to 31 % in the last four years .
she said there were many reasons for young people getting involved , but two significant factors were exclusion from school and copying the offending of older siblings .
lack of ' self-love ' the reverend nims obunge , the chief executive of the peace alliance , said many young people suffered from low self-esteem and this absence of " self-love " was key .
he said : " when young people do n't feel a sense of love for themselves , the absence of value for their lives ... that is dangerous . "
' postcode territoriality ' mr obunge added : " another big thing is the sense of territoriality - some call it gang culture - which has kicked off in a big way in recent years . "
gun crime continues to attract youths despite warnings mr hales said the emergence of so-called " postcode territoriality " did raise difficult questions .
he said : " is it a fad ?
it may be part of youth culture which may disappear very quickly , but it is a worry . "
mr hales said there was increasing evidence of an " arms race " in some communities , with youths turning from knives to guns and then to even more powerful weapons .
some youths claim this arms race forces them to carry guns for protection .
but detective chief inspector john lyons , of greater manchester police 's armed crime unit , was dismissive of that argument .
the other day i had a journalist ask me what it was like living in the ' triangle of death ' erinma bell he said : " if you are not swimming in the pool with the sharks , you do n't need to behave like a shark .
" you might have a gun for self-defence if you are a drug dealer , but you are just as likely to have it to make sure you get paid . "

by chris summers bbc news simply carrying a gun now carries a mandatory minimum sentence of five years - so who does it and why ?
guns can provide an intoxicating and almost pornographic attraction to young men who often feel powerless , according to academics in the field .
last year a team of criminologists from portsmouth university researched gun crime in a project funded by the home office .
they interviewed 80 men in prison who had become involved in gun crime .
' power ' asked about what attracted him to guns , tommy , a london-born crack addict and armed robber , said : " the control , the power you have got when you have got that in your hand . "
that power was crudely illustrated at a recent trial at the old bailey .
gun criminals timy -lrb- left -rrb- and diamond babamuboni were convicted of manslaughter at the old bailey in december 2006 the trial was shown footage of timy , 15 , tormenting a friend with a gun they were sentenced as juveniles despite the police 's suspicions that they lied about their ages is it wrong to blame hip hop ?
the jury was shown footage from a mobile phone of a boy pointing a sawn-off shotgun at a terrified former friend who was forced to strip to his underpants as his tormentors laughed .
timy babamuboni , who was aged 15 , swore on the bible he was not the boy in the footage , but he was shown to be a liar and was later convicted of the manslaughter of a woman shot dead as she held a baby at a christening party in south london .
posturing gavin hales , a criminologist who led the portsmouth university study , said police frequently came across mobile phone footage of young men posturing with guns , which may be real or imitation .
in may this year police swooped on homes in ellesmere port , cheshire , after discovering footage of youths posturing with a weapon .
it turned out to be an imitation weapon .
things have changed a great deal since the 1960s and 1970s , when gun crime was generally restricted to armed robberies , usually by career criminals and often using shotguns .
in the 1980s and 1990s the number of armed robberies fell away as more and more criminals moved into the drugs trade .
despite the 1997 ban on handguns - introduced after the dunblane massacre - the crooks increasingly favoured pistols and revolvers , which were easier to hide and more " fashionable " .
some politicians have pointed the finger at hollywood films , violent computer games and the posturing - often with guns - on hip-hop videos .
last year tory leader david cameron criticised bbc radio 1 for playing songs which he said " encouraged the carrying of guns and knives " .
average age falling in the past 15 years there has been a noticeable rise in black-on-black gun crime , which was recognised when the metropolitan police launched operation trident in response to appeals by the black community .
but despite mr cameron 's recent " anarchy in the uk " rhetoric , the problem pre-dates the labour government .
in march and april 1997 - under a conservative government - there were 10 murders by gun in england alone . "
we have noticed for a couple of years now that the ages of people involved in gun crime is reducing and it 's something that we have been deeply concerned about " det ch supt helen ball what does seem to have changed in the past decade is the average age of both offenders and victims , which has come down considerably .
the average age of the victims in those 10 murders in the spring of 1997 was 29 and the youngest was aged 19 .
ten years on , if you look at the gun deaths that took place in june and july 2007 the average age of the five victims had fallen to 25 and that falls to 20 if 47-year-old boxer james oyebola is excluded .
detective chief superintendent helen ball , who heads up operation trident , recently told bbc radio five live : " we have noticed for a couple of years now that the ages of people involved in gun crime is reducing and it 's something that we have been deeply concerned about and until we are able to tackle that trend i am not sure that we will be able to be confident in solving this problem . "
she said the proportion of victims who were teenagers had risen from 19 % to 31 % in the last four years .
she said there were many reasons for young people getting involved , but two significant factors were exclusion from school and copying the offending of older siblings .
lack of ' self-love ' the reverend nims obunge , the chief executive of the peace alliance , said many young people suffered from low self-esteem and this absence of " self-love " was key .
he said : " when young people do n't feel a sense of love for themselves , the absence of value for their lives ... that is dangerous . "
' postcode territoriality ' mr obunge added : " another big thing is the sense of territoriality - some call it gang culture - which has kicked off in a big way in recent years . "
mr hales said the emergence of so-called " postcode territoriality " did raise difficult questions .
he said : " is it a fad ?
it may be part of youth culture which may disappear very quickly , but it is a worry . "
mr hales said there was increasing evidence of an " arms race " in some communities , with youths turning from knives to guns and then to even more powerful weapons .
some youths claim this arms race forces them to carry guns for protection .
but detective chief inspector john lyons , of greater manchester police 's armed crime unit , was dismissive of that argument . "
the other day i had a journalist ask me what it was like living in the ' triangle of death " ' erinma bell he said : " if you are not swimming in the pool with the sharks , you do n't need to behave like a shark .
" you might have a gun for self-defence if you are a drug dealer , but you are just as likely to have it to make sure you get paid . "
but manchester community worker erinma bell said there needed to be more emphasis on positive aspects of life in inner city communities such as moss side and longsight and she blamed the media for perpetuating negative images .
" the other day i had a journalist ask me what it was like living in the ' triangle of death ' .
the media should stop perpetuating these labels , " she said .
she said many of the youths in areas plagued by gun crime simply needed to be given real achievable alternatives as well as positive role models .
lack of opportunity ms bell has set up a work experience programme at construction company laing o 'rourke and she said this sort of thing could transform the aspirations of young people in areas like moss side .
craze 24 , a hip-hop mc from brixton , south london , agrees there is a lack of positive role models and said : " the local role models are drug dealers , with their big gold chains , their flash cars and their money .
" the young kids too often want to be like them rather than someone who is studying every day for a proper job which might take years .
there is too much of a ' get-rich-quick ' mentality . "
he said the mandatory five-year sentence for carrying a gun was just not enough .
" they need to make it 10 years to really scare these kids , " he said .
richard garside , director of the centre for crime and justice studies , said the fact young black men were statistically over-represented among gun crime victims should not lead to misleading analysis .
he said : " i do n't think anybody is seriously suggesting there is a gun-carrying gene that black people inherit that white people do n't .
so whatever we are saying about young black men , it 's not related to their blackness . "
mr garside said the high rate of gun crime in black communities was more to do with the fact the victims tended to live in inner city areas with a lack of social and economic opportunity .

by chris summers bbc news black men are statistically over-represented among gun victims .
is this due to cultural influences , such as hip hop and rap music , which have been accused of using lyrics and images which glamorise guns ?
two of hip hop 's most enduring icons - tupac shakur and biggie smalls - were victims of gun crime .
could it be a coincidence - after all john lennon was also a gun crime victim - or is rap , hip hop and grime music inherently violent ?
in recent years the genres have come under increasing flak for the lyrics and the imagery used in many songs .
last year the conservative leader david cameron criticised some of bbc radio 1 's output for " encouraging people to carry guns and knives " .
sinister lyrics a poster of rapper 50 cent holding a gun and a baby was also criticised by the advertising standards authority for " glamorising " gun crime .
in may 2004 aspiring rapper david gaynor shot a man in the head and then penned a song about the incident . "
i 'll kill u in front of your family , g , i knock down family and family trees till there 's no branches left " david gaynor 's lyrics when he was asked at his trial if the lyrics were his own , he replied that he had adapted them from a song by 50 cent .
gaynor was later jailed for 25 years for attempted murder .
earlier this year campaigners in the us , including the reverend al sharpton , joined relatives of the late james brown to protest at derogatory lyrics used by some rappers .
but radio 1xtra presenter semtex said : " hip hop can not be blamed for gun crime in the uk .
the vast majority of sales are generated from people that live in middle class suburbs , whereas the vast majority of gun crime affects inner city areas .
society is to blame more than scarface the movie or scarface the rapper . "
" gun crimes could be resolved tomorrow but until society tackles the socio-economic problems instead of pointing the finger at hip hop , it 's only going to get worse , and it will spill into the suburbs . "
there is no empirical evidence to prove a link between violent lyrics and images and real violence on the streets , but many people in the music industry have accepted they need to do more to address the issue .
anti-gun songs earlier this year many british artists performed on a new album , do n't trigger , part of a government-supported anti-gun campaign .
channel u , a digital tv network that shows music videos , has been criticised in the past for showing images that encouraged or glamorised guns and gangs . "
with the whole gang stuff you have got to be aware of the rivalries and -lsb- if you broadcast something -rsb- you are going to be stirring it up " channel u station manager , cat park the channel , which launched in 2003 as a rival to mtv base , specialises in new music from british artists and most of the videos it broadcasts are sent in by groups who want to follow in the footsteps of 50 cent or so solid crew .
channel u now employs a head of compliance , bob tyler , who spends many hours weeding out videos which break ofcom regulations .
" during the day 25 % of our audience are under-18 so that is why we 're ultra-cautious , " he said .
he said they never broadcast videos that showed guns and scrutinised lyrics to ensure they were not inciting violence .
channel u 's station manager , cat park , said : " a lot of people talk in metaphors so you have got to be well up on urban slang .
with the whole gang stuff you have got to be aware of the rivalries and -lsb- if you broadcast something -rsb- you are going to be stirring it up . "
competition and rivalry between different mcs and their crews is common , but violence - like that which killed tupac and notorious big in the 1990s during a feud in the us between west coast and east coast rappers - is still quite rare .
in november 2005 richard holmes was shot dead on an estate in chingford , north east london , after a dispute over the lyrics in a song written by his friend sabar shah , a budding rapper .
in the song , over the years , shah badmouthed 25-year-old dwayne mahorn , a rapper better known as durrty goodz .
the lyrics included the line : " over the years things change in the ' hood .
i used to have a lot of respect for durrty goodz - either singer or song .
not no more . "
mr holmes was killed with a mac-10 submachine gun by two associates of mr mahorn who were jailed for life .
mr mahorn was acquitted .
one of the killers was carl dobson , aka crazy titch , and some of his videos have been aired on channel u in the past . "

angela lawrence mothers against violence she used this painful experience to help her write the lyrics of a song , testify , which is one of several tracks on this year 's do n't trigger album .
chanelle is angry at the imagery and lyrics used by many rappers , not just in relation to violence but also when it comes to degrading women with words like " bitch " and " ho " .
