" the german chancellor wants to take a decision at the summit without poland , " said merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm in brussels . " the german presidency now wants to obtain a joint mandate of the 26 other countries for an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- . " he said . the goal of the igc would be to draw up a new treaty instead of the bloc 's constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
according to eu regulations , a simple majority of countries is needed to call such a conference .
any decisions reached at the conference , however , would have to be unanimous . " poland would then have the chance to join the european consensus at the governmental conference in the autumn , " wilhelm said . polish opposition to the " double majority " voting scheme , requiring that eu decisions have the support of 55 per cent of member states , representing 65 per cent of the population , has been one of the key stumbling blocks in efforts to strike a treaty deal . poland sees it as less favorable to medium-sized nations than the current voting share-out under which it has 27 votes , almost on a par with big eu states germany , britain , italy and france , which have been accorded 29 votes each . a failed attempt ? in an effort to end the ongoing impasse regarding eu voting rights , merkel on friday offered new concessions to poland as european union leaders entered a decisive end-game at summit talks in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins have been flexing poland 's muscles jo leinen , chairman of european parliament 's constitutional committee , said merkel had told the polish delegation that application of the eu 's " double majority " system for decisions would only be introduced in 2014 , instead of in 2009 when the new " reform " treaty is expected to come into force . this offer was , however , quickly turned down by poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . " if you ask me now , i 'd say that the negotiations are going to end with a veto , " kaczynski said in an interview with poland 's public tvp1 broadcaster . " what 's been proposed to us is not enough for us to be able to accept , " he added . merkel was also seeking to ease polish concerns through the introduction of a mechanism allowing a small group of countries to stop unfavorable decisions - even if they do not meet current eu criteria for forging a so-called " blocking minority . " wilhelm said the german eu presidency made repeated attempts to address polish demands and that the german offer had been " far-reaching . "
in the light of the polish rejection , however , wilhelm quoted merkel as saying it was important to take action to avoid " leaving europe to mark time . " no eu foreign minister ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair opposes the idea of ceding sovereignty on foreign policy to the eu in a concession to britain , germany agreed that the eu 's charter on fundamental rights would only be legally binding in areas covered by eu laws .
this means it would not apply to britain 's labor legislation . in addition , as demanded by britain , the treaty will not refer to the appointment of a first-ever " foreign minister " but to a " high representative for foreign and security policy , " which is already the job title held by javier solana , the eu 's current chief diplomat . britain claims that the title of foreign minister would give the impression that national governments were ceding sovereignty on foreign policy to the eu .
the newly proposed high representative , however , would also serve as a vice-president of the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm . in addition , the new foreign policy post would be backed up by an eu diplomatic service including commission officials and diplomats from national governments . the summit , chaired by merkel , was scheduled to end later on friday .
but diplomats said discussions could stretch out into saturday to give leaders more time to break the deadlock . dw staff with agency reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

doping in german soccer is likely still practiced , the head of the german anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- , armin baumert , said on friday . " international and domestic soccer is not a doping-free zone , " baumert told german public broadcaster swr , according to news reports .
" you do n't have to be afraid if you say that doping still takes place in soccer . "
the statements made in a radio interview instantly drew angry reactions from germany 's soccer federation , the dfb , which asked baumert for details about is allegations .
naming names " he should give names and facts if he has concrete evidence of current doping practices in soccer , " dfb spokesman harald stenger told dpa news service .
" but if it 's only a general suspicion then his statements are populist . "
baumert said that the dfb carried out 800 drug tests last year , but that only 87 of them were random tests .
he said that nada and the dfb will raise the number of out-of-competition tests in the future .
more tests ?
bildunterschrift : theo zwanziger dfb head theo zwanziger said the dfb was ready in principle to pay for more random tests carried out by nada .
" we 'll check who nada can be used more effectively for doping tests during training sessions , " he told wdr public radio , adding that the anti-doping agency would receive money from the dfb for services rendered .
" we 're not , however , financing this agency , " zwanziger said .
" we have clubs that we have to support . "
a history of doping the soccer-doping issue was raised again recently by coach peter neururer , who said that doping with the stimulant fenetylline -lrb- also known as captagon -rrb- was common practice in the bundesliga in the 1980s .
players in former communist east germany 's soccer clubs were also allegedly doped and received amphetamines ahead of european cup games at home , according to news reports .
several former players confirmed neururer 's statements , but there will be no sanctions because of the dfb 's eight-year statute of limitations . dw staff based on wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the european union entered discussion this week on revising the draft of its constitutional treaty , poland expressed discontentment with the existing voting system .
readers responded to this week 's discussion . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . poland is within its rights and is right to stick to its position on the eu 's voting structure . - walter rymsza , poland i think that there is only one way forward for europe and this is to find a common goal and unity , without the squabble over who has more voting rights .
the european idea might die one of these days .
people might ask themselves what the sense is of their country being in the eu if they ca n't find a common goal .
maybe equal rights for every member state , no matter how big or how small and how many citizens it has - this might be an idea . - mike h. roesemann , us poland should understand that there will have to be concessions on its part if it wants to participate in the eu .
i personally think that germany has the right to have its share of votes , because of the economic , diplomatic and social power that it has .
for poland to have comparable strength within the union then there should be reform in the voting process , but until then poland should work with the eu . - milan , slovakia for the polish leader to say that the eu voting system should be based on poland 's pre-world war two population is disturbing .
with comments like that , it will be difficult for germany to reconcile with its neighbor .
one wonders why germany tried so hard to help them join the eu .
germany should say that they will go with poland 's voting plan once silesia is returned to german territory . - william conners , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski do n't quite see eye to eye on the treaty issue poland has every right to take a stand on its position .
just as every country in the united nations does , regardless of its population , each country in the eu should be fairly treated , despite how large or small it is .
i am from hawaii , and being the smallest state in the us , we still have a fair voice on all issues going through congress and the senate .
give poland their chance to speak out . - christine karas , us i think the idea of the constitution should be dropped .
an amending treaty is all that is required to help take the eu forward . - kevin blanking , great britain i am disappointed in the present polish leadership .
no person and no nation inhabiting this world are without fault !
let 's reach out in hope and trust and not be possessed by the spirit of reciprocation .
look at the relationship that developed between germany and france - it inspires because their leaders and most inhabitants embraced forgiveness , mutual respect , and hope . - elisabeth heptner , us i was born in poland but have lived in canada for the past half of my life so i am able to understand both sides of the story .
as much as i 'm concerned at how the media , in particular german media , in labeling their headlines when it comes to poland , i can certainly say that poland is not trying to dampen the hopes of the eu treaty 's success as this article claims .
poland is only trying to hammer out the bugs in the eu constitution , taking lessons from history .
to inflame the situation like germany is only worsening the atmosphere surrounding a discussion that should be carried out without rushing .
germany is pushing to get the constitution finalized as if something were on fire .
every time poland starts the conversation , germany slams down its might , accusing poland of threatening the constitution .
i think germany 's the real threat to the constitution , as it is oppressive to all outside suggestions that do n't result in germany as the major stake holder . - tom varga , poland these kaczynski twins remind me of our president george w. bush .
maybe that 's why they get along so well .
there has to be room to negotiate , and right-wingers or left-wingers are not so good at that .
i think the world will be a better place with a strong eu .
people in the eu need to realize that the world is not perfect and will never be perfect . - lee davis , us i think poland is pushing for a new voting system in the eu which would be more democratic one than that presented in the constitutional treaty .
the evidence demonstrated by poland proves the fairness of the polish proposal . - stanislav sendek , slovakia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu leaders struggle to reach agreement on new treaty eu leaders on friday entered a second day of tense negotiations on a european reform treaty with german chancellor angela merkel seeking to break down resistance from poland and britain .
-lrb- 22.06.2007 -rrb- polish prime minister brings world war two into eu vote debate in arguing for poland to receive more voting influence in a reworked eu treaty , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has said his own reform plan takes the number of poles killed in world war two into account .
-lrb- 21.06.2007 -rrb- poland dampens hopes for eu treaty success poland seemed to have softened its public tone on the eve of a crucial eu treaty summit , but concerns run deep in the country about not being taken seriously for plans to change the bloc 's reformed voting system .
-lrb- 20.06.2007 -rrb- audios and videos on the topic eu summit - will the 27-member bloc agree on a new treaty ?

but germany 's " posaunenchöre " - literally , trombone choirs - are not your typical brass bands : they do n't even play folk music . go to any village festival or drop in at the local protestant church on a sunday morning and you 're bound to hear one .
and do n't be surprised if many of the musicians are n't even old enough to drive . the all-brass ensembles - a formation that 's unique to german-speaking countries - may have been around for over a century and a half , but that does n't stop more and more young people from taking part .
the origin of the amateur brass orchestra is closely linked to the development of the protestant church in germany .
after the enlightenment movement , which focused on humanism and rationalism , the leaders of the protestant revival movement in the mid-19th century were ready for something that spoke less to the head and more to the heart - and the ears .
they took the call in psalm 150 literally - " praise the lord with trumpets " - and replaced the more somber-sounding organ with the cheery sound of brass - everything from trumpets and trombones to french horns and tubas .
portable organs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things got a bit loud at the national brass orchestra festival last week " the brass orchestras play a key role in churches because they can open people 's heart , " said bernhard silaschi , chairman of the protestant brass orchestra service of germany , an umbrella organization representing some 30 state and regional groups . " music is a bridge and you do n't need many words . "
as the revival movement caught on and protestant churches outgrew their chapels , services were held outdoors or in makeshift tents .
the instruments were perfectly suited for it .
tubas are n't hard to carry - that 's how they got the nickname " portable organs " - and , best of all , brass instruments are more waterproof than violins , pianos and oboes .
today , as german churches struggle to attract the faithful , brass orchestras seem to have no problem recruiting members . " amazingly , the christian brass ensemble movement is growing , " said karsten heger , who has directed brass orchestras for 40 years .
" the ensembles do n't have to worry about finding new young members . "
heger estimated that there are 7,000 such ensembles in germany with some 120,000 members .
choir of horns bildunterschrift : chorales are the core of the brass orchestas ' repertoire it 's no accident that the german term " posaunenchor " includes the word ' choir ' .
their original aim was to mimic human voices as closely as possible , heger said .
the brass orchestras do play swing and jazz music , but chorales are one of the " main pillars of our work , " silaschi said .
chorales , generally written for four parts , were originally intended for vocal choirs or church congregations and are a staple of protestant church music .
like a vocal choir , each part can be played by an unlimited number of instrumentalists - which is a significant difference to other well-known brass formations like american army bands or british brass bands .
just last week , several thousand musicians of all ages gathered in essen for the annual national brass festival , which is sponsored by the german version of the ymca .
and at the beginning of the month , composer and trumpet player markus stockhausen opened the german protestant church day by conducting 1,500 brass players on the banks of the rhine river in cologne .
true to church roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brass instruments are practical : they 're portable and water-proof although over a century and a half has passed since the protestant revival in germany , brass orchestras have remained true to their church roots . the network of regional and state organizations in charge of the local ensembles not only provide opportunities for musical development and performance , instrument loans and scores : leaders also take a personal interest in passing on religious values to the musicians .
" the music is important , but it 's also important to know what our common foundation is , " said silaschi , who added that most rehearsals and events begin with a prayer or devotion .
still , brass players not involved in a church are invited to participate and diversity seems to be a key element of the amateur groups .
" my youngest member is nine and the oldest is 67 , " heger said of the ensemble in wilhelmshaven that he directs .
" all social groups are represented - you 'll have a doctor sitting next to a construction worker .

" my youngest member is nine and the oldest is 67 , " heger said of the ensemble in wilhelmshaven that he directs .
" all social groups are represented - you 'll have a doctor sitting next to a construction worker .
the abilities span a wide spectrum but we reach all groups . "
for the brass players , " reaching " people does n't just mean playing a chorale at church or a swing tune in the local convalescent hospital .
silaschi recently appeared with an ensemble on the harald schmidt show , one of germany 's most-watched late-night comedy shows , to advertise a major " posaunenchor " festival planned for next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.06.2007 opinion : political abuse of religious feelings is not a new tactic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outrage over the decision to honor author salman rushdie with a knighthood has been orchestrated to distract the public from other political problems in iran and pakistan , writes dw 's peter philipp . only the narrow-minded would interpret the manifestations of open irritation and public outrage in the streets of tehran and islamabad as the actual expression of the public 's mood .
they are not .
they are rather a finely orchestrated means for the authorities to serve a purpose .
to achieve their political goals or to distract from their own problems , the " security aware " - some may say " repressive " - regimes allow such demonstrations : against the insulting mohammed caricatures in denmark , against alleged desecration of the koran somewhere in the world or , as is currently the case , against the distinction being paid by the queen to british author salman rushdie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many demonstrators in front of the british embassies in tehran and islamabad today even knew who rushdie was 14 days ago ?
how many may have actually read the " satanic verses , " the book that garnered rushdie the anger of islamic extremists ?
probably none .
but that 's not really the point .
in 1989 , the iranian revolutionary leader khomeini issued a fatwa against then unknown rushdie , and iran put a price on the author 's head .
for 10 years rushdie had to go underground and live under police surveillance until tehran admitted that while the now deceased khomeini 's fatwa could not be revoked , it did not need to be implemented .
rushdie 's life could once again return to normal .
now that new demonstrations are being aimed at the author , it 's certainly not because of the " satanic verses . "
he is , after all , being recognized for his life 's work , not a single book .
but iranian and pakistani officials describe the knighthood as a new insult to one and half billion muslims .
and the pakistani religion minister raised the bar with the threat of a suicide attack to avenge this unfriendly act on the part of the british royal family .
as if that 's not an insult against all well-meaning people around the world , regardless of their religion , skin color or language .
such statements are a slap in the face to anyone who works for understanding and freedom - especially between cultures .
that includes muslims who believe in their religion 's true messages of freedom and understanding .
the abuse of religious sentiment for political means is not a new tactic .
but in the case of iran , one had hoped that things had changed .
and one even believed that they had in the case of pakistan , a country that is an important partner in the " fight against terror . "
in both cases the people are being thoughtlessly manipulated as a way of distraction from foreign and domestic problems , and the unforeseen consequences are being accepted .
in the end , it 's an easy call to make : the culprit has already been decided , and if anyone gets hurt during protests then the west will be responsible for that , too .
what satanic tactics .

germany 's highest-ranking cardinal has warned against indifference and uncritical tolerance which he says could lead to islam enjoying equal standing with christianity in the country . cardinal karl lehmann , who is head of the german conference of bishops , expressed concern about religious freedom leading to all faiths being treated equally regardless of the size of their flock and their history . germany 's constitution obliges the state to maintain strict religious neutrality .
but lehmann pointed to christianity 's role in shaping european history and even its legal culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann " the deep cultural connection between christianity and our legal state , that goes back to the middle ages and before , can not simply be ignored , " lehmann said in a speech in karlsruhe . germany continues to struggle to integrate its 3.2 million muslims , over half of whom are of turkish origin , primarily " guest workers " who came to work during the country 's postwar economic boom , and their children . integration problems the government has been concerned about the potential radicalization of disillusioned young muslims and organized an islam conference last year to try to help muslims mesh with mainstream society .

now that new demonstrations are being aimed at the author , it 's certainly not because of the " satanic verses . "
he is , after all , being recognized for his life 's work , not a single book .
but iranian and pakistani officials describe the knighthood as a new insult to one and half billion muslims .
and the pakistani religion minister raised the bar with the threat of a suicide attack to avenge this unfriendly act on the part of the british royal family .
as if that 's not an insult against all well-meaning people around the world , regardless of their religion , skin color or language .
such statements are a slap in the face to anyone who works for understanding and freedom - especially between cultures .
that includes muslims who believe in their religion 's true messages of freedom and understanding .
the abuse of religious sentiment for political means is not a new tactic .
but in the case of iran , one had hoped that things had changed .
and one even believed that they had in the case of pakistan , a country that is an important partner in the " fight against terror . "
in both cases the people are being thoughtlessly manipulated as a way of distraction from foreign and domestic problems , and the unforeseen consequences are being accepted .
in the end , it 's an easy call to make : the culprit has already been decided , and if anyone gets hurt during protests then the west will be responsible for that , too .
what satanic tactics .

they are not .
they are rather a finely orchestrated means for the authorities to serve a purpose .
to achieve their political goals or to distract from their own problems , the " security aware " - some may say " repressive " - regimes allow such demonstrations : against the insulting mohammed caricatures in denmark , against alleged desecration of the koran somewhere in the world or , as is currently the case , against the distinction being paid by the queen to british author salman rushdie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many demonstrators in front of the british embassies in tehran and islamabad today even knew who rushdie was 14 days ago ?
how many may have actually read the " satanic verses , " the book that garnered rushdie the anger of islamic extremists ?
probably none .
but that 's not really the point .
in 1989 , the iranian revolutionary leader khomeini issued a fatwa against then unknown rushdie , and iran put a price on the author 's head .
for 10 years rushdie had to go underground and live under police surveillance until tehran admitted that while the now deceased khomeini 's fatwa could not be revoked , it did not need to be implemented .
rushdie 's life could once again return to normal .
now that new demonstrations are being aimed at the author , it 's certainly not because of the " satanic verses . "
he is , after all , being recognized for his life 's work , not a single book .
but iranian and pakistani officials describe the knighthood as a new insult to one and half billion muslims .
and the pakistani religion minister raised the bar with the threat of a suicide attack to avenge this unfriendly act on the part of the british royal family .
as if that 's not an insult against all well-meaning people around the world , regardless of their religion , skin color or language .
such statements are a slap in the face to anyone who works for understanding and freedom - especially between cultures .
that includes muslims who believe in their religion 's true messages of freedom and understanding .
the abuse of religious sentiment for political means is not a new tactic .
but in the case of iran , one had hoped that things had changed .
and one even believed that they had in the case of pakistan , a country that is an important partner in the " fight against terror . "
in both cases the people are being thoughtlessly manipulated as a way of distraction from foreign and domestic problems , and the unforeseen consequences are being accepted .
in the end , it 's an easy call to make : the culprit has already been decided , and if anyone gets hurt during protests then the west will be responsible for that , too .

the united nations has confirmed that the outgoing british premier is under discussion for the role and us president george bush reportedly is also in favor . the united nations confirmed on thursday that blair is under discussion to fill the vacant position of middle east envoy .
" the issue was raised with -lrb- un -rrb- secretary general -lrb- ban ki-moon -rrb- during different conversations with some quartet principals , " said un spokeswoman michele montas .
on wednesday , blair is due to hand over the reins as britain 's prime minister to gordon brown after a decade of holding the post . the 54-year old has made clear he 's not ready to retire from the world stage .
two senior us administration sources said blair 's aides indicated he was interested in the position , the bbc reported .
the prime minister 's spokesman said there was lots of speculation over blair 's future , much of it " inaccurate , " according to the bbc .

eu leaders on friday entered a second day of tense negotiations on a european reform treaty with german chancellor angela merkel seeking to break down resistance from poland and britain . merkel said eu leaders were doing their " level best " to reach a compromise on a treaty and she was to meet the british and polish leaders to press the case .
" we are working hard , but the problems remain unresolved , " merkel said before the talks with kaczynski .
" but everyone is trying . "
merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy proposed a compromise about the eu voting system during talks in the early hours of friday with poland 's president lech kaczynski , but it remained unclear if the polish leader would accept the suggestion .
the polish news agency pap reported that earlier in the day kacyznski was not optimistic and convinced he held the most advantageous position for poland .
" poland is not in the habit of withdrawing when it is in the right , " he said .

merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the month , said she wants agreement on a broad outline of a treaty at the summit so that it can be written over the next six months by an inter-governmental conference .
the new treaty is deemed necessary after the collapse of the proposed constitution , which french and dutch voters ' rejected two years ago and sent the bloc into an extended " period of contemplation . "
caught between two poles ? the german chancellor hoped to use a series of bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit to win over britain , poland , the netherlands and the czech republic .

poland is threatening to wreck efforts to forge a new institutional treaty because it believes it will lose decision-making power under the so-called double majority voting system proposed by germany . on friday , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , the president 's twin brother who did not attend the summit , said he would be willing to consider other options if his country 's plan on voting rules did not get approved at the summit . " if there is no agreement on the square root -lrb- voting plan -rrb- , then we could talk about other solutions , " kaczynski told a news conference , according to reuters news service . he added that poland wanted to " moderate the revolution " that the treaty plan would bring to the eu . his brother meanwhile suggested that the current system for distributing decision-making votes in the bloc agreed in 2000 should be extended until 2020 .
blair 's last " red lines " british prime minister tony blair , attending his final eu summit , on the other hand warned there were four " red lines " concerning national control over foreign policy , the judicial and police system , or tax and social security rules that he would not cross in the search for a compromise .
the dutch want a bigger role for national parliaments in the new treaty while the czechs sympathize with poland in opposition to the proposed voting rules , though some experts have said that support is only half-hearted .

after his debut on the eu stage , french leader sarkozy said he had seen " a strong willingness to find a compromise , " but that soothing poland 's fears could prove difficult .
as the first day of talks stretched into friday , sarkozy made a compromise solution to poland in a bid to persuade it to drop its opposition to voting procedures , said his spokesman david martinon .
under the proposal , a small group of countries who had almost enough votes to block a decision would be able to have it re-examined , but a polish source told the afp news agency the compromise " does n't go far enough " and added that warsaw had made a counter-proposal , signaling that debate on the issue was far from over . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- sms / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu leaders on friday entered a second day of tense negotiations on a european reform treaty with german chancellor angela merkel seeking to break down resistance from poland and britain . merkel said eu leaders were doing their " level best " to reach a compromise on a treaty and she was to meet the british and polish leaders to press the case .
" we are working hard , but the problems remain unresolved , " merkel said before the talks with kaczynski .
" but everyone is trying . "
merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy proposed a compromise about the eu voting system during talks in the early hours of friday with poland 's president lech kaczynski , but it remained unclear if the polish leader would accept the suggestion .
the polish news agency pap reported that earlier in the day kacyznski was not optimistic and convinced he held the most advantageous position for poland .
" poland is not in the habit of withdrawing when it is in the right , " he said .
more nations register opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aide to french president sarkozy said paris was optimistic about finding a compromise germany and its allies want the new treaty to update the eu 's rulebook for the 21st century , but poland is against the voting system and britain has also announced it has several doubts while the czech and dutch governments also have misgivings .
merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the month , said she wants agreement on a broad outline of a treaty at the summit so that it can be written over the next six months by an inter-governmental conference .
the new treaty is deemed necessary after the collapse of the proposed constitution , which french and dutch voters ' rejected two years ago and sent the bloc into an extended " period of contemplation . "
caught between two poles ? the german chancellor hoped to use a series of bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit to win over britain , poland , the netherlands and the czech republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski brothers have said poland 's proposal is the best solution to eu voting procedures but after little progress was made on the first day , she had a long day ahead amid expectations for the negotiations to drag into the night - and possibly the weekend - in a classic eu wrangling marathon .
poland is threatening to wreck efforts to forge a new institutional treaty because it believes it will lose decision-making power under the so-called double majority voting system proposed by germany . on friday , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , the president 's twin brother who did not attend the summit , said he would be willing to consider other options if his country 's plan on voting rules did not get approved at the summit . " if there is no agreement on the square root -lrb- voting plan -rrb- , then we could talk about other solutions , " kaczynski told a news conference , according to reuters news service . he added that poland wanted to " moderate the revolution " that the treaty plan would bring to the eu . his brother meanwhile suggested that the current system for distributing decision-making votes in the bloc agreed in 2000 should be extended until 2020 .
blair 's last " red lines " british prime minister tony blair , attending his final eu summit , on the other hand warned there were four " red lines " concerning national control over foreign policy , the judicial and police system , or tax and social security rules that he would not cross in the search for a compromise .
the dutch want a bigger role for national parliaments in the new treaty while the czechs sympathize with poland in opposition to the proposed voting rules , though some experts have said that support is only half-hearted .
poland , whose leaders have said it is " willing to die , " appeared after talks broke up late thursday to be moving as a number of different proposals were circulated to accommodate warsaw .
further discussions required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders are trying to decide what direction the eu should take in the future " there are proposals which could be a solution equivalent to our proposition , but they need to be discussed some more , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga said , adding that meetings with " key partners " would follow .
after his debut on the eu stage , french leader sarkozy said he had seen " a strong willingness to find a compromise , " but that soothing poland 's fears could prove difficult .
as the first day of talks stretched into friday , sarkozy made a compromise solution to poland in a bid to persuade it to drop its opposition to voting procedures , said his spokesman david martinon .
under the proposal , a small group of countries who had almost enough votes to block a decision would be able to have it re-examined , but a polish source told the afp news agency the compromise " does n't go far enough " and added that warsaw had made a counter-proposal , signaling that debate on the issue was far from over . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- sms / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we 're not , however , financing this agency , " zwanziger said .
" we have clubs that we have to support . "
a history of doping the soccer-doping issue was raised again recently by coach peter neururer , who said that doping with the stimulant fenetylline -lrb- also known as captagon -rrb- was common practice in the bundesliga in the 1980s .
players in former communist east germany 's soccer clubs were also allegedly doped and received amphetamines ahead of european cup games at home , according to news reports .
several former players confirmed neururer 's statements , but there will be no sanctions because of the dfb 's eight-year statute of limitations . dw staff based on wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" following slovenia in january this year , it will be the turn of cyprus and malta to adopt the euro in 2008 and to benefit from the same macro-economic stability and protection brought about by the single currency , " eu economic and monetary commissioner joaquin almunia said .

eu finance ministers agreed to admit cyprus and malta at their meeting in luxembourg on june 5 on the basis that the two had met the necessary criteria .
the finance ministers are to set the final exchange rates of the cypriot pound and maltese lira to the euro on july 10 .
the two island states were among the 10 countries that joined the bloc in may 2004 .
the tiny ex-yugoslav republic of slovenia became the 13th member of the euro-zone in january , making it the first to adopt the euro of the 10 mostly ex-communist countries that joined the eu in may 2004 .

" this is an important landmark for cyprus and i believe that once we adopt the euro , prices will be rounded downwards as opposed to upwards , " he said prior to his departure for the european council meeting which will deal with the cypriot and maltese accession to the euro currency zone .
papadopoulos was quoted by cyprus ' state news agency as saying that government services would monitor the change of currency to ensure that there was no exploitation of prices , adding that the cypriot pound will be locked to the euro in early july .
at present the exchange rate has been steady in the range of 1.708 to 1.718 euros to the cypriot pound . at current exchange rates one cypriot pound is worth about 1.71 euros , while the maltese lira is worth 2.33 euros .
after cyprus and malta join , slovakia is the next in line for euro-zone membership in 2009 .

germany 's highest-ranking cardinal has warned against indifference and uncritical tolerance which he says could lead to islam enjoying equal standing with christianity in the country . cardinal karl lehmann , who is head of the german conference of bishops , expressed concern about religious freedom leading to all faiths being treated equally regardless of the size of their flock and their history . germany 's constitution obliges the state to maintain strict religious neutrality .
but lehmann pointed to christianity 's role in shaping european history and even its legal culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann " the deep cultural connection between christianity and our legal state , that goes back to the middle ages and before , can not simply be ignored , " lehmann said in a speech in karlsruhe . germany continues to struggle to integrate its 3.2 million muslims , over half of whom are of turkish origin , primarily " guest workers " who came to work during the country 's postwar economic boom , and their children . integration problems the government has been concerned about the potential radicalization of disillusioned young muslims and organized an islam conference last year to try to help muslims mesh with mainstream society .
germany has western europe 's second-biggest muslim population after france . the conference has made little progress so far on sensitive issues such as religion lessons , girls ' participation in sports and the legal status of a new islamic grouping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the planned mosque demonstrated in cologne lehmann 's comments come amid a sensitive time for muslim-christian relations in germany .
the construction of a large mosque in the western city of cologne has set off a wave of intense opposition among many local residents . " i do n't want to say i am worried , but i have an uneasy feeling , " cardinal joachim meisner of cologne said of the mosque in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio on wednesday . meisner , who last year banned catholic children from praying with muslim classmates , said a real test of religious tolerance would be whether christians could build churches and worship freely in turkey , as muslims can in germany . chancellor angela merkel , the daughter of a protestant pastor , said in april she expected turkey to take action to show it was tolerant of christianity after the killing of three people , including a german , at a turkish bible publishing house . mixed reactions from politicians ronald pofalla , the general secretary of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union party , said lehmann was right to say islam could not be afforded the same legal standing in germany as christianity , although he added no one should prevent muslims from practicing their religion in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think the eu ca n't cope with a muslim country such as turkey as a member " unlike christianity , islam is not in europe 's cultural center and is not reflected in everyday life in the same way , " pofalla said in a statement . " only those who are conscious of their cultural and social roots can freely and openly stand up for the rights of people of different faiths , " he added . but left-leaning politicians criticized lehmann 's statements . the leader of the green party 's parliamentary group , volker beck , said germany 's constitution required islam be treated the same as christianity . " the cardinal is wrong if he concludes that europe 's or germany 's undoubtedly christian character infers a legal discrimination of other religious communities , " he said . lale akgün , a social democratic parliamentarian in charge of islam issues , said lehmann was not looking clearly at the reality of life in germany . " whoever says that islam can not be put on an equal legal footing -lrb- as other religions -rrb- is stoking social unrest , " she said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" following slovenia in january this year , it will be the turn of cyprus and malta to adopt the euro in 2008 and to benefit from the same macro-economic stability and protection brought about by the single currency , " eu economic and monetary commissioner joaquin almunia said .
" it is important that they make careful use of the next six months to ensure a smooth transition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maltese and cypriot cashiers will have to get used to the new notes next year once the two mediterranean islands have made the changeover , the single european currency will be in use in 15 eu member countries with a total population of around 320 million .
eu finance ministers agreed to admit cyprus and malta at their meeting in luxembourg on june 5 on the basis that the two had met the necessary criteria .
the finance ministers are to set the final exchange rates of the cypriot pound and maltese lira to the euro on july 10 .
the two island states were among the 10 countries that joined the bloc in may 2004 .
the tiny ex-yugoslav republic of slovenia became the 13th member of the euro-zone in january , making it the first to adopt the euro of the 10 mostly ex-communist countries that joined the eu in may 2004 .
lithuania narrowly missed being included on the grounds that its inflation rate was too high .
britain , sweden and denmark are among the eu countries which have opted to remain outside the euro-zone thus far .
" an important landmark " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papadopoulos called wednesday a " historic day " for cyprus cyprus president tassos papadopoulos said wednesday that his country 's entry into the euro-zone on jan .
1 , 2008 was very significant as it would confirm the success of his government fiscal policy and the local economy in meeting european union criteria .
" this is an important landmark for cyprus and i believe that once we adopt the euro , prices will be rounded downwards as opposed to upwards , " he said prior to his departure for the european council meeting which will deal with the cypriot and maltese accession to the euro currency zone .
papadopoulos was quoted by cyprus ' state news agency as saying that government services would monitor the change of currency to ensure that there was no exploitation of prices , adding that the cypriot pound will be locked to the euro in early july .
at present the exchange rate has been steady in the range of 1.708 to 1.718 euros to the cypriot pound . at current exchange rates one cypriot pound is worth about 1.71 euros , while the maltese lira is worth 2.33 euros .
after cyprus and malta join , slovakia is the next in line for euro-zone membership in 2009 .
the baltic trio of estonia , latvia and lithuania all harbor plans to join the euro-zone quickly , but they have had to scale back their ambitions because inflation in their booming economies has been running too high . bildunterschrift : malta plans to mint its euro coins with these designs bildunterschrift : cyprus plans to mint its euro coins with these designs dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a person in an actual accident scenario would hardly have a chance at survival , " maurer said . the test consisted of a frontal and side crash at 64 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- per hour , and the front crash showed that the safety cell of the brilliance bs6 was too soft and not stable enough , adac said . most european-made cars win four or five stars in the crash test , so the result is not encouraging for the bs6 , which was slated to compete against the likes of the volkswagen passat and audi a6 when it launched at march 's geneva motor show . disappointing results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbag would be of little help in an actual accident , the adac said but hso , that company that handles brilliance 's imports to the european market , said the bs6 would undergo modifications and that sales of the car , 350 of which are on roads in germany and the benelux countries , would continue . " we are not happy with the test and will consequently improve our car , " hso head hans-ulrich sachs told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on thursday .
" a prototype will undergo the adac crash test at the end of july . " the bs6 , which sells for slightly less than 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 26,866 -rrb- is the first chinese-made sedan to be sold on the european market .
sachs added that brilliance would not stand in the way if any bs6 owners wanted to return their car based on the crash test results . thomas böhm of the germany-based association of international vehicle manufacturers told the süddeutsche zeitung that the association looked at the crash test results in a " relaxed " manner and was confident " that the market would regulate the problem .

they are not .
they are rather a finely orchestrated means for the authorities to serve a purpose .
to achieve their political goals or to distract from their own problems , the " security aware " - some may say " repressive " - regimes allow such demonstrations : against the insulting mohammed caricatures in denmark , against alleged desecration of the koran somewhere in the world or , as is currently the case , against the distinction being paid by the queen to british author salman rushdie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many demonstrators in front of the british embassies in tehran and islamabad today even knew who rushdie was 14 days ago ?
how many may have actually read the " satanic verses , " the book that garnered rushdie the anger of islamic extremists ?
probably none .
but that 's not really the point .
in 1989 , the iranian revolutionary leader khomeini issued a fatwa against then unknown rushdie , and iran put a price on the author 's head .
for 10 years rushdie had to go underground and live under police surveillance until tehran admitted that while the now deceased khomeini 's fatwa could not be revoked , it did not need to be implemented .
rushdie 's life could once again return to normal .
now that new demonstrations are being aimed at the author , it 's certainly not because of the " satanic verses . "
he is , after all , being recognized for his life 's work , not a single book .
but iranian and pakistani officials describe the knighthood as a new insult to one and half billion muslims .
and the pakistani religion minister raised the bar with the threat of a suicide attack to avenge this unfriendly act on the part of the british royal family .
as if that 's not an insult against all well-meaning people around the world , regardless of their religion , skin color or language .
such statements are a slap in the face to anyone who works for understanding and freedom - especially between cultures .
that includes muslims who believe in their religion 's true messages of freedom and understanding .
the abuse of religious sentiment for political means is not a new tactic .
but in the case of iran , one had hoped that things had changed .
and one even believed that they had in the case of pakistan , a country that is an important partner in the " fight against terror . "
in both cases the people are being thoughtlessly manipulated as a way of distraction from foreign and domestic problems , and the unforeseen consequences are being accepted .
in the end , it 's an easy call to make : the culprit has already been decided , and if anyone gets hurt during protests then the west will be responsible for that , too .
what satanic tactics .

cruise is expected to play count claus schenk von stauffenberg , the military officer who led the plot and was promptly executed in a courtyard , close to his own office at the army and navy hq .
the german defense minister now uses the building as his office along with a defense ministry complex in bonn .
denying recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial for stauffenberg and others involved in the plot to kill hitler has been set up inside the german defense ministry in berlin antje blumenthal , party spokeswoman for the christian democrats on sect issues , said defense minister franz josef jung had assured her cruise would not be given a clearance to film inside the secure site .
she said letting cruise inside would have seemed like germany 's recognition of scientology .
babelsberg studios near berlin said the company was unaware of any shooting schedule for the movie with the working title " valkyrie , " and was still in co-production talks about the project .

" wilhelm said the german eu presidency made repeated attempts to address polish demands and that the german offer had been " far-reaching . "
in the light of the polish rejection , however , wilhelm quoted merkel as saying it was important to take action to avoid " leaving europe to mark time . " no eu foreign minister ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair opposes the idea of ceding sovereignty on foreign policy to the eu in a concession to britain , germany agreed that the eu 's charter on fundamental rights would only be legally binding in areas covered by eu laws .

" the german chancellor wants to take a decision at the summit without poland , " said merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm in brussels . " the german presidency now wants to obtain a joint mandate of the 26 other countries for an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- . " he said . the goal of the igc would be to draw up a new treaty instead of the bloc 's constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
according to eu regulations , a simple majority of countries is needed to call such a conference .
any decisions reached at the conference , however , would have to be unanimous . " poland would then have the chance to join the european consensus at the governmental conference in the autumn , " wilhelm said . polish opposition to the " double majority " voting scheme , requiring that eu decisions have the support of 55 per cent of member states , representing 65 per cent of the population , has been one of the key stumbling blocks in efforts to strike a treaty deal . poland sees it as less favorable to medium-sized nations than the current voting share-out under which it has 27 votes , almost on a par with big eu states germany , britain , italy and france , which have been accorded 29 votes each . a failed attempt ? in an effort to end the ongoing impasse regarding eu voting rights , merkel on friday offered new concessions to poland as european union leaders entered a decisive end-game at summit talks in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins have been flexing poland 's muscles jo leinen , chairman of european parliament 's constitutional committee , said merkel had told the polish delegation that application of the eu 's " double majority " system for decisions would only be introduced in 2014 , instead of in 2009 when the new " reform " treaty is expected to come into force . this offer was , however , quickly turned down by poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . " if you ask me now , i 'd say that the negotiations are going to end with a veto , " kaczynski said in an interview with poland 's public tvp1 broadcaster . " what 's been proposed to us is not enough for us to be able to accept , " he added . merkel was also seeking to ease polish concerns through the introduction of a mechanism allowing a small group of countries to stop unfavorable decisions - even if they do not meet current eu criteria for forging a so-called " blocking minority . " wilhelm said the german eu presidency made repeated attempts to address polish demands and that the german offer had been " far-reaching . "
in the light of the polish rejection , however , wilhelm quoted merkel as saying it was important to take action to avoid " leaving europe to mark time . " no eu foreign minister ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair opposes the idea of ceding sovereignty on foreign policy to the eu in a concession to britain , germany agreed that the eu 's charter on fundamental rights would only be legally binding in areas covered by eu laws .

the newly proposed high representative , however , would also serve as a vice-president of the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm . in addition , the new foreign policy post would be backed up by an eu diplomatic service including commission officials and diplomats from national governments . the summit , chaired by merkel , was scheduled to end later on friday .

" a person in an actual accident scenario would hardly have a chance at survival , " maurer said . the test consisted of a frontal and side crash at 64 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- per hour , and the front crash showed that the safety cell of the brilliance bs6 was too soft and not stable enough , adac said . most european-made cars win four or five stars in the crash test , so the result is not encouraging for the bs6 , which was slated to compete against the likes of the volkswagen passat and audi a6 when it launched at march 's geneva motor show . disappointing results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbag would be of little help in an actual accident , the adac said but hso , that company that handles brilliance 's imports to the european market , said the bs6 would undergo modifications and that sales of the car , 350 of which are on roads in germany and the benelux countries , would continue . " we are not happy with the test and will consequently improve our car , " hso head hans-ulrich sachs told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on thursday .
" a prototype will undergo the adac crash test at the end of july . " the bs6 , which sells for slightly less than 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 26,866 -rrb- is the first chinese-made sedan to be sold on the european market .
sachs added that brilliance would not stand in the way if any bs6 owners wanted to return their car based on the crash test results . thomas böhm of the germany-based association of international vehicle manufacturers told the süddeutsche zeitung that the association looked at the crash test results in a " relaxed " manner and was confident " that the market would regulate the problem .

germany 's highest-ranking cardinal has warned against indifference and uncritical tolerance which he says could lead to islam enjoying equal standing with christianity in the country . cardinal karl lehmann , who is head of the german conference of bishops , expressed concern about religious freedom leading to all faiths being treated equally regardless of the size of their flock and their history . germany 's constitution obliges the state to maintain strict religious neutrality .
but lehmann pointed to christianity 's role in shaping european history and even its legal culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann " the deep cultural connection between christianity and our legal state , that goes back to the middle ages and before , can not simply be ignored , " lehmann said in a speech in karlsruhe . germany continues to struggle to integrate its 3.2 million muslims , over half of whom are of turkish origin , primarily " guest workers " who came to work during the country 's postwar economic boom , and their children . integration problems the government has been concerned about the potential radicalization of disillusioned young muslims and organized an islam conference last year to try to help muslims mesh with mainstream society .
germany has western europe 's second-biggest muslim population after france . the conference has made little progress so far on sensitive issues such as religion lessons , girls ' participation in sports and the legal status of a new islamic grouping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the planned mosque demonstrated in cologne lehmann 's comments come amid a sensitive time for muslim-christian relations in germany .
the construction of a large mosque in the western city of cologne has set off a wave of intense opposition among many local residents . " i do n't want to say i am worried , but i have an uneasy feeling , " cardinal joachim meisner of cologne said of the mosque in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio on wednesday . meisner , who last year banned catholic children from praying with muslim classmates , said a real test of religious tolerance would be whether christians could build churches and worship freely in turkey , as muslims can in germany . chancellor angela merkel , the daughter of a protestant pastor , said in april she expected turkey to take action to show it was tolerant of christianity after the killing of three people , including a german , at a turkish bible publishing house . mixed reactions from politicians ronald pofalla , the general secretary of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union party , said lehmann was right to say islam could not be afforded the same legal standing in germany as christianity , although he added no one should prevent muslims from practicing their religion in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think the eu ca n't cope with a muslim country such as turkey as a member " unlike christianity , islam is not in europe 's cultural center and is not reflected in everyday life in the same way , " pofalla said in a statement . " only those who are conscious of their cultural and social roots can freely and openly stand up for the rights of people of different faiths , " he added . but left-leaning politicians criticized lehmann 's statements . the leader of the green party 's parliamentary group , volker beck , said germany 's constitution required islam be treated the same as christianity . " the cardinal is wrong if he concludes that europe 's or germany 's undoubtedly christian character infers a legal discrimination of other religious communities , " he said . lale akgün , a social democratic parliamentarian in charge of islam issues , said lehmann was not looking clearly at the reality of life in germany . " whoever says that islam can not be put on an equal legal footing -lrb- as other religions -rrb- is stoking social unrest , " she said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" following slovenia in january this year , it will be the turn of cyprus and malta to adopt the euro in 2008 and to benefit from the same macro-economic stability and protection brought about by the single currency , " eu economic and monetary commissioner joaquin almunia said .
" it is important that they make careful use of the next six months to ensure a smooth transition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maltese and cypriot cashiers will have to get used to the new notes next year once the two mediterranean islands have made the changeover , the single european currency will be in use in 15 eu member countries with a total population of around 320 million .
eu finance ministers agreed to admit cyprus and malta at their meeting in luxembourg on june 5 on the basis that the two had met the necessary criteria .
the finance ministers are to set the final exchange rates of the cypriot pound and maltese lira to the euro on july 10 .
the two island states were among the 10 countries that joined the bloc in may 2004 .
the tiny ex-yugoslav republic of slovenia became the 13th member of the euro-zone in january , making it the first to adopt the euro of the 10 mostly ex-communist countries that joined the eu in may 2004 .
lithuania narrowly missed being included on the grounds that its inflation rate was too high .
britain , sweden and denmark are among the eu countries which have opted to remain outside the euro-zone thus far .
" an important landmark " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papadopoulos called wednesday a " historic day " for cyprus cyprus president tassos papadopoulos said wednesday that his country 's entry into the euro-zone on jan .
1 , 2008 was very significant as it would confirm the success of his government fiscal policy and the local economy in meeting european union criteria .
" this is an important landmark for cyprus and i believe that once we adopt the euro , prices will be rounded downwards as opposed to upwards , " he said prior to his departure for the european council meeting which will deal with the cypriot and maltese accession to the euro currency zone .
papadopoulos was quoted by cyprus ' state news agency as saying that government services would monitor the change of currency to ensure that there was no exploitation of prices , adding that the cypriot pound will be locked to the euro in early july .
at present the exchange rate has been steady in the range of 1.708 to 1.718 euros to the cypriot pound . at current exchange rates one cypriot pound is worth about 1.71 euros , while the maltese lira is worth 2.33 euros .
after cyprus and malta join , slovakia is the next in line for euro-zone membership in 2009 .

germany 's highest-ranking cardinal has warned against indifference and uncritical tolerance which he says could lead to islam enjoying equal standing with christianity in the country . cardinal karl lehmann , who is head of the german conference of bishops , expressed concern about religious freedom leading to all faiths being treated equally regardless of the size of their flock and their history . germany 's constitution obliges the state to maintain strict religious neutrality .
but lehmann pointed to christianity 's role in shaping european history and even its legal culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann " the deep cultural connection between christianity and our legal state , that goes back to the middle ages and before , can not simply be ignored , " lehmann said in a speech in karlsruhe . germany continues to struggle to integrate its 3.2 million muslims , over half of whom are of turkish origin , primarily " guest workers " who came to work during the country 's postwar economic boom , and their children . integration problems the government has been concerned about the potential radicalization of disillusioned young muslims and organized an islam conference last year to try to help muslims mesh with mainstream society .
germany has western europe 's second-biggest muslim population after france . the conference has made little progress so far on sensitive issues such as religion lessons , girls ' participation in sports and the legal status of a new islamic grouping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the planned mosque demonstrated in cologne lehmann 's comments come amid a sensitive time for muslim-christian relations in germany .
the construction of a large mosque in the western city of cologne has set off a wave of intense opposition among many local residents . " i do n't want to say i am worried , but i have an uneasy feeling , " cardinal joachim meisner of cologne said of the mosque in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio on wednesday . meisner , who last year banned catholic children from praying with muslim classmates , said a real test of religious tolerance would be whether christians could build churches and worship freely in turkey , as muslims can in germany . chancellor angela merkel , the daughter of a protestant pastor , said in april she expected turkey to take action to show it was tolerant of christianity after the killing of three people , including a german , at a turkish bible publishing house . mixed reactions from politicians ronald pofalla , the general secretary of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union party , said lehmann was right to say islam could not be afforded the same legal standing in germany as christianity , although he added no one should prevent muslims from practicing their religion in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think the eu ca n't cope with a muslim country such as turkey as a member " unlike christianity , islam is not in europe 's cultural center and is not reflected in everyday life in the same way , " pofalla said in a statement . " only those who are conscious of their cultural and social roots can freely and openly stand up for the rights of people of different faiths , " he added . but left-leaning politicians criticized lehmann 's statements . the leader of the green party 's parliamentary group , volker beck , said germany 's constitution required islam be treated the same as christianity . " the cardinal is wrong if he concludes that europe 's or germany 's undoubtedly christian character infers a legal discrimination of other religious communities , " he said . lale akgün , a social democratic parliamentarian in charge of islam issues , said lehmann was not looking clearly at the reality of life in germany . " whoever says that islam can not be put on an equal legal footing -lrb- as other religions -rrb- is stoking social unrest , " she said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" following slovenia in january this year , it will be the turn of cyprus and malta to adopt the euro in 2008 and to benefit from the same macro-economic stability and protection brought about by the single currency , " eu economic and monetary commissioner joaquin almunia said .
" it is important that they make careful use of the next six months to ensure a smooth transition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maltese and cypriot cashiers will have to get used to the new notes next year once the two mediterranean islands have made the changeover , the single european currency will be in use in 15 eu member countries with a total population of around 320 million .
eu finance ministers agreed to admit cyprus and malta at their meeting in luxembourg on june 5 on the basis that the two had met the necessary criteria .
the finance ministers are to set the final exchange rates of the cypriot pound and maltese lira to the euro on july 10 .
the two island states were among the 10 countries that joined the bloc in may 2004 .
the tiny ex-yugoslav republic of slovenia became the 13th member of the euro-zone in january , making it the first to adopt the euro of the 10 mostly ex-communist countries that joined the eu in may 2004 .
lithuania narrowly missed being included on the grounds that its inflation rate was too high .
britain , sweden and denmark are among the eu countries which have opted to remain outside the euro-zone thus far .
" an important landmark " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papadopoulos called wednesday a " historic day " for cyprus cyprus president tassos papadopoulos said wednesday that his country 's entry into the euro-zone on jan .
1 , 2008 was very significant as it would confirm the success of his government fiscal policy and the local economy in meeting european union criteria .
" this is an important landmark for cyprus and i believe that once we adopt the euro , prices will be rounded downwards as opposed to upwards , " he said prior to his departure for the european council meeting which will deal with the cypriot and maltese accession to the euro currency zone .
papadopoulos was quoted by cyprus ' state news agency as saying that government services would monitor the change of currency to ensure that there was no exploitation of prices , adding that the cypriot pound will be locked to the euro in early july .
at present the exchange rate has been steady in the range of 1.708 to 1.718 euros to the cypriot pound . at current exchange rates one cypriot pound is worth about 1.71 euros , while the maltese lira is worth 2.33 euros .
after cyprus and malta join , slovakia is the next in line for euro-zone membership in 2009 .
the baltic trio of estonia , latvia and lithuania all harbor plans to join the euro-zone quickly , but they have had to scale back their ambitions because inflation in their booming economies has been running too high . bildunterschrift : malta plans to mint its euro coins with these designs bildunterschrift : cyprus plans to mint its euro coins with these designs dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu leaders on friday entered a second day of tense negotiations on a european reform treaty with german chancellor angela merkel seeking to break down resistance from poland and britain . merkel said eu leaders were doing their " level best " to reach a compromise on a treaty and she was to meet the british and polish leaders to press the case .
" we are working hard , but the problems remain unresolved , " merkel said before the talks with kaczynski .
" but everyone is trying . "
merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy proposed a compromise about the eu voting system during talks in the early hours of friday with poland 's president lech kaczynski , but it remained unclear if the polish leader would accept the suggestion .
the polish news agency pap reported that earlier in the day kacyznski was not optimistic and convinced he held the most advantageous position for poland .
" poland is not in the habit of withdrawing when it is in the right , " he said .

merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the month , said she wants agreement on a broad outline of a treaty at the summit so that it can be written over the next six months by an inter-governmental conference .
the new treaty is deemed necessary after the collapse of the proposed constitution , which french and dutch voters ' rejected two years ago and sent the bloc into an extended " period of contemplation . "

poland is threatening to wreck efforts to forge a new institutional treaty because it believes it will lose decision-making power under the so-called double majority voting system proposed by germany . on friday , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , the president 's twin brother who did not attend the summit , said he would be willing to consider other options if his country 's plan on voting rules did not get approved at the summit . " if there is no agreement on the square root -lrb- voting plan -rrb- , then we could talk about other solutions , " kaczynski told a news conference , according to reuters news service . he added that poland wanted to " moderate the revolution " that the treaty plan would bring to the eu . his brother meanwhile suggested that the current system for distributing decision-making votes in the bloc agreed in 2000 should be extended until 2020 .

eu leaders on friday entered a second day of tense negotiations on a european reform treaty with german chancellor angela merkel seeking to break down resistance from poland and britain . merkel said eu leaders were doing their " level best " to reach a compromise on a treaty and she was to meet the british and polish leaders to press the case .
" we are working hard , but the problems remain unresolved , " merkel said before the talks with kaczynski .
" but everyone is trying . "
merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy proposed a compromise about the eu voting system during talks in the early hours of friday with poland 's president lech kaczynski , but it remained unclear if the polish leader would accept the suggestion .
the polish news agency pap reported that earlier in the day kacyznski was not optimistic and convinced he held the most advantageous position for poland .
" poland is not in the habit of withdrawing when it is in the right , " he said .

merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the month , said she wants agreement on a broad outline of a treaty at the summit so that it can be written over the next six months by an inter-governmental conference .
the new treaty is deemed necessary after the collapse of the proposed constitution , which french and dutch voters ' rejected two years ago and sent the bloc into an extended " period of contemplation . "

poland is threatening to wreck efforts to forge a new institutional treaty because it believes it will lose decision-making power under the so-called double majority voting system proposed by germany . on friday , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , the president 's twin brother who did not attend the summit , said he would be willing to consider other options if his country 's plan on voting rules did not get approved at the summit . " if there is no agreement on the square root -lrb- voting plan -rrb- , then we could talk about other solutions , " kaczynski told a news conference , according to reuters news service . he added that poland wanted to " moderate the revolution " that the treaty plan would bring to the eu . his brother meanwhile suggested that the current system for distributing decision-making votes in the bloc agreed in 2000 should be extended until 2020 .

after his debut on the eu stage , french leader sarkozy said he had seen " a strong willingness to find a compromise , " but that soothing poland 's fears could prove difficult .

as the european union entered discussion this week on revising the draft of its constitutional treaty , poland expressed discontentment with the existing voting system .
readers responded to this week 's discussion . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . poland is within its rights and is right to stick to its position on the eu 's voting structure . - walter rymsza , poland i think that there is only one way forward for europe and this is to find a common goal and unity , without the squabble over who has more voting rights .
the european idea might die one of these days .
people might ask themselves what the sense is of their country being in the eu if they ca n't find a common goal .
maybe equal rights for every member state , no matter how big or how small and how many citizens it has - this might be an idea . - mike h. roesemann , us poland should understand that there will have to be concessions on its part if it wants to participate in the eu .
i personally think that germany has the right to have its share of votes , because of the economic , diplomatic and social power that it has .
for poland to have comparable strength within the union then there should be reform in the voting process , but until then poland should work with the eu . - milan , slovakia for the polish leader to say that the eu voting system should be based on poland 's pre-world war two population is disturbing .
with comments like that , it will be difficult for germany to reconcile with its neighbor .
one wonders why germany tried so hard to help them join the eu .
germany should say that they will go with poland 's voting plan once silesia is returned to german territory . - william conners , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski do n't quite see eye to eye on the treaty issue poland has every right to take a stand on its position .
just as every country in the united nations does , regardless of its population , each country in the eu should be fairly treated , despite how large or small it is .
i am from hawaii , and being the smallest state in the us , we still have a fair voice on all issues going through congress and the senate .
give poland their chance to speak out . - christine karas , us i think the idea of the constitution should be dropped .
an amending treaty is all that is required to help take the eu forward . - kevin blanking , great britain i am disappointed in the present polish leadership .
no person and no nation inhabiting this world are without fault !
let 's reach out in hope and trust and not be possessed by the spirit of reciprocation .
look at the relationship that developed between germany and france - it inspires because their leaders and most inhabitants embraced forgiveness , mutual respect , and hope . - elisabeth heptner , us i was born in poland but have lived in canada for the past half of my life so i am able to understand both sides of the story .
as much as i 'm concerned at how the media , in particular german media , in labeling their headlines when it comes to poland , i can certainly say that poland is not trying to dampen the hopes of the eu treaty 's success as this article claims .
poland is only trying to hammer out the bugs in the eu constitution , taking lessons from history .
to inflame the situation like germany is only worsening the atmosphere surrounding a discussion that should be carried out without rushing .
germany is pushing to get the constitution finalized as if something were on fire .
every time poland starts the conversation , germany slams down its might , accusing poland of threatening the constitution .
i think germany 's the real threat to the constitution , as it is oppressive to all outside suggestions that do n't result in germany as the major stake holder . - tom varga , poland these kaczynski twins remind me of our president george w. bush .
maybe that 's why they get along so well .
there has to be room to negotiate , and right-wingers or left-wingers are not so good at that .
i think the world will be a better place with a strong eu .
people in the eu need to realize that the world is not perfect and will never be perfect . - lee davis , us i think poland is pushing for a new voting system in the eu which would be more democratic one than that presented in the constitutional treaty .
the evidence demonstrated by poland proves the fairness of the polish proposal . - stanislav sendek , slovakia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the european union entered discussion this week on revising the draft of its constitutional treaty , poland expressed discontentment with the existing voting system .
readers responded to this week 's discussion . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . poland is within its rights and is right to stick to its position on the eu 's voting structure . - walter rymsza , poland i think that there is only one way forward for europe and this is to find a common goal and unity , without the squabble over who has more voting rights .
the european idea might die one of these days .
people might ask themselves what the sense is of their country being in the eu if they ca n't find a common goal .
maybe equal rights for every member state , no matter how big or how small and how many citizens it has - this might be an idea . - mike h. roesemann , us poland should understand that there will have to be concessions on its part if it wants to participate in the eu .
i personally think that germany has the right to have its share of votes , because of the economic , diplomatic and social power that it has .
for poland to have comparable strength within the union then there should be reform in the voting process , but until then poland should work with the eu . - milan , slovakia for the polish leader to say that the eu voting system should be based on poland 's pre-world war two population is disturbing .
with comments like that , it will be difficult for germany to reconcile with its neighbor .
one wonders why germany tried so hard to help them join the eu .
germany should say that they will go with poland 's voting plan once silesia is returned to german territory . - william conners , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski do n't quite see eye to eye on the treaty issue poland has every right to take a stand on its position .
just as every country in the united nations does , regardless of its population , each country in the eu should be fairly treated , despite how large or small it is .
i am from hawaii , and being the smallest state in the us , we still have a fair voice on all issues going through congress and the senate .
give poland their chance to speak out . - christine karas , us i think the idea of the constitution should be dropped .
an amending treaty is all that is required to help take the eu forward . - kevin blanking , great britain i am disappointed in the present polish leadership .
no person and no nation inhabiting this world are without fault !
let 's reach out in hope and trust and not be possessed by the spirit of reciprocation .
look at the relationship that developed between germany and france - it inspires because their leaders and most inhabitants embraced forgiveness , mutual respect , and hope . - elisabeth heptner , us i was born in poland but have lived in canada for the past half of my life so i am able to understand both sides of the story .
as much as i 'm concerned at how the media , in particular german media , in labeling their headlines when it comes to poland , i can certainly say that poland is not trying to dampen the hopes of the eu treaty 's success as this article claims .
poland is only trying to hammer out the bugs in the eu constitution , taking lessons from history .
to inflame the situation like germany is only worsening the atmosphere surrounding a discussion that should be carried out without rushing .
germany is pushing to get the constitution finalized as if something were on fire .
every time poland starts the conversation , germany slams down its might , accusing poland of threatening the constitution .
i think germany 's the real threat to the constitution , as it is oppressive to all outside suggestions that do n't result in germany as the major stake holder . - tom varga , poland these kaczynski twins remind me of our president george w. bush .
maybe that 's why they get along so well .
there has to be room to negotiate , and right-wingers or left-wingers are not so good at that .
i think the world will be a better place with a strong eu .
people in the eu need to realize that the world is not perfect and will never be perfect . - lee davis , us i think poland is pushing for a new voting system in the eu which would be more democratic one than that presented in the constitutional treaty .
the evidence demonstrated by poland proves the fairness of the polish proposal . - stanislav sendek , slovakia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu leaders struggle to reach agreement on new treaty eu leaders on friday entered a second day of tense negotiations on a european reform treaty with german chancellor angela merkel seeking to break down resistance from poland and britain .

-lrb- 21.06.2007 -rrb- poland dampens hopes for eu treaty success poland seemed to have softened its public tone on the eve of a crucial eu treaty summit , but concerns run deep in the country about not being taken seriously for plans to change the bloc 's reformed voting system .

doping in german soccer is likely still practiced , the head of the german anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- , armin baumert , said on friday . " international and domestic soccer is not a doping-free zone , " baumert told german public broadcaster swr , according to news reports .
" you do n't have to be afraid if you say that doping still takes place in soccer . "
the statements made in a radio interview instantly drew angry reactions from germany 's soccer federation , the dfb , which asked baumert for details about is allegations .
naming names " he should give names and facts if he has concrete evidence of current doping practices in soccer , " dfb spokesman harald stenger told dpa news service .
" but if it 's only a general suspicion then his statements are populist . "
baumert said that the dfb carried out 800 drug tests last year , but that only 87 of them were random tests .
he said that nada and the dfb will raise the number of out-of-competition tests in the future .
more tests ?
bildunterschrift : theo zwanziger dfb head theo zwanziger said the dfb was ready in principle to pay for more random tests carried out by nada .
" we 'll check who nada can be used more effectively for doping tests during training sessions , " he told wdr public radio , adding that the anti-doping agency would receive money from the dfb for services rendered .
" we 're not , however , financing this agency , " zwanziger said .
" we have clubs that we have to support . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 22.06.2007 eu leaders struggle to reach agreement on new treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are eu leaders inching towards success or failure ?
eu leaders on friday entered a second day of tense negotiations on a european reform treaty with german chancellor angela merkel seeking to break down resistance from poland and britain . merkel said eu leaders were doing their " level best " to reach a compromise on a treaty and she was to meet the british and polish leaders to press the case .
" we are working hard , but the problems remain unresolved , " merkel said before the talks with kaczynski .
" but everyone is trying . "
merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy proposed a compromise about the eu voting system during talks in the early hours of friday with poland 's president lech kaczynski , but it remained unclear if the polish leader would accept the suggestion .
the polish news agency pap reported that earlier in the day kacyznski was not optimistic and convinced he held the most advantageous position for poland .
" poland is not in the habit of withdrawing when it is in the right , " he said .
more nations register opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aide to french president sarkozy said paris was optimistic about finding a compromise germany and its allies want the new treaty to update the eu 's rulebook for the 21st century , but poland is against the voting system and britain has also announced it has several doubts while the czech and dutch governments also have misgivings .
merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the month , said she wants agreement on a broad outline of a treaty at the summit so that it can be written over the next six months by an inter-governmental conference .
the new treaty is deemed necessary after the collapse of the proposed constitution , which french and dutch voters ' rejected two years ago and sent the bloc into an extended " period of contemplation . "
caught between two poles ? the german chancellor hoped to use a series of bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit to win over britain , poland , the netherlands and the czech republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski brothers have said poland 's proposal is the best solution to eu voting procedures but after little progress was made on the first day , she had a long day ahead amid expectations for the negotiations to drag into the night - and possibly the weekend - in a classic eu wrangling marathon .
poland is threatening to wreck efforts to forge a new institutional treaty because it believes it will lose decision-making power under the so-called double majority voting system proposed by germany . on friday , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , the president 's twin brother who did not attend the summit , said he would be willing to consider other options if his country 's plan on voting rules did not get approved at the summit . " if there is no agreement on the square root -lrb- voting plan -rrb- , then we could talk about other solutions , " kaczynski told a news conference , according to reuters news service . he added that poland wanted to " moderate the revolution " that the treaty plan would bring to the eu . his brother meanwhile suggested that the current system for distributing decision-making votes in the bloc agreed in 2000 should be extended until 2020 .
blair 's last " red lines " british prime minister tony blair , attending his final eu summit , on the other hand warned there were four " red lines " concerning national control over foreign policy , the judicial and police system , or tax and social security rules that he would not cross in the search for a compromise .
the dutch want a bigger role for national parliaments in the new treaty while the czechs sympathize with poland in opposition to the proposed voting rules , though some experts have said that support is only half-hearted .
poland , whose leaders have said it is " willing to die , " appeared after talks broke up late thursday to be moving as a number of different proposals were circulated to accommodate warsaw .
further discussions required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders are trying to decide what direction the eu should take in the future " there are proposals which could be a solution equivalent to our proposition , but they need to be discussed some more , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga said , adding that meetings with " key partners " would follow .
after his debut on the eu stage , french leader sarkozy said he had seen " a strong willingness to find a compromise , " but that soothing poland 's fears could prove difficult .
as the first day of talks stretched into friday , sarkozy made a compromise solution to poland in a bid to persuade it to drop its opposition to voting procedures , said his spokesman david martinon .
under the proposal , a small group of countries who had almost enough votes to block a decision would be able to have it re-examined , but a polish source told the afp news agency the compromise " does n't go far enough " and added that warsaw had made a counter-proposal , signaling that debate on the issue was far from over . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- sms / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a person in an actual accident scenario would hardly have a chance at survival , " maurer said . the test consisted of a frontal and side crash at 64 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- per hour , and the front crash showed that the safety cell of the brilliance bs6 was too soft and not stable enough , adac said . most european-made cars win four or five stars in the crash test , so the result is not encouraging for the bs6 , which was slated to compete against the likes of the volkswagen passat and audi a6 when it launched at march 's geneva motor show . disappointing results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbag would be of little help in an actual accident , the adac said but hso , that company that handles brilliance 's imports to the european market , said the bs6 would undergo modifications and that sales of the car , 350 of which are on roads in germany and the benelux countries , would continue . " we are not happy with the test and will consequently improve our car , " hso head hans-ulrich sachs told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on thursday .
" a prototype will undergo the adac crash test at the end of july . " the bs6 , which sells for slightly less than 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 26,866 -rrb- is the first chinese-made sedan to be sold on the european market .
sachs added that brilliance would not stand in the way if any bs6 owners wanted to return their car based on the crash test results . thomas böhm of the germany-based association of international vehicle manufacturers told the süddeutsche zeitung that the association looked at the crash test results in a " relaxed " manner and was confident " that the market would regulate the problem .

doping in german soccer is likely still practiced , the head of the german anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- , armin baumert , said on friday . " international and domestic soccer is not a doping-free zone , " baumert told german public broadcaster swr , according to news reports .
" you do n't have to be afraid if you say that doping still takes place in soccer . "
the statements made in a radio interview instantly drew angry reactions from germany 's soccer federation , the dfb , which asked baumert for details about is allegations .
naming names " he should give names and facts if he has concrete evidence of current doping practices in soccer , " dfb spokesman harald stenger told dpa news service .
" but if it 's only a general suspicion then his statements are populist . "
baumert said that the dfb carried out 800 drug tests last year , but that only 87 of them were random tests .
he said that nada and the dfb will raise the number of out-of-competition tests in the future .
more tests ?
bildunterschrift : theo zwanziger dfb head theo zwanziger said the dfb was ready in principle to pay for more random tests carried out by nada .
" we 'll check who nada can be used more effectively for doping tests during training sessions , " he told wdr public radio , adding that the anti-doping agency would receive money from the dfb for services rendered .
" we 're not , however , financing this agency , " zwanziger said .
" we have clubs that we have to support . "
a history of doping the soccer-doping issue was raised again recently by coach peter neururer , who said that doping with the stimulant fenetylline -lrb- also known as captagon -rrb- was common practice in the bundesliga in the 1980s .
players in former communist east germany 's soccer clubs were also allegedly doped and received amphetamines ahead of european cup games at home , according to news reports .
several former players confirmed neururer 's statements , but there will be no sanctions because of the dfb 's eight-year statute of limitations . dw staff based on wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german defense minister now uses the building as his office along with a defense ministry complex in bonn .
denying recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial for stauffenberg and others involved in the plot to kill hitler has been set up inside the german defense ministry in berlin antje blumenthal , party spokeswoman for the christian democrats on sect issues , said defense minister franz josef jung had assured her cruise would not be given a clearance to film inside the secure site .
she said letting cruise inside would have seemed like germany 's recognition of scientology .
babelsberg studios near berlin said the company was unaware of any shooting schedule for the movie with the working title " valkyrie , " and was still in co-production talks about the project .
the defense ministry said it had not received any request to use the building .
news reports said cruise had taken a look at the military building from outside and studio scenes were to begin on july 19 .
son complains stauffenberg 's oldest son , berthold , meanwhile said in remarks quoted friday by the german daily süddeutsche zeitung that he objected to a practicing scientologist playing his father .
" i hoped for a while that it was all just a publicity stunt by mr. cruise , " said the 72-year-old retired major general of the german bundeswehr .
he added that cruise " should keep his hands off my father . "
bildunterschrift : berthold stauffenberg -lrb- right -rrb- is not amused about cruise 's plans " it 's sure to be crap , " he said of the movie .
" of course i could be wrong - i would like to be . "
stauffenberg said cruise 's professed faith in scientology was " off-putting , " adding that the church was not a religion but a " business . "
go climbing instead " i am not saying that cruise is a bad actor - i can not judge that , " he said .
" but , in any case , i fear that it could turn into horrible kitsch . "
stauffenberg added that he had been deeply disappointed by previous films on his father .
while he said that he would not take legal action against the movie plan as his father was a historical figure , he hoped cruise would drop the project nevertheless .
bildunterschrift : cruise should enjoy germany 's mountains instead of making a movie , stauffenberg says " he should climb a mountain or go surfing in the caribbean , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.06.2007 opinion : political abuse of religious feelings is not a new tactic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outrage over the decision to honor author salman rushdie with a knighthood has been orchestrated to distract the public from other political problems in iran and pakistan , writes dw 's peter philipp . only the narrow-minded would interpret the manifestations of open irritation and public outrage in the streets of tehran and islamabad as the actual expression of the public 's mood .
they are not .
they are rather a finely orchestrated means for the authorities to serve a purpose .
to achieve their political goals or to distract from their own problems , the " security aware " - some may say " repressive " - regimes allow such demonstrations : against the insulting mohammed caricatures in denmark , against alleged desecration of the koran somewhere in the world or , as is currently the case , against the distinction being paid by the queen to british author salman rushdie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many demonstrators in front of the british embassies in tehran and islamabad today even knew who rushdie was 14 days ago ?
how many may have actually read the " satanic verses , " the book that garnered rushdie the anger of islamic extremists ?
probably none .
but that 's not really the point .
in 1989 , the iranian revolutionary leader khomeini issued a fatwa against then unknown rushdie , and iran put a price on the author 's head .
for 10 years rushdie had to go underground and live under police surveillance until tehran admitted that while the now deceased khomeini 's fatwa could not be revoked , it did not need to be implemented .
rushdie 's life could once again return to normal .
now that new demonstrations are being aimed at the author , it 's certainly not because of the " satanic verses . "
he is , after all , being recognized for his life 's work , not a single book .
but iranian and pakistani officials describe the knighthood as a new insult to one and half billion muslims .
and the pakistani religion minister raised the bar with the threat of a suicide attack to avenge this unfriendly act on the part of the british royal family .
as if that 's not an insult against all well-meaning people around the world , regardless of their religion , skin color or language .
such statements are a slap in the face to anyone who works for understanding and freedom - especially between cultures .
that includes muslims who believe in their religion 's true messages of freedom and understanding .
the abuse of religious sentiment for political means is not a new tactic .
but in the case of iran , one had hoped that things had changed .
and one even believed that they had in the case of pakistan , a country that is an important partner in the " fight against terror . "
in both cases the people are being thoughtlessly manipulated as a way of distraction from foreign and domestic problems , and the unforeseen consequences are being accepted .
in the end , it 's an easy call to make : the culprit has already been decided , and if anyone gets hurt during protests then the west will be responsible for that , too .
what satanic tactics .

" wilhelm said the german eu presidency made repeated attempts to address polish demands and that the german offer had been " far-reaching . "

" the german chancellor wants to take a decision at the summit without poland , " said merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm in brussels . " the german presidency now wants to obtain a joint mandate of the 26 other countries for an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- . " he said . the goal of the igc would be to draw up a new treaty instead of the bloc 's constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
according to eu regulations , a simple majority of countries is needed to call such a conference .
any decisions reached at the conference , however , would have to be unanimous . " poland would then have the chance to join the european consensus at the governmental conference in the autumn , " wilhelm said . polish opposition to the " double majority " voting scheme , requiring that eu decisions have the support of 55 per cent of member states , representing 65 per cent of the population , has been one of the key stumbling blocks in efforts to strike a treaty deal . poland sees it as less favorable to medium-sized nations than the current voting share-out under which it has 27 votes , almost on a par with big eu states germany , britain , italy and france , which have been accorded 29 votes each . a failed attempt ? in an effort to end the ongoing impasse regarding eu voting rights , merkel on friday offered new concessions to poland as european union leaders entered a decisive end-game at summit talks in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins have been flexing poland 's muscles jo leinen , chairman of european parliament 's constitutional committee , said merkel had told the polish delegation that application of the eu 's " double majority " system for decisions would only be introduced in 2014 , instead of in 2009 when the new " reform " treaty is expected to come into force . this offer was , however , quickly turned down by poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . " if you ask me now , i 'd say that the negotiations are going to end with a veto , " kaczynski said in an interview with poland 's public tvp1 broadcaster . " what 's been proposed to us is not enough for us to be able to accept , " he added . merkel was also seeking to ease polish concerns through the introduction of a mechanism allowing a small group of countries to stop unfavorable decisions - even if they do not meet current eu criteria for forging a so-called " blocking minority . " wilhelm said the german eu presidency made repeated attempts to address polish demands and that the german offer had been " far-reaching . "
in the light of the polish rejection , however , wilhelm quoted merkel as saying it was important to take action to avoid " leaving europe to mark time . " no eu foreign minister ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair opposes the idea of ceding sovereignty on foreign policy to the eu in a concession to britain , germany agreed that the eu 's charter on fundamental rights would only be legally binding in areas covered by eu laws .
this means it would not apply to britain 's labor legislation . in addition , as demanded by britain , the treaty will not refer to the appointment of a first-ever " foreign minister " but to a " high representative for foreign and security policy , " which is already the job title held by javier solana , the eu 's current chief diplomat . britain claims that the title of foreign minister would give the impression that national governments were ceding sovereignty on foreign policy to the eu .
the newly proposed high representative , however , would also serve as a vice-president of the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm . in addition , the new foreign policy post would be backed up by an eu diplomatic service including commission officials and diplomats from national governments . the summit , chaired by merkel , was scheduled to end later on friday .

they are not .
they are rather a finely orchestrated means for the authorities to serve a purpose .
to achieve their political goals or to distract from their own problems , the " security aware " - some may say " repressive " - regimes allow such demonstrations : against the insulting mohammed caricatures in denmark , against alleged desecration of the koran somewhere in the world or , as is currently the case , against the distinction being paid by the queen to british author salman rushdie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many demonstrators in front of the british embassies in tehran and islamabad today even knew who rushdie was 14 days ago ?
how many may have actually read the " satanic verses , " the book that garnered rushdie the anger of islamic extremists ?
probably none .
but that 's not really the point .
in 1989 , the iranian revolutionary leader khomeini issued a fatwa against then unknown rushdie , and iran put a price on the author 's head .
for 10 years rushdie had to go underground and live under police surveillance until tehran admitted that while the now deceased khomeini 's fatwa could not be revoked , it did not need to be implemented .
rushdie 's life could once again return to normal .
now that new demonstrations are being aimed at the author , it 's certainly not because of the " satanic verses . "
he is , after all , being recognized for his life 's work , not a single book .
but iranian and pakistani officials describe the knighthood as a new insult to one and half billion muslims .
and the pakistani religion minister raised the bar with the threat of a suicide attack to avenge this unfriendly act on the part of the british royal family .
as if that 's not an insult against all well-meaning people around the world , regardless of their religion , skin color or language .
such statements are a slap in the face to anyone who works for understanding and freedom - especially between cultures .
that includes muslims who believe in their religion 's true messages of freedom and understanding .
the abuse of religious sentiment for political means is not a new tactic .
but in the case of iran , one had hoped that things had changed .
and one even believed that they had in the case of pakistan , a country that is an important partner in the " fight against terror . "
in both cases the people are being thoughtlessly manipulated as a way of distraction from foreign and domestic problems , and the unforeseen consequences are being accepted .
in the end , it 's an easy call to make : the culprit has already been decided , and if anyone gets hurt during protests then the west will be responsible for that , too .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.06.2007 opinion : political abuse of religious feelings is not a new tactic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outrage over the decision to honor author salman rushdie with a knighthood has been orchestrated to distract the public from other political problems in iran and pakistan , writes dw 's peter philipp . only the narrow-minded would interpret the manifestations of open irritation and public outrage in the streets of tehran and islamabad as the actual expression of the public 's mood .
they are not .
they are rather a finely orchestrated means for the authorities to serve a purpose .
to achieve their political goals or to distract from their own problems , the " security aware " - some may say " repressive " - regimes allow such demonstrations : against the insulting mohammed caricatures in denmark , against alleged desecration of the koran somewhere in the world or , as is currently the case , against the distinction being paid by the queen to british author salman rushdie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many demonstrators in front of the british embassies in tehran and islamabad today even knew who rushdie was 14 days ago ?
how many may have actually read the " satanic verses , " the book that garnered rushdie the anger of islamic extremists ?
probably none .
but that 's not really the point .
in 1989 , the iranian revolutionary leader khomeini issued a fatwa against then unknown rushdie , and iran put a price on the author 's head .
for 10 years rushdie had to go underground and live under police surveillance until tehran admitted that while the now deceased khomeini 's fatwa could not be revoked , it did not need to be implemented .
rushdie 's life could once again return to normal .
now that new demonstrations are being aimed at the author , it 's certainly not because of the " satanic verses . "
he is , after all , being recognized for his life 's work , not a single book .
but iranian and pakistani officials describe the knighthood as a new insult to one and half billion muslims .
and the pakistani religion minister raised the bar with the threat of a suicide attack to avenge this unfriendly act on the part of the british royal family .
as if that 's not an insult against all well-meaning people around the world , regardless of their religion , skin color or language .
such statements are a slap in the face to anyone who works for understanding and freedom - especially between cultures .
that includes muslims who believe in their religion 's true messages of freedom and understanding .
the abuse of religious sentiment for political means is not a new tactic .
but in the case of iran , one had hoped that things had changed .
and one even believed that they had in the case of pakistan , a country that is an important partner in the " fight against terror . "
in both cases the people are being thoughtlessly manipulated as a way of distraction from foreign and domestic problems , and the unforeseen consequences are being accepted .
in the end , it 's an easy call to make : the culprit has already been decided , and if anyone gets hurt during protests then the west will be responsible for that , too .
what satanic tactics .

doping in german soccer is likely still practiced , the head of the german anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- , armin baumert , said on friday . " international and domestic soccer is not a doping-free zone , " baumert told german public broadcaster swr , according to news reports .
" you do n't have to be afraid if you say that doping still takes place in soccer . "
the statements made in a radio interview instantly drew angry reactions from germany 's soccer federation , the dfb , which asked baumert for details about is allegations .
naming names " he should give names and facts if he has concrete evidence of current doping practices in soccer , " dfb spokesman harald stenger told dpa news service .
" but if it 's only a general suspicion then his statements are populist . "
baumert said that the dfb carried out 800 drug tests last year , but that only 87 of them were random tests .
he said that nada and the dfb will raise the number of out-of-competition tests in the future .
more tests ?

" we 'll check who nada can be used more effectively for doping tests during training sessions , " he told wdr public radio , adding that the anti-doping agency would receive money from the dfb for services rendered .
" we 're not , however , financing this agency , " zwanziger said .
" we have clubs that we have to support . "
a history of doping the soccer-doping issue was raised again recently by coach peter neururer , who said that doping with the stimulant fenetylline -lrb- also known as captagon -rrb- was common practice in the bundesliga in the 1980s .
players in former communist east germany 's soccer clubs were also allegedly doped and received amphetamines ahead of european cup games at home , according to news reports .
several former players confirmed neururer 's statements , but there will be no sanctions because of the dfb 's eight-year statute of limitations . dw staff based on wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

top german officials said suicide bombers could carry out attacks within the country and that the security situation was more serious than it had been since 2001 . the likelihood of terrorist attacks in germany has increased , officials from the interior and foreign ministries said on friday .
border controls have been stepped up as well as the search for possible islamist terrorists .
" there is information about suicide bombers directed towards germany ' , " a spokesman for the interior ministry said on friday .
german federal crime office head jörg ziercke confirmed the arrest of three germans in pakistan who belonged to a group of 10 german islamists who had settled in the region of pakistan and afghanistan in recent months .
the men were all converts to islam who had become radicals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops in afghanistan have been targeted before ziercke referred to a june 9 video broadcast on us tv channel abc that showed mansur dadullah , the brother of a recently killed taliban military leader , visiting a training camp in afghanistan .
in the video , dadallah saw off four men who said they were on their way to carry out suicide attacks in the united states , canada , britain and germany .
security officials alarmed " we are alarmed , " deputy interior minister august hanning said in a meeting with journalists on thursday evening .
he also said there had been indications of possible terror attacks in germany .
" we have moved fully into the sights of the islamic terror , " he added .
" we are experiencing a new quality of danger : germany is threatened with suicide bombers , " hanning told the daily süddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- .
german soldiers , police officers and humanitarian aid workers in afghanistan were particularly at risk , the sz reported .

plötner refused to give further details for security reasons .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble said attacks on germans , such as those in afghanistan , could also occur within the country .
no longer abstract threats " i think one can no longer say that we ' only ' face an abstract danger , " said schäuble 's christian democratic party colleague wolfgang bosbach , the party 's deputy parliamentary group leader , on german news channel n-tv .
bosbach said the threats were " concrete . "

almost 200 people were killed when terrorists detonated bombs on commuter trains in the run-up to spanish parliamentary elections , which were at the time perceived as a referendum on whether the country should keep its soldiers in iraq .
the socialist party , which had vowed to bring the troops home , subsequently won the election and carried through on its promise .
germany 's parliament is due to vote in october on whether to renew its armed forces ' mission in afghanistan .
" germany must continue its engagement there and should not dare to allow itself to be bombed away by criminals , " schäuble said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for poland to have comparable strength within the union then there should be reform in the voting process , but until then poland should work with the eu . - milan , slovakia for the polish leader to say that the eu voting system should be based on poland 's pre-world war two population is disturbing .

as the european union entered discussion this week on revising the draft of its constitutional treaty , poland expressed discontentment with the existing voting system .
readers responded to this week 's discussion . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . poland is within its rights and is right to stick to its position on the eu 's voting structure . - walter rymsza , poland i think that there is only one way forward for europe and this is to find a common goal and unity , without the squabble over who has more voting rights .
the european idea might die one of these days .
people might ask themselves what the sense is of their country being in the eu if they ca n't find a common goal .
maybe equal rights for every member state , no matter how big or how small and how many citizens it has - this might be an idea . - mike h. roesemann , us poland should understand that there will have to be concessions on its part if it wants to participate in the eu .
i personally think that germany has the right to have its share of votes , because of the economic , diplomatic and social power that it has .
for poland to have comparable strength within the union then there should be reform in the voting process , but until then poland should work with the eu . - milan , slovakia for the polish leader to say that the eu voting system should be based on poland 's pre-world war two population is disturbing .
with comments like that , it will be difficult for germany to reconcile with its neighbor .
one wonders why germany tried so hard to help them join the eu .
germany should say that they will go with poland 's voting plan once silesia is returned to german territory . - william conners , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski do n't quite see eye to eye on the treaty issue poland has every right to take a stand on its position .

" a person in an actual accident scenario would hardly have a chance at survival , " maurer said . the test consisted of a frontal and side crash at 64 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- per hour , and the front crash showed that the safety cell of the brilliance bs6 was too soft and not stable enough , adac said . most european-made cars win four or five stars in the crash test , so the result is not encouraging for the bs6 , which was slated to compete against the likes of the volkswagen passat and audi a6 when it launched at march 's geneva motor show . disappointing results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbag would be of little help in an actual accident , the adac said but hso , that company that handles brilliance 's imports to the european market , said the bs6 would undergo modifications and that sales of the car , 350 of which are on roads in germany and the benelux countries , would continue .

eu leaders on friday entered a second day of tense negotiations on a european reform treaty with german chancellor angela merkel seeking to break down resistance from poland and britain . merkel said eu leaders were doing their " level best " to reach a compromise on a treaty and she was to meet the british and polish leaders to press the case .
" we are working hard , but the problems remain unresolved , " merkel said before the talks with kaczynski .
" but everyone is trying . "
merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy proposed a compromise about the eu voting system during talks in the early hours of friday with poland 's president lech kaczynski , but it remained unclear if the polish leader would accept the suggestion .
the polish news agency pap reported that earlier in the day kacyznski was not optimistic and convinced he held the most advantageous position for poland .
" poland is not in the habit of withdrawing when it is in the right , " he said .
more nations register opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aide to french president sarkozy said paris was optimistic about finding a compromise germany and its allies want the new treaty to update the eu 's rulebook for the 21st century , but poland is against the voting system and britain has also announced it has several doubts while the czech and dutch governments also have misgivings .
merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the month , said she wants agreement on a broad outline of a treaty at the summit so that it can be written over the next six months by an inter-governmental conference .
the new treaty is deemed necessary after the collapse of the proposed constitution , which french and dutch voters ' rejected two years ago and sent the bloc into an extended " period of contemplation . "
caught between two poles ? the german chancellor hoped to use a series of bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit to win over britain , poland , the netherlands and the czech republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski brothers have said poland 's proposal is the best solution to eu voting procedures but after little progress was made on the first day , she had a long day ahead amid expectations for the negotiations to drag into the night - and possibly the weekend - in a classic eu wrangling marathon .
poland is threatening to wreck efforts to forge a new institutional treaty because it believes it will lose decision-making power under the so-called double majority voting system proposed by germany . on friday , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , the president 's twin brother who did not attend the summit , said he would be willing to consider other options if his country 's plan on voting rules did not get approved at the summit . " if there is no agreement on the square root -lrb- voting plan -rrb- , then we could talk about other solutions , " kaczynski told a news conference , according to reuters news service . he added that poland wanted to " moderate the revolution " that the treaty plan would bring to the eu . his brother meanwhile suggested that the current system for distributing decision-making votes in the bloc agreed in 2000 should be extended until 2020 .
blair 's last " red lines " british prime minister tony blair , attending his final eu summit , on the other hand warned there were four " red lines " concerning national control over foreign policy , the judicial and police system , or tax and social security rules that he would not cross in the search for a compromise .
the dutch want a bigger role for national parliaments in the new treaty while the czechs sympathize with poland in opposition to the proposed voting rules , though some experts have said that support is only half-hearted .
poland , whose leaders have said it is " willing to die , " appeared after talks broke up late thursday to be moving as a number of different proposals were circulated to accommodate warsaw .
further discussions required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders are trying to decide what direction the eu should take in the future " there are proposals which could be a solution equivalent to our proposition , but they need to be discussed some more , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga said , adding that meetings with " key partners " would follow .
after his debut on the eu stage , french leader sarkozy said he had seen " a strong willingness to find a compromise , " but that soothing poland 's fears could prove difficult .
as the first day of talks stretched into friday , sarkozy made a compromise solution to poland in a bid to persuade it to drop its opposition to voting procedures , said his spokesman david martinon .
under the proposal , a small group of countries who had almost enough votes to block a decision would be able to have it re-examined , but a polish source told the afp news agency the compromise " does n't go far enough " and added that warsaw had made a counter-proposal , signaling that debate on the issue was far from over . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- sms / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu leaders on friday entered a second day of tense negotiations on a european reform treaty with german chancellor angela merkel seeking to break down resistance from poland and britain . merkel said eu leaders were doing their " level best " to reach a compromise on a treaty and she was to meet the british and polish leaders to press the case .
" we are working hard , but the problems remain unresolved , " merkel said before the talks with kaczynski .
" but everyone is trying . "
merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy proposed a compromise about the eu voting system during talks in the early hours of friday with poland 's president lech kaczynski , but it remained unclear if the polish leader would accept the suggestion .
the polish news agency pap reported that earlier in the day kacyznski was not optimistic and convinced he held the most advantageous position for poland .
" poland is not in the habit of withdrawing when it is in the right , " he said .

merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the month , said she wants agreement on a broad outline of a treaty at the summit so that it can be written over the next six months by an inter-governmental conference .
the new treaty is deemed necessary after the collapse of the proposed constitution , which french and dutch voters ' rejected two years ago and sent the bloc into an extended " period of contemplation . "
caught between two poles ? the german chancellor hoped to use a series of bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit to win over britain , poland , the netherlands and the czech republic .

poland is threatening to wreck efforts to forge a new institutional treaty because it believes it will lose decision-making power under the so-called double majority voting system proposed by germany . on friday , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , the president 's twin brother who did not attend the summit , said he would be willing to consider other options if his country 's plan on voting rules did not get approved at the summit . " if there is no agreement on the square root -lrb- voting plan -rrb- , then we could talk about other solutions , " kaczynski told a news conference , according to reuters news service . he added that poland wanted to " moderate the revolution " that the treaty plan would bring to the eu . his brother meanwhile suggested that the current system for distributing decision-making votes in the bloc agreed in 2000 should be extended until 2020 .
blair 's last " red lines " british prime minister tony blair , attending his final eu summit , on the other hand warned there were four " red lines " concerning national control over foreign policy , the judicial and police system , or tax and social security rules that he would not cross in the search for a compromise .
the dutch want a bigger role for national parliaments in the new treaty while the czechs sympathize with poland in opposition to the proposed voting rules , though some experts have said that support is only half-hearted .
poland , whose leaders have said it is " willing to die , " appeared after talks broke up late thursday to be moving as a number of different proposals were circulated to accommodate warsaw .
further discussions required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders are trying to decide what direction the eu should take in the future " there are proposals which could be a solution equivalent to our proposition , but they need to be discussed some more , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga said , adding that meetings with " key partners " would follow .
after his debut on the eu stage , french leader sarkozy said he had seen " a strong willingness to find a compromise , " but that soothing poland 's fears could prove difficult .
as the first day of talks stretched into friday , sarkozy made a compromise solution to poland in a bid to persuade it to drop its opposition to voting procedures , said his spokesman david martinon .
under the proposal , a small group of countries who had almost enough votes to block a decision would be able to have it re-examined , but a polish source told the afp news agency the compromise " does n't go far enough " and added that warsaw had made a counter-proposal , signaling that debate on the issue was far from over . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- sms / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" following slovenia in january this year , it will be the turn of cyprus and malta to adopt the euro in 2008 and to benefit from the same macro-economic stability and protection brought about by the single currency , " eu economic and monetary commissioner joaquin almunia said .
" it is important that they make careful use of the next six months to ensure a smooth transition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maltese and cypriot cashiers will have to get used to the new notes next year once the two mediterranean islands have made the changeover , the single european currency will be in use in 15 eu member countries with a total population of around 320 million .
eu finance ministers agreed to admit cyprus and malta at their meeting in luxembourg on june 5 on the basis that the two had met the necessary criteria .
the finance ministers are to set the final exchange rates of the cypriot pound and maltese lira to the euro on july 10 .
the two island states were among the 10 countries that joined the bloc in may 2004 .
the tiny ex-yugoslav republic of slovenia became the 13th member of the euro-zone in january , making it the first to adopt the euro of the 10 mostly ex-communist countries that joined the eu in may 2004 .
lithuania narrowly missed being included on the grounds that its inflation rate was too high .
britain , sweden and denmark are among the eu countries which have opted to remain outside the euro-zone thus far .
" an important landmark " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papadopoulos called wednesday a " historic day " for cyprus cyprus president tassos papadopoulos said wednesday that his country 's entry into the euro-zone on jan .
1 , 2008 was very significant as it would confirm the success of his government fiscal policy and the local economy in meeting european union criteria .
" this is an important landmark for cyprus and i believe that once we adopt the euro , prices will be rounded downwards as opposed to upwards , " he said prior to his departure for the european council meeting which will deal with the cypriot and maltese accession to the euro currency zone .
papadopoulos was quoted by cyprus ' state news agency as saying that government services would monitor the change of currency to ensure that there was no exploitation of prices , adding that the cypriot pound will be locked to the euro in early july .
at present the exchange rate has been steady in the range of 1.708 to 1.718 euros to the cypriot pound . at current exchange rates one cypriot pound is worth about 1.71 euros , while the maltese lira is worth 2.33 euros .
after cyprus and malta join , slovakia is the next in line for euro-zone membership in 2009 .
the baltic trio of estonia , latvia and lithuania all harbor plans to join the euro-zone quickly , but they have had to scale back their ambitions because inflation in their booming economies has been running too high . bildunterschrift : malta plans to mint its euro coins with these designs bildunterschrift : cyprus plans to mint its euro coins with these designs dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's highest-ranking cardinal has warned against indifference and uncritical tolerance which he says could lead to islam enjoying equal standing with christianity in the country . cardinal karl lehmann , who is head of the german conference of bishops , expressed concern about religious freedom leading to all faiths being treated equally regardless of the size of their flock and their history . germany 's constitution obliges the state to maintain strict religious neutrality .
but lehmann pointed to christianity 's role in shaping european history and even its legal culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann " the deep cultural connection between christianity and our legal state , that goes back to the middle ages and before , can not simply be ignored , " lehmann said in a speech in karlsruhe . germany continues to struggle to integrate its 3.2 million muslims , over half of whom are of turkish origin , primarily " guest workers " who came to work during the country 's postwar economic boom , and their children . integration problems the government has been concerned about the potential radicalization of disillusioned young muslims and organized an islam conference last year to try to help muslims mesh with mainstream society .
germany has western europe 's second-biggest muslim population after france . the conference has made little progress so far on sensitive issues such as religion lessons , girls ' participation in sports and the legal status of a new islamic grouping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the planned mosque demonstrated in cologne lehmann 's comments come amid a sensitive time for muslim-christian relations in germany .
the construction of a large mosque in the western city of cologne has set off a wave of intense opposition among many local residents . " i do n't want to say i am worried , but i have an uneasy feeling , " cardinal joachim meisner of cologne said of the mosque in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio on wednesday . meisner , who last year banned catholic children from praying with muslim classmates , said a real test of religious tolerance would be whether christians could build churches and worship freely in turkey , as muslims can in germany . chancellor angela merkel , the daughter of a protestant pastor , said in april she expected turkey to take action to show it was tolerant of christianity after the killing of three people , including a german , at a turkish bible publishing house . mixed reactions from politicians ronald pofalla , the general secretary of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union party , said lehmann was right to say islam could not be afforded the same legal standing in germany as christianity , although he added no one should prevent muslims from practicing their religion in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think the eu ca n't cope with a muslim country such as turkey as a member " unlike christianity , islam is not in europe 's cultural center and is not reflected in everyday life in the same way , " pofalla said in a statement . " only those who are conscious of their cultural and social roots can freely and openly stand up for the rights of people of different faiths , " he added . but left-leaning politicians criticized lehmann 's statements . the leader of the green party 's parliamentary group , volker beck , said germany 's constitution required islam be treated the same as christianity . " the cardinal is wrong if he concludes that europe 's or germany 's undoubtedly christian character infers a legal discrimination of other religious communities , " he said . lale akgün , a social democratic parliamentarian in charge of islam issues , said lehmann was not looking clearly at the reality of life in germany .

germany 's highest-ranking cardinal has warned against indifference and uncritical tolerance which he says could lead to islam enjoying equal standing with christianity in the country . cardinal karl lehmann , who is head of the german conference of bishops , expressed concern about religious freedom leading to all faiths being treated equally regardless of the size of their flock and their history . germany 's constitution obliges the state to maintain strict religious neutrality .
but lehmann pointed to christianity 's role in shaping european history and even its legal culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann " the deep cultural connection between christianity and our legal state , that goes back to the middle ages and before , can not simply be ignored , " lehmann said in a speech in karlsruhe . germany continues to struggle to integrate its 3.2 million muslims , over half of whom are of turkish origin , primarily " guest workers " who came to work during the country 's postwar economic boom , and their children . integration problems the government has been concerned about the potential radicalization of disillusioned young muslims and organized an islam conference last year to try to help muslims mesh with mainstream society .
germany has western europe 's second-biggest muslim population after france . the conference has made little progress so far on sensitive issues such as religion lessons , girls ' participation in sports and the legal status of a new islamic grouping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the planned mosque demonstrated in cologne lehmann 's comments come amid a sensitive time for muslim-christian relations in germany .

but germany 's " posaunenchöre " - literally , trombone choirs - are not your typical brass bands : they do n't even play folk music . go to any village festival or drop in at the local protestant church on a sunday morning and you 're bound to hear one .
and do n't be surprised if many of the musicians are n't even old enough to drive . the all-brass ensembles - a formation that 's unique to german-speaking countries - may have been around for over a century and a half , but that does n't stop more and more young people from taking part .
the origin of the amateur brass orchestra is closely linked to the development of the protestant church in germany .
after the enlightenment movement , which focused on humanism and rationalism , the leaders of the protestant revival movement in the mid-19th century were ready for something that spoke less to the head and more to the heart - and the ears .
they took the call in psalm 150 literally - " praise the lord with trumpets " - and replaced the more somber-sounding organ with the cheery sound of brass - everything from trumpets and trombones to french horns and tubas .
portable organs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things got a bit loud at the national brass orchestra festival last week " the brass orchestras play a key role in churches because they can open people 's heart , " said bernhard silaschi , chairman of the protestant brass orchestra service of germany , an umbrella organization representing some 30 state and regional groups . " music is a bridge and you do n't need many words . "
as the revival movement caught on and protestant churches outgrew their chapels , services were held outdoors or in makeshift tents .
the instruments were perfectly suited for it .
tubas are n't hard to carry - that 's how they got the nickname " portable organs " - and , best of all , brass instruments are more waterproof than violins , pianos and oboes .
today , as german churches struggle to attract the faithful , brass orchestras seem to have no problem recruiting members . " amazingly , the christian brass ensemble movement is growing , " said karsten heger , who has directed brass orchestras for 40 years .
" the ensembles do n't have to worry about finding new young members . "
heger estimated that there are 7,000 such ensembles in germany with some 120,000 members .
choir of horns bildunterschrift : chorales are the core of the brass orchestas ' repertoire it 's no accident that the german term " posaunenchor " includes the word ' choir ' .
their original aim was to mimic human voices as closely as possible , heger said .
the brass orchestras do play swing and jazz music , but chorales are one of the " main pillars of our work , " silaschi said .
chorales , generally written for four parts , were originally intended for vocal choirs or church congregations and are a staple of protestant church music .
like a vocal choir , each part can be played by an unlimited number of instrumentalists - which is a significant difference to other well-known brass formations like american army bands or british brass bands .
just last week , several thousand musicians of all ages gathered in essen for the annual national brass festival , which is sponsored by the german version of the ymca .
and at the beginning of the month , composer and trumpet player markus stockhausen opened the german protestant church day by conducting 1,500 brass players on the banks of the rhine river in cologne .
true to church roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brass instruments are practical : they 're portable and water-proof although over a century and a half has passed since the protestant revival in germany , brass orchestras have remained true to their church roots . the network of regional and state organizations in charge of the local ensembles not only provide opportunities for musical development and performance , instrument loans and scores : leaders also take a personal interest in passing on religious values to the musicians .
" the music is important , but it 's also important to know what our common foundation is , " said silaschi , who added that most rehearsals and events begin with a prayer or devotion .
still , brass players not involved in a church are invited to participate and diversity seems to be a key element of the amateur groups .
" my youngest member is nine and the oldest is 67 , " heger said of the ensemble in wilhelmshaven that he directs .
" all social groups are represented - you 'll have a doctor sitting next to a construction worker .
the abilities span a wide spectrum but we reach all groups . "
for the brass players , " reaching " people does n't just mean playing a chorale at church or a swing tune in the local convalescent hospital .

but germany 's " posaunenchöre " - literally , trombone choirs - are not your typical brass bands : they do n't even play folk music . go to any village festival or drop in at the local protestant church on a sunday morning and you 're bound to hear one .
and do n't be surprised if many of the musicians are n't even old enough to drive . the all-brass ensembles - a formation that 's unique to german-speaking countries - may have been around for over a century and a half , but that does n't stop more and more young people from taking part .
the origin of the amateur brass orchestra is closely linked to the development of the protestant church in germany .
after the enlightenment movement , which focused on humanism and rationalism , the leaders of the protestant revival movement in the mid-19th century were ready for something that spoke less to the head and more to the heart - and the ears .
they took the call in psalm 150 literally - " praise the lord with trumpets " - and replaced the more somber-sounding organ with the cheery sound of brass - everything from trumpets and trombones to french horns and tubas .
portable organs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things got a bit loud at the national brass orchestra festival last week " the brass orchestras play a key role in churches because they can open people 's heart , " said bernhard silaschi , chairman of the protestant brass orchestra service of germany , an umbrella organization representing some 30 state and regional groups . " music is a bridge and you do n't need many words . "
as the revival movement caught on and protestant churches outgrew their chapels , services were held outdoors or in makeshift tents .
the instruments were perfectly suited for it .
tubas are n't hard to carry - that 's how they got the nickname " portable organs " - and , best of all , brass instruments are more waterproof than violins , pianos and oboes .
today , as german churches struggle to attract the faithful , brass orchestras seem to have no problem recruiting members . " amazingly , the christian brass ensemble movement is growing , " said karsten heger , who has directed brass orchestras for 40 years .
" the ensembles do n't have to worry about finding new young members . "
heger estimated that there are 7,000 such ensembles in germany with some 120,000 members .
choir of horns bildunterschrift : chorales are the core of the brass orchestas ' repertoire it 's no accident that the german term " posaunenchor " includes the word ' choir ' .
their original aim was to mimic human voices as closely as possible , heger said .
the brass orchestras do play swing and jazz music , but chorales are one of the " main pillars of our work , " silaschi said .
chorales , generally written for four parts , were originally intended for vocal choirs or church congregations and are a staple of protestant church music .
like a vocal choir , each part can be played by an unlimited number of instrumentalists - which is a significant difference to other well-known brass formations like american army bands or british brass bands .
just last week , several thousand musicians of all ages gathered in essen for the annual national brass festival , which is sponsored by the german version of the ymca .

cruise is expected to play count claus schenk von stauffenberg , the military officer who led the plot and was promptly executed in a courtyard , close to his own office at the army and navy hq .
the german defense minister now uses the building as his office along with a defense ministry complex in bonn .
denying recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial for stauffenberg and others involved in the plot to kill hitler has been set up inside the german defense ministry in berlin antje blumenthal , party spokeswoman for the christian democrats on sect issues , said defense minister franz josef jung had assured her cruise would not be given a clearance to film inside the secure site .
she said letting cruise inside would have seemed like germany 's recognition of scientology .
babelsberg studios near berlin said the company was unaware of any shooting schedule for the movie with the working title " valkyrie , " and was still in co-production talks about the project .
the defense ministry said it had not received any request to use the building .
news reports said cruise had taken a look at the military building from outside and studio scenes were to begin on july 19 .
son complains stauffenberg 's oldest son , berthold , meanwhile said in remarks quoted friday by the german daily süddeutsche zeitung that he objected to a practicing scientologist playing his father .
" i hoped for a while that it was all just a publicity stunt by mr. cruise , " said the 72-year-old retired major general of the german bundeswehr .
he added that cruise " should keep his hands off my father . "
bildunterschrift : berthold stauffenberg -lrb- right -rrb- is not amused about cruise 's plans " it 's sure to be crap , " he said of the movie .
" of course i could be wrong - i would like to be . "
stauffenberg said cruise 's professed faith in scientology was " off-putting , " adding that the church was not a religion but a " business . "
go climbing instead " i am not saying that cruise is a bad actor - i can not judge that , " he said .
" but , in any case , i fear that it could turn into horrible kitsch . "
stauffenberg added that he had been deeply disappointed by previous films on his father .
while he said that he would not take legal action against the movie plan as his father was a historical figure , he hoped cruise would drop the project nevertheless .

eu leaders on friday entered a second day of tense negotiations on a european reform treaty with german chancellor angela merkel seeking to break down resistance from poland and britain . merkel said eu leaders were doing their " level best " to reach a compromise on a treaty and she was to meet the british and polish leaders to press the case .
" we are working hard , but the problems remain unresolved , " merkel said before the talks with kaczynski .
" but everyone is trying . "
merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy proposed a compromise about the eu voting system during talks in the early hours of friday with poland 's president lech kaczynski , but it remained unclear if the polish leader would accept the suggestion .
the polish news agency pap reported that earlier in the day kacyznski was not optimistic and convinced he held the most advantageous position for poland .
" poland is not in the habit of withdrawing when it is in the right , " he said .
more nations register opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aide to french president sarkozy said paris was optimistic about finding a compromise germany and its allies want the new treaty to update the eu 's rulebook for the 21st century , but poland is against the voting system and britain has also announced it has several doubts while the czech and dutch governments also have misgivings .
merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the month , said she wants agreement on a broad outline of a treaty at the summit so that it can be written over the next six months by an inter-governmental conference .
the new treaty is deemed necessary after the collapse of the proposed constitution , which french and dutch voters ' rejected two years ago and sent the bloc into an extended " period of contemplation . "
caught between two poles ? the german chancellor hoped to use a series of bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit to win over britain , poland , the netherlands and the czech republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski brothers have said poland 's proposal is the best solution to eu voting procedures but after little progress was made on the first day , she had a long day ahead amid expectations for the negotiations to drag into the night - and possibly the weekend - in a classic eu wrangling marathon .
poland is threatening to wreck efforts to forge a new institutional treaty because it believes it will lose decision-making power under the so-called double majority voting system proposed by germany . on friday , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , the president 's twin brother who did not attend the summit , said he would be willing to consider other options if his country 's plan on voting rules did not get approved at the summit . " if there is no agreement on the square root -lrb- voting plan -rrb- , then we could talk about other solutions , " kaczynski told a news conference , according to reuters news service . he added that poland wanted to " moderate the revolution " that the treaty plan would bring to the eu . his brother meanwhile suggested that the current system for distributing decision-making votes in the bloc agreed in 2000 should be extended until 2020 .
blair 's last " red lines " british prime minister tony blair , attending his final eu summit , on the other hand warned there were four " red lines " concerning national control over foreign policy , the judicial and police system , or tax and social security rules that he would not cross in the search for a compromise .

" the german chancellor wants to take a decision at the summit without poland , " said merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm in brussels . " the german presidency now wants to obtain a joint mandate of the 26 other countries for an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- . " he said . the goal of the igc would be to draw up a new treaty instead of the bloc 's constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
according to eu regulations , a simple majority of countries is needed to call such a conference .
any decisions reached at the conference , however , would have to be unanimous . " poland would then have the chance to join the european consensus at the governmental conference in the autumn , " wilhelm said . polish opposition to the " double majority " voting scheme , requiring that eu decisions have the support of 55 per cent of member states , representing 65 per cent of the population , has been one of the key stumbling blocks in efforts to strike a treaty deal . poland sees it as less favorable to medium-sized nations than the current voting share-out under which it has 27 votes , almost on a par with big eu states germany , britain , italy and france , which have been accorded 29 votes each . a failed attempt ? in an effort to end the ongoing impasse regarding eu voting rights , merkel on friday offered new concessions to poland as european union leaders entered a decisive end-game at summit talks in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins have been flexing poland 's muscles jo leinen , chairman of european parliament 's constitutional committee , said merkel had told the polish delegation that application of the eu 's " double majority " system for decisions would only be introduced in 2014 , instead of in 2009 when the new " reform " treaty is expected to come into force . this offer was , however , quickly turned down by poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . " if you ask me now , i 'd say that the negotiations are going to end with a veto , " kaczynski said in an interview with poland 's public tvp1 broadcaster . " what 's been proposed to us is not enough for us to be able to accept , " he added . merkel was also seeking to ease polish concerns through the introduction of a mechanism allowing a small group of countries to stop unfavorable decisions - even if they do not meet current eu criteria for forging a so-called " blocking minority . " wilhelm said the german eu presidency made repeated attempts to address polish demands and that the german offer had been " far-reaching . "
in the light of the polish rejection , however , wilhelm quoted merkel as saying it was important to take action to avoid " leaving europe to mark time . " no eu foreign minister ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair opposes the idea of ceding sovereignty on foreign policy to the eu in a concession to britain , germany agreed that the eu 's charter on fundamental rights would only be legally binding in areas covered by eu laws .
this means it would not apply to britain 's labor legislation . in addition , as demanded by britain , the treaty will not refer to the appointment of a first-ever " foreign minister " but to a " high representative for foreign and security policy , " which is already the job title held by javier solana , the eu 's current chief diplomat . britain claims that the title of foreign minister would give the impression that national governments were ceding sovereignty on foreign policy to the eu .
the newly proposed high representative , however , would also serve as a vice-president of the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm . in addition , the new foreign policy post would be backed up by an eu diplomatic service including commission officials and diplomats from national governments . the summit , chaired by merkel , was scheduled to end later on friday .

cruise is expected to play count claus schenk von stauffenberg , the military officer who led the plot and was promptly executed in a courtyard , close to his own office at the army and navy hq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 22.06.2007 merkel : eu to launch treaty talks without poland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is willing to go ahead without poland german chancellor angela merkel on friday said she would go ahead and propose a mandate for a new " reform " treaty for the 27-nation bloc even if poland does not give its go-ahead to the deal , german officials said . " the german chancellor wants to take a decision at the summit without poland , " said merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm in brussels . " the german presidency now wants to obtain a joint mandate of the 26 other countries for an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- . " he said . the goal of the igc would be to draw up a new treaty instead of the bloc 's constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
according to eu regulations , a simple majority of countries is needed to call such a conference .
any decisions reached at the conference , however , would have to be unanimous . " poland would then have the chance to join the european consensus at the governmental conference in the autumn , " wilhelm said . polish opposition to the " double majority " voting scheme , requiring that eu decisions have the support of 55 per cent of member states , representing 65 per cent of the population , has been one of the key stumbling blocks in efforts to strike a treaty deal . poland sees it as less favorable to medium-sized nations than the current voting share-out under which it has 27 votes , almost on a par with big eu states germany , britain , italy and france , which have been accorded 29 votes each . a failed attempt ? in an effort to end the ongoing impasse regarding eu voting rights , merkel on friday offered new concessions to poland as european union leaders entered a decisive end-game at summit talks in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins have been flexing poland 's muscles jo leinen , chairman of european parliament 's constitutional committee , said merkel had told the polish delegation that application of the eu 's " double majority " system for decisions would only be introduced in 2014 , instead of in 2009 when the new " reform " treaty is expected to come into force . this offer was , however , quickly turned down by poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . " if you ask me now , i 'd say that the negotiations are going to end with a veto , " kaczynski said in an interview with poland 's public tvp1 broadcaster . " what 's been proposed to us is not enough for us to be able to accept , " he added . merkel was also seeking to ease polish concerns through the introduction of a mechanism allowing a small group of countries to stop unfavorable decisions - even if they do not meet current eu criteria for forging a so-called " blocking minority . " wilhelm said the german eu presidency made repeated attempts to address polish demands and that the german offer had been " far-reaching . "
in the light of the polish rejection , however , wilhelm quoted merkel as saying it was important to take action to avoid " leaving europe to mark time . " no eu foreign minister ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair opposes the idea of ceding sovereignty on foreign policy to the eu in a concession to britain , germany agreed that the eu 's charter on fundamental rights would only be legally binding in areas covered by eu laws .
this means it would not apply to britain 's labor legislation . in addition , as demanded by britain , the treaty will not refer to the appointment of a first-ever " foreign minister " but to a " high representative for foreign and security policy , " which is already the job title held by javier solana , the eu 's current chief diplomat . britain claims that the title of foreign minister would give the impression that national governments were ceding sovereignty on foreign policy to the eu .
the newly proposed high representative , however , would also serve as a vice-president of the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm . in addition , the new foreign policy post would be backed up by an eu diplomatic service including commission officials and diplomats from national governments . the summit , chaired by merkel , was scheduled to end later on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.06.2007 opinion : political abuse of religious feelings is not a new tactic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outrage over the decision to honor author salman rushdie with a knighthood has been orchestrated to distract the public from other political problems in iran and pakistan , writes dw 's peter philipp . only the narrow-minded would interpret the manifestations of open irritation and public outrage in the streets of tehran and islamabad as the actual expression of the public 's mood .
they are not .
they are rather a finely orchestrated means for the authorities to serve a purpose .
to achieve their political goals or to distract from their own problems , the " security aware " - some may say " repressive " - regimes allow such demonstrations : against the insulting mohammed caricatures in denmark , against alleged desecration of the koran somewhere in the world or , as is currently the case , against the distinction being paid by the queen to british author salman rushdie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many demonstrators in front of the british embassies in tehran and islamabad today even knew who rushdie was 14 days ago ?
how many may have actually read the " satanic verses , " the book that garnered rushdie the anger of islamic extremists ?
probably none .
but that 's not really the point .
in 1989 , the iranian revolutionary leader khomeini issued a fatwa against then unknown rushdie , and iran put a price on the author 's head .
for 10 years rushdie had to go underground and live under police surveillance until tehran admitted that while the now deceased khomeini 's fatwa could not be revoked , it did not need to be implemented .
rushdie 's life could once again return to normal .
now that new demonstrations are being aimed at the author , it 's certainly not because of the " satanic verses . "
he is , after all , being recognized for his life 's work , not a single book .
but iranian and pakistani officials describe the knighthood as a new insult to one and half billion muslims .
and the pakistani religion minister raised the bar with the threat of a suicide attack to avenge this unfriendly act on the part of the british royal family .
as if that 's not an insult against all well-meaning people around the world , regardless of their religion , skin color or language .
such statements are a slap in the face to anyone who works for understanding and freedom - especially between cultures .
that includes muslims who believe in their religion 's true messages of freedom and understanding .
the abuse of religious sentiment for political means is not a new tactic .
but in the case of iran , one had hoped that things had changed .
and one even believed that they had in the case of pakistan , a country that is an important partner in the " fight against terror . "
in both cases the people are being thoughtlessly manipulated as a way of distraction from foreign and domestic problems , and the unforeseen consequences are being accepted .
in the end , it 's an easy call to make : the culprit has already been decided , and if anyone gets hurt during protests then the west will be responsible for that , too .
what satanic tactics .

they are not .
they are rather a finely orchestrated means for the authorities to serve a purpose .
to achieve their political goals or to distract from their own problems , the " security aware " - some may say " repressive " - regimes allow such demonstrations : against the insulting mohammed caricatures in denmark , against alleged desecration of the koran somewhere in the world or , as is currently the case , against the distinction being paid by the queen to british author salman rushdie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many demonstrators in front of the british embassies in tehran and islamabad today even knew who rushdie was 14 days ago ?
how many may have actually read the " satanic verses , " the book that garnered rushdie the anger of islamic extremists ?
probably none .
but that 's not really the point .
in 1989 , the iranian revolutionary leader khomeini issued a fatwa against then unknown rushdie , and iran put a price on the author 's head .
for 10 years rushdie had to go underground and live under police surveillance until tehran admitted that while the now deceased khomeini 's fatwa could not be revoked , it did not need to be implemented .
rushdie 's life could once again return to normal .
now that new demonstrations are being aimed at the author , it 's certainly not because of the " satanic verses . "
he is , after all , being recognized for his life 's work , not a single book .
but iranian and pakistani officials describe the knighthood as a new insult to one and half billion muslims .
and the pakistani religion minister raised the bar with the threat of a suicide attack to avenge this unfriendly act on the part of the british royal family .
as if that 's not an insult against all well-meaning people around the world , regardless of their religion , skin color or language .
such statements are a slap in the face to anyone who works for understanding and freedom - especially between cultures .
that includes muslims who believe in their religion 's true messages of freedom and understanding .
the abuse of religious sentiment for political means is not a new tactic .
but in the case of iran , one had hoped that things had changed .
and one even believed that they had in the case of pakistan , a country that is an important partner in the " fight against terror . "
in both cases the people are being thoughtlessly manipulated as a way of distraction from foreign and domestic problems , and the unforeseen consequences are being accepted .
in the end , it 's an easy call to make : the culprit has already been decided , and if anyone gets hurt during protests then the west will be responsible for that , too .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 22.06.2007 merkel : eu to launch treaty talks without poland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is willing to go ahead without poland german chancellor angela merkel on friday said she would go ahead and propose a mandate for a new " reform " treaty for the 27-nation bloc even if poland does not give its go-ahead to the deal , german officials said . " the german chancellor wants to take a decision at the summit without poland , " said merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm in brussels . " the german presidency now wants to obtain a joint mandate of the 26 other countries for an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- . " he said . the goal of the igc would be to draw up a new treaty instead of the bloc 's constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
according to eu regulations , a simple majority of countries is needed to call such a conference .
any decisions reached at the conference , however , would have to be unanimous . " poland would then have the chance to join the european consensus at the governmental conference in the autumn , " wilhelm said . polish opposition to the " double majority " voting scheme , requiring that eu decisions have the support of 55 per cent of member states , representing 65 per cent of the population , has been one of the key stumbling blocks in efforts to strike a treaty deal . poland sees it as less favorable to medium-sized nations than the current voting share-out under which it has 27 votes , almost on a par with big eu states germany , britain , italy and france , which have been accorded 29 votes each . a failed attempt ? in an effort to end the ongoing impasse regarding eu voting rights , merkel on friday offered new concessions to poland as european union leaders entered a decisive end-game at summit talks in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins have been flexing poland 's muscles jo leinen , chairman of european parliament 's constitutional committee , said merkel had told the polish delegation that application of the eu 's " double majority " system for decisions would only be introduced in 2014 , instead of in 2009 when the new " reform " treaty is expected to come into force . this offer was , however , quickly turned down by poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . " if you ask me now , i 'd say that the negotiations are going to end with a veto , " kaczynski said in an interview with poland 's public tvp1 broadcaster . " what 's been proposed to us is not enough for us to be able to accept , " he added . merkel was also seeking to ease polish concerns through the introduction of a mechanism allowing a small group of countries to stop unfavorable decisions - even if they do not meet current eu criteria for forging a so-called " blocking minority . " wilhelm said the german eu presidency made repeated attempts to address polish demands and that the german offer had been " far-reaching . "
in the light of the polish rejection , however , wilhelm quoted merkel as saying it was important to take action to avoid " leaving europe to mark time . " no eu foreign minister ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair opposes the idea of ceding sovereignty on foreign policy to the eu in a concession to britain , germany agreed that the eu 's charter on fundamental rights would only be legally binding in areas covered by eu laws .
this means it would not apply to britain 's labor legislation . in addition , as demanded by britain , the treaty will not refer to the appointment of a first-ever " foreign minister " but to a " high representative for foreign and security policy , " which is already the job title held by javier solana , the eu 's current chief diplomat . britain claims that the title of foreign minister would give the impression that national governments were ceding sovereignty on foreign policy to the eu .
the newly proposed high representative , however , would also serve as a vice-president of the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm . in addition , the new foreign policy post would be backed up by an eu diplomatic service including commission officials and diplomats from national governments . the summit , chaired by merkel , was scheduled to end later on friday .
but diplomats said discussions could stretch out into saturday to give leaders more time to break the deadlock . dw staff with agency reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the german chancellor wants to take a decision at the summit without poland , " said merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm in brussels . " the german presidency now wants to obtain a joint mandate of the 26 other countries for an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- . " he said . the goal of the igc would be to draw up a new treaty instead of the bloc 's constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
according to eu regulations , a simple majority of countries is needed to call such a conference .
any decisions reached at the conference , however , would have to be unanimous . " poland would then have the chance to join the european consensus at the governmental conference in the autumn , " wilhelm said . polish opposition to the " double majority " voting scheme , requiring that eu decisions have the support of 55 per cent of member states , representing 65 per cent of the population , has been one of the key stumbling blocks in efforts to strike a treaty deal . poland sees it as less favorable to medium-sized nations than the current voting share-out under which it has 27 votes , almost on a par with big eu states germany , britain , italy and france , which have been accorded 29 votes each . a failed attempt ? in an effort to end the ongoing impasse regarding eu voting rights , merkel on friday offered new concessions to poland as european union leaders entered a decisive end-game at summit talks in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins have been flexing poland 's muscles jo leinen , chairman of european parliament 's constitutional committee , said merkel had told the polish delegation that application of the eu 's " double majority " system for decisions would only be introduced in 2014 , instead of in 2009 when the new " reform " treaty is expected to come into force . this offer was , however , quickly turned down by poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . " if you ask me now , i 'd say that the negotiations are going to end with a veto , " kaczynski said in an interview with poland 's public tvp1 broadcaster . " what 's been proposed to us is not enough for us to be able to accept , " he added . merkel was also seeking to ease polish concerns through the introduction of a mechanism allowing a small group of countries to stop unfavorable decisions - even if they do not meet current eu criteria for forging a so-called " blocking minority . " wilhelm said the german eu presidency made repeated attempts to address polish demands and that the german offer had been " far-reaching . "
in the light of the polish rejection , however , wilhelm quoted merkel as saying it was important to take action to avoid " leaving europe to mark time . " no eu foreign minister ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair opposes the idea of ceding sovereignty on foreign policy to the eu in a concession to britain , germany agreed that the eu 's charter on fundamental rights would only be legally binding in areas covered by eu laws .
this means it would not apply to britain 's labor legislation . in addition , as demanded by britain , the treaty will not refer to the appointment of a first-ever " foreign minister " but to a " high representative for foreign and security policy , " which is already the job title held by javier solana , the eu 's current chief diplomat . britain claims that the title of foreign minister would give the impression that national governments were ceding sovereignty on foreign policy to the eu .
the newly proposed high representative , however , would also serve as a vice-president of the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm . in addition , the new foreign policy post would be backed up by an eu diplomatic service including commission officials and diplomats from national governments . the summit , chaired by merkel , was scheduled to end later on friday .
but diplomats said discussions could stretch out into saturday to give leaders more time to break the deadlock . dw staff with agency reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.06.2007 opinion : political abuse of religious feelings is not a new tactic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outrage over the decision to honor author salman rushdie with a knighthood has been orchestrated to distract the public from other political problems in iran and pakistan , writes dw 's peter philipp . only the narrow-minded would interpret the manifestations of open irritation and public outrage in the streets of tehran and islamabad as the actual expression of the public 's mood .
they are not .
they are rather a finely orchestrated means for the authorities to serve a purpose .
to achieve their political goals or to distract from their own problems , the " security aware " - some may say " repressive " - regimes allow such demonstrations : against the insulting mohammed caricatures in denmark , against alleged desecration of the koran somewhere in the world or , as is currently the case , against the distinction being paid by the queen to british author salman rushdie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many demonstrators in front of the british embassies in tehran and islamabad today even knew who rushdie was 14 days ago ?
how many may have actually read the " satanic verses , " the book that garnered rushdie the anger of islamic extremists ?
probably none .
but that 's not really the point .
in 1989 , the iranian revolutionary leader khomeini issued a fatwa against then unknown rushdie , and iran put a price on the author 's head .
for 10 years rushdie had to go underground and live under police surveillance until tehran admitted that while the now deceased khomeini 's fatwa could not be revoked , it did not need to be implemented .
rushdie 's life could once again return to normal .
now that new demonstrations are being aimed at the author , it 's certainly not because of the " satanic verses . "
he is , after all , being recognized for his life 's work , not a single book .
but iranian and pakistani officials describe the knighthood as a new insult to one and half billion muslims .
and the pakistani religion minister raised the bar with the threat of a suicide attack to avenge this unfriendly act on the part of the british royal family .
as if that 's not an insult against all well-meaning people around the world , regardless of their religion , skin color or language .
such statements are a slap in the face to anyone who works for understanding and freedom - especially between cultures .
that includes muslims who believe in their religion 's true messages of freedom and understanding .
the abuse of religious sentiment for political means is not a new tactic .
but in the case of iran , one had hoped that things had changed .
and one even believed that they had in the case of pakistan , a country that is an important partner in the " fight against terror . "
in both cases the people are being thoughtlessly manipulated as a way of distraction from foreign and domestic problems , and the unforeseen consequences are being accepted .
in the end , it 's an easy call to make : the culprit has already been decided , and if anyone gets hurt during protests then the west will be responsible for that , too .
what satanic tactics .

the united nations has confirmed that the outgoing british premier is under discussion for the role and us president george bush reportedly is also in favor . the united nations confirmed on thursday that blair is under discussion to fill the vacant position of middle east envoy .
" the issue was raised with -lrb- un -rrb- secretary general -lrb- ban ki-moon -rrb- during different conversations with some quartet principals , " said un spokeswoman michele montas .
on wednesday , blair is due to hand over the reins as britain 's prime minister to gordon brown after a decade of holding the post . the 54-year old has made clear he 's not ready to retire from the world stage .
two senior us administration sources said blair 's aides indicated he was interested in the position , the bbc reported .
the prime minister 's spokesman said there was lots of speculation over blair 's future , much of it " inaccurate , " according to the bbc .
the white house on thursday refused to confirm or deny reports that bush wanted blair to take up the post .
olmert enthusiastic israel 's premier would welcome blair as envoy , a spokeswoman said friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert would like to see blair in the post " prime minister olmert sees tony blair as a very positive figure in the region and he would be very happy to see him continuing to be involved , " miri eisin told afp .
britain 's conservative daily telegraph wrote on friday that blair should take the job , though it pointed out that his relationship to russia was strained and he was reviled in the arab world " as the invader of iraq and … bush 's closest foreign ally . "
however , the paper went on , " he had shown in northern ireland his patient expertise as a negotiator , strikingly vindicated by last month 's restoration of devolved government .
he will also carry the heft of a world leader , an authority that could not be wielded by the last holder of this role . "
former world bank chief james wolfensohn resigned in may 2006 after one year as middle east envoy .
he was frustrated by the slow implementation of the quartet 's so-called road map , which was supposed to lead to the creation of a palestinian state by 2005 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united nations has confirmed that the outgoing british premier is under discussion for the role and us president george bush reportedly is also in favor . the united nations confirmed on thursday that blair is under discussion to fill the vacant position of middle east envoy .
" the issue was raised with -lrb- un -rrb- secretary general -lrb- ban ki-moon -rrb- during different conversations with some quartet principals , " said un spokeswoman michele montas .
on wednesday , blair is due to hand over the reins as britain 's prime minister to gordon brown after a decade of holding the post . the 54-year old has made clear he 's not ready to retire from the world stage .
two senior us administration sources said blair 's aides indicated he was interested in the position , the bbc reported .
the prime minister 's spokesman said there was lots of speculation over blair 's future , much of it " inaccurate , " according to the bbc .
the white house on thursday refused to confirm or deny reports that bush wanted blair to take up the post .
olmert enthusiastic israel 's premier would welcome blair as envoy , a spokeswoman said friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert would like to see blair in the post " prime minister olmert sees tony blair as a very positive figure in the region and he would be very happy to see him continuing to be involved , " miri eisin told afp .
britain 's conservative daily telegraph wrote on friday that blair should take the job , though it pointed out that his relationship to russia was strained and he was reviled in the arab world " as the invader of iraq and … bush 's closest foreign ally . "
however , the paper went on , " he had shown in northern ireland his patient expertise as a negotiator , strikingly vindicated by last month 's restoration of devolved government .
he will also carry the heft of a world leader , an authority that could not be wielded by the last holder of this role . "
former world bank chief james wolfensohn resigned in may 2006 after one year as middle east envoy .
he was frustrated by the slow implementation of the quartet 's so-called road map , which was supposed to lead to the creation of a palestinian state by 2005 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu leaders on friday entered a second day of tense negotiations on a european reform treaty with german chancellor angela merkel seeking to break down resistance from poland and britain . merkel said eu leaders were doing their " level best " to reach a compromise on a treaty and she was to meet the british and polish leaders to press the case .
" we are working hard , but the problems remain unresolved , " merkel said before the talks with kaczynski .
" but everyone is trying . "
merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy proposed a compromise about the eu voting system during talks in the early hours of friday with poland 's president lech kaczynski , but it remained unclear if the polish leader would accept the suggestion .
the polish news agency pap reported that earlier in the day kacyznski was not optimistic and convinced he held the most advantageous position for poland .
" poland is not in the habit of withdrawing when it is in the right , " he said .

merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the month , said she wants agreement on a broad outline of a treaty at the summit so that it can be written over the next six months by an inter-governmental conference .

poland is threatening to wreck efforts to forge a new institutional treaty because it believes it will lose decision-making power under the so-called double majority voting system proposed by germany . on friday , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , the president 's twin brother who did not attend the summit , said he would be willing to consider other options if his country 's plan on voting rules did not get approved at the summit . " if there is no agreement on the square root -lrb- voting plan -rrb- , then we could talk about other solutions , " kaczynski told a news conference , according to reuters news service . he added that poland wanted to " moderate the revolution " that the treaty plan would bring to the eu . his brother meanwhile suggested that the current system for distributing decision-making votes in the bloc agreed in 2000 should be extended until 2020 .

more nations register opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aide to french president sarkozy said paris was optimistic about finding a compromise germany and its allies want the new treaty to update the eu 's rulebook for the 21st century , but poland is against the voting system and britain has also announced it has several doubts while the czech and dutch governments also have misgivings .
merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the month , said she wants agreement on a broad outline of a treaty at the summit so that it can be written over the next six months by an inter-governmental conference .
the new treaty is deemed necessary after the collapse of the proposed constitution , which french and dutch voters ' rejected two years ago and sent the bloc into an extended " period of contemplation . "
caught between two poles ? the german chancellor hoped to use a series of bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit to win over britain , poland , the netherlands and the czech republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski brothers have said poland 's proposal is the best solution to eu voting procedures but after little progress was made on the first day , she had a long day ahead amid expectations for the negotiations to drag into the night - and possibly the weekend - in a classic eu wrangling marathon .
poland is threatening to wreck efforts to forge a new institutional treaty because it believes it will lose decision-making power under the so-called double majority voting system proposed by germany . on friday , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , the president 's twin brother who did not attend the summit , said he would be willing to consider other options if his country 's plan on voting rules did not get approved at the summit . " if there is no agreement on the square root -lrb- voting plan -rrb- , then we could talk about other solutions , " kaczynski told a news conference , according to reuters news service . he added that poland wanted to " moderate the revolution " that the treaty plan would bring to the eu . his brother meanwhile suggested that the current system for distributing decision-making votes in the bloc agreed in 2000 should be extended until 2020 .
blair 's last " red lines " british prime minister tony blair , attending his final eu summit , on the other hand warned there were four " red lines " concerning national control over foreign policy , the judicial and police system , or tax and social security rules that he would not cross in the search for a compromise .
the dutch want a bigger role for national parliaments in the new treaty while the czechs sympathize with poland in opposition to the proposed voting rules , though some experts have said that support is only half-hearted .
poland , whose leaders have said it is " willing to die , " appeared after talks broke up late thursday to be moving as a number of different proposals were circulated to accommodate warsaw .
further discussions required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders are trying to decide what direction the eu should take in the future " there are proposals which could be a solution equivalent to our proposition , but they need to be discussed some more , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga said , adding that meetings with " key partners " would follow .
after his debut on the eu stage , french leader sarkozy said he had seen " a strong willingness to find a compromise , " but that soothing poland 's fears could prove difficult .
as the first day of talks stretched into friday , sarkozy made a compromise solution to poland in a bid to persuade it to drop its opposition to voting procedures , said his spokesman david martinon .
under the proposal , a small group of countries who had almost enough votes to block a decision would be able to have it re-examined , but a polish source told the afp news agency the compromise " does n't go far enough " and added that warsaw had made a counter-proposal , signaling that debate on the issue was far from over . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- sms / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

top german officials said suicide bombers could carry out attacks within the country and that the security situation was more serious than it had been since 2001 . the likelihood of terrorist attacks in germany has increased , officials from the interior and foreign ministries said on friday .
border controls have been stepped up as well as the search for possible islamist terrorists .
" there is information about suicide bombers directed towards germany ' , " a spokesman for the interior ministry said on friday .
german federal crime office head jörg ziercke confirmed the arrest of three germans in pakistan who belonged to a group of 10 german islamists who had settled in the region of pakistan and afghanistan in recent months .
the men were all converts to islam who had become radicals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops in afghanistan have been targeted before ziercke referred to a june 9 video broadcast on us tv channel abc that showed mansur dadullah , the brother of a recently killed taliban military leader , visiting a training camp in afghanistan .
in the video , dadallah saw off four men who said they were on their way to carry out suicide attacks in the united states , canada , britain and germany .
security officials alarmed " we are alarmed , " deputy interior minister august hanning said in a meeting with journalists on thursday evening .
he also said there had been indications of possible terror attacks in germany .
" we have moved fully into the sights of the islamic terror , " he added .
" we are experiencing a new quality of danger : germany is threatened with suicide bombers , " hanning told the daily süddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- .
german soldiers , police officers and humanitarian aid workers in afghanistan were particularly at risk , the sz reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany must not give in to terrorists , schäuble said an attack was carried out on a german embassy convoy of cars last weekend , foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said on friday .
the personnel had made it to the embassy unhurt , but one car had been torched in the attack .
plötner refused to give further details for security reasons .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble said attacks on germans , such as those in afghanistan , could also occur within the country .
no longer abstract threats " i think one can no longer say that we ' only ' face an abstract danger , " said schäuble 's christian democratic party colleague wolfgang bosbach , the party 's deputy parliamentary group leader , on german news channel n-tv .
bosbach said the threats were " concrete . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombs went off at madrid 's atocha station in march 2004 security experts have drawn a parallel to the situation in madrid in 2004 , in which a terror attack influenced national politics .
almost 200 people were killed when terrorists detonated bombs on commuter trains in the run-up to spanish parliamentary elections , which were at the time perceived as a referendum on whether the country should keep its soldiers in iraq .
the socialist party , which had vowed to bring the troops home , subsequently won the election and carried through on its promise .
germany 's parliament is due to vote in october on whether to renew its armed forces ' mission in afghanistan .
" germany must continue its engagement there and should not dare to allow itself to be bombed away by criminals , " schäuble said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . poland is within its rights and is right to stick to its position on the eu 's voting structure . - walter rymsza , poland i think that there is only one way forward for europe and this is to find a common goal and unity , without the squabble over who has more voting rights .
the european idea might die one of these days .
people might ask themselves what the sense is of their country being in the eu if they ca n't find a common goal .
maybe equal rights for every member state , no matter how big or how small and how many citizens it has - this might be an idea . - mike h. roesemann , us poland should understand that there will have to be concessions on its part if it wants to participate in the eu .
i personally think that germany has the right to have its share of votes , because of the economic , diplomatic and social power that it has .
for poland to have comparable strength within the union then there should be reform in the voting process , but until then poland should work with the eu . - milan , slovakia for the polish leader to say that the eu voting system should be based on poland 's pre-world war two population is disturbing .
with comments like that , it will be difficult for germany to reconcile with its neighbor .

as much as i 'm concerned at how the media , in particular german media , in labeling their headlines when it comes to poland , i can certainly say that poland is not trying to dampen the hopes of the eu treaty 's success as this article claims .
poland is only trying to hammer out the bugs in the eu constitution , taking lessons from history .
to inflame the situation like germany is only worsening the atmosphere surrounding a discussion that should be carried out without rushing .
germany is pushing to get the constitution finalized as if something were on fire .
every time poland starts the conversation , germany slams down its might , accusing poland of threatening the constitution .

the united nations has confirmed that the outgoing british premier is under discussion for the role and us president george bush reportedly is also in favor . the united nations confirmed on thursday that blair is under discussion to fill the vacant position of middle east envoy .
" the issue was raised with -lrb- un -rrb- secretary general -lrb- ban ki-moon -rrb- during different conversations with some quartet principals , " said un spokeswoman michele montas .
on wednesday , blair is due to hand over the reins as britain 's prime minister to gordon brown after a decade of holding the post . the 54-year old has made clear he 's not ready to retire from the world stage .
two senior us administration sources said blair 's aides indicated he was interested in the position , the bbc reported .
the prime minister 's spokesman said there was lots of speculation over blair 's future , much of it " inaccurate , " according to the bbc .
the white house on thursday refused to confirm or deny reports that bush wanted blair to take up the post .
olmert enthusiastic israel 's premier would welcome blair as envoy , a spokeswoman said friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert would like to see blair in the post " prime minister olmert sees tony blair as a very positive figure in the region and he would be very happy to see him continuing to be involved , " miri eisin told afp .
britain 's conservative daily telegraph wrote on friday that blair should take the job , though it pointed out that his relationship to russia was strained and he was reviled in the arab world " as the invader of iraq and … bush 's closest foreign ally . "
however , the paper went on , " he had shown in northern ireland his patient expertise as a negotiator , strikingly vindicated by last month 's restoration of devolved government .
he will also carry the heft of a world leader , an authority that could not be wielded by the last holder of this role . "
former world bank chief james wolfensohn resigned in may 2006 after one year as middle east envoy .
he was frustrated by the slow implementation of the quartet 's so-called road map , which was supposed to lead to the creation of a palestinian state by 2005 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but germany 's " posaunenchöre " - literally , trombone choirs - are not your typical brass bands : they do n't even play folk music . go to any village festival or drop in at the local protestant church on a sunday morning and you 're bound to hear one .
and do n't be surprised if many of the musicians are n't even old enough to drive . the all-brass ensembles - a formation that 's unique to german-speaking countries - may have been around for over a century and a half , but that does n't stop more and more young people from taking part .
the origin of the amateur brass orchestra is closely linked to the development of the protestant church in germany .
after the enlightenment movement , which focused on humanism and rationalism , the leaders of the protestant revival movement in the mid-19th century were ready for something that spoke less to the head and more to the heart - and the ears .
they took the call in psalm 150 literally - " praise the lord with trumpets " - and replaced the more somber-sounding organ with the cheery sound of brass - everything from trumpets and trombones to french horns and tubas .

" music is a bridge and you do n't need many words . "

the instruments were perfectly suited for it .
tubas are n't hard to carry - that 's how they got the nickname " portable organs " - and , best of all , brass instruments are more waterproof than violins , pianos and oboes .
today , as german churches struggle to attract the faithful , brass orchestras seem to have no problem recruiting members . " amazingly , the christian brass ensemble movement is growing , " said karsten heger , who has directed brass orchestras for 40 years .
" the ensembles do n't have to worry about finding new young members . "

but germany 's " posaunenchöre " - literally , trombone choirs - are not your typical brass bands : they do n't even play folk music . go to any village festival or drop in at the local protestant church on a sunday morning and you 're bound to hear one .
and do n't be surprised if many of the musicians are n't even old enough to drive . the all-brass ensembles - a formation that 's unique to german-speaking countries - may have been around for over a century and a half , but that does n't stop more and more young people from taking part .
the origin of the amateur brass orchestra is closely linked to the development of the protestant church in germany .
after the enlightenment movement , which focused on humanism and rationalism , the leaders of the protestant revival movement in the mid-19th century were ready for something that spoke less to the head and more to the heart - and the ears .
they took the call in psalm 150 literally - " praise the lord with trumpets " - and replaced the more somber-sounding organ with the cheery sound of brass - everything from trumpets and trombones to french horns and tubas .
portable organs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things got a bit loud at the national brass orchestra festival last week " the brass orchestras play a key role in churches because they can open people 's heart , " said bernhard silaschi , chairman of the protestant brass orchestra service of germany , an umbrella organization representing some 30 state and regional groups . " music is a bridge and you do n't need many words . "
as the revival movement caught on and protestant churches outgrew their chapels , services were held outdoors or in makeshift tents .
the instruments were perfectly suited for it .
tubas are n't hard to carry - that 's how they got the nickname " portable organs " - and , best of all , brass instruments are more waterproof than violins , pianos and oboes .
today , as german churches struggle to attract the faithful , brass orchestras seem to have no problem recruiting members . " amazingly , the christian brass ensemble movement is growing , " said karsten heger , who has directed brass orchestras for 40 years .
" the ensembles do n't have to worry about finding new young members . "
heger estimated that there are 7,000 such ensembles in germany with some 120,000 members .
choir of horns bildunterschrift : chorales are the core of the brass orchestas ' repertoire it 's no accident that the german term " posaunenchor " includes the word ' choir ' .
their original aim was to mimic human voices as closely as possible , heger said .
the brass orchestras do play swing and jazz music , but chorales are one of the " main pillars of our work , " silaschi said .
chorales , generally written for four parts , were originally intended for vocal choirs or church congregations and are a staple of protestant church music .
like a vocal choir , each part can be played by an unlimited number of instrumentalists - which is a significant difference to other well-known brass formations like american army bands or british brass bands .
just last week , several thousand musicians of all ages gathered in essen for the annual national brass festival , which is sponsored by the german version of the ymca .
and at the beginning of the month , composer and trumpet player markus stockhausen opened the german protestant church day by conducting 1,500 brass players on the banks of the rhine river in cologne .
true to church roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brass instruments are practical : they 're portable and water-proof although over a century and a half has passed since the protestant revival in germany , brass orchestras have remained true to their church roots . the network of regional and state organizations in charge of the local ensembles not only provide opportunities for musical development and performance , instrument loans and scores : leaders also take a personal interest in passing on religious values to the musicians .
" the music is important , but it 's also important to know what our common foundation is , " said silaschi , who added that most rehearsals and events begin with a prayer or devotion .
still , brass players not involved in a church are invited to participate and diversity seems to be a key element of the amateur groups .
" my youngest member is nine and the oldest is 67 , " heger said of the ensemble in wilhelmshaven that he directs .
" all social groups are represented - you 'll have a doctor sitting next to a construction worker .
the abilities span a wide spectrum but we reach all groups . "
for the brass players , " reaching " people does n't just mean playing a chorale at church or a swing tune in the local convalescent hospital .

germany 's highest-ranking cardinal has warned against indifference and uncritical tolerance which he says could lead to islam enjoying equal standing with christianity in the country . cardinal karl lehmann , who is head of the german conference of bishops , expressed concern about religious freedom leading to all faiths being treated equally regardless of the size of their flock and their history . germany 's constitution obliges the state to maintain strict religious neutrality .
but lehmann pointed to christianity 's role in shaping european history and even its legal culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann " the deep cultural connection between christianity and our legal state , that goes back to the middle ages and before , can not simply be ignored , " lehmann said in a speech in karlsruhe . germany continues to struggle to integrate its 3.2 million muslims , over half of whom are of turkish origin , primarily " guest workers " who came to work during the country 's postwar economic boom , and their children . integration problems the government has been concerned about the potential radicalization of disillusioned young muslims and organized an islam conference last year to try to help muslims mesh with mainstream society .

the construction of a large mosque in the western city of cologne has set off a wave of intense opposition among many local residents . " i do n't want to say i am worried , but i have an uneasy feeling , " cardinal joachim meisner of cologne said of the mosque in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio on wednesday . meisner , who last year banned catholic children from praying with muslim classmates , said a real test of religious tolerance would be whether christians could build churches and worship freely in turkey , as muslims can in germany . chancellor angela merkel , the daughter of a protestant pastor , said in april she expected turkey to take action to show it was tolerant of christianity after the killing of three people , including a german , at a turkish bible publishing house . mixed reactions from politicians ronald pofalla , the general secretary of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union party , said lehmann was right to say islam could not be afforded the same legal standing in germany as christianity , although he added no one should prevent muslims from practicing their religion in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think the eu ca n't cope with a muslim country such as turkey as a member " unlike christianity , islam is not in europe 's cultural center and is not reflected in everyday life in the same way , " pofalla said in a statement .

but lehmann pointed to christianity 's role in shaping european history and even its legal culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann " the deep cultural connection between christianity and our legal state , that goes back to the middle ages and before , can not simply be ignored , " lehmann said in a speech in karlsruhe . germany continues to struggle to integrate its 3.2 million muslims , over half of whom are of turkish origin , primarily " guest workers " who came to work during the country 's postwar economic boom , and their children . integration problems the government has been concerned about the potential radicalization of disillusioned young muslims and organized an islam conference last year to try to help muslims mesh with mainstream society .
germany has western europe 's second-biggest muslim population after france . the conference has made little progress so far on sensitive issues such as religion lessons , girls ' participation in sports and the legal status of a new islamic grouping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the planned mosque demonstrated in cologne lehmann 's comments come amid a sensitive time for muslim-christian relations in germany .

but germany 's " posaunenchöre " - literally , trombone choirs - are not your typical brass bands : they do n't even play folk music . go to any village festival or drop in at the local protestant church on a sunday morning and you 're bound to hear one .
and do n't be surprised if many of the musicians are n't even old enough to drive . the all-brass ensembles - a formation that 's unique to german-speaking countries - may have been around for over a century and a half , but that does n't stop more and more young people from taking part .
the origin of the amateur brass orchestra is closely linked to the development of the protestant church in germany .
after the enlightenment movement , which focused on humanism and rationalism , the leaders of the protestant revival movement in the mid-19th century were ready for something that spoke less to the head and more to the heart - and the ears .
they took the call in psalm 150 literally - " praise the lord with trumpets " - and replaced the more somber-sounding organ with the cheery sound of brass - everything from trumpets and trombones to french horns and tubas .
portable organs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things got a bit loud at the national brass orchestra festival last week " the brass orchestras play a key role in churches because they can open people 's heart , " said bernhard silaschi , chairman of the protestant brass orchestra service of germany , an umbrella organization representing some 30 state and regional groups . " music is a bridge and you do n't need many words . "
as the revival movement caught on and protestant churches outgrew their chapels , services were held outdoors or in makeshift tents .
the instruments were perfectly suited for it .
tubas are n't hard to carry - that 's how they got the nickname " portable organs " - and , best of all , brass instruments are more waterproof than violins , pianos and oboes .
today , as german churches struggle to attract the faithful , brass orchestras seem to have no problem recruiting members . " amazingly , the christian brass ensemble movement is growing , " said karsten heger , who has directed brass orchestras for 40 years .
" the ensembles do n't have to worry about finding new young members . "
heger estimated that there are 7,000 such ensembles in germany with some 120,000 members .
choir of horns bildunterschrift : chorales are the core of the brass orchestas ' repertoire it 's no accident that the german term " posaunenchor " includes the word ' choir ' .
their original aim was to mimic human voices as closely as possible , heger said .
the brass orchestras do play swing and jazz music , but chorales are one of the " main pillars of our work , " silaschi said .
chorales , generally written for four parts , were originally intended for vocal choirs or church congregations and are a staple of protestant church music .
like a vocal choir , each part can be played by an unlimited number of instrumentalists - which is a significant difference to other well-known brass formations like american army bands or british brass bands .
just last week , several thousand musicians of all ages gathered in essen for the annual national brass festival , which is sponsored by the german version of the ymca .
and at the beginning of the month , composer and trumpet player markus stockhausen opened the german protestant church day by conducting 1,500 brass players on the banks of the rhine river in cologne .
true to church roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brass instruments are practical : they 're portable and water-proof although over a century and a half has passed since the protestant revival in germany , brass orchestras have remained true to their church roots . the network of regional and state organizations in charge of the local ensembles not only provide opportunities for musical development and performance , instrument loans and scores : leaders also take a personal interest in passing on religious values to the musicians .
" the music is important , but it 's also important to know what our common foundation is , " said silaschi , who added that most rehearsals and events begin with a prayer or devotion .
still , brass players not involved in a church are invited to participate and diversity seems to be a key element of the amateur groups .
" my youngest member is nine and the oldest is 67 , " heger said of the ensemble in wilhelmshaven that he directs .
" all social groups are represented - you 'll have a doctor sitting next to a construction worker .
the abilities span a wide spectrum but we reach all groups . "
for the brass players , " reaching " people does n't just mean playing a chorale at church or a swing tune in the local convalescent hospital .
silaschi recently appeared with an ensemble on the harald schmidt show , one of germany 's most-watched late-night comedy shows , to advertise a major " posaunenchor " festival planned for next year .

" the german presidency now wants to obtain a joint mandate of the 26 other countries for an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- . " he said . the goal of the igc would be to draw up a new treaty instead of the bloc 's constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
according to eu regulations , a simple majority of countries is needed to call such a conference .
any decisions reached at the conference , however , would have to be unanimous . " poland would then have the chance to join the european consensus at the governmental conference in the autumn , " wilhelm said . polish opposition to the " double majority " voting scheme , requiring that eu decisions have the support of 55 per cent of member states , representing 65 per cent of the population , has been one of the key stumbling blocks in efforts to strike a treaty deal . poland sees it as less favorable to medium-sized nations than the current voting share-out under which it has 27 votes , almost on a par with big eu states germany , britain , italy and france , which have been accorded 29 votes each . a failed attempt ? in an effort to end the ongoing impasse regarding eu voting rights , merkel on friday offered new concessions to poland as european union leaders entered a decisive end-game at summit talks in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins have been flexing poland 's muscles jo leinen , chairman of european parliament 's constitutional committee , said merkel had told the polish delegation that application of the eu 's " double majority " system for decisions would only be introduced in 2014 , instead of in 2009 when the new " reform " treaty is expected to come into force . this offer was , however , quickly turned down by poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . " if you ask me now , i 'd say that the negotiations are going to end with a veto , " kaczynski said in an interview with poland 's public tvp1 broadcaster .

" wilhelm said the german eu presidency made repeated attempts to address polish demands and that the german offer had been " far-reaching . "
in the light of the polish rejection , however , wilhelm quoted merkel as saying it was important to take action to avoid " leaving europe to mark time . " no eu foreign minister ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair opposes the idea of ceding sovereignty on foreign policy to the eu in a concession to britain , germany agreed that the eu 's charter on fundamental rights would only be legally binding in areas covered by eu laws .

the newly proposed high representative , however , would also serve as a vice-president of the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm . in addition , the new foreign policy post would be backed up by an eu diplomatic service including commission officials and diplomats from national governments . the summit , chaired by merkel , was scheduled to end later on friday .

cruise is expected to play count claus schenk von stauffenberg , the military officer who led the plot and was promptly executed in a courtyard , close to his own office at the army and navy hq .
the german defense minister now uses the building as his office along with a defense ministry complex in bonn .
denying recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial for stauffenberg and others involved in the plot to kill hitler has been set up inside the german defense ministry in berlin antje blumenthal , party spokeswoman for the christian democrats on sect issues , said defense minister franz josef jung had assured her cruise would not be given a clearance to film inside the secure site .
she said letting cruise inside would have seemed like germany 's recognition of scientology .
babelsberg studios near berlin said the company was unaware of any shooting schedule for the movie with the working title " valkyrie , " and was still in co-production talks about the project .
the defense ministry said it had not received any request to use the building .
news reports said cruise had taken a look at the military building from outside and studio scenes were to begin on july 19 .
son complains stauffenberg 's oldest son , berthold , meanwhile said in remarks quoted friday by the german daily süddeutsche zeitung that he objected to a practicing scientologist playing his father .
" i hoped for a while that it was all just a publicity stunt by mr. cruise , " said the 72-year-old retired major general of the german bundeswehr .
he added that cruise " should keep his hands off my father . "
bildunterschrift : berthold stauffenberg -lrb- right -rrb- is not amused about cruise 's plans " it 's sure to be crap , " he said of the movie .
" of course i could be wrong - i would like to be . "
stauffenberg said cruise 's professed faith in scientology was " off-putting , " adding that the church was not a religion but a " business . "
go climbing instead " i am not saying that cruise is a bad actor - i can not judge that , " he said .
" but , in any case , i fear that it could turn into horrible kitsch . "
stauffenberg added that he had been deeply disappointed by previous films on his father .
while he said that he would not take legal action against the movie plan as his father was a historical figure , he hoped cruise would drop the project nevertheless .
bildunterschrift : cruise should enjoy germany 's mountains instead of making a movie , stauffenberg says " he should climb a mountain or go surfing in the caribbean , " he said .

they are not .
they are rather a finely orchestrated means for the authorities to serve a purpose .
to achieve their political goals or to distract from their own problems , the " security aware " - some may say " repressive " - regimes allow such demonstrations : against the insulting mohammed caricatures in denmark , against alleged desecration of the koran somewhere in the world or , as is currently the case , against the distinction being paid by the queen to british author salman rushdie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many demonstrators in front of the british embassies in tehran and islamabad today even knew who rushdie was 14 days ago ?
how many may have actually read the " satanic verses , " the book that garnered rushdie the anger of islamic extremists ?
probably none .
but that 's not really the point .
in 1989 , the iranian revolutionary leader khomeini issued a fatwa against then unknown rushdie , and iran put a price on the author 's head .
for 10 years rushdie had to go underground and live under police surveillance until tehran admitted that while the now deceased khomeini 's fatwa could not be revoked , it did not need to be implemented .
rushdie 's life could once again return to normal .
now that new demonstrations are being aimed at the author , it 's certainly not because of the " satanic verses . "
he is , after all , being recognized for his life 's work , not a single book .
but iranian and pakistani officials describe the knighthood as a new insult to one and half billion muslims .
and the pakistani religion minister raised the bar with the threat of a suicide attack to avenge this unfriendly act on the part of the british royal family .
as if that 's not an insult against all well-meaning people around the world , regardless of their religion , skin color or language .
such statements are a slap in the face to anyone who works for understanding and freedom - especially between cultures .
that includes muslims who believe in their religion 's true messages of freedom and understanding .
the abuse of religious sentiment for political means is not a new tactic .
but in the case of iran , one had hoped that things had changed .
and one even believed that they had in the case of pakistan , a country that is an important partner in the " fight against terror . "
in both cases the people are being thoughtlessly manipulated as a way of distraction from foreign and domestic problems , and the unforeseen consequences are being accepted .
in the end , it 's an easy call to make : the culprit has already been decided , and if anyone gets hurt during protests then the west will be responsible for that , too .

to achieve their political goals or to distract from their own problems , the " security aware " - some may say " repressive " - regimes allow such demonstrations : against the insulting mohammed caricatures in denmark , against alleged desecration of the koran somewhere in the world or , as is currently the case , against the distinction being paid by the queen to british author salman rushdie .

how many may have actually read the " satanic verses , " the book that garnered rushdie the anger of islamic extremists ?
probably none .
but that 's not really the point .
in 1989 , the iranian revolutionary leader khomeini issued a fatwa against then unknown rushdie , and iran put a price on the author 's head .
for 10 years rushdie had to go underground and live under police surveillance until tehran admitted that while the now deceased khomeini 's fatwa could not be revoked , it did not need to be implemented .
rushdie 's life could once again return to normal .
now that new demonstrations are being aimed at the author , it 's certainly not because of the " satanic verses . "
he is , after all , being recognized for his life 's work , not a single book .
but iranian and pakistani officials describe the knighthood as a new insult to one and half billion muslims .
and the pakistani religion minister raised the bar with the threat of a suicide attack to avenge this unfriendly act on the part of the british royal family .
as if that 's not an insult against all well-meaning people around the world , regardless of their religion , skin color or language .
such statements are a slap in the face to anyone who works for understanding and freedom - especially between cultures .
that includes muslims who believe in their religion 's true messages of freedom and understanding .
the abuse of religious sentiment for political means is not a new tactic .
but in the case of iran , one had hoped that things had changed .
and one even believed that they had in the case of pakistan , a country that is an important partner in the " fight against terror . "
in both cases the people are being thoughtlessly manipulated as a way of distraction from foreign and domestic problems , and the unforeseen consequences are being accepted .
in the end , it 's an easy call to make : the culprit has already been decided , and if anyone gets hurt during protests then the west will be responsible for that , too .

as the european union entered discussion this week on revising the draft of its constitutional treaty , poland expressed discontentment with the existing voting system .
readers responded to this week 's discussion . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . poland is within its rights and is right to stick to its position on the eu 's voting structure . - walter rymsza , poland i think that there is only one way forward for europe and this is to find a common goal and unity , without the squabble over who has more voting rights .
the european idea might die one of these days .
people might ask themselves what the sense is of their country being in the eu if they ca n't find a common goal .
maybe equal rights for every member state , no matter how big or how small and how many citizens it has - this might be an idea . - mike h. roesemann , us poland should understand that there will have to be concessions on its part if it wants to participate in the eu .
i personally think that germany has the right to have its share of votes , because of the economic , diplomatic and social power that it has .
for poland to have comparable strength within the union then there should be reform in the voting process , but until then poland should work with the eu . - milan , slovakia for the polish leader to say that the eu voting system should be based on poland 's pre-world war two population is disturbing .
with comments like that , it will be difficult for germany to reconcile with its neighbor .
one wonders why germany tried so hard to help them join the eu .
germany should say that they will go with poland 's voting plan once silesia is returned to german territory . - william conners , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski do n't quite see eye to eye on the treaty issue poland has every right to take a stand on its position .
just as every country in the united nations does , regardless of its population , each country in the eu should be fairly treated , despite how large or small it is .
i am from hawaii , and being the smallest state in the us , we still have a fair voice on all issues going through congress and the senate .
give poland their chance to speak out . - christine karas , us i think the idea of the constitution should be dropped .
an amending treaty is all that is required to help take the eu forward . - kevin blanking , great britain i am disappointed in the present polish leadership .
no person and no nation inhabiting this world are without fault !
let 's reach out in hope and trust and not be possessed by the spirit of reciprocation .
look at the relationship that developed between germany and france - it inspires because their leaders and most inhabitants embraced forgiveness , mutual respect , and hope . - elisabeth heptner , us i was born in poland but have lived in canada for the past half of my life so i am able to understand both sides of the story .
as much as i 'm concerned at how the media , in particular german media , in labeling their headlines when it comes to poland , i can certainly say that poland is not trying to dampen the hopes of the eu treaty 's success as this article claims .
poland is only trying to hammer out the bugs in the eu constitution , taking lessons from history .
to inflame the situation like germany is only worsening the atmosphere surrounding a discussion that should be carried out without rushing .
germany is pushing to get the constitution finalized as if something were on fire .
every time poland starts the conversation , germany slams down its might , accusing poland of threatening the constitution .
i think germany 's the real threat to the constitution , as it is oppressive to all outside suggestions that do n't result in germany as the major stake holder . - tom varga , poland these kaczynski twins remind me of our president george w. bush .
maybe that 's why they get along so well .
there has to be room to negotiate , and right-wingers or left-wingers are not so good at that .
i think the world will be a better place with a strong eu .
people in the eu need to realize that the world is not perfect and will never be perfect . - lee davis , us i think poland is pushing for a new voting system in the eu which would be more democratic one than that presented in the constitutional treaty .
the evidence demonstrated by poland proves the fairness of the polish proposal . - stanislav sendek , slovakia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu leaders struggle to reach agreement on new treaty eu leaders on friday entered a second day of tense negotiations on a european reform treaty with german chancellor angela merkel seeking to break down resistance from poland and britain .
-lrb- 22.06.2007 -rrb- polish prime minister brings world war two into eu vote debate in arguing for poland to receive more voting influence in a reworked eu treaty , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has said his own reform plan takes the number of poles killed in world war two into account .
-lrb- 21.06.2007 -rrb- poland dampens hopes for eu treaty success poland seemed to have softened its public tone on the eve of a crucial eu treaty summit , but concerns run deep in the country about not being taken seriously for plans to change the bloc 's reformed voting system .

eu leaders on friday entered a second day of tense negotiations on a european reform treaty with german chancellor angela merkel seeking to break down resistance from poland and britain . merkel said eu leaders were doing their " level best " to reach a compromise on a treaty and she was to meet the british and polish leaders to press the case .
" we are working hard , but the problems remain unresolved , " merkel said before the talks with kaczynski .
" but everyone is trying . "
merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy proposed a compromise about the eu voting system during talks in the early hours of friday with poland 's president lech kaczynski , but it remained unclear if the polish leader would accept the suggestion .
the polish news agency pap reported that earlier in the day kacyznski was not optimistic and convinced he held the most advantageous position for poland .
" poland is not in the habit of withdrawing when it is in the right , " he said .

merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the month , said she wants agreement on a broad outline of a treaty at the summit so that it can be written over the next six months by an inter-governmental conference .
the new treaty is deemed necessary after the collapse of the proposed constitution , which french and dutch voters ' rejected two years ago and sent the bloc into an extended " period of contemplation . "

poland is threatening to wreck efforts to forge a new institutional treaty because it believes it will lose decision-making power under the so-called double majority voting system proposed by germany . on friday , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , the president 's twin brother who did not attend the summit , said he would be willing to consider other options if his country 's plan on voting rules did not get approved at the summit . " if there is no agreement on the square root -lrb- voting plan -rrb- , then we could talk about other solutions , " kaczynski told a news conference , according to reuters news service . he added that poland wanted to " moderate the revolution " that the treaty plan would bring to the eu . his brother meanwhile suggested that the current system for distributing decision-making votes in the bloc agreed in 2000 should be extended until 2020 .

the dutch want a bigger role for national parliaments in the new treaty while the czechs sympathize with poland in opposition to the proposed voting rules , though some experts have said that support is only half-hearted .

after his debut on the eu stage , french leader sarkozy said he had seen " a strong willingness to find a compromise , " but that soothing poland 's fears could prove difficult .
as the first day of talks stretched into friday , sarkozy made a compromise solution to poland in a bid to persuade it to drop its opposition to voting procedures , said his spokesman david martinon .

eu leaders on friday entered a second day of tense negotiations on a european reform treaty with german chancellor angela merkel seeking to break down resistance from poland and britain . merkel said eu leaders were doing their " level best " to reach a compromise on a treaty and she was to meet the british and polish leaders to press the case .
" we are working hard , but the problems remain unresolved , " merkel said before the talks with kaczynski .
" but everyone is trying . "
merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy proposed a compromise about the eu voting system during talks in the early hours of friday with poland 's president lech kaczynski , but it remained unclear if the polish leader would accept the suggestion .
the polish news agency pap reported that earlier in the day kacyznski was not optimistic and convinced he held the most advantageous position for poland .

further discussions required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders are trying to decide what direction the eu should take in the future " there are proposals which could be a solution equivalent to our proposition , but they need to be discussed some more , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga said , adding that meetings with " key partners " would follow .
after his debut on the eu stage , french leader sarkozy said he had seen " a strong willingness to find a compromise , " but that soothing poland 's fears could prove difficult .
as the first day of talks stretched into friday , sarkozy made a compromise solution to poland in a bid to persuade it to drop its opposition to voting procedures , said his spokesman david martinon .
under the proposal , a small group of countries who had almost enough votes to block a decision would be able to have it re-examined , but a polish source told the afp news agency the compromise " does n't go far enough " and added that warsaw had made a counter-proposal , signaling that debate on the issue was far from over . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- sms / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the german chancellor wants to take a decision at the summit without poland , " said merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm in brussels . " the german presidency now wants to obtain a joint mandate of the 26 other countries for an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- . " he said . the goal of the igc would be to draw up a new treaty instead of the bloc 's constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
according to eu regulations , a simple majority of countries is needed to call such a conference .
any decisions reached at the conference , however , would have to be unanimous . " poland would then have the chance to join the european consensus at the governmental conference in the autumn , " wilhelm said . polish opposition to the " double majority " voting scheme , requiring that eu decisions have the support of 55 per cent of member states , representing 65 per cent of the population , has been one of the key stumbling blocks in efforts to strike a treaty deal . poland sees it as less favorable to medium-sized nations than the current voting share-out under which it has 27 votes , almost on a par with big eu states germany , britain , italy and france , which have been accorded 29 votes each . a failed attempt ? in an effort to end the ongoing impasse regarding eu voting rights , merkel on friday offered new concessions to poland as european union leaders entered a decisive end-game at summit talks in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins have been flexing poland 's muscles jo leinen , chairman of european parliament 's constitutional committee , said merkel had told the polish delegation that application of the eu 's " double majority " system for decisions would only be introduced in 2014 , instead of in 2009 when the new " reform " treaty is expected to come into force . this offer was , however , quickly turned down by poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . " if you ask me now , i 'd say that the negotiations are going to end with a veto , " kaczynski said in an interview with poland 's public tvp1 broadcaster . " what 's been proposed to us is not enough for us to be able to accept , " he added . merkel was also seeking to ease polish concerns through the introduction of a mechanism allowing a small group of countries to stop unfavorable decisions - even if they do not meet current eu criteria for forging a so-called " blocking minority . " wilhelm said the german eu presidency made repeated attempts to address polish demands and that the german offer had been " far-reaching . "
in the light of the polish rejection , however , wilhelm quoted merkel as saying it was important to take action to avoid " leaving europe to mark time . " no eu foreign minister ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair opposes the idea of ceding sovereignty on foreign policy to the eu in a concession to britain , germany agreed that the eu 's charter on fundamental rights would only be legally binding in areas covered by eu laws .
this means it would not apply to britain 's labor legislation . in addition , as demanded by britain , the treaty will not refer to the appointment of a first-ever " foreign minister " but to a " high representative for foreign and security policy , " which is already the job title held by javier solana , the eu 's current chief diplomat . britain claims that the title of foreign minister would give the impression that national governments were ceding sovereignty on foreign policy to the eu .
the newly proposed high representative , however , would also serve as a vice-president of the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm . in addition , the new foreign policy post would be backed up by an eu diplomatic service including commission officials and diplomats from national governments . the summit , chaired by merkel , was scheduled to end later on friday .
but diplomats said discussions could stretch out into saturday to give leaders more time to break the deadlock . dw staff with agency reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's highest-ranking cardinal has warned against indifference and uncritical tolerance which he says could lead to islam enjoying equal standing with christianity in the country . cardinal karl lehmann , who is head of the german conference of bishops , expressed concern about religious freedom leading to all faiths being treated equally regardless of the size of their flock and their history . germany 's constitution obliges the state to maintain strict religious neutrality .
but lehmann pointed to christianity 's role in shaping european history and even its legal culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann " the deep cultural connection between christianity and our legal state , that goes back to the middle ages and before , can not simply be ignored , " lehmann said in a speech in karlsruhe . germany continues to struggle to integrate its 3.2 million muslims , over half of whom are of turkish origin , primarily " guest workers " who came to work during the country 's postwar economic boom , and their children . integration problems the government has been concerned about the potential radicalization of disillusioned young muslims and organized an islam conference last year to try to help muslims mesh with mainstream society .
germany has western europe 's second-biggest muslim population after france . the conference has made little progress so far on sensitive issues such as religion lessons , girls ' participation in sports and the legal status of a new islamic grouping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the planned mosque demonstrated in cologne lehmann 's comments come amid a sensitive time for muslim-christian relations in germany .
the construction of a large mosque in the western city of cologne has set off a wave of intense opposition among many local residents . " i do n't want to say i am worried , but i have an uneasy feeling , " cardinal joachim meisner of cologne said of the mosque in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio on wednesday . meisner , who last year banned catholic children from praying with muslim classmates , said a real test of religious tolerance would be whether christians could build churches and worship freely in turkey , as muslims can in germany . chancellor angela merkel , the daughter of a protestant pastor , said in april she expected turkey to take action to show it was tolerant of christianity after the killing of three people , including a german , at a turkish bible publishing house . mixed reactions from politicians ronald pofalla , the general secretary of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union party , said lehmann was right to say islam could not be afforded the same legal standing in germany as christianity , although he added no one should prevent muslims from practicing their religion in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think the eu ca n't cope with a muslim country such as turkey as a member " unlike christianity , islam is not in europe 's cultural center and is not reflected in everyday life in the same way , " pofalla said in a statement . " only those who are conscious of their cultural and social roots can freely and openly stand up for the rights of people of different faiths , " he added . but left-leaning politicians criticized lehmann 's statements . the leader of the green party 's parliamentary group , volker beck , said germany 's constitution required islam be treated the same as christianity . " the cardinal is wrong if he concludes that europe 's or germany 's undoubtedly christian character infers a legal discrimination of other religious communities , " he said . lale akgün , a social democratic parliamentarian in charge of islam issues , said lehmann was not looking clearly at the reality of life in germany . " whoever says that islam can not be put on an equal legal footing -lrb- as other religions -rrb- is stoking social unrest , " she said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 22.06.2007 germany 's christian brass ensembles stay true to their roots großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blowing their hearts out say " german " and " brass " and you might be forgiven for thinking of oompah-bands .
but germany 's " posaunenchöre " - literally , trombone choirs - are not your typical brass bands : they do n't even play folk music . go to any village festival or drop in at the local protestant church on a sunday morning and you 're bound to hear one .
and do n't be surprised if many of the musicians are n't even old enough to drive . the all-brass ensembles - a formation that 's unique to german-speaking countries - may have been around for over a century and a half , but that does n't stop more and more young people from taking part .
the origin of the amateur brass orchestra is closely linked to the development of the protestant church in germany .
after the enlightenment movement , which focused on humanism and rationalism , the leaders of the protestant revival movement in the mid-19th century were ready for something that spoke less to the head and more to the heart - and the ears .
they took the call in psalm 150 literally - " praise the lord with trumpets " - and replaced the more somber-sounding organ with the cheery sound of brass - everything from trumpets and trombones to french horns and tubas .
portable organs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things got a bit loud at the national brass orchestra festival last week " the brass orchestras play a key role in churches because they can open people 's heart , " said bernhard silaschi , chairman of the protestant brass orchestra service of germany , an umbrella organization representing some 30 state and regional groups . " music is a bridge and you do n't need many words . "
as the revival movement caught on and protestant churches outgrew their chapels , services were held outdoors or in makeshift tents .
the instruments were perfectly suited for it .
tubas are n't hard to carry - that 's how they got the nickname " portable organs " - and , best of all , brass instruments are more waterproof than violins , pianos and oboes .
today , as german churches struggle to attract the faithful , brass orchestras seem to have no problem recruiting members . " amazingly , the christian brass ensemble movement is growing , " said karsten heger , who has directed brass orchestras for 40 years .
" the ensembles do n't have to worry about finding new young members . "
heger estimated that there are 7,000 such ensembles in germany with some 120,000 members .
choir of horns bildunterschrift : chorales are the core of the brass orchestas ' repertoire it 's no accident that the german term " posaunenchor " includes the word ' choir ' .
their original aim was to mimic human voices as closely as possible , heger said .
the brass orchestras do play swing and jazz music , but chorales are one of the " main pillars of our work , " silaschi said .
chorales , generally written for four parts , were originally intended for vocal choirs or church congregations and are a staple of protestant church music .
like a vocal choir , each part can be played by an unlimited number of instrumentalists - which is a significant difference to other well-known brass formations like american army bands or british brass bands .
just last week , several thousand musicians of all ages gathered in essen for the annual national brass festival , which is sponsored by the german version of the ymca .
and at the beginning of the month , composer and trumpet player markus stockhausen opened the german protestant church day by conducting 1,500 brass players on the banks of the rhine river in cologne .
true to church roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brass instruments are practical : they 're portable and water-proof although over a century and a half has passed since the protestant revival in germany , brass orchestras have remained true to their church roots . the network of regional and state organizations in charge of the local ensembles not only provide opportunities for musical development and performance , instrument loans and scores : leaders also take a personal interest in passing on religious values to the musicians .
" the music is important , but it 's also important to know what our common foundation is , " said silaschi , who added that most rehearsals and events begin with a prayer or devotion .
still , brass players not involved in a church are invited to participate and diversity seems to be a key element of the amateur groups .
" my youngest member is nine and the oldest is 67 , " heger said of the ensemble in wilhelmshaven that he directs .
" all social groups are represented - you 'll have a doctor sitting next to a construction worker .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 22.06.2007 germany 's christian brass ensembles stay true to their roots großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blowing their hearts out say " german " and " brass " and you might be forgiven for thinking of oompah-bands .
but germany 's " posaunenchöre " - literally , trombone choirs - are not your typical brass bands : they do n't even play folk music . go to any village festival or drop in at the local protestant church on a sunday morning and you 're bound to hear one .
and do n't be surprised if many of the musicians are n't even old enough to drive . the all-brass ensembles - a formation that 's unique to german-speaking countries - may have been around for over a century and a half , but that does n't stop more and more young people from taking part .
the origin of the amateur brass orchestra is closely linked to the development of the protestant church in germany .
after the enlightenment movement , which focused on humanism and rationalism , the leaders of the protestant revival movement in the mid-19th century were ready for something that spoke less to the head and more to the heart - and the ears .
they took the call in psalm 150 literally - " praise the lord with trumpets " - and replaced the more somber-sounding organ with the cheery sound of brass - everything from trumpets and trombones to french horns and tubas .
portable organs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things got a bit loud at the national brass orchestra festival last week " the brass orchestras play a key role in churches because they can open people 's heart , " said bernhard silaschi , chairman of the protestant brass orchestra service of germany , an umbrella organization representing some 30 state and regional groups . " music is a bridge and you do n't need many words . "
as the revival movement caught on and protestant churches outgrew their chapels , services were held outdoors or in makeshift tents .
the instruments were perfectly suited for it .
tubas are n't hard to carry - that 's how they got the nickname " portable organs " - and , best of all , brass instruments are more waterproof than violins , pianos and oboes .
today , as german churches struggle to attract the faithful , brass orchestras seem to have no problem recruiting members . " amazingly , the christian brass ensemble movement is growing , " said karsten heger , who has directed brass orchestras for 40 years .
" the ensembles do n't have to worry about finding new young members . "
heger estimated that there are 7,000 such ensembles in germany with some 120,000 members .
choir of horns bildunterschrift : chorales are the core of the brass orchestas ' repertoire it 's no accident that the german term " posaunenchor " includes the word ' choir ' .
their original aim was to mimic human voices as closely as possible , heger said .
the brass orchestras do play swing and jazz music , but chorales are one of the " main pillars of our work , " silaschi said .
chorales , generally written for four parts , were originally intended for vocal choirs or church congregations and are a staple of protestant church music .
like a vocal choir , each part can be played by an unlimited number of instrumentalists - which is a significant difference to other well-known brass formations like american army bands or british brass bands .
just last week , several thousand musicians of all ages gathered in essen for the annual national brass festival , which is sponsored by the german version of the ymca .
and at the beginning of the month , composer and trumpet player markus stockhausen opened the german protestant church day by conducting 1,500 brass players on the banks of the rhine river in cologne .
true to church roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brass instruments are practical : they 're portable and water-proof although over a century and a half has passed since the protestant revival in germany , brass orchestras have remained true to their church roots . the network of regional and state organizations in charge of the local ensembles not only provide opportunities for musical development and performance , instrument loans and scores : leaders also take a personal interest in passing on religious values to the musicians .
" the music is important , but it 's also important to know what our common foundation is , " said silaschi , who added that most rehearsals and events begin with a prayer or devotion .
still , brass players not involved in a church are invited to participate and diversity seems to be a key element of the amateur groups .
" my youngest member is nine and the oldest is 67 , " heger said of the ensemble in wilhelmshaven that he directs .
" all social groups are represented - you 'll have a doctor sitting next to a construction worker .
the abilities span a wide spectrum but we reach all groups . "
for the brass players , " reaching " people does n't just mean playing a chorale at church or a swing tune in the local convalescent hospital .
silaschi recently appeared with an ensemble on the harald schmidt show , one of germany 's most-watched late-night comedy shows , to advertise a major " posaunenchor " festival planned for next year .

germany 's highest-ranking cardinal has warned against indifference and uncritical tolerance which he says could lead to islam enjoying equal standing with christianity in the country . cardinal karl lehmann , who is head of the german conference of bishops , expressed concern about religious freedom leading to all faiths being treated equally regardless of the size of their flock and their history . germany 's constitution obliges the state to maintain strict religious neutrality .
but lehmann pointed to christianity 's role in shaping european history and even its legal culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann " the deep cultural connection between christianity and our legal state , that goes back to the middle ages and before , can not simply be ignored , " lehmann said in a speech in karlsruhe . germany continues to struggle to integrate its 3.2 million muslims , over half of whom are of turkish origin , primarily " guest workers " who came to work during the country 's postwar economic boom , and their children . integration problems the government has been concerned about the potential radicalization of disillusioned young muslims and organized an islam conference last year to try to help muslims mesh with mainstream society .
germany has western europe 's second-biggest muslim population after france . the conference has made little progress so far on sensitive issues such as religion lessons , girls ' participation in sports and the legal status of a new islamic grouping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the planned mosque demonstrated in cologne lehmann 's comments come amid a sensitive time for muslim-christian relations in germany .
the construction of a large mosque in the western city of cologne has set off a wave of intense opposition among many local residents . " i do n't want to say i am worried , but i have an uneasy feeling , " cardinal joachim meisner of cologne said of the mosque in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio on wednesday . meisner , who last year banned catholic children from praying with muslim classmates , said a real test of religious tolerance would be whether christians could build churches and worship freely in turkey , as muslims can in germany . chancellor angela merkel , the daughter of a protestant pastor , said in april she expected turkey to take action to show it was tolerant of christianity after the killing of three people , including a german , at a turkish bible publishing house . mixed reactions from politicians ronald pofalla , the general secretary of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union party , said lehmann was right to say islam could not be afforded the same legal standing in germany as christianity , although he added no one should prevent muslims from practicing their religion in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think the eu ca n't cope with a muslim country such as turkey as a member " unlike christianity , islam is not in europe 's cultural center and is not reflected in everyday life in the same way , " pofalla said in a statement . " only those who are conscious of their cultural and social roots can freely and openly stand up for the rights of people of different faiths , " he added . but left-leaning politicians criticized lehmann 's statements . the leader of the green party 's parliamentary group , volker beck , said germany 's constitution required islam be treated the same as christianity . " the cardinal is wrong if he concludes that europe 's or germany 's undoubtedly christian character infers a legal discrimination of other religious communities , " he said . lale akgün , a social democratic parliamentarian in charge of islam issues , said lehmann was not looking clearly at the reality of life in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 22.06.2007 germany 's christian brass ensembles stay true to their roots großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blowing their hearts out say " german " and " brass " and you might be forgiven for thinking of oompah-bands .
but germany 's " posaunenchöre " - literally , trombone choirs - are not your typical brass bands : they do n't even play folk music . go to any village festival or drop in at the local protestant church on a sunday morning and you 're bound to hear one .
and do n't be surprised if many of the musicians are n't even old enough to drive . the all-brass ensembles - a formation that 's unique to german-speaking countries - may have been around for over a century and a half , but that does n't stop more and more young people from taking part .
the origin of the amateur brass orchestra is closely linked to the development of the protestant church in germany .
after the enlightenment movement , which focused on humanism and rationalism , the leaders of the protestant revival movement in the mid-19th century were ready for something that spoke less to the head and more to the heart - and the ears .
they took the call in psalm 150 literally - " praise the lord with trumpets " - and replaced the more somber-sounding organ with the cheery sound of brass - everything from trumpets and trombones to french horns and tubas .
portable organs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things got a bit loud at the national brass orchestra festival last week " the brass orchestras play a key role in churches because they can open people 's heart , " said bernhard silaschi , chairman of the protestant brass orchestra service of germany , an umbrella organization representing some 30 state and regional groups . " music is a bridge and you do n't need many words . "
as the revival movement caught on and protestant churches outgrew their chapels , services were held outdoors or in makeshift tents .
the instruments were perfectly suited for it .
tubas are n't hard to carry - that 's how they got the nickname " portable organs " - and , best of all , brass instruments are more waterproof than violins , pianos and oboes .
today , as german churches struggle to attract the faithful , brass orchestras seem to have no problem recruiting members . " amazingly , the christian brass ensemble movement is growing , " said karsten heger , who has directed brass orchestras for 40 years .
" the ensembles do n't have to worry about finding new young members . "
heger estimated that there are 7,000 such ensembles in germany with some 120,000 members .
choir of horns bildunterschrift : chorales are the core of the brass orchestas ' repertoire it 's no accident that the german term " posaunenchor " includes the word ' choir ' .
their original aim was to mimic human voices as closely as possible , heger said .
the brass orchestras do play swing and jazz music , but chorales are one of the " main pillars of our work , " silaschi said .
chorales , generally written for four parts , were originally intended for vocal choirs or church congregations and are a staple of protestant church music .
like a vocal choir , each part can be played by an unlimited number of instrumentalists - which is a significant difference to other well-known brass formations like american army bands or british brass bands .
just last week , several thousand musicians of all ages gathered in essen for the annual national brass festival , which is sponsored by the german version of the ymca .
and at the beginning of the month , composer and trumpet player markus stockhausen opened the german protestant church day by conducting 1,500 brass players on the banks of the rhine river in cologne .
true to church roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brass instruments are practical : they 're portable and water-proof although over a century and a half has passed since the protestant revival in germany , brass orchestras have remained true to their church roots . the network of regional and state organizations in charge of the local ensembles not only provide opportunities for musical development and performance , instrument loans and scores : leaders also take a personal interest in passing on religious values to the musicians .
" the music is important , but it 's also important to know what our common foundation is , " said silaschi , who added that most rehearsals and events begin with a prayer or devotion .
still , brass players not involved in a church are invited to participate and diversity seems to be a key element of the amateur groups .
" my youngest member is nine and the oldest is 67 , " heger said of the ensemble in wilhelmshaven that he directs .
" all social groups are represented - you 'll have a doctor sitting next to a construction worker .
the abilities span a wide spectrum but we reach all groups . "
for the brass players , " reaching " people does n't just mean playing a chorale at church or a swing tune in the local convalescent hospital .

and do n't be surprised if many of the musicians are n't even old enough to drive . the all-brass ensembles - a formation that 's unique to german-speaking countries - may have been around for over a century and a half , but that does n't stop more and more young people from taking part .
the origin of the amateur brass orchestra is closely linked to the development of the protestant church in germany .
after the enlightenment movement , which focused on humanism and rationalism , the leaders of the protestant revival movement in the mid-19th century were ready for something that spoke less to the head and more to the heart - and the ears .
they took the call in psalm 150 literally - " praise the lord with trumpets " - and replaced the more somber-sounding organ with the cheery sound of brass - everything from trumpets and trombones to french horns and tubas .
portable organs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things got a bit loud at the national brass orchestra festival last week " the brass orchestras play a key role in churches because they can open people 's heart , " said bernhard silaschi , chairman of the protestant brass orchestra service of germany , an umbrella organization representing some 30 state and regional groups . " music is a bridge and you do n't need many words . "
as the revival movement caught on and protestant churches outgrew their chapels , services were held outdoors or in makeshift tents .
the instruments were perfectly suited for it .
tubas are n't hard to carry - that 's how they got the nickname " portable organs " - and , best of all , brass instruments are more waterproof than violins , pianos and oboes .
today , as german churches struggle to attract the faithful , brass orchestras seem to have no problem recruiting members . " amazingly , the christian brass ensemble movement is growing , " said karsten heger , who has directed brass orchestras for 40 years .
" the ensembles do n't have to worry about finding new young members . "
heger estimated that there are 7,000 such ensembles in germany with some 120,000 members .
choir of horns bildunterschrift : chorales are the core of the brass orchestas ' repertoire it 's no accident that the german term " posaunenchor " includes the word ' choir ' .
their original aim was to mimic human voices as closely as possible , heger said .
the brass orchestras do play swing and jazz music , but chorales are one of the " main pillars of our work , " silaschi said .
chorales , generally written for four parts , were originally intended for vocal choirs or church congregations and are a staple of protestant church music .
like a vocal choir , each part can be played by an unlimited number of instrumentalists - which is a significant difference to other well-known brass formations like american army bands or british brass bands .
just last week , several thousand musicians of all ages gathered in essen for the annual national brass festival , which is sponsored by the german version of the ymca .
and at the beginning of the month , composer and trumpet player markus stockhausen opened the german protestant church day by conducting 1,500 brass players on the banks of the rhine river in cologne .
true to church roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brass instruments are practical : they 're portable and water-proof although over a century and a half has passed since the protestant revival in germany , brass orchestras have remained true to their church roots . the network of regional and state organizations in charge of the local ensembles not only provide opportunities for musical development and performance , instrument loans and scores : leaders also take a personal interest in passing on religious values to the musicians .
" the music is important , but it 's also important to know what our common foundation is , " said silaschi , who added that most rehearsals and events begin with a prayer or devotion .
still , brass players not involved in a church are invited to participate and diversity seems to be a key element of the amateur groups .
" my youngest member is nine and the oldest is 67 , " heger said of the ensemble in wilhelmshaven that he directs .
" all social groups are represented - you 'll have a doctor sitting next to a construction worker .
the abilities span a wide spectrum but we reach all groups . "
for the brass players , " reaching " people does n't just mean playing a chorale at church or a swing tune in the local convalescent hospital .
silaschi recently appeared with an ensemble on the harald schmidt show , one of germany 's most-watched late-night comedy shows , to advertise a major " posaunenchor " festival planned for next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 22.06.2007 readers weigh in on poland 's stance in treaty discussions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way should the eu go ?
as the european union entered discussion this week on revising the draft of its constitutional treaty , poland expressed discontentment with the existing voting system .
readers responded to this week 's discussion . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . poland is within its rights and is right to stick to its position on the eu 's voting structure . - walter rymsza , poland i think that there is only one way forward for europe and this is to find a common goal and unity , without the squabble over who has more voting rights .
the european idea might die one of these days .
people might ask themselves what the sense is of their country being in the eu if they ca n't find a common goal .
maybe equal rights for every member state , no matter how big or how small and how many citizens it has - this might be an idea . - mike h. roesemann , us poland should understand that there will have to be concessions on its part if it wants to participate in the eu .
i personally think that germany has the right to have its share of votes , because of the economic , diplomatic and social power that it has .
for poland to have comparable strength within the union then there should be reform in the voting process , but until then poland should work with the eu . - milan , slovakia for the polish leader to say that the eu voting system should be based on poland 's pre-world war two population is disturbing .

as the european union entered discussion this week on revising the draft of its constitutional treaty , poland expressed discontentment with the existing voting system .
readers responded to this week 's discussion . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . poland is within its rights and is right to stick to its position on the eu 's voting structure . - walter rymsza , poland i think that there is only one way forward for europe and this is to find a common goal and unity , without the squabble over who has more voting rights .
the european idea might die one of these days .
people might ask themselves what the sense is of their country being in the eu if they ca n't find a common goal .
maybe equal rights for every member state , no matter how big or how small and how many citizens it has - this might be an idea . - mike h. roesemann , us poland should understand that there will have to be concessions on its part if it wants to participate in the eu .
i personally think that germany has the right to have its share of votes , because of the economic , diplomatic and social power that it has .
for poland to have comparable strength within the union then there should be reform in the voting process , but until then poland should work with the eu . - milan , slovakia for the polish leader to say that the eu voting system should be based on poland 's pre-world war two population is disturbing .
with comments like that , it will be difficult for germany to reconcile with its neighbor .
one wonders why germany tried so hard to help them join the eu .
germany should say that they will go with poland 's voting plan once silesia is returned to german territory . - william conners , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski do n't quite see eye to eye on the treaty issue poland has every right to take a stand on its position .
just as every country in the united nations does , regardless of its population , each country in the eu should be fairly treated , despite how large or small it is .
i am from hawaii , and being the smallest state in the us , we still have a fair voice on all issues going through congress and the senate .
give poland their chance to speak out . - christine karas , us i think the idea of the constitution should be dropped .
an amending treaty is all that is required to help take the eu forward . - kevin blanking , great britain i am disappointed in the present polish leadership .
no person and no nation inhabiting this world are without fault !
let 's reach out in hope and trust and not be possessed by the spirit of reciprocation .
look at the relationship that developed between germany and france - it inspires because their leaders and most inhabitants embraced forgiveness , mutual respect , and hope . - elisabeth heptner , us i was born in poland but have lived in canada for the past half of my life so i am able to understand both sides of the story .
as much as i 'm concerned at how the media , in particular german media , in labeling their headlines when it comes to poland , i can certainly say that poland is not trying to dampen the hopes of the eu treaty 's success as this article claims .
poland is only trying to hammer out the bugs in the eu constitution , taking lessons from history .
to inflame the situation like germany is only worsening the atmosphere surrounding a discussion that should be carried out without rushing .
germany is pushing to get the constitution finalized as if something were on fire .
every time poland starts the conversation , germany slams down its might , accusing poland of threatening the constitution .
i think germany 's the real threat to the constitution , as it is oppressive to all outside suggestions that do n't result in germany as the major stake holder . - tom varga , poland these kaczynski twins remind me of our president george w. bush .
maybe that 's why they get along so well .
there has to be room to negotiate , and right-wingers or left-wingers are not so good at that .
i think the world will be a better place with a strong eu .
people in the eu need to realize that the world is not perfect and will never be perfect . - lee davis , us i think poland is pushing for a new voting system in the eu which would be more democratic one than that presented in the constitutional treaty .

eu leaders on friday entered a second day of tense negotiations on a european reform treaty with german chancellor angela merkel seeking to break down resistance from poland and britain . merkel said eu leaders were doing their " level best " to reach a compromise on a treaty and she was to meet the british and polish leaders to press the case .
" we are working hard , but the problems remain unresolved , " merkel said before the talks with kaczynski .
" but everyone is trying . "
merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy proposed a compromise about the eu voting system during talks in the early hours of friday with poland 's president lech kaczynski , but it remained unclear if the polish leader would accept the suggestion .
the polish news agency pap reported that earlier in the day kacyznski was not optimistic and convinced he held the most advantageous position for poland .
" poland is not in the habit of withdrawing when it is in the right , " he said .

merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the month , said she wants agreement on a broad outline of a treaty at the summit so that it can be written over the next six months by an inter-governmental conference .
the new treaty is deemed necessary after the collapse of the proposed constitution , which french and dutch voters ' rejected two years ago and sent the bloc into an extended " period of contemplation . "

poland is threatening to wreck efforts to forge a new institutional treaty because it believes it will lose decision-making power under the so-called double majority voting system proposed by germany . on friday , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , the president 's twin brother who did not attend the summit , said he would be willing to consider other options if his country 's plan on voting rules did not get approved at the summit . " if there is no agreement on the square root -lrb- voting plan -rrb- , then we could talk about other solutions , " kaczynski told a news conference , according to reuters news service . he added that poland wanted to " moderate the revolution " that the treaty plan would bring to the eu . his brother meanwhile suggested that the current system for distributing decision-making votes in the bloc agreed in 2000 should be extended until 2020 .
blair 's last " red lines " british prime minister tony blair , attending his final eu summit , on the other hand warned there were four " red lines " concerning national control over foreign policy , the judicial and police system , or tax and social security rules that he would not cross in the search for a compromise .
the dutch want a bigger role for national parliaments in the new treaty while the czechs sympathize with poland in opposition to the proposed voting rules , though some experts have said that support is only half-hearted .
poland , whose leaders have said it is " willing to die , " appeared after talks broke up late thursday to be moving as a number of different proposals were circulated to accommodate warsaw .

after his debut on the eu stage , french leader sarkozy said he had seen " a strong willingness to find a compromise , " but that soothing poland 's fears could prove difficult .
as the first day of talks stretched into friday , sarkozy made a compromise solution to poland in a bid to persuade it to drop its opposition to voting procedures , said his spokesman david martinon .
under the proposal , a small group of countries who had almost enough votes to block a decision would be able to have it re-examined , but a polish source told the afp news agency the compromise " does n't go far enough " and added that warsaw had made a counter-proposal , signaling that debate on the issue was far from over . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- sms / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu leaders on friday entered a second day of tense negotiations on a european reform treaty with german chancellor angela merkel seeking to break down resistance from poland and britain . merkel said eu leaders were doing their " level best " to reach a compromise on a treaty and she was to meet the british and polish leaders to press the case .
" we are working hard , but the problems remain unresolved , " merkel said before the talks with kaczynski .
" but everyone is trying . "
merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy proposed a compromise about the eu voting system during talks in the early hours of friday with poland 's president lech kaczynski , but it remained unclear if the polish leader would accept the suggestion .
the polish news agency pap reported that earlier in the day kacyznski was not optimistic and convinced he held the most advantageous position for poland .
" poland is not in the habit of withdrawing when it is in the right , " he said .

the united nations has confirmed that the outgoing british premier is under discussion for the role and us president george bush reportedly is also in favor . the united nations confirmed on thursday that blair is under discussion to fill the vacant position of middle east envoy .
" the issue was raised with -lrb- un -rrb- secretary general -lrb- ban ki-moon -rrb- during different conversations with some quartet principals , " said un spokeswoman michele montas .
on wednesday , blair is due to hand over the reins as britain 's prime minister to gordon brown after a decade of holding the post . the 54-year old has made clear he 's not ready to retire from the world stage .
two senior us administration sources said blair 's aides indicated he was interested in the position , the bbc reported .
the prime minister 's spokesman said there was lots of speculation over blair 's future , much of it " inaccurate , " according to the bbc .
the white house on thursday refused to confirm or deny reports that bush wanted blair to take up the post .
olmert enthusiastic israel 's premier would welcome blair as envoy , a spokeswoman said friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert would like to see blair in the post " prime minister olmert sees tony blair as a very positive figure in the region and he would be very happy to see him continuing to be involved , " miri eisin told afp .
britain 's conservative daily telegraph wrote on friday that blair should take the job , though it pointed out that his relationship to russia was strained and he was reviled in the arab world " as the invader of iraq and … bush 's closest foreign ally . "
however , the paper went on , " he had shown in northern ireland his patient expertise as a negotiator , strikingly vindicated by last month 's restoration of devolved government .
he will also carry the heft of a world leader , an authority that could not be wielded by the last holder of this role . "
former world bank chief james wolfensohn resigned in may 2006 after one year as middle east envoy .
he was frustrated by the slow implementation of the quartet 's so-called road map , which was supposed to lead to the creation of a palestinian state by 2005 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

doping in german soccer is likely still practiced , the head of the german anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- , armin baumert , said on friday . " international and domestic soccer is not a doping-free zone , " baumert told german public broadcaster swr , according to news reports .
" you do n't have to be afraid if you say that doping still takes place in soccer . "
the statements made in a radio interview instantly drew angry reactions from germany 's soccer federation , the dfb , which asked baumert for details about is allegations .
naming names " he should give names and facts if he has concrete evidence of current doping practices in soccer , " dfb spokesman harald stenger told dpa news service .
" but if it 's only a general suspicion then his statements are populist . "
baumert said that the dfb carried out 800 drug tests last year , but that only 87 of them were random tests .

they are not .
they are rather a finely orchestrated means for the authorities to serve a purpose .
to achieve their political goals or to distract from their own problems , the " security aware " - some may say " repressive " - regimes allow such demonstrations : against the insulting mohammed caricatures in denmark , against alleged desecration of the koran somewhere in the world or , as is currently the case , against the distinction being paid by the queen to british author salman rushdie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many demonstrators in front of the british embassies in tehran and islamabad today even knew who rushdie was 14 days ago ?
how many may have actually read the " satanic verses , " the book that garnered rushdie the anger of islamic extremists ?
probably none .
but that 's not really the point .
in 1989 , the iranian revolutionary leader khomeini issued a fatwa against then unknown rushdie , and iran put a price on the author 's head .
for 10 years rushdie had to go underground and live under police surveillance until tehran admitted that while the now deceased khomeini 's fatwa could not be revoked , it did not need to be implemented .
rushdie 's life could once again return to normal .
now that new demonstrations are being aimed at the author , it 's certainly not because of the " satanic verses . "
he is , after all , being recognized for his life 's work , not a single book .
but iranian and pakistani officials describe the knighthood as a new insult to one and half billion muslims .
and the pakistani religion minister raised the bar with the threat of a suicide attack to avenge this unfriendly act on the part of the british royal family .
as if that 's not an insult against all well-meaning people around the world , regardless of their religion , skin color or language .
such statements are a slap in the face to anyone who works for understanding and freedom - especially between cultures .
that includes muslims who believe in their religion 's true messages of freedom and understanding .
the abuse of religious sentiment for political means is not a new tactic .
but in the case of iran , one had hoped that things had changed .
and one even believed that they had in the case of pakistan , a country that is an important partner in the " fight against terror . "
in both cases the people are being thoughtlessly manipulated as a way of distraction from foreign and domestic problems , and the unforeseen consequences are being accepted .
in the end , it 's an easy call to make : the culprit has already been decided , and if anyone gets hurt during protests then the west will be responsible for that , too .

they are not .
they are rather a finely orchestrated means for the authorities to serve a purpose .
to achieve their political goals or to distract from their own problems , the " security aware " - some may say " repressive " - regimes allow such demonstrations : against the insulting mohammed caricatures in denmark , against alleged desecration of the koran somewhere in the world or , as is currently the case , against the distinction being paid by the queen to british author salman rushdie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many demonstrators in front of the british embassies in tehran and islamabad today even knew who rushdie was 14 days ago ?
how many may have actually read the " satanic verses , " the book that garnered rushdie the anger of islamic extremists ?
probably none .
but that 's not really the point .
in 1989 , the iranian revolutionary leader khomeini issued a fatwa against then unknown rushdie , and iran put a price on the author 's head .
for 10 years rushdie had to go underground and live under police surveillance until tehran admitted that while the now deceased khomeini 's fatwa could not be revoked , it did not need to be implemented .
rushdie 's life could once again return to normal .
now that new demonstrations are being aimed at the author , it 's certainly not because of the " satanic verses . "
he is , after all , being recognized for his life 's work , not a single book .
but iranian and pakistani officials describe the knighthood as a new insult to one and half billion muslims .
and the pakistani religion minister raised the bar with the threat of a suicide attack to avenge this unfriendly act on the part of the british royal family .
as if that 's not an insult against all well-meaning people around the world , regardless of their religion , skin color or language .
such statements are a slap in the face to anyone who works for understanding and freedom - especially between cultures .
that includes muslims who believe in their religion 's true messages of freedom and understanding .
the abuse of religious sentiment for political means is not a new tactic .
but in the case of iran , one had hoped that things had changed .
and one even believed that they had in the case of pakistan , a country that is an important partner in the " fight against terror . "
in both cases the people are being thoughtlessly manipulated as a way of distraction from foreign and domestic problems , and the unforeseen consequences are being accepted .
in the end , it 's an easy call to make : the culprit has already been decided , and if anyone gets hurt during protests then the west will be responsible for that , too .
what satanic tactics .

germany 's highest-ranking cardinal has warned against indifference and uncritical tolerance which he says could lead to islam enjoying equal standing with christianity in the country . cardinal karl lehmann , who is head of the german conference of bishops , expressed concern about religious freedom leading to all faiths being treated equally regardless of the size of their flock and their history . germany 's constitution obliges the state to maintain strict religious neutrality .
but lehmann pointed to christianity 's role in shaping european history and even its legal culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann " the deep cultural connection between christianity and our legal state , that goes back to the middle ages and before , can not simply be ignored , " lehmann said in a speech in karlsruhe . germany continues to struggle to integrate its 3.2 million muslims , over half of whom are of turkish origin , primarily " guest workers " who came to work during the country 's postwar economic boom , and their children . integration problems the government has been concerned about the potential radicalization of disillusioned young muslims and organized an islam conference last year to try to help muslims mesh with mainstream society .
germany has western europe 's second-biggest muslim population after france . the conference has made little progress so far on sensitive issues such as religion lessons , girls ' participation in sports and the legal status of a new islamic grouping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the planned mosque demonstrated in cologne lehmann 's comments come amid a sensitive time for muslim-christian relations in germany .
the construction of a large mosque in the western city of cologne has set off a wave of intense opposition among many local residents . " i do n't want to say i am worried , but i have an uneasy feeling , " cardinal joachim meisner of cologne said of the mosque in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio on wednesday . meisner , who last year banned catholic children from praying with muslim classmates , said a real test of religious tolerance would be whether christians could build churches and worship freely in turkey , as muslims can in germany . chancellor angela merkel , the daughter of a protestant pastor , said in april she expected turkey to take action to show it was tolerant of christianity after the killing of three people , including a german , at a turkish bible publishing house . mixed reactions from politicians ronald pofalla , the general secretary of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union party , said lehmann was right to say islam could not be afforded the same legal standing in germany as christianity , although he added no one should prevent muslims from practicing their religion in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think the eu ca n't cope with a muslim country such as turkey as a member " unlike christianity , islam is not in europe 's cultural center and is not reflected in everyday life in the same way , " pofalla said in a statement . " only those who are conscious of their cultural and social roots can freely and openly stand up for the rights of people of different faiths , " he added . but left-leaning politicians criticized lehmann 's statements . the leader of the green party 's parliamentary group , volker beck , said germany 's constitution required islam be treated the same as christianity . " the cardinal is wrong if he concludes that europe 's or germany 's undoubtedly christian character infers a legal discrimination of other religious communities , " he said . lale akgün , a social democratic parliamentarian in charge of islam issues , said lehmann was not looking clearly at the reality of life in germany . " whoever says that islam can not be put on an equal legal footing -lrb- as other religions -rrb- is stoking social unrest , " she said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's highest-ranking cardinal has warned against indifference and uncritical tolerance which he says could lead to islam enjoying equal standing with christianity in the country . cardinal karl lehmann , who is head of the german conference of bishops , expressed concern about religious freedom leading to all faiths being treated equally regardless of the size of their flock and their history . germany 's constitution obliges the state to maintain strict religious neutrality .
but lehmann pointed to christianity 's role in shaping european history and even its legal culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann " the deep cultural connection between christianity and our legal state , that goes back to the middle ages and before , can not simply be ignored , " lehmann said in a speech in karlsruhe . germany continues to struggle to integrate its 3.2 million muslims , over half of whom are of turkish origin , primarily " guest workers " who came to work during the country 's postwar economic boom , and their children . integration problems the government has been concerned about the potential radicalization of disillusioned young muslims and organized an islam conference last year to try to help muslims mesh with mainstream society .
germany has western europe 's second-biggest muslim population after france . the conference has made little progress so far on sensitive issues such as religion lessons , girls ' participation in sports and the legal status of a new islamic grouping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the planned mosque demonstrated in cologne lehmann 's comments come amid a sensitive time for muslim-christian relations in germany .
the construction of a large mosque in the western city of cologne has set off a wave of intense opposition among many local residents . " i do n't want to say i am worried , but i have an uneasy feeling , " cardinal joachim meisner of cologne said of the mosque in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio on wednesday . meisner , who last year banned catholic children from praying with muslim classmates , said a real test of religious tolerance would be whether christians could build churches and worship freely in turkey , as muslims can in germany . chancellor angela merkel , the daughter of a protestant pastor , said in april she expected turkey to take action to show it was tolerant of christianity after the killing of three people , including a german , at a turkish bible publishing house . mixed reactions from politicians ronald pofalla , the general secretary of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union party , said lehmann was right to say islam could not be afforded the same legal standing in germany as christianity , although he added no one should prevent muslims from practicing their religion in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think the eu ca n't cope with a muslim country such as turkey as a member " unlike christianity , islam is not in europe 's cultural center and is not reflected in everyday life in the same way , " pofalla said in a statement . " only those who are conscious of their cultural and social roots can freely and openly stand up for the rights of people of different faiths , " he added . but left-leaning politicians criticized lehmann 's statements . the leader of the green party 's parliamentary group , volker beck , said germany 's constitution required islam be treated the same as christianity . " the cardinal is wrong if he concludes that europe 's or germany 's undoubtedly christian character infers a legal discrimination of other religious communities , " he said . lale akgün , a social democratic parliamentarian in charge of islam issues , said lehmann was not looking clearly at the reality of life in germany .

" the german chancellor wants to take a decision at the summit without poland , " said merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm in brussels . " the german presidency now wants to obtain a joint mandate of the 26 other countries for an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- . " he said . the goal of the igc would be to draw up a new treaty instead of the bloc 's constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
according to eu regulations , a simple majority of countries is needed to call such a conference .
any decisions reached at the conference , however , would have to be unanimous . " poland would then have the chance to join the european consensus at the governmental conference in the autumn , " wilhelm said . polish opposition to the " double majority " voting scheme , requiring that eu decisions have the support of 55 per cent of member states , representing 65 per cent of the population , has been one of the key stumbling blocks in efforts to strike a treaty deal . poland sees it as less favorable to medium-sized nations than the current voting share-out under which it has 27 votes , almost on a par with big eu states germany , britain , italy and france , which have been accorded 29 votes each . a failed attempt ? in an effort to end the ongoing impasse regarding eu voting rights , merkel on friday offered new concessions to poland as european union leaders entered a decisive end-game at summit talks in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins have been flexing poland 's muscles jo leinen , chairman of european parliament 's constitutional committee , said merkel had told the polish delegation that application of the eu 's " double majority " system for decisions would only be introduced in 2014 , instead of in 2009 when the new " reform " treaty is expected to come into force . this offer was , however , quickly turned down by poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . " if you ask me now , i 'd say that the negotiations are going to end with a veto , " kaczynski said in an interview with poland 's public tvp1 broadcaster . " what 's been proposed to us is not enough for us to be able to accept , " he added . merkel was also seeking to ease polish concerns through the introduction of a mechanism allowing a small group of countries to stop unfavorable decisions - even if they do not meet current eu criteria for forging a so-called " blocking minority . " wilhelm said the german eu presidency made repeated attempts to address polish demands and that the german offer had been " far-reaching . "
in the light of the polish rejection , however , wilhelm quoted merkel as saying it was important to take action to avoid " leaving europe to mark time . " no eu foreign minister ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair opposes the idea of ceding sovereignty on foreign policy to the eu in a concession to britain , germany agreed that the eu 's charter on fundamental rights would only be legally binding in areas covered by eu laws .

the newly proposed high representative , however , would also serve as a vice-president of the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm . in addition , the new foreign policy post would be backed up by an eu diplomatic service including commission officials and diplomats from national governments . the summit , chaired by merkel , was scheduled to end later on friday .

the origin of the amateur brass orchestra is closely linked to the development of the protestant church in germany .
after the enlightenment movement , which focused on humanism and rationalism , the leaders of the protestant revival movement in the mid-19th century were ready for something that spoke less to the head and more to the heart - and the ears .

just last week , several thousand musicians of all ages gathered in essen for the annual national brass festival , which is sponsored by the german version of the ymca .

but germany 's " posaunenchöre " - literally , trombone choirs - are not your typical brass bands : they do n't even play folk music . go to any village festival or drop in at the local protestant church on a sunday morning and you 're bound to hear one .
and do n't be surprised if many of the musicians are n't even old enough to drive . the all-brass ensembles - a formation that 's unique to german-speaking countries - may have been around for over a century and a half , but that does n't stop more and more young people from taking part .
the origin of the amateur brass orchestra is closely linked to the development of the protestant church in germany .
after the enlightenment movement , which focused on humanism and rationalism , the leaders of the protestant revival movement in the mid-19th century were ready for something that spoke less to the head and more to the heart - and the ears .
they took the call in psalm 150 literally - " praise the lord with trumpets " - and replaced the more somber-sounding organ with the cheery sound of brass - everything from trumpets and trombones to french horns and tubas .
portable organs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things got a bit loud at the national brass orchestra festival last week " the brass orchestras play a key role in churches because they can open people 's heart , " said bernhard silaschi , chairman of the protestant brass orchestra service of germany , an umbrella organization representing some 30 state and regional groups . " music is a bridge and you do n't need many words . "
as the revival movement caught on and protestant churches outgrew their chapels , services were held outdoors or in makeshift tents .
the instruments were perfectly suited for it .
tubas are n't hard to carry - that 's how they got the nickname " portable organs " - and , best of all , brass instruments are more waterproof than violins , pianos and oboes .
today , as german churches struggle to attract the faithful , brass orchestras seem to have no problem recruiting members . " amazingly , the christian brass ensemble movement is growing , " said karsten heger , who has directed brass orchestras for 40 years .
" the ensembles do n't have to worry about finding new young members . "
heger estimated that there are 7,000 such ensembles in germany with some 120,000 members .
choir of horns bildunterschrift : chorales are the core of the brass orchestas ' repertoire it 's no accident that the german term " posaunenchor " includes the word ' choir ' .
their original aim was to mimic human voices as closely as possible , heger said .
the brass orchestras do play swing and jazz music , but chorales are one of the " main pillars of our work , " silaschi said .
chorales , generally written for four parts , were originally intended for vocal choirs or church congregations and are a staple of protestant church music .
like a vocal choir , each part can be played by an unlimited number of instrumentalists - which is a significant difference to other well-known brass formations like american army bands or british brass bands .
just last week , several thousand musicians of all ages gathered in essen for the annual national brass festival , which is sponsored by the german version of the ymca .
and at the beginning of the month , composer and trumpet player markus stockhausen opened the german protestant church day by conducting 1,500 brass players on the banks of the rhine river in cologne .
true to church roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brass instruments are practical : they 're portable and water-proof although over a century and a half has passed since the protestant revival in germany , brass orchestras have remained true to their church roots . the network of regional and state organizations in charge of the local ensembles not only provide opportunities for musical development and performance , instrument loans and scores : leaders also take a personal interest in passing on religious values to the musicians .
" the music is important , but it 's also important to know what our common foundation is , " said silaschi , who added that most rehearsals and events begin with a prayer or devotion .
still , brass players not involved in a church are invited to participate and diversity seems to be a key element of the amateur groups .
" my youngest member is nine and the oldest is 67 , " heger said of the ensemble in wilhelmshaven that he directs .
" all social groups are represented - you 'll have a doctor sitting next to a construction worker .
the abilities span a wide spectrum but we reach all groups . "
for the brass players , " reaching " people does n't just mean playing a chorale at church or a swing tune in the local convalescent hospital .
silaschi recently appeared with an ensemble on the harald schmidt show , one of germany 's most-watched late-night comedy shows , to advertise a major " posaunenchor " festival planned for next year .

" the german chancellor wants to take a decision at the summit without poland , " said merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm in brussels . " the german presidency now wants to obtain a joint mandate of the 26 other countries for an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- . " he said . the goal of the igc would be to draw up a new treaty instead of the bloc 's constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
according to eu regulations , a simple majority of countries is needed to call such a conference .
any decisions reached at the conference , however , would have to be unanimous . " poland would then have the chance to join the european consensus at the governmental conference in the autumn , " wilhelm said . polish opposition to the " double majority " voting scheme , requiring that eu decisions have the support of 55 per cent of member states , representing 65 per cent of the population , has been one of the key stumbling blocks in efforts to strike a treaty deal . poland sees it as less favorable to medium-sized nations than the current voting share-out under which it has 27 votes , almost on a par with big eu states germany , britain , italy and france , which have been accorded 29 votes each . a failed attempt ? in an effort to end the ongoing impasse regarding eu voting rights , merkel on friday offered new concessions to poland as european union leaders entered a decisive end-game at summit talks in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins have been flexing poland 's muscles jo leinen , chairman of european parliament 's constitutional committee , said merkel had told the polish delegation that application of the eu 's " double majority " system for decisions would only be introduced in 2014 , instead of in 2009 when the new " reform " treaty is expected to come into force . this offer was , however , quickly turned down by poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . " if you ask me now , i 'd say that the negotiations are going to end with a veto , " kaczynski said in an interview with poland 's public tvp1 broadcaster . " what 's been proposed to us is not enough for us to be able to accept , " he added . merkel was also seeking to ease polish concerns through the introduction of a mechanism allowing a small group of countries to stop unfavorable decisions - even if they do not meet current eu criteria for forging a so-called " blocking minority . " wilhelm said the german eu presidency made repeated attempts to address polish demands and that the german offer had been " far-reaching . "
in the light of the polish rejection , however , wilhelm quoted merkel as saying it was important to take action to avoid " leaving europe to mark time . " no eu foreign minister ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair opposes the idea of ceding sovereignty on foreign policy to the eu in a concession to britain , germany agreed that the eu 's charter on fundamental rights would only be legally binding in areas covered by eu laws .
this means it would not apply to britain 's labor legislation . in addition , as demanded by britain , the treaty will not refer to the appointment of a first-ever " foreign minister " but to a " high representative for foreign and security policy , " which is already the job title held by javier solana , the eu 's current chief diplomat . britain claims that the title of foreign minister would give the impression that national governments were ceding sovereignty on foreign policy to the eu .
the newly proposed high representative , however , would also serve as a vice-president of the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm . in addition , the new foreign policy post would be backed up by an eu diplomatic service including commission officials and diplomats from national governments . the summit , chaired by merkel , was scheduled to end later on friday .

" a person in an actual accident scenario would hardly have a chance at survival , " maurer said . the test consisted of a frontal and side crash at 64 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- per hour , and the front crash showed that the safety cell of the brilliance bs6 was too soft and not stable enough , adac said . most european-made cars win four or five stars in the crash test , so the result is not encouraging for the bs6 , which was slated to compete against the likes of the volkswagen passat and audi a6 when it launched at march 's geneva motor show . disappointing results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbag would be of little help in an actual accident , the adac said but hso , that company that handles brilliance 's imports to the european market , said the bs6 would undergo modifications and that sales of the car , 350 of which are on roads in germany and the benelux countries , would continue . " we are not happy with the test and will consequently improve our car , " hso head hans-ulrich sachs told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on thursday .
" a prototype will undergo the adac crash test at the end of july . " the bs6 , which sells for slightly less than 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 26,866 -rrb- is the first chinese-made sedan to be sold on the european market .
sachs added that brilliance would not stand in the way if any bs6 owners wanted to return their car based on the crash test results . thomas böhm of the germany-based association of international vehicle manufacturers told the süddeutsche zeitung that the association looked at the crash test results in a " relaxed " manner and was confident " that the market would regulate the problem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 22.06.2007 germany 's christian brass ensembles stay true to their roots großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blowing their hearts out say " german " and " brass " and you might be forgiven for thinking of oompah-bands .
but germany 's " posaunenchöre " - literally , trombone choirs - are not your typical brass bands : they do n't even play folk music . go to any village festival or drop in at the local protestant church on a sunday morning and you 're bound to hear one .
and do n't be surprised if many of the musicians are n't even old enough to drive . the all-brass ensembles - a formation that 's unique to german-speaking countries - may have been around for over a century and a half , but that does n't stop more and more young people from taking part .
the origin of the amateur brass orchestra is closely linked to the development of the protestant church in germany .
after the enlightenment movement , which focused on humanism and rationalism , the leaders of the protestant revival movement in the mid-19th century were ready for something that spoke less to the head and more to the heart - and the ears .
they took the call in psalm 150 literally - " praise the lord with trumpets " - and replaced the more somber-sounding organ with the cheery sound of brass - everything from trumpets and trombones to french horns and tubas .
portable organs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things got a bit loud at the national brass orchestra festival last week " the brass orchestras play a key role in churches because they can open people 's heart , " said bernhard silaschi , chairman of the protestant brass orchestra service of germany , an umbrella organization representing some 30 state and regional groups . " music is a bridge and you do n't need many words . "
as the revival movement caught on and protestant churches outgrew their chapels , services were held outdoors or in makeshift tents .
the instruments were perfectly suited for it .
tubas are n't hard to carry - that 's how they got the nickname " portable organs " - and , best of all , brass instruments are more waterproof than violins , pianos and oboes .
today , as german churches struggle to attract the faithful , brass orchestras seem to have no problem recruiting members . " amazingly , the christian brass ensemble movement is growing , " said karsten heger , who has directed brass orchestras for 40 years .
" the ensembles do n't have to worry about finding new young members . "
heger estimated that there are 7,000 such ensembles in germany with some 120,000 members .
choir of horns bildunterschrift : chorales are the core of the brass orchestas ' repertoire it 's no accident that the german term " posaunenchor " includes the word ' choir ' .
their original aim was to mimic human voices as closely as possible , heger said .
the brass orchestras do play swing and jazz music , but chorales are one of the " main pillars of our work , " silaschi said .
chorales , generally written for four parts , were originally intended for vocal choirs or church congregations and are a staple of protestant church music .
like a vocal choir , each part can be played by an unlimited number of instrumentalists - which is a significant difference to other well-known brass formations like american army bands or british brass bands .
just last week , several thousand musicians of all ages gathered in essen for the annual national brass festival , which is sponsored by the german version of the ymca .
and at the beginning of the month , composer and trumpet player markus stockhausen opened the german protestant church day by conducting 1,500 brass players on the banks of the rhine river in cologne .
true to church roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brass instruments are practical : they 're portable and water-proof although over a century and a half has passed since the protestant revival in germany , brass orchestras have remained true to their church roots . the network of regional and state organizations in charge of the local ensembles not only provide opportunities for musical development and performance , instrument loans and scores : leaders also take a personal interest in passing on religious values to the musicians .
" the music is important , but it 's also important to know what our common foundation is , " said silaschi , who added that most rehearsals and events begin with a prayer or devotion .
still , brass players not involved in a church are invited to participate and diversity seems to be a key element of the amateur groups .
" my youngest member is nine and the oldest is 67 , " heger said of the ensemble in wilhelmshaven that he directs .
" all social groups are represented - you 'll have a doctor sitting next to a construction worker .
the abilities span a wide spectrum but we reach all groups . "
for the brass players , " reaching " people does n't just mean playing a chorale at church or a swing tune in the local convalescent hospital .
silaschi recently appeared with an ensemble on the harald schmidt show , one of germany 's most-watched late-night comedy shows , to advertise a major " posaunenchor " festival planned for next year .

the origin of the amateur brass orchestra is closely linked to the development of the protestant church in germany .
after the enlightenment movement , which focused on humanism and rationalism , the leaders of the protestant revival movement in the mid-19th century were ready for something that spoke less to the head and more to the heart - and the ears .

" a person in an actual accident scenario would hardly have a chance at survival , " maurer said . the test consisted of a frontal and side crash at 64 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- per hour , and the front crash showed that the safety cell of the brilliance bs6 was too soft and not stable enough , adac said . most european-made cars win four or five stars in the crash test , so the result is not encouraging for the bs6 , which was slated to compete against the likes of the volkswagen passat and audi a6 when it launched at march 's geneva motor show . disappointing results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbag would be of little help in an actual accident , the adac said but hso , that company that handles brilliance 's imports to the european market , said the bs6 would undergo modifications and that sales of the car , 350 of which are on roads in germany and the benelux countries , would continue . " we are not happy with the test and will consequently improve our car , " hso head hans-ulrich sachs told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on thursday .
" a prototype will undergo the adac crash test at the end of july . " the bs6 , which sells for slightly less than 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 26,866 -rrb- is the first chinese-made sedan to be sold on the european market .
sachs added that brilliance would not stand in the way if any bs6 owners wanted to return their car based on the crash test results . thomas böhm of the germany-based association of international vehicle manufacturers told the süddeutsche zeitung that the association looked at the crash test results in a " relaxed " manner and was confident " that the market would regulate the problem .

germany 's highest-ranking cardinal has warned against indifference and uncritical tolerance which he says could lead to islam enjoying equal standing with christianity in the country . cardinal karl lehmann , who is head of the german conference of bishops , expressed concern about religious freedom leading to all faiths being treated equally regardless of the size of their flock and their history . germany 's constitution obliges the state to maintain strict religious neutrality .
but lehmann pointed to christianity 's role in shaping european history and even its legal culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann " the deep cultural connection between christianity and our legal state , that goes back to the middle ages and before , can not simply be ignored , " lehmann said in a speech in karlsruhe . germany continues to struggle to integrate its 3.2 million muslims , over half of whom are of turkish origin , primarily " guest workers " who came to work during the country 's postwar economic boom , and their children . integration problems the government has been concerned about the potential radicalization of disillusioned young muslims and organized an islam conference last year to try to help muslims mesh with mainstream society .
germany has western europe 's second-biggest muslim population after france . the conference has made little progress so far on sensitive issues such as religion lessons , girls ' participation in sports and the legal status of a new islamic grouping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the planned mosque demonstrated in cologne lehmann 's comments come amid a sensitive time for muslim-christian relations in germany .
the construction of a large mosque in the western city of cologne has set off a wave of intense opposition among many local residents . " i do n't want to say i am worried , but i have an uneasy feeling , " cardinal joachim meisner of cologne said of the mosque in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio on wednesday . meisner , who last year banned catholic children from praying with muslim classmates , said a real test of religious tolerance would be whether christians could build churches and worship freely in turkey , as muslims can in germany . chancellor angela merkel , the daughter of a protestant pastor , said in april she expected turkey to take action to show it was tolerant of christianity after the killing of three people , including a german , at a turkish bible publishing house . mixed reactions from politicians ronald pofalla , the general secretary of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union party , said lehmann was right to say islam could not be afforded the same legal standing in germany as christianity , although he added no one should prevent muslims from practicing their religion in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think the eu ca n't cope with a muslim country such as turkey as a member " unlike christianity , islam is not in europe 's cultural center and is not reflected in everyday life in the same way , " pofalla said in a statement . " only those who are conscious of their cultural and social roots can freely and openly stand up for the rights of people of different faiths , " he added . but left-leaning politicians criticized lehmann 's statements . the leader of the green party 's parliamentary group , volker beck , said germany 's constitution required islam be treated the same as christianity . " the cardinal is wrong if he concludes that europe 's or germany 's undoubtedly christian character infers a legal discrimination of other religious communities , " he said . lale akgün , a social democratic parliamentarian in charge of islam issues , said lehmann was not looking clearly at the reality of life in germany . " whoever says that islam can not be put on an equal legal footing -lrb- as other religions -rrb- is stoking social unrest , " she said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two housing bodies have said wales is short of about 40,000 affordable homes .
the home builders federation and the chartered institute of housing cymru said fewer new homes were being built in wales than at any time since wwii .
they criticised the assembly government and local authorities over the planning process and house-building policies .
the welsh assembly government said it had raised spending on social housing .
the welsh local government association called their views " simplistic " .
the two housing bodies blamed rocketing house prices for making life difficult for many first-time buyers .
they said they had identified a chronic shortage of affordable homes and claimed that affordable housing - which are part-owned or with subsidies available to buyers - was the only option for many people . "
we have to find a balance between those who want to buy their own properties and those communities who would be aghast at a complete loosening of planning guidelines " aled roberts , the welsh local government association the two organisations said the planning system was too time-consuming and that not enough land was made available for development .
richard price , a planning and policy advisor with the home builders federation for wales , said : " it seems bleak at the moment , we 've got a very big affordable housing crisis .
" considering the fact that the areas that are most attractive to investment are planning a reduction in house-building does n't really do us any favours .
" and it just looks as if it 's going to get worse unless we really do something to tackle these problems . "
kellie beirne , of the chartered institute of housing cymru , said the problems were across the board but the assembly government and local authorities had a part to play in finding a solution .
" the population is increasing and more households are forming , but the average size of these households is declining , " she said .
in response , councillor aled roberts , the welsh local government association 's spokesperson for housing , said : " what they are saying about affordable housing is simplistic .
" some developers claim that the imposition of affordable homes is detrimental to them .
" the town and country planning act is there so that there is no indiscriminate building .
' aghast ' " we have to find a balance between those who want to buy their own properties and those communities who would be aghast at a complete loosening of planning guidelines .
" we need to look at the supply of housing .
there is an issue with the number of empty properties which need to be brought back into circulation .
" there is the issue of pressure on the system caused by the buy-to-let sector . "

it comes two days after the head of the nhs in wales said change was needed to deal with a rise in chronic conditions , which are those that can not be cured .
recent medical advances now mean patients with some forms of cancer can manage their illness in the same way as people with ongoing chronic diseases .
professor tim maughan and a tenovus spokesman said it meant new challenges .
prof maughan , a consultant clinical oncologist at velindre hospital , said some of the newer drugs gave " really excellent " quality of life to cancer patients .
" i think we are just at the beginning of this curve - there are so many new ideas and opportunities for new treatments for cancer , " he said .
i 've never enjoyed my life so much .
what i took for granted before , i do n't anymore mike evans he said this led to two " major challenges " for the nhs .
" in terms of the actual workload in the clinics , the same number of people are being diagnosed but they are living longer , they are still needing regular reviews and they are being looked after by specialists so our clinics are getting fuller , " he said .

researchers said the device , being developed at swansea university , could make a big difference to people with conditions such as cystic fibrosis .
they said it was unique as it mimics a human lung 's behaviour , and also means patients could move around more .
the research was started by professor bill johns , after his eldest son graham died from cystic fibrosis aged 32 .
prof johns is the managing director of haemair ltd , which is developing the device in conjunction with university researchers in swansea . "
if we make a million pounds - it will merely be a bonus " professor bill johns he said : " if we can save the life of just one person , such as my son graham , the whole enterprise will be worthwhile .
" money is important for any viable business , but for us , it is a means , not an end .
" if we make a million pounds - it will merely be a bonus . "
the research team claimed the prosthetic lung was the first of its kind in that it can adapt to the body 's changing needs .
the prototype is being developed into a portable device , which should allow patients with damaged or diseased lungs to move around while they were being treated , rather than being confined to a hospital bed .
blood clots key features include a sensor which detects how much oxygen a body needs and adjusts the amount accordingly .
it also has the ability to reduce the formation of blood clots - a key challenge for artificial lungs .
it is hoped it will be available in hospitals within five years .
the ultimate aim of the research team is to use the technology to develop a more sophisticated lung which could be placed inside the human body - taking away the need for a lung transplant .
professor rhodri williams , who is leading the research , said : " we are delighted that the prototype has been selected for inclusion in the exhibition at the science museum .
" it recognises the innovative nature of our work in the development of new blood oxygenation devices . "

the prototype is being developed into a portable device , which should allow patients with damaged or diseased lungs to move around while they were being treated , rather than being confined to a hospital bed .
blood clots key features include a sensor which detects how much oxygen a body needs and adjusts the amount accordingly .
it also has the ability to reduce the formation of blood clots - a key challenge for artificial lungs .
it is hoped it will be available in hospitals within five years .
the ultimate aim of the research team is to use the technology to develop a more sophisticated lung which could be placed inside the human body - taking away the need for a lung transplant .
professor rhodri williams , who is leading the research , said : " we are delighted that the prototype has been selected for inclusion in the exhibition at the science museum .
" it recognises the innovative nature of our work in the development of new blood oxygenation devices . "

most countries broadly support the original text of the constitution and have similar positions on the main issues .
they may still have to give some ground , however .
five countries that want substantial changes to the treaty they signed in 2004 are more exposed and will have to fight their own corners .
here is a summary of their objections .
poland poland is fighting a lone battle to scrap rules laid down in the constitution determining how countries vote on eu legislation .
the constitution says a vote passes if it has the support of 55 % of member states -lrb- ie 15 out of 27 -rrb- - and if these countries represent 65 % of the eu 's population .
this links a country 's voting strength to the size of its population .
but the existing voting system , agreed after much haggling at a summit in nice in 2000 , is far more advantageous for poland .
under the nice treaty , poland got 27 votes out of a total of 345 - only two fewer than germany , which has double the population .
but poland says it voted to join the eu on the basis of nice , and it is unfair to move the goalposts .
as a compromise , it suggests a country 's voting weight should be tied not to its population , but to the square root of its population .
this would sharply narrow the gap in voting power between large , middle-sized , and small member states .

most countries broadly support the original text of the constitution and have similar positions on the main issues .
they may still have to give some ground , however .
five countries that want substantial changes to the treaty they signed in 2004 are more exposed and will have to fight their own corners .
here is a summary of their objections .
poland the netherlands france united kingdom czech republic poland poland is fighting a lone battle to scrap rules laid down in the constitution determining how countries vote on eu legislation .
the constitution says a vote passes if it has the support of 55 % of member states -lrb- ie 15 out of 27 -rrb- - and if these countries represent 65 % of the eu 's population .
this links a country 's voting strength to the size of its population .
but the existing voting system , agreed after much haggling at a summit in nice in 2000 , is far more advantageous for poland .
under the nice treaty , poland got 27 votes out of a total of 345 - only two fewer than germany , which has double the population .
but poland says it voted to join the eu on the basis of nice , and it is unfair to move the goalposts .
as a compromise , it suggests a country 's voting weight should be tied not to its population , but to the square root of its population .
this would sharply narrow the gap in voting power between large , middle-sized , and small member states .
