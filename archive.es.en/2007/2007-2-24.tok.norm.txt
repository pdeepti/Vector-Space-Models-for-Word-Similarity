program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 24.02.2007 germany seeks closer economic ties to the united states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry leaders are calling for less bureaucracy in transatlantic business politically , transatlantic relations have seen their ups and downs .
economically , though , business leaders have consistently sought stronger german-us ties .
now , they want to strengthen these to battle asian competition . german and american business leaders are seeking closer economic cooperation .
a meeting of leading industry representatives in hamburg this week stressed their common interests . jürgen fitschen , the germany head of deutsche bank , said this was necessary in order to steel themselves against competition from asia . " it is very obvious that common interests exist here , which are worth expanding , therefore this attempt to fill the transatlantic order with new life , " fitschen said .
but he said asian counterparts could not be excluded in the process . " it would be fatal if europe and america positioned themselves against asia , " fitschen said .
" the cooperation has to leave room for partners in asia . " however , relations between europe and the united states are much stronger than those will ever be with asia , fitschen said .
the numbers spoke for themselves , he said . bilateral trade between the united states and the european union totaled more than 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 525 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
every day , exports and imports of 1.25 billion euros were processed , he said . transatlantic skeleton agreement in the works business leaders from both sides of the atlantic are gearing up for the eu-us summit in washington on april 30 .
it is expected to lead to a transatlantic skeleton agreement , from which both sides could profit . " there is no doubt that such an agreement could provide a significant boost to the transatlantic economy , " said jürgen thumann , head of the bdi industry federation .
" personally , i am convinced that it will . " thumann said he estimates at least 3 percent growth and additional jobs on both sides will result . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated dvds are available across asia - and exported to europe and the us concretely , the agreement focuses on closer cooperation in the energy and environment sectors and harmonizing financial markets .
the fight against product piracy is a central issue , as well . us congressman jim sensenbrenner from wisconsin , who attended the hamburg meeting , said over 90 percent of the patents and copyrights in the world are issued to intellectual rights holders in the united states and in the european union . " as we are increasingly facing competition from third world economies , specifically china , india and brazil , we have to maintain our productivity edge , " sensenbrenner said .
" by protecting intellectual property rights , we will be able to attract venture capital for new inventions . " according to sensenbrenner , no one will invest in a country in which they ca n't be sure that an invention wo n't be copied tomorrow .
product piracy costs the american economy $ 9 billion annually , he said . capital transactions should be simplified for deutsche bank 's fitschen , there is another area in which there is a desperate need for action . " we are interested in clearing capital flows as much as possible from many bureaucratic strains , " fitschen said .
" i do n't want to say obstacles , but it could be better . " he said industry leaders needed to play a part in this process , explaining business interests to lawmakers . " it is in our interest that partners on both sides of the atlantic work together better , " fitschen said .
" that includes taking over companies and expanding on both sides .
in this respect , it is a fundamental interest . " german chancellor angela merkel 's call for closer european-american economic cooperation at january 's world economic forum in davos was a step in the right direction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 24.02.2007 germany seeks closer economic ties to the united states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry leaders are calling for less bureaucracy in transatlantic business politically , transatlantic relations have seen their ups and downs .
economically , though , business leaders have consistently sought stronger german-us ties .
now , they want to strengthen these to battle asian competition . german and american business leaders are seeking closer economic cooperation .
a meeting of leading industry representatives in hamburg this week stressed their common interests . jürgen fitschen , the germany head of deutsche bank , said this was necessary in order to steel themselves against competition from asia . " it is very obvious that common interests exist here , which are worth expanding , therefore this attempt to fill the transatlantic order with new life , " fitschen said .
but he said asian counterparts could not be excluded in the process . " it would be fatal if europe and america positioned themselves against asia , " fitschen said .
" the cooperation has to leave room for partners in asia . " however , relations between europe and the united states are much stronger than those will ever be with asia , fitschen said .
the numbers spoke for themselves , he said . bilateral trade between the united states and the european union totaled more than 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 525 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
every day , exports and imports of 1.25 billion euros were processed , he said . transatlantic skeleton agreement in the works business leaders from both sides of the atlantic are gearing up for the eu-us summit in washington on april 30 .
it is expected to lead to a transatlantic skeleton agreement , from which both sides could profit . " there is no doubt that such an agreement could provide a significant boost to the transatlantic economy , " said jürgen thumann , head of the bdi industry federation .
" personally , i am convinced that it will . " thumann said he estimates at least 3 percent growth and additional jobs on both sides will result . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated dvds are available across asia - and exported to europe and the us concretely , the agreement focuses on closer cooperation in the energy and environment sectors and harmonizing financial markets .
the fight against product piracy is a central issue , as well . us congressman jim sensenbrenner from wisconsin , who attended the hamburg meeting , said over 90 percent of the patents and copyrights in the world are issued to intellectual rights holders in the united states and in the european union . " as we are increasingly facing competition from third world economies , specifically china , india and brazil , we have to maintain our productivity edge , " sensenbrenner said .
" by protecting intellectual property rights , we will be able to attract venture capital for new inventions . " according to sensenbrenner , no one will invest in a country in which they ca n't be sure that an invention wo n't be copied tomorrow .
product piracy costs the american economy $ 9 billion annually , he said . capital transactions should be simplified for deutsche bank 's fitschen , there is another area in which there is a desperate need for action . " we are interested in clearing capital flows as much as possible from many bureaucratic strains , " fitschen said .
" i do n't want to say obstacles , but it could be better . " he said industry leaders needed to play a part in this process , explaining business interests to lawmakers . " it is in our interest that partners on both sides of the atlantic work together better , " fitschen said .
" that includes taking over companies and expanding on both sides .
in this respect , it is a fundamental interest . " german chancellor angela merkel 's call for closer european-american economic cooperation at january 's world economic forum in davos was a step in the right direction .

" as we are increasingly facing competition from third world economies , specifically china , india and brazil , we have to maintain our productivity edge , " sensenbrenner said .
" by protecting intellectual property rights , we will be able to attract venture capital for new inventions . " according to sensenbrenner , no one will invest in a country in which they ca n't be sure that an invention wo n't be copied tomorrow .
product piracy costs the american economy $ 9 billion annually , he said . capital transactions should be simplified for deutsche bank 's fitschen , there is another area in which there is a desperate need for action . " we are interested in clearing capital flows as much as possible from many bureaucratic strains , " fitschen said .
" i do n't want to say obstacles , but it could be better . " he said industry leaders needed to play a part in this process , explaining business interests to lawmakers . " it is in our interest that partners on both sides of the atlantic work together better , " fitschen said .

" i will seek a vote of confidence as soon as possible , with renewed impetus and a united coalition , " he told reporters saturday , according to ap news service . set of commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian parliament is made up of many small factions on thursday , the mild-mannered prodi , nicknamed il professore , whipped his squabbling nine-party coalition into line by extracting a " non-negotiable " set of commitments from them .
prodi also received a boost from an italian centrist senator marco follini who was reported in a saturday newspaper as saying that he would " probably " support the center-left in a confidence vote . two communist senators in prodi 's coalition refused to support him in wednesday 's vote which was called to test support for his government 's foreign policy .
the pair dislike his approval of a planned enlargement of a us military base and commitment to italy 's 2,000-troop deployment in afghanistan . both were contrite afterwards , and one of them , trotskyite franco turigliatto , was expelled from the refoundation communist party .
the other , fernando rossi , a pacifist of the italian communist party , pledged his loyalty to prodi . the berlusconi factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will preventing berlusconi unite the left ?
the specter of snap elections that might return conservative leader silvio berlusconi to power after just nine months in opposition appeared to be the main catalyst for the center-left 's newfound cohesion . sergio romano , a leading italian political analyst , said : " prodi is using an argument that is right now very strong : ' do we want to help berlusconi regain power ?

economically , though , business leaders have consistently sought stronger german-us ties .
now , they want to strengthen these to battle asian competition . german and american business leaders are seeking closer economic cooperation .
a meeting of leading industry representatives in hamburg this week stressed their common interests . jürgen fitschen , the germany head of deutsche bank , said this was necessary in order to steel themselves against competition from asia . " it is very obvious that common interests exist here , which are worth expanding , therefore this attempt to fill the transatlantic order with new life , " fitschen said .

" i will seek a vote of confidence as soon as possible , with renewed impetus and a united coalition , " he told reporters saturday , according to ap news service . set of commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian parliament is made up of many small factions on thursday , the mild-mannered prodi , nicknamed il professore , whipped his squabbling nine-party coalition into line by extracting a " non-negotiable " set of commitments from them .
prodi also received a boost from an italian centrist senator marco follini who was reported in a saturday newspaper as saying that he would " probably " support the center-left in a confidence vote . two communist senators in prodi 's coalition refused to support him in wednesday 's vote which was called to test support for his government 's foreign policy .
the pair dislike his approval of a planned enlargement of a us military base and commitment to italy 's 2,000-troop deployment in afghanistan . both were contrite afterwards , and one of them , trotskyite franco turigliatto , was expelled from the refoundation communist party .
the other , fernando rossi , a pacifist of the italian communist party , pledged his loyalty to prodi . the berlusconi factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will preventing berlusconi unite the left ?
the specter of snap elections that might return conservative leader silvio berlusconi to power after just nine months in opposition appeared to be the main catalyst for the center-left 's newfound cohesion . sergio romano , a leading italian political analyst , said : " prodi is using an argument that is right now very strong : ' do we want to help berlusconi regain power ?

product piracy costs the american economy $ 9 billion annually , he said . capital transactions should be simplified for deutsche bank 's fitschen , there is another area in which there is a desperate need for action . " we are interested in clearing capital flows as much as possible from many bureaucratic strains , " fitschen said .
" i do n't want to say obstacles , but it could be better . " he said industry leaders needed to play a part in this process , explaining business interests to lawmakers . " it is in our interest that partners on both sides of the atlantic work together better , " fitschen said .

now , they want to strengthen these to battle asian competition . german and american business leaders are seeking closer economic cooperation .
a meeting of leading industry representatives in hamburg this week stressed their common interests . jürgen fitschen , the germany head of deutsche bank , said this was necessary in order to steel themselves against competition from asia . " it is very obvious that common interests exist here , which are worth expanding , therefore this attempt to fill the transatlantic order with new life , " fitschen said .
but he said asian counterparts could not be excluded in the process . " it would be fatal if europe and america positioned themselves against asia , " fitschen said .
" the cooperation has to leave room for partners in asia . " however , relations between europe and the united states are much stronger than those will ever be with asia , fitschen said .
the numbers spoke for themselves , he said . bilateral trade between the united states and the european union totaled more than 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 525 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
every day , exports and imports of 1.25 billion euros were processed , he said . transatlantic skeleton agreement in the works business leaders from both sides of the atlantic are gearing up for the eu-us summit in washington on april 30 .

" as we are increasingly facing competition from third world economies , specifically china , india and brazil , we have to maintain our productivity edge , " sensenbrenner said .
" by protecting intellectual property rights , we will be able to attract venture capital for new inventions . " according to sensenbrenner , no one will invest in a country in which they ca n't be sure that an invention wo n't be copied tomorrow .
product piracy costs the american economy $ 9 billion annually , he said . capital transactions should be simplified for deutsche bank 's fitschen , there is another area in which there is a desperate need for action . " we are interested in clearing capital flows as much as possible from many bureaucratic strains , " fitschen said .
" i do n't want to say obstacles , but it could be better . " he said industry leaders needed to play a part in this process , explaining business interests to lawmakers . " it is in our interest that partners on both sides of the atlantic work together better , " fitschen said .

26 in lower saxony 's representative office in berlin , which documents the progress that has been made over the years . recognize guilt and then move on it used to be that poland hardly showed up at all in many german textbooks .
a recent comparison , however , shows that poland is now " just as represented as france , " said thomas strobel , the exhibit 's designer , in an interview with german news agency dpa . one of the members of the textbook committee , robert mayer , told deutsche welle about the organization 's approach to overcoming what he called the " political exploitation of the german-polish polarity . " everyone has to recognize their own guilt , " he said .
" it alleviates the situation when the other person sees : ' ah , he 's not closing in on me or making accusations , instead he 's admitting his guilt . " ' getting away from national thinking is also very important , he added . beyond central europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is now associated more with globalization than with communism the institute has also moved beyond its purely polish-german focus .

" by protecting intellectual property rights , we will be able to attract venture capital for new inventions . " according to sensenbrenner , no one will invest in a country in which they ca n't be sure that an invention wo n't be copied tomorrow .
product piracy costs the american economy $ 9 billion annually , he said . capital transactions should be simplified for deutsche bank 's fitschen , there is another area in which there is a desperate need for action . " we are interested in clearing capital flows as much as possible from many bureaucratic strains , " fitschen said .
" i do n't want to say obstacles , but it could be better . " he said industry leaders needed to play a part in this process , explaining business interests to lawmakers . " it is in our interest that partners on both sides of the atlantic work together better , " fitschen said .

" i will seek a vote of confidence as soon as possible , with renewed impetus and a united coalition , " he told reporters saturday , according to ap news service . set of commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian parliament is made up of many small factions on thursday , the mild-mannered prodi , nicknamed il professore , whipped his squabbling nine-party coalition into line by extracting a " non-negotiable " set of commitments from them .
prodi also received a boost from an italian centrist senator marco follini who was reported in a saturday newspaper as saying that he would " probably " support the center-left in a confidence vote . two communist senators in prodi 's coalition refused to support him in wednesday 's vote which was called to test support for his government 's foreign policy .
the pair dislike his approval of a planned enlargement of a us military base and commitment to italy 's 2,000-troop deployment in afghanistan . both were contrite afterwards , and one of them , trotskyite franco turigliatto , was expelled from the refoundation communist party .
the other , fernando rossi , a pacifist of the italian communist party , pledged his loyalty to prodi . the berlusconi factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will preventing berlusconi unite the left ?
the specter of snap elections that might return conservative leader silvio berlusconi to power after just nine months in opposition appeared to be the main catalyst for the center-left 's newfound cohesion . sergio romano , a leading italian political analyst , said : " prodi is using an argument that is right now very strong : ' do we want to help berlusconi regain power ?

product piracy costs the american economy $ 9 billion annually , he said . capital transactions should be simplified for deutsche bank 's fitschen , there is another area in which there is a desperate need for action . " we are interested in clearing capital flows as much as possible from many bureaucratic strains , " fitschen said .
" i do n't want to say obstacles , but it could be better . " he said industry leaders needed to play a part in this process , explaining business interests to lawmakers . " it is in our interest that partners on both sides of the atlantic work together better , " fitschen said .

but he said asian counterparts could not be excluded in the process . " it would be fatal if europe and america positioned themselves against asia , " fitschen said .
" the cooperation has to leave room for partners in asia . " however , relations between europe and the united states are much stronger than those will ever be with asia , fitschen said .
the numbers spoke for themselves , he said . bilateral trade between the united states and the european union totaled more than 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 525 billion -rrb- in 2005 .

" as we are increasingly facing competition from third world economies , specifically china , india and brazil , we have to maintain our productivity edge , " sensenbrenner said .
" by protecting intellectual property rights , we will be able to attract venture capital for new inventions . " according to sensenbrenner , no one will invest in a country in which they ca n't be sure that an invention wo n't be copied tomorrow .
product piracy costs the american economy $ 9 billion annually , he said . capital transactions should be simplified for deutsche bank 's fitschen , there is another area in which there is a desperate need for action . " we are interested in clearing capital flows as much as possible from many bureaucratic strains , " fitschen said .
" i do n't want to say obstacles , but it could be better . " he said industry leaders needed to play a part in this process , explaining business interests to lawmakers . " it is in our interest that partners on both sides of the atlantic work together better , " fitschen said .
" that includes taking over companies and expanding on both sides .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 24.02.2007 germany seeks closer economic ties to the united states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry leaders are calling for less bureaucracy in transatlantic business politically , transatlantic relations have seen their ups and downs .
economically , though , business leaders have consistently sought stronger german-us ties .
now , they want to strengthen these to battle asian competition . german and american business leaders are seeking closer economic cooperation .
a meeting of leading industry representatives in hamburg this week stressed their common interests . jürgen fitschen , the germany head of deutsche bank , said this was necessary in order to steel themselves against competition from asia . " it is very obvious that common interests exist here , which are worth expanding , therefore this attempt to fill the transatlantic order with new life , " fitschen said .
but he said asian counterparts could not be excluded in the process . " it would be fatal if europe and america positioned themselves against asia , " fitschen said .
" the cooperation has to leave room for partners in asia . " however , relations between europe and the united states are much stronger than those will ever be with asia , fitschen said .
the numbers spoke for themselves , he said . bilateral trade between the united states and the european union totaled more than 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 525 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
every day , exports and imports of 1.25 billion euros were processed , he said . transatlantic skeleton agreement in the works business leaders from both sides of the atlantic are gearing up for the eu-us summit in washington on april 30 .
it is expected to lead to a transatlantic skeleton agreement , from which both sides could profit . " there is no doubt that such an agreement could provide a significant boost to the transatlantic economy , " said jürgen thumann , head of the bdi industry federation .
" personally , i am convinced that it will . " thumann said he estimates at least 3 percent growth and additional jobs on both sides will result . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated dvds are available across asia - and exported to europe and the us concretely , the agreement focuses on closer cooperation in the energy and environment sectors and harmonizing financial markets .
the fight against product piracy is a central issue , as well . us congressman jim sensenbrenner from wisconsin , who attended the hamburg meeting , said over 90 percent of the patents and copyrights in the world are issued to intellectual rights holders in the united states and in the european union . " as we are increasingly facing competition from third world economies , specifically china , india and brazil , we have to maintain our productivity edge , " sensenbrenner said .
" by protecting intellectual property rights , we will be able to attract venture capital for new inventions . " according to sensenbrenner , no one will invest in a country in which they ca n't be sure that an invention wo n't be copied tomorrow .
product piracy costs the american economy $ 9 billion annually , he said . capital transactions should be simplified for deutsche bank 's fitschen , there is another area in which there is a desperate need for action . " we are interested in clearing capital flows as much as possible from many bureaucratic strains , " fitschen said .
" i do n't want to say obstacles , but it could be better . " he said industry leaders needed to play a part in this process , explaining business interests to lawmakers . " it is in our interest that partners on both sides of the atlantic work together better , " fitschen said .
" that includes taking over companies and expanding on both sides .
in this respect , it is a fundamental interest . " german chancellor angela merkel 's call for closer european-american economic cooperation at january 's world economic forum in davos was a step in the right direction .

" i will seek a vote of confidence as soon as possible , with renewed impetus and a united coalition , " he told reporters saturday , according to ap news service . set of commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian parliament is made up of many small factions on thursday , the mild-mannered prodi , nicknamed il professore , whipped his squabbling nine-party coalition into line by extracting a " non-negotiable " set of commitments from them .
prodi also received a boost from an italian centrist senator marco follini who was reported in a saturday newspaper as saying that he would " probably " support the center-left in a confidence vote . two communist senators in prodi 's coalition refused to support him in wednesday 's vote which was called to test support for his government 's foreign policy .
the pair dislike his approval of a planned enlargement of a us military base and commitment to italy 's 2,000-troop deployment in afghanistan . both were contrite afterwards , and one of them , trotskyite franco turigliatto , was expelled from the refoundation communist party .

" i will seek a vote of confidence as soon as possible , with renewed impetus and a united coalition , " he told reporters saturday , according to ap news service . set of commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian parliament is made up of many small factions on thursday , the mild-mannered prodi , nicknamed il professore , whipped his squabbling nine-party coalition into line by extracting a " non-negotiable " set of commitments from them .
prodi also received a boost from an italian centrist senator marco follini who was reported in a saturday newspaper as saying that he would " probably " support the center-left in a confidence vote . two communist senators in prodi 's coalition refused to support him in wednesday 's vote which was called to test support for his government 's foreign policy .
the pair dislike his approval of a planned enlargement of a us military base and commitment to italy 's 2,000-troop deployment in afghanistan . both were contrite afterwards , and one of them , trotskyite franco turigliatto , was expelled from the refoundation communist party .
the other , fernando rossi , a pacifist of the italian communist party , pledged his loyalty to prodi . the berlusconi factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will preventing berlusconi unite the left ?
the specter of snap elections that might return conservative leader silvio berlusconi to power after just nine months in opposition appeared to be the main catalyst for the center-left 's newfound cohesion . sergio romano , a leading italian political analyst , said : " prodi is using an argument that is right now very strong : ' do we want to help berlusconi regain power ?

" i will seek a vote of confidence as soon as possible , with renewed impetus and a united coalition , " he told reporters saturday , according to ap news service . set of commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian parliament is made up of many small factions on thursday , the mild-mannered prodi , nicknamed il professore , whipped his squabbling nine-party coalition into line by extracting a " non-negotiable " set of commitments from them .
prodi also received a boost from an italian centrist senator marco follini who was reported in a saturday newspaper as saying that he would " probably " support the center-left in a confidence vote . two communist senators in prodi 's coalition refused to support him in wednesday 's vote which was called to test support for his government 's foreign policy .
the pair dislike his approval of a planned enlargement of a us military base and commitment to italy 's 2,000-troop deployment in afghanistan . both were contrite afterwards , and one of them , trotskyite franco turigliatto , was expelled from the refoundation communist party .
the other , fernando rossi , a pacifist of the italian communist party , pledged his loyalty to prodi . the berlusconi factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will preventing berlusconi unite the left ?
the specter of snap elections that might return conservative leader silvio berlusconi to power after just nine months in opposition appeared to be the main catalyst for the center-left 's newfound cohesion . sergio romano , a leading italian political analyst , said : " prodi is using an argument that is right now very strong : ' do we want to help berlusconi regain power ?

" it alleviates the situation when the other person sees : ' ah , he 's not closing in on me or making accusations , instead he 's admitting his guilt . " ' getting away from national thinking is also very important , he added . beyond central europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is now associated more with globalization than with communism the institute has also moved beyond its purely polish-german focus .
in addition to the 200 german and polish experts who have contributed to the textbook committee , academic experts come from all over the world to visit the institute , learn from its example and make use of its extensive library . recently , jordanian and egyptian textbook writers met to discuss how history could be taught more fairly and accurately in their respective countries .
the goal of cross-border understanding is n't limited to neighboring countries , however .

mr cheney said that david hicks was " near the head of the queue " for trial and confirmed he would serve his sentence in australia if convicted .
his comments came after a meeting with australian prime minister john howard .
the two allies also discussed military operations in iraq and afghanistan , and ties with china .
mr cheney used the news conference after the meeting to issue a warning to iran , stating that " all options are still on the table " and refusing to rule out force over the nuclear issue .
the us vice-president is on a three-day visit to australia following security talks in japan .
his visit has triggered protests from demonstrators opposing the iraq war .
' no more delay ' there has been growing pressure on mr howard to press for a resolution to the detention of mr hicks .
david hicks has been detained in guantanamo bay for five years the 31-year-old muslim convert has been held at guantanamo bay for five years .
he was arrested in afghanistan in 2001 for allegedly fighting with the taleban .
mr howard told journalists he had asked mr cheney for the trial to " be brought on as soon as humanly possible and that there be no further delay " .
the us was " doing everything we can to deal with these matters in as expeditious a manner as possible " , mr cheney said .
the us vice-president did not reveal whether he had asked australia to increase its troop deployment in iraq .
" it 's not for us to suggest to ... allies what their appropriate response might be , " he said , going on to praise australia for its " exceptional " cooperation in iraq .
australia currently has about 1,450 military personnel based in iraq or involved in iraq-related operations .
mr howard is under considerable domestic pressure to commit to a timetable for withdrawing australian troops , but earlier this week he announced the deployment of another 70 military advisors .
china ties on china , mr howard said australia took a practical view .
mr cheney on friday had expressed concern over china 's military build-up and recent use of a missile to destroy a satellite .
" we have no illusions that china remains an authoritarian country , " mr howard said .
but he went on : " we have sought to emphasise in our relations with china those practical things that we have in common . "
the two leaders are to hold more informal talks over lunch .
mr cheney leaves australia on sunday .

the extra money has taken them above the threshold for claiming carer 's allowance , which is worth £ 46 a week .
but if the people affected cut their weekly hours to under 16 to take them back under the threshold , they would then lose out on tax credits .
support groups want the government to end what they say is a " catch-22 situation " but so far it has refused .
sarah lives in liverpool and cares for her elderly mother as well as looking after her own 14-year-old son and working in the local chemist .
she told bbc radio 4 's money box about the nasty shock when her wages went up .
" i work 16 hours a week and earn the minimum wage .
but when that went up to £ 5.35 an hour i was no longer entitled to claim the carer 's allowance .
i was £ 1.60 over the threshold , " she said .
to get carer 's allowance your wages have to be less than £ 84 a week .
and the small rise in her weekly pay took her above that threshold meaning she lost the whole of her carer 's allowance - worth £ 46.95 a week .
' catch 22 ' if sarah cut her hours to just 15 a week she would get back her carer 's allowance .
but another anomaly means that would leave her even worse off .
" it 's a catch-22 situation , " she said .
" you ca n't work any longer because you 're caring for somebody .
and you ca n't work any less because if you 're claiming tax credit you 've got to work 16 hours a week . "
i ca n't begin to tell you what a difference it makes and how miserable it 's made us sarah , carer send us your comments sarah 's tax credit amounts to more than £ 100 a week .
emily holzhausen , head of policy at carer 's uk , confirmed that if sarah cut her hours she would lose it .
" if you work 15 hours you do n't get tax credits at all .
so she has no option but to lose this carer 's allowance , " she said .
and sarah said that has not been easy : " just over £ 45 a week may not seem a lot to some people but i ca n't begin to tell you what a difference it makes and how miserable it 's made us now it 's been taken away . "
simple solution ?
the problem affects many of the estimated 40,000 people who get carer 's allowance from the department for work and pensions and also work .
ms holzhausen said it shows a lack of joined up government : " one department has been working without talking to another department about what the knock-on effect would be .
" it 's great that the minimum wage has gone up in october .
but it 's out-of-synch with benefit changes .
change the time when you raise the earnings threshold emily holzhausen , carers uk " the threshold will rise to £ 87 in april and sarah will be able to claim carer 's allowance again .
" then in october if the minimum wage rises again she will lose it .
and so on . "
ms holzhausen hopes the recent launch of a £ 33m package of help for carers by chancellor gordon brown and minister for care services ivan lewis will trigger a further look at this expensive anomaly .
" the solution is simple , " she said : " change the time when you raise the earnings threshold for carer 's allowance from april and synchronise it with the national minimum wage in october .
" if you did that we would solve it in one . "

the extra money has taken them above the threshold for claiming carer 's allowance , which is worth £ 46 a week .
but if the people affected cut their weekly hours to under 16 to take them back under the threshold , they would then lose out on tax credits .
support groups want the government to end what they say is a " catch-22 situation " but so far it has refused .
sarah lives in liverpool and cares for her elderly mother as well as looking after her own 14-year-old son and working in the local chemist .
she told bbc radio 4 's money box about the nasty shock when her wages went up .
" i work 16 hours a week and earn the minimum wage .
but when that went up to £ 5.35 an hour i was no longer entitled to claim the carer 's allowance .
i was £ 1.60 over the threshold , " she said .
to get carer 's allowance your wages have to be less than £ 84 a week .
and the small rise in her weekly pay took her above that threshold meaning she lost the whole of her carer 's allowance - worth £ 46.95 a week .
' catch 22 ' if sarah cut her hours to just 15 a week she would get back her carer 's allowance .
but another anomaly means that would leave her even worse off .
" it 's a catch-22 situation , " she said .
" you ca n't work any longer because you 're caring for somebody .
and you ca n't work any less because if you 're claiming tax credit you 've got to work 16 hours a week . "
i ca n't begin to tell you what a difference it makes and how miserable it 's made us sarah , carer send us your comments sarah 's tax credit amounts to more than £ 100 a week .
emily holzhausen , head of policy at carer 's uk , confirmed that if sarah cut her hours she would lose it .
" if you work 15 hours you do n't get tax credits at all .
so she has no option but to lose this carer 's allowance , " she said .
and sarah said that has not been easy : " just over £ 45 a week may not seem a lot to some people but i ca n't begin to tell you what a difference it makes and how miserable it 's made us now it 's been taken away . "
simple solution ?
the problem affects many of the estimated 40,000 people who get carer 's allowance from the department for work and pensions and also work .
ms holzhausen said it shows a lack of joined up government : " one department has been working without talking to another department about what the knock-on effect would be .
" it 's great that the minimum wage has gone up in october .
but it 's out-of-synch with benefit changes .
change the time when you raise the earnings threshold emily holzhausen , carers uk " the threshold will rise to £ 87 in april and sarah will be able to claim carer 's allowance again .
" then in october if the minimum wage rises again she will lose it .
and so on . "
ms holzhausen hopes the recent launch of a £ 33m package of help for carers by chancellor gordon brown and minister for care services ivan lewis will trigger a further look at this expensive anomaly .
" the solution is simple , " she said : " change the time when you raise the earnings threshold for carer 's allowance from april and synchronise it with the national minimum wage in october .
" if you did that we would solve it in one . "

society has been hollowed out by hiv and aids .
orphans are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation .
some men infected by hiv believe they can be cured by having sex with a child .
but now unicef has set up a unique scheme to protect them .
part guardian angels , part neighbourhood watch , the workers , who are all volunteers are called " shoulders to cry on " , in the local language lihlombe lekukhalela .
mr ndzima is a small , quiet man , with kind eyes and a firm handshake .
" when i was growing up my father used to beat me a lot , " mr ndzima confided .
" i felt that i would not like to see a repeat of such an upbringing , not just for my own children , but for all children . "
so he got involved and has become a " shoulder to cry on " volunteer .
one of his most difficult cases has been zandile .
her parents died and she was forced to go to the city .
when she tried to return home she found her own grandparents had given the land over to squatters .
mr ndzima has taken zandile into his family while he negotiates to get the property back .
this is a common problem in swaziland .
" it 's very fulfilling to try to help zandile and help protect her rights , but it has been very challenging to do this work . "
challenges some people in the community see the volunteers as interfering in their private family business .
" i have been threatened , i have been abused verbally " , he explained .
some of his fellow volunteers have given up , but he has continued believing that good will prevail over evil .
" i had even been threatened that i 'll be chased from the community " " without him my life would be in danger , i 'd have ended up a mess " rape victim ' cynthia ' this is difficult for them , both he and zandile begin to cry , very quietly .
my translator asks me to step away for a moment .
after a pause mr ndzima regains his composure and assures me that he will continue , because he believes in the work he is doing .
he explains a plan he has .
he wishes to buy a maize flour milling machine .
he sees the business value in it , people could come with their crops and pay to use it .
the money raised would then go to support children like zandile .
" i have great dreams - i wish every child like zandile could grow up and live a fulfilled life like any other child . "
his fellow volunteer henry has a deep voice and a strong laugh .
he is burly and intense and carries a bible in his hand .
" as a child of god , i have that heart of caring for each other - it 's like a calling to become a ' shoulder ' .
at the end of the day we get no pay , " he explained .
orphans he says are often at risk of sexual abuse .
" they live with their guardians - sometimes the guardians take advantage and rape them and they become victims , " henry said .
at the moment he is working with ' cynthia ' .
she was raped by a stranger on her way to school .
he offers her counselling and support .
" we try to motivate her , tell her that she must look to the future , we try to tell her this is not the end of her life . "
but he and his team are also helping the police to trace her attacker .
he says he now knows who did it and that he is willing to follow the man and give him to the police .
' cynthia ' is grateful for henry 's help and support .
" without him my life would be in danger , i 'd have ended up a mess , " she said .
this network of " shoulders " now work with traditional leaders and community groups across swaziland .
during my time there i heard only one criticism - a head teacher told me there simply are not enough volunteers doing this kind of work .
' cynthia ' hopes to train as a nurse when she grows up .
asked if she might become a " shoulder to cry on " , she replied simply " of course " .

society has been hollowed out by hiv and aids .
zandile is very grateful for the support from mr ndzima orphans are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation .
some men infected by hiv believe they can be cured by having sex with a child .
but now unicef has set up a unique scheme to protect them .
part guardian angels , part neighbourhood watch , the workers , who are all volunteers are called " shoulders to cry on " , in the local language lihlombe lekukhalela .
mr ndzima is a small , quiet man , with kind eyes and a firm handshake .
" when i was growing up my father used to beat me a lot , " mr ndzima confided .
" i felt that i would not like to see a repeat of such an upbringing , not just for my own children , but for all children . "
so he got involved and has become a " shoulder to cry on " volunteer .
one of his most difficult cases has been zandile .
her parents died and she was forced to go to the city .
when she tried to return home she found her own grandparents had given the land over to squatters .
mr ndzima has taken zandile into his family while he negotiates to get the property back .
this is a common problem in swaziland .
" it 's very fulfilling to try to help zandile and help protect her rights , but it has been very challenging to do this work . "
challenges some people in the community see the volunteers as interfering in their private family business .
" i have been threatened , i have been abused verbally " , he explained .
some of his fellow volunteers have given up , but he has continued believing that good will prevail over evil .
" i had even been threatened that i 'll be chased from the community " without him my life would be in danger , i 'd have ended up a mess rape victim ' cynthia ' this is difficult for them , both he and zandile begin to cry , very quietly .
my translator asks me to step away for a moment .
after a pause mr ndzima regains his composure and assures me that he will continue , because he believes in the work he is doing .
he explains a plan he has .
he wishes to buy a maize flour milling machine .
he sees the business value in it , people could come with their crops and pay to use it .
the money raised would then go to support children like zandile .
" i have great dreams - i wish every child like zandile could grow up and live a fulfilled life like any other child . "
his fellow volunteer henry has a deep voice and a strong laugh .
he is burly and intense and carries a bible in his hand .
henry believes that as a man of god he needs to show love to others " as a child of god , i have that heart of caring for each other - it 's like a calling to become a ' shoulder ' .
at the end of the day we get no pay , " he explained .
orphans he says are often at risk of sexual abuse .
" they live with their guardians - sometimes the guardians take advantage and rape them and they become victims , " henry said .
at the moment he is working with ' cynthia ' .
she was raped by a stranger on her way to school .
he offers her counselling and support .
" we try to motivate her , tell her that she must look to the future , we try to tell her this is not the end of her life . "
but he and his team are also helping the police to trace her attacker .
he says he now knows who did it and that he is willing to follow the man and give him to the police .
' cynthia ' is grateful for henry 's help and support .
" without him my life would be in danger , i 'd have ended up a mess , " she said .
this network of " shoulders " now work with traditional leaders and community groups across swaziland .

just one police officer , who had been on duty all night , manned the barrier on the tiny tebay to grayrigg road barring all but engineers and network rail investigators to pass .
other people were told the site had to be preserved as a potential crime scene while investigators probed the cause of the fatal crash .
at 0340 gmt a motorist and a taxi driver were turned away from the barrier without so much as a protest , as the seriousness of the crash began to sink in .
police confirmed more than 500 rescuers , police and accident investigators had visited the scene in the hours since the derailment near docker bridge , close to the isolated village of grayrigg at 2015 gmt on friday .
i will never forget the sight of women wearing high heels stumbling down ladders from the carriages and wandering through the mud rescue worker grayrigg has a population of only a few hundred , but as soon as news of the crash broke , police said the local community rallied , inviting the walking wounded into their homes for comfort and a hot drink .
the remoteness of the location also made it difficult for rescuers who battled through heavy rain in poor light to free dazed passengers from the overturned carriages .
opened their doors a member of the emergency services , who did not wish to be named , described what it was like being one of the first on the scene .
he said : " when i arrived it was hard to take in .
i will never forget the sight of women wearing high heels stumbling down ladders from the carriages and wandering through the mud .
" there were a lot of elderly people clutching their bags looking very shocked , dazed and confused .
we helped dozens of walking wounded .
" it was a filthy night weather-wise , and rescuers did a magnificent job because finding the remote location was a problem as there was no light .
three helicopters " this is a small community - there are only about 300 residents , but the farmers opened their doors - a lot of people were taken to brackenhall farm for hot drinks and something to eat and the place is completely trampled with mud .
" the cordon had to be put in place because technically this could be a crime scene , although there is no indication that there was anything on the track or anything had been tampered with .
" this is a major incident and about 500 personnel have been at the scene .
we had three helicopters at the site as well as fire and ambulance crews from as far away as doncaster . "

an h-2a rocket carrying the satellite lifted off from a base in southern japan at 0441 gmt , officials said .
tokyo began launching spy satellites in 2003 , after north korea fired a missile over japan 's main island in 1998 .
japan sees itself as one of the top targets of the communist state , which last year tested a nuclear bomb .
satoki kurokawa , a spokesman for the japan aerospace exploration agency -lrb- jaxa -rrb- , said the lift-off from the remote base was a success .
once the satellite is in orbit , tokyo will be able to spy on any location in the world , officials say .
the rocket also carried an experimental optical satellite that tokyo hopes to use in the future to improve the quality of satellite images .
before the launch , japan already had three spy satellites in orbit .
two others were lost when a rocket failed in november 2003 .
the launch also came a month after china destroyed an old weather satellite using a ground-based medium-range ballistic missile .

an h-2a rocket carrying the satellite lifted off from a base in southern japan at 0441 gmt , officials said .
tokyo began launching spy satellites in 2003 , after north korea fired a missile over japan 's main island in 1998 .
japan sees itself as one of the top targets of the communist state , which last year tested a nuclear bomb .
satoki kurokawa , a spokesman for the japan aerospace exploration agency -lrb- jaxa -rrb- , said the lift-off from the remote base was a success .
once the satellite is in orbit , tokyo will be able to spy on any location in the world , officials say .
the rocket also carried an experimental optical satellite that tokyo hopes to use in the future to improve the quality of satellite images .
before the launch , japan already had three spy satellites in orbit .
two others were lost when a rocket failed in november 2003 .
the launch also came a month after china destroyed an old weather satellite using a ground-based medium-range ballistic missile .

anti-bullying charity kidscape said web bullying was rising and praised the police response , and bebo said it was " leading the field " against bullying .

" bullying is not acceptable no matter what form it takes , " she said .

the treasury and the department for culture , media and sport -lrb- dcms -rrb- are discussing a price of £ 9bn - up from an initial figure of £ 2.35bn.
construction alone could cost £ 3.3bn , the government has said .
the dcms said budget talks were still ongoing and accurate figures would be announced later .
' staggering ' costs have mounted since london won the right to host the games in july 2005 .
on top of soaring construction bills , an extra £ 2bn has been allocated as a contingency fund .
have your say " it 's a complete waste of money .
we should have let paris take it " alan bates , uk send us your comments regeneration costs of £ 1.8bn and a £ 1bn vat bill have also been added .
and security costs have grown to at least £ 900m .
shadow culture secretary hugo swire said the news was " staggering " , and said chancellor gordon brown should take responsibility , because he signed off the original budget .
" there is no doubt that there will be real worries across the country about the huge increase in costs ... it is time we got a proper explanation from gordon brown on what has gone on and assurances as to what the government is doing to control the ever-increasing budget , " he said .
' outstanding issues ' there has been some suggestion that the treasury and the dcms have clashed over the budget , but the dcms has denied this .
" this is just the latest of many different figures to be quoted by the media in the last few months , claiming to be the cost of the 2012 games , " a dcms spokesman said .
" discussions are going on across government to resolve outstanding issues and we will make an announcement about long-term budget figures when they have concluded .
" it is completely incorrect to suggest government departments are at odds on this issue .
this is simply not the case . "
in the wake of heavy criticism of the government 's handling of the games , culture secretary tessa jowell admitted to parliament in november that the cost of the games would rise by £ 900m - 40 % - to £ 3.3bn.
but critics have continued to express wide-ranging concerns over everything from transport to the burden on the tax payer and the effect on the national lottery 's funding of good causes .
decontamination work the treasury has insisted a 60 % contingency should be to be added to the construction cost .
but this figure has been resisted both by the mayor of london ken livingstone and also the dcms .
both of them would like a much lower contingency , a view that appears to have support from clm , the delivery partners .
a variety of other factors are also at play .
these include rise in commodity prices , adjustments to transport figures to reflect 2012 prices and a revised estimate for inflation on construction costs .
the land in the east end of london chosen for the site also needs decontamination and major remedial work before it can be fit for the games .
the treasury has also decided that the olympic development authority will have to pay vat .
while vat is in effect paid to the treasury , the cash initially still has to be found before it is reclaimed .
the chairman of the cms select committee , john whittingdale , said it was important the british taxpayer was not asked to write a " blank cheque " for the olympics .
he said : " i think the total is going to be a lot bigger than was initially suggested , and what is important , i think , is that the government comes out and gives a clear statement so that we can actually have some facts rather than continue to have figures bandied about which seem to rise by the week . "
the deputy leader of the liberal democrats , vincent cable , questioned whether so much money should be spent .
" i think the people promoting it will say there will be a legacy .
but i would have to say the answer would be no .
we just can not talk about that magnitude of money .
we just can not have an open-ended budget and people just signing cheques .
it is n't going to happen and it 's not right " .
