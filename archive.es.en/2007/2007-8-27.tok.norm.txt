so it should come as no surprise that its efforts to solve child abduction cases should focus on cooperation and standardized search procedures . there have probably been as many column inches written about the efforts of kate and gerry mccann to find their missing daughter madeleine as the investigation into the alleged abduction itself .
the campaign by the missing four-year-old 's family and friends to keep maddy 's face in the media has drawn both praise and criticism since it swung into action in the days after her disappearance from the mccanns ' apartment at the praia da luz resort in portugal on may 3 .
whether one admires or criticizes the mccanns ' use of the media in the search for their daughter , one thing can not be ignored : the media strategy has resulted in an unprecedented level of coverage regarding a child 's abduction .
but should a family have to create its own rolling news channel to keep the world informed of the efforts to find a missing child ?
could the creation of the " find madeleine " campaign also be a reaction to inadequate international search procedures ?
incompatibilities obvious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerry and kate mccann gave the public vital information one of the most debated aspects of the mccann investigation has been the extensive criticism of the portuguese police .
critics of the policia judiciaria have highlighted the differences between portuguese methods and those employed in the search for a child in madeleine 's native britain and other eu countries .
in particular , the police have been accused of failing to distribute information for hours after maddy vanished , for delays in passing a description to border or marine police and for refusing offers of help from international experts for almost three months .
the portuguese have defended themselves by saying that under article 86 of the country 's penal code information must not be released , apart from in exceptional circumstances , while the criminal investigation is still taking place .
while similar types of secrecy laws regarding ongoing police investigations exist in most european countries , information covered by these laws tends to apply to evidence and situations that need to be kept under wraps in the search for a suspect .
few prevent the broadcast or distribution of information regarding a missing child .
eu-wide alert system ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police cooperation across the eu is improving slowly the mccann case has raised new calls for a europe-wide response procedure in the case of abducted children .
while the european commission is already trying to increase cooperation in cross-border investigations , there are currently no plans to standardize the response in the case of a missing child .
" we have been told that there are no plans at the moment for an eu-wide alert system , " said carolyn bouchard from independent child protection agency safehands .
" the level of police cooperation is slowly improving and most current systems work well on a national level , but we continue to push for an efficient network across the continent . "
delphine moralis , the acting secretary general for the european federation for missing and sexually exploited children , was more specific .
" based on the experience of its members -lrb- 21 non-governmental organizations in 14 eu countries -rrb- when dealing with missing children cases across the eu , missing children europe advocates the need to develop alert support systems for cases of child abductions or life threatening disappearances of children in countries where no system exists , " she said .
" we also recommend the development of co-ordination procedures and interconnection schemes between existing systems , such as the ones in belgium , france , germany , greece and the uk . "
the closest thing europe currently has to a standardized response is the amber alert , a procedure imported from the united states , although not all countries in the eu use it .
amber alerts a tried and tested response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public is a vaulable resource in any abduction case amber alerts are issued by police when four main criteria of a child abduction case are satisfied : when a child under 16 goes missing ; when the child is believed kidnapped , when a senior police officer fears that death or serious harm may come about , and when the case has sufficient descriptive details , such as photographs of the child or suspected abductor .
the alerts are then broadcast to the public via radio and television stations , immediately interrupting scheduled broadcasting to report the missing child .
the alerts are also shown on electronic motorway signs and sent to email accounts , mobile phones and wireless devices of registered search volunteers .
" a coordinated amber alert system in europe would be hugely beneficial because one of the most critical parts of an abduction investigation is informing the public , " said robert hoever , from the us national center for missing and exploited children -lrb- ncmec -rrb- .
" it would require each country to have a designated amber facilitator and for all the facilitators to meet and plan together a memorandum of understanding as to how they would work together . "
cross-border structures needed for success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations must cross borders seemlessly to succeed hoever believes that having a similar system and a coordinator in every eu member state would greatly improve cross-border child abduction investigations in the bloc .
" contact person ' a ' would be responsible for putting the alert out in his or her own country and if information suggested the child had crossed the border , then ' a ' calls ' b ' and the same system kicks in , " he said .
however , according to hoever , bringing in a standardized amber alert-type system in europe would only work if other investigative strategies were already in place .
" before you have a standardized alert system , you have to address the cross-border problems .
you ca n't try and solve differences in police procedure during a case ; you waste time and endanger the child further .
these strategies between countries should be in place first . "
delphine moralis agreed .
" any system developed at eu level will have to start by looking at what already exists at the national level , " she said . " many questions remain to be analyzed , both regarding the procedures and regarding technical implementation of a system . "
a painful lesson so did the inadequacy of existing structures hinder the search for madeleine mccann in the first hours of her disappearance ?
" in portugal , missing children europe has an ngo member called instituto de apoio à criança i.a.c. , lisbon , which launched a hotline for missing children on may 25 , 2004 , " moralis said . " however , due to a lack of financial means and political support , no fully developed ' child alert ' or ' amber alert system ' has been launched in portugal yet . "
she said a good communication and coordination among existing systems as well as child search programs in countries which do n't currently have them could well have made a difference in the case of madeleine mccann . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

delphine moralis , the acting secretary general for the european federation for missing and sexually exploited children , was more specific .
" based on the experience of its members -lrb- 21 non-governmental organizations in 14 eu countries -rrb- when dealing with missing children cases across the eu , missing children europe advocates the need to develop alert support systems for cases of child abductions or life threatening disappearances of children in countries where no system exists , " she said .
" we also recommend the development of co-ordination procedures and interconnection schemes between existing systems , such as the ones in belgium , france , germany , greece and the uk . "
the closest thing europe currently has to a standardized response is the amber alert , a procedure imported from the united states , although not all countries in the eu use it .
amber alerts a tried and tested response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public is a vaulable resource in any abduction case amber alerts are issued by police when four main criteria of a child abduction case are satisfied : when a child under 16 goes missing ; when the child is believed kidnapped , when a senior police officer fears that death or serious harm may come about , and when the case has sufficient descriptive details , such as photographs of the child or suspected abductor .
the alerts are then broadcast to the public via radio and television stations , immediately interrupting scheduled broadcasting to report the missing child .
the alerts are also shown on electronic motorway signs and sent to email accounts , mobile phones and wireless devices of registered search volunteers .
" a coordinated amber alert system in europe would be hugely beneficial because one of the most critical parts of an abduction investigation is informing the public , " said robert hoever , from the us national center for missing and exploited children -lrb- ncmec -rrb- .
" it would require each country to have a designated amber facilitator and for all the facilitators to meet and plan together a memorandum of understanding as to how they would work together . "
cross-border structures needed for success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations must cross borders seemlessly to succeed hoever believes that having a similar system and a coordinator in every eu member state would greatly improve cross-border child abduction investigations in the bloc .
" contact person ' a ' would be responsible for putting the alert out in his or her own country and if information suggested the child had crossed the border , then ' a ' calls ' b ' and the same system kicks in , " he said .
however , according to hoever , bringing in a standardized amber alert-type system in europe would only work if other investigative strategies were already in place .
" before you have a standardized alert system , you have to address the cross-border problems .
you ca n't try and solve differences in police procedure during a case ; you waste time and endanger the child further .
these strategies between countries should be in place first . "
delphine moralis agreed .
" any system developed at eu level will have to start by looking at what already exists at the national level , " she said . " many questions remain to be analyzed , both regarding the procedures and regarding technical implementation of a system . "
a painful lesson so did the inadequacy of existing structures hinder the search for madeleine mccann in the first hours of her disappearance ?
" in portugal , missing children europe has an ngo member called instituto de apoio à criança i.a.c. , lisbon , which launched a hotline for missing children on may 25 , 2004 , " moralis said . " however , due to a lack of financial means and political support , no fully developed ' child alert ' or ' amber alert system ' has been launched in portugal yet . "
she said a good communication and coordination among existing systems as well as child search programs in countries which do n't currently have them could well have made a difference in the case of madeleine mccann . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 27.08.2007 experts say new alert system needed in eu child searches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madeleine mccann 's parents have spread the word with their own media campaign the eu has a lot of experience in dealing with cross-border problems .
so it should come as no surprise that its efforts to solve child abduction cases should focus on cooperation and standardized search procedures . there have probably been as many column inches written about the efforts of kate and gerry mccann to find their missing daughter madeleine as the investigation into the alleged abduction itself .
the campaign by the missing four-year-old 's family and friends to keep maddy 's face in the media has drawn both praise and criticism since it swung into action in the days after her disappearance from the mccanns ' apartment at the praia da luz resort in portugal on may 3 .
whether one admires or criticizes the mccanns ' use of the media in the search for their daughter , one thing can not be ignored : the media strategy has resulted in an unprecedented level of coverage regarding a child 's abduction .
but should a family have to create its own rolling news channel to keep the world informed of the efforts to find a missing child ?
could the creation of the " find madeleine " campaign also be a reaction to inadequate international search procedures ?
incompatibilities obvious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerry and kate mccann gave the public vital information one of the most debated aspects of the mccann investigation has been the extensive criticism of the portuguese police .
critics of the policia judiciaria have highlighted the differences between portuguese methods and those employed in the search for a child in madeleine 's native britain and other eu countries .
in particular , the police have been accused of failing to distribute information for hours after maddy vanished , for delays in passing a description to border or marine police and for refusing offers of help from international experts for almost three months .
the portuguese have defended themselves by saying that under article 86 of the country 's penal code information must not be released , apart from in exceptional circumstances , while the criminal investigation is still taking place .
while similar types of secrecy laws regarding ongoing police investigations exist in most european countries , information covered by these laws tends to apply to evidence and situations that need to be kept under wraps in the search for a suspect .
few prevent the broadcast or distribution of information regarding a missing child .
eu-wide alert system ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police cooperation across the eu is improving slowly the mccann case has raised new calls for a europe-wide response procedure in the case of abducted children .
while the european commission is already trying to increase cooperation in cross-border investigations , there are currently no plans to standardize the response in the case of a missing child .
" we have been told that there are no plans at the moment for an eu-wide alert system , " said carolyn bouchard from independent child protection agency safehands .

a spokesman for the stuttgart-based bank told afp that the sale price would be fixed at the end of the year after lbbw had carried out a more detailed evaluation of the leipzig-based bank .
he said lbbw had also given the bank a 250 million euro -lrb- $ 342 million -rrb- cash injection as " an immediate measure . "
saxony state premier georg milbradt said current turbulence in the capital markets meant that it was impossible for the bank to continue without a partner .
knock-on effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us mortgage crisis has sent stock markets tumbling worldwide news of sachsenlb 's troubles emerged a week ago , when it admitted receiving a financial lifeline of 17.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.7 billion -rrb- from a consortium of other banks in the wake of the us home loans turmoil that sent world markets diving .
but german newspapers reported on friday that this had failed to stem sachsenlb 's liquidity problems caused by its inability to cover the debts of ormond quay , an investment fund under the management of its dublin-based unit .
normalize operations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxony 's state premier says the sale will place operations back on a normal footing milbradt told mdr radio on sunday that the sale of the bank to lbbw would put operations at the bank back on an even keel .
" we promise that the support of baden-württemberg will restore calm , " he said .
" things could be back to normal on monday .
baden-württemberg is not leaping into a black hole with this purchase . "
he said the lowest price his government was prepared to accept for sachsenlb was 300 million euros .
the leipzig-based financial institution is the second german bank that has had to be bailed out after exposure to credit markets caught in the us sub-prime housing market crisis .
the ikb bank - a relatively small financial institution that lends to medium-sized businesses - was subject to a 3.5 billion-euro rescue operation last month by the state-owned kfw - a bank set up immediately after world war ii to finance germany 's reconstruction . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as german politicians are reconsidering a ban of the ultra-right npd party after recent xenophobic attacks . fourteen percent of the women canvassed said they would not rule out giving their ballot to a party to the right of the conservative christian democratic union or its bavarian sister party , the csu , at the next state parliamentary elections .
nine percent of men , in comparison , said they would do the same in the emnid survey commissioned by the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
emnid head , klaus-peter schöppner , called the results " surprising . " " women do n't usually lean towards the rightwing spectrum so strongly , " he told the newspaper .
right shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dissatisfaction with family policy may be the reason for the poll results schöppner said conservative women voters with traditional family views were possibly disappointed by the conservatives ' modern family politics . " some have stopped voting , " he said .
" others have turned towards parties of the far-right . "
in addition to the discrepancy between men and women in their voting patterns , the survey also showed a split between eastern and western germany .
eleven percent of western germans canvassed by emnid said they would vote for far-right parties , in comparison to 15 percent in eastern germany .
germany has recently seen a spate of racist violence that has prompted renewed calls to ban the far-right npd party .
racist surge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gorvinda singh was one of the indians injured in the recent attack in mügeln in the latest incident this weekend , a 36-year-old iraqi was attacked with a baseball bat while waiting for a tram in the eastern german city of magdeburg .

merkel 's hosts said they would investigate . merkel said that china needed " to respect the rules of the game , " after talks in beijing touched upon controversial issues such as piracy and unsafe chinese exports . " in our talks , i made clear that every country has the right to development , " merkel told journalists in a joint press conference after the one-hour meeting with the chinese premier wen jiabao .
" but at present there are a great many large countries such as china that are developing fast and there is a need to respect the rules of the game . " the label " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months , especially in the aftermath of a recent recall of 18 million chinese-made products by us toy giant mattel because of safety concerns . an opportunity , not a threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen : " there is no such thing as the ' china threat theory . " '
critics of china have also voiced concerns in recent years that the country 's economic rise could potentially be seen as a threat to the rest of the world , especially in view of china 's deplorable human rights record . " china 's development is an opportunity , not a threat , " wen said .
" we have decades of work ahead before we can be even a moderately well-developed country . " the chinese premier stressed that his country was still struggling with issues such as poverty and population growth , but added that chinese intentions were not sinister . " china will always take the peaceful road , " he said .
" china is very happy to cooperate with all nations but will never threaten ... so it 's clear , everyone please be at ease , there is no such thing as the ' china threat theory . " ' hi-tech espionage ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were german government computers compromised by hackers from china ?
merkel 's talks with the chinese premier came only two days after the german news magazine der spiegel reported that chinese hackers had broken into the government computer network in berlin . according to the magazine , spy programs - which investigations showed could be tracked to the chinese people 's liberation army - were uncovered at merkel 's office , the foreign ministry and other government institutions . " we in the government took -lrb- the reports -rrb- as a matter of grave concern , " wen said . " hackers breaking into and sabotaging computers is a problem faced by the entire world . " the chinese premier emphasized that fighting hacking must be a joint effort and that china will cooperate with germany on this issue . " we are willing to maintain cooperation with the german government and take firm and effective action to prevent all hacking acts that threaten computer systems , " he said . climate goals wen promised china would undertake greater efforts to prevent global warming in its next environmental five-year plan starting in 2011 , but stressed that china 's responsibilities regarding carbon-dioxide emissions were not the same as those of long-time industrialized nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and china are important trade partners even if they do n't see eye-to-eye on human rights " it will be extremely difficult to reach these targets , but we have already shown our determination , " wen said .
" we have a much tougher task than germany does . " china has long maintained that wealthy nations - those that have already benefited from emissions-producing industrial booms - are the ones who should take the lead in cutting greenhouse-gas emissions . " china has taken part of the responsibility for climate change for only 30 years while industrial countries have grown fast for the last 200 years , " he said . merkel , who made climate change a key focus of germany 's presidency over the g8 group of leading industrialized nations , emphasized that all countries needed to work on energy efficiency . " developed countries should help by providing the latest technology , " she said . china has set goals to reduce its energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2011 , but its consumption fell by only 1.23 percent last year .
it also failed to meet its targeted 2-percent reduction in emissions of major water and air pollutants last year , recording instead toxic levels rising by almost 2 percent . merkel also met with chinese president hu jintao later on monday .
she will head for japan on wednesday , where she will also address climate change and economic issues . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 27.08.2007 experts say new alert system needed in eu child searches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madeleine mccann 's parents have spread the word with their own media campaign the eu has a lot of experience in dealing with cross-border problems .
so it should come as no surprise that its efforts to solve child abduction cases should focus on cooperation and standardized search procedures . there have probably been as many column inches written about the efforts of kate and gerry mccann to find their missing daughter madeleine as the investigation into the alleged abduction itself .
the campaign by the missing four-year-old 's family and friends to keep maddy 's face in the media has drawn both praise and criticism since it swung into action in the days after her disappearance from the mccanns ' apartment at the praia da luz resort in portugal on may 3 .
whether one admires or criticizes the mccanns ' use of the media in the search for their daughter , one thing can not be ignored : the media strategy has resulted in an unprecedented level of coverage regarding a child 's abduction .
but should a family have to create its own rolling news channel to keep the world informed of the efforts to find a missing child ?
could the creation of the " find madeleine " campaign also be a reaction to inadequate international search procedures ?
incompatibilities obvious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerry and kate mccann gave the public vital information one of the most debated aspects of the mccann investigation has been the extensive criticism of the portuguese police .
critics of the policia judiciaria have highlighted the differences between portuguese methods and those employed in the search for a child in madeleine 's native britain and other eu countries .
in particular , the police have been accused of failing to distribute information for hours after maddy vanished , for delays in passing a description to border or marine police and for refusing offers of help from international experts for almost three months .
the portuguese have defended themselves by saying that under article 86 of the country 's penal code information must not be released , apart from in exceptional circumstances , while the criminal investigation is still taking place .
while similar types of secrecy laws regarding ongoing police investigations exist in most european countries , information covered by these laws tends to apply to evidence and situations that need to be kept under wraps in the search for a suspect .
few prevent the broadcast or distribution of information regarding a missing child .
eu-wide alert system ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police cooperation across the eu is improving slowly the mccann case has raised new calls for a europe-wide response procedure in the case of abducted children .
while the european commission is already trying to increase cooperation in cross-border investigations , there are currently no plans to standardize the response in the case of a missing child .
" we have been told that there are no plans at the moment for an eu-wide alert system , " said carolyn bouchard from independent child protection agency safehands .
" the level of police cooperation is slowly improving and most current systems work well on a national level , but we continue to push for an efficient network across the continent . "
delphine moralis , the acting secretary general for the european federation for missing and sexually exploited children , was more specific .
" based on the experience of its members -lrb- 21 non-governmental organizations in 14 eu countries -rrb- when dealing with missing children cases across the eu , missing children europe advocates the need to develop alert support systems for cases of child abductions or life threatening disappearances of children in countries where no system exists , " she said .
" we also recommend the development of co-ordination procedures and interconnection schemes between existing systems , such as the ones in belgium , france , germany , greece and the uk . "
the closest thing europe currently has to a standardized response is the amber alert , a procedure imported from the united states , although not all countries in the eu use it .
amber alerts a tried and tested response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public is a vaulable resource in any abduction case amber alerts are issued by police when four main criteria of a child abduction case are satisfied : when a child under 16 goes missing ; when the child is believed kidnapped , when a senior police officer fears that death or serious harm may come about , and when the case has sufficient descriptive details , such as photographs of the child or suspected abductor .
the alerts are then broadcast to the public via radio and television stations , immediately interrupting scheduled broadcasting to report the missing child .
the alerts are also shown on electronic motorway signs and sent to email accounts , mobile phones and wireless devices of registered search volunteers .
" a coordinated amber alert system in europe would be hugely beneficial because one of the most critical parts of an abduction investigation is informing the public , " said robert hoever , from the us national center for missing and exploited children -lrb- ncmec -rrb- .
" it would require each country to have a designated amber facilitator and for all the facilitators to meet and plan together a memorandum of understanding as to how they would work together . "
cross-border structures needed for success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations must cross borders seemlessly to succeed hoever believes that having a similar system and a coordinator in every eu member state would greatly improve cross-border child abduction investigations in the bloc .
" contact person ' a ' would be responsible for putting the alert out in his or her own country and if information suggested the child had crossed the border , then ' a ' calls ' b ' and the same system kicks in , " he said .
however , according to hoever , bringing in a standardized amber alert-type system in europe would only work if other investigative strategies were already in place .
" before you have a standardized alert system , you have to address the cross-border problems .
you ca n't try and solve differences in police procedure during a case ; you waste time and endanger the child further .
these strategies between countries should be in place first . "
delphine moralis agreed .
" any system developed at eu level will have to start by looking at what already exists at the national level , " she said . " many questions remain to be analyzed , both regarding the procedures and regarding technical implementation of a system . "
a painful lesson so did the inadequacy of existing structures hinder the search for madeleine mccann in the first hours of her disappearance ?
" in portugal , missing children europe has an ngo member called instituto de apoio à criança i.a.c. , lisbon , which launched a hotline for missing children on may 25 , 2004 , " moralis said . " however , due to a lack of financial means and political support , no fully developed ' child alert ' or ' amber alert system ' has been launched in portugal yet . "
she said a good communication and coordination among existing systems as well as child search programs in countries which do n't currently have them could well have made a difference in the case of madeleine mccann . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's hosts said they would investigate . merkel said that china needed " to respect the rules of the game , " after talks in beijing touched upon controversial issues such as piracy and unsafe chinese exports . " in our talks , i made clear that every country has the right to development , " merkel told journalists in a joint press conference after the one-hour meeting with the chinese premier wen jiabao .
" but at present there are a great many large countries such as china that are developing fast and there is a need to respect the rules of the game . " the label " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months , especially in the aftermath of a recent recall of 18 million chinese-made products by us toy giant mattel because of safety concerns . an opportunity , not a threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen : " there is no such thing as the ' china threat theory . " '
critics of china have also voiced concerns in recent years that the country 's economic rise could potentially be seen as a threat to the rest of the world , especially in view of china 's deplorable human rights record . " china 's development is an opportunity , not a threat , " wen said .
" we have decades of work ahead before we can be even a moderately well-developed country . " the chinese premier stressed that his country was still struggling with issues such as poverty and population growth , but added that chinese intentions were not sinister . " china will always take the peaceful road , " he said .
" china is very happy to cooperate with all nations but will never threaten ... so it 's clear , everyone please be at ease , there is no such thing as the ' china threat theory . " ' hi-tech espionage ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were german government computers compromised by hackers from china ?
merkel 's talks with the chinese premier came only two days after the german news magazine der spiegel reported that chinese hackers had broken into the government computer network in berlin . according to the magazine , spy programs - which investigations showed could be tracked to the chinese people 's liberation army - were uncovered at merkel 's office , the foreign ministry and other government institutions . " we in the government took -lrb- the reports -rrb- as a matter of grave concern , " wen said . " hackers breaking into and sabotaging computers is a problem faced by the entire world . " the chinese premier emphasized that fighting hacking must be a joint effort and that china will cooperate with germany on this issue . " we are willing to maintain cooperation with the german government and take firm and effective action to prevent all hacking acts that threaten computer systems , " he said . climate goals wen promised china would undertake greater efforts to prevent global warming in its next environmental five-year plan starting in 2011 , but stressed that china 's responsibilities regarding carbon-dioxide emissions were not the same as those of long-time industrialized nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and china are important trade partners even if they do n't see eye-to-eye on human rights " it will be extremely difficult to reach these targets , but we have already shown our determination , " wen said .
" we have a much tougher task than germany does . " china has long maintained that wealthy nations - those that have already benefited from emissions-producing industrial booms - are the ones who should take the lead in cutting greenhouse-gas emissions . " china has taken part of the responsibility for climate change for only 30 years while industrial countries have grown fast for the last 200 years , " he said . merkel , who made climate change a key focus of germany 's presidency over the g8 group of leading industrialized nations , emphasized that all countries needed to work on energy efficiency . " developed countries should help by providing the latest technology , " she said . china has set goals to reduce its energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2011 , but its consumption fell by only 1.23 percent last year .
it also failed to meet its targeted 2-percent reduction in emissions of major water and air pollutants last year , recording instead toxic levels rising by almost 2 percent . merkel also met with chinese president hu jintao later on monday .

" '
critics of china have also voiced concerns in recent years that the country 's economic rise could potentially be seen as a threat to the rest of the world , especially in view of china 's deplorable human rights record . " china 's development is an opportunity , not a threat , " wen said .
" we have decades of work ahead before we can be even a moderately well-developed country . " the chinese premier stressed that his country was still struggling with issues such as poverty and population growth , but added that chinese intentions were not sinister .

merkel 's talks with the chinese premier came only two days after the german news magazine der spiegel reported that chinese hackers had broken into the government computer network in berlin . according to the magazine , spy programs - which investigations showed could be tracked to the chinese people 's liberation army - were uncovered at merkel 's office , the foreign ministry and other government institutions . " we in the government took -lrb- the reports -rrb- as a matter of grave concern , " wen said . " hackers breaking into and sabotaging computers is a problem faced by the entire world .

" we are willing to maintain cooperation with the german government and take firm and effective action to prevent all hacking acts that threaten computer systems , " he said . climate goals wen promised china would undertake greater efforts to prevent global warming in its next environmental five-year plan starting in 2011 , but stressed that china 's responsibilities regarding carbon-dioxide emissions were not the same as those of long-time industrialized nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and china are important trade partners even if they do n't see eye-to-eye on human rights " it will be extremely difficult to reach these targets , but we have already shown our determination , " wen said .
" we have a much tougher task than germany does . " china has long maintained that wealthy nations - those that have already benefited from emissions-producing industrial booms - are the ones who should take the lead in cutting greenhouse-gas emissions . " china has taken part of the responsibility for climate change for only 30 years while industrial countries have grown fast for the last 200 years , " he said . merkel , who made climate change a key focus of germany 's presidency over the g8 group of leading industrialized nations , emphasized that all countries needed to work on energy efficiency . " developed countries should help by providing the latest technology , " she said . china has set goals to reduce its energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2011 , but its consumption fell by only 1.23 percent last year .
it also failed to meet its targeted 2-percent reduction in emissions of major water and air pollutants last year , recording instead toxic levels rising by almost 2 percent . merkel also met with chinese president hu jintao later on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 27.08.2007 experts say new alert system needed in eu child searches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madeleine mccann 's parents have spread the word with their own media campaign the eu has a lot of experience in dealing with cross-border problems .
so it should come as no surprise that its efforts to solve child abduction cases should focus on cooperation and standardized search procedures . there have probably been as many column inches written about the efforts of kate and gerry mccann to find their missing daughter madeleine as the investigation into the alleged abduction itself .
the campaign by the missing four-year-old 's family and friends to keep maddy 's face in the media has drawn both praise and criticism since it swung into action in the days after her disappearance from the mccanns ' apartment at the praia da luz resort in portugal on may 3 .
whether one admires or criticizes the mccanns ' use of the media in the search for their daughter , one thing can not be ignored : the media strategy has resulted in an unprecedented level of coverage regarding a child 's abduction .
but should a family have to create its own rolling news channel to keep the world informed of the efforts to find a missing child ?
could the creation of the " find madeleine " campaign also be a reaction to inadequate international search procedures ?
incompatibilities obvious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerry and kate mccann gave the public vital information one of the most debated aspects of the mccann investigation has been the extensive criticism of the portuguese police .
critics of the policia judiciaria have highlighted the differences between portuguese methods and those employed in the search for a child in madeleine 's native britain and other eu countries .
in particular , the police have been accused of failing to distribute information for hours after maddy vanished , for delays in passing a description to border or marine police and for refusing offers of help from international experts for almost three months .
the portuguese have defended themselves by saying that under article 86 of the country 's penal code information must not be released , apart from in exceptional circumstances , while the criminal investigation is still taking place .
while similar types of secrecy laws regarding ongoing police investigations exist in most european countries , information covered by these laws tends to apply to evidence and situations that need to be kept under wraps in the search for a suspect .
few prevent the broadcast or distribution of information regarding a missing child .
eu-wide alert system ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police cooperation across the eu is improving slowly the mccann case has raised new calls for a europe-wide response procedure in the case of abducted children .
while the european commission is already trying to increase cooperation in cross-border investigations , there are currently no plans to standardize the response in the case of a missing child .
" we have been told that there are no plans at the moment for an eu-wide alert system , " said carolyn bouchard from independent child protection agency safehands .
" the level of police cooperation is slowly improving and most current systems work well on a national level , but we continue to push for an efficient network across the continent . "
delphine moralis , the acting secretary general for the european federation for missing and sexually exploited children , was more specific .
" based on the experience of its members -lrb- 21 non-governmental organizations in 14 eu countries -rrb- when dealing with missing children cases across the eu , missing children europe advocates the need to develop alert support systems for cases of child abductions or life threatening disappearances of children in countries where no system exists , " she said .
" we also recommend the development of co-ordination procedures and interconnection schemes between existing systems , such as the ones in belgium , france , germany , greece and the uk . "
the closest thing europe currently has to a standardized response is the amber alert , a procedure imported from the united states , although not all countries in the eu use it .
amber alerts a tried and tested response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public is a vaulable resource in any abduction case amber alerts are issued by police when four main criteria of a child abduction case are satisfied : when a child under 16 goes missing ; when the child is believed kidnapped , when a senior police officer fears that death or serious harm may come about , and when the case has sufficient descriptive details , such as photographs of the child or suspected abductor .
the alerts are then broadcast to the public via radio and television stations , immediately interrupting scheduled broadcasting to report the missing child .
the alerts are also shown on electronic motorway signs and sent to email accounts , mobile phones and wireless devices of registered search volunteers .
" a coordinated amber alert system in europe would be hugely beneficial because one of the most critical parts of an abduction investigation is informing the public , " said robert hoever , from the us national center for missing and exploited children -lrb- ncmec -rrb- .
" it would require each country to have a designated amber facilitator and for all the facilitators to meet and plan together a memorandum of understanding as to how they would work together . "
cross-border structures needed for success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations must cross borders seemlessly to succeed hoever believes that having a similar system and a coordinator in every eu member state would greatly improve cross-border child abduction investigations in the bloc .
" contact person ' a ' would be responsible for putting the alert out in his or her own country and if information suggested the child had crossed the border , then ' a ' calls ' b ' and the same system kicks in , " he said .
however , according to hoever , bringing in a standardized amber alert-type system in europe would only work if other investigative strategies were already in place .
" before you have a standardized alert system , you have to address the cross-border problems .
you ca n't try and solve differences in police procedure during a case ; you waste time and endanger the child further .
these strategies between countries should be in place first . "
delphine moralis agreed .
" any system developed at eu level will have to start by looking at what already exists at the national level , " she said . " many questions remain to be analyzed , both regarding the procedures and regarding technical implementation of a system . "
a painful lesson so did the inadequacy of existing structures hinder the search for madeleine mccann in the first hours of her disappearance ?
" in portugal , missing children europe has an ngo member called instituto de apoio à criança i.a.c. , lisbon , which launched a hotline for missing children on may 25 , 2004 , " moralis said . " however , due to a lack of financial means and political support , no fully developed ' child alert ' or ' amber alert system ' has been launched in portugal yet . "
she said a good communication and coordination among existing systems as well as child search programs in countries which do n't currently have them could well have made a difference in the case of madeleine mccann . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as german politicians are reconsidering a ban of the ultra-right npd party after recent xenophobic attacks . fourteen percent of the women canvassed said they would not rule out giving their ballot to a party to the right of the conservative christian democratic union or its bavarian sister party , the csu , at the next state parliamentary elections .
nine percent of men , in comparison , said they would do the same in the emnid survey commissioned by the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
emnid head , klaus-peter schöppner , called the results " surprising . " " women do n't usually lean towards the rightwing spectrum so strongly , " he told the newspaper .
right shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dissatisfaction with family policy may be the reason for the poll results schöppner said conservative women voters with traditional family views were possibly disappointed by the conservatives ' modern family politics . " some have stopped voting , " he said .
" others have turned towards parties of the far-right . "
in addition to the discrepancy between men and women in their voting patterns , the survey also showed a split between eastern and western germany .
eleven percent of western germans canvassed by emnid said they would vote for far-right parties , in comparison to 15 percent in eastern germany .
germany has recently seen a spate of racist violence that has prompted renewed calls to ban the far-right npd party .

merkel 's hosts said they would investigate . merkel said that china needed " to respect the rules of the game , " after talks in beijing touched upon controversial issues such as piracy and unsafe chinese exports . " in our talks , i made clear that every country has the right to development , " merkel told journalists in a joint press conference after the one-hour meeting with the chinese premier wen jiabao .
" but at present there are a great many large countries such as china that are developing fast and there is a need to respect the rules of the game . " the label " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months , especially in the aftermath of a recent recall of 18 million chinese-made products by us toy giant mattel because of safety concerns . an opportunity , not a threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen : " there is no such thing as the ' china threat theory . " '
critics of china have also voiced concerns in recent years that the country 's economic rise could potentially be seen as a threat to the rest of the world , especially in view of china 's deplorable human rights record . " china 's development is an opportunity , not a threat , " wen said .
" we have decades of work ahead before we can be even a moderately well-developed country . " the chinese premier stressed that his country was still struggling with issues such as poverty and population growth , but added that chinese intentions were not sinister . " china will always take the peaceful road , " he said .
" china is very happy to cooperate with all nations but will never threaten ... so it 's clear , everyone please be at ease , there is no such thing as the ' china threat theory . " ' hi-tech espionage ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were german government computers compromised by hackers from china ?
merkel 's talks with the chinese premier came only two days after the german news magazine der spiegel reported that chinese hackers had broken into the government computer network in berlin . according to the magazine , spy programs - which investigations showed could be tracked to the chinese people 's liberation army - were uncovered at merkel 's office , the foreign ministry and other government institutions . " we in the government took -lrb- the reports -rrb- as a matter of grave concern , " wen said . " hackers breaking into and sabotaging computers is a problem faced by the entire world . " the chinese premier emphasized that fighting hacking must be a joint effort and that china will cooperate with germany on this issue . " we are willing to maintain cooperation with the german government and take firm and effective action to prevent all hacking acts that threaten computer systems , " he said . climate goals wen promised china would undertake greater efforts to prevent global warming in its next environmental five-year plan starting in 2011 , but stressed that china 's responsibilities regarding carbon-dioxide emissions were not the same as those of long-time industrialized nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and china are important trade partners even if they do n't see eye-to-eye on human rights " it will be extremely difficult to reach these targets , but we have already shown our determination , " wen said .
" we have a much tougher task than germany does . " china has long maintained that wealthy nations - those that have already benefited from emissions-producing industrial booms - are the ones who should take the lead in cutting greenhouse-gas emissions . " china has taken part of the responsibility for climate change for only 30 years while industrial countries have grown fast for the last 200 years , " he said . merkel , who made climate change a key focus of germany 's presidency over the g8 group of leading industrialized nations , emphasized that all countries needed to work on energy efficiency . " developed countries should help by providing the latest technology , " she said . china has set goals to reduce its energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2011 , but its consumption fell by only 1.23 percent last year .
it also failed to meet its targeted 2-percent reduction in emissions of major water and air pollutants last year , recording instead toxic levels rising by almost 2 percent . merkel also met with chinese president hu jintao later on monday .
she will head for japan on wednesday , where she will also address climate change and economic issues . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if we succeed , then it will be a collective success and if we fail , it will be a collective failure , " gallois told the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday . the eads and its subsidiary airbus previously had an awkward management structure with two co-chairmen and two co-chief executives from france and germany .
the twin-headed management structure had been widely blamed for slow decision-making and inefficiency which lead to significant financial losses and product delays . the new deal , hammered out by german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy in july , gave each country a chance to have one top position in the concern . france 's louis gallois , took over on monday as the sole chief executive of the eads , while his former eads co-chief , germany 's tom enders , took the reins at airbus . gallois said he did not want to be the " french ceo of eads , but the ceo of eads . " old challenges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former eads co-chiefs thomas enders , left , and louis gallois now have separate jobs it is yet to be seen , whether the new management structure will bring the much-needed improvements to the company .
a french trade unionist complained publicly last week about the new board of the group , which is now made up of six germans , two french managers , one spaniard and an english director .
gallois said that the current arrangement , whereby the company has two headquarters , one in paris and one in munich was not ideal .
" one day we will have to agree on a single office , " gallois said . " but the time is not ripe for that , " he said , adding that he could imagine a transition to single headquarters taking place " in a few years . " golden shares also on monday , rudiger grube , who has become the sole chairman of eads backed the idea of " golden shares " in the company , which would be held by chosen shareholders and which could outvote all other shares in certain specified circumstances , such as a hostile takeover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy found a solution to eads ' cumbersome dual management structure " taking into account eads ' contribution to the sovereignty and security of europe , it 's a legitimate question , " grube said in an interview with the french financial daily les echos . " many aerospace companies around the world have protection of this type . " he said a a working group set up by eads shareholders would hand in its conclusions before the next shareholder meeting . " we would like to make a proposal during the next agm , in may 2008 , at the latest , " grube said . earlier this month , a german government spokesperson confirmed that chancellor angela merkel 's administration was looking into ways to protect german interests in the european aerospace company and that it was calling for it to recieve a golden share . golden share have been used in the past by governments of eu member states to allow them to keep controlling voting rights in partially privatized companies , but are not viewed favorably by the european commission . eads is controlled by a group of french and german shareholders which are either public or politically-linked private investors .

this comes as german politicians are reconsidering a ban of the ultra-right npd party after recent xenophobic attacks . fourteen percent of the women canvassed said they would not rule out giving their ballot to a party to the right of the conservative christian democratic union or its bavarian sister party , the csu , at the next state parliamentary elections .
nine percent of men , in comparison , said they would do the same in the emnid survey commissioned by the german newspaper bild am sonntag .

in addition to the discrepancy between men and women in their voting patterns , the survey also showed a split between eastern and western germany .

" if we succeed , then it will be a collective success and if we fail , it will be a collective failure , " gallois told the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday . the eads and its subsidiary airbus previously had an awkward management structure with two co-chairmen and two co-chief executives from france and germany .
the twin-headed management structure had been widely blamed for slow decision-making and inefficiency which lead to significant financial losses and product delays . the new deal , hammered out by german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy in july , gave each country a chance to have one top position in the concern . france 's louis gallois , took over on monday as the sole chief executive of the eads , while his former eads co-chief , germany 's tom enders , took the reins at airbus . gallois said he did not want to be the " french ceo of eads , but the ceo of eads . " old challenges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former eads co-chiefs thomas enders , left , and louis gallois now have separate jobs it is yet to be seen , whether the new management structure will bring the much-needed improvements to the company .
a french trade unionist complained publicly last week about the new board of the group , which is now made up of six germans , two french managers , one spaniard and an english director .
gallois said that the current arrangement , whereby the company has two headquarters , one in paris and one in munich was not ideal .
" one day we will have to agree on a single office , " gallois said . " but the time is not ripe for that , " he said , adding that he could imagine a transition to single headquarters taking place " in a few years . " golden shares also on monday , rudiger grube , who has become the sole chairman of eads backed the idea of " golden shares " in the company , which would be held by chosen shareholders and which could outvote all other shares in certain specified circumstances , such as a hostile takeover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy found a solution to eads ' cumbersome dual management structure " taking into account eads ' contribution to the sovereignty and security of europe , it 's a legitimate question , " grube said in an interview with the french financial daily les echos . " many aerospace companies around the world have protection of this type . " he said a a working group set up by eads shareholders would hand in its conclusions before the next shareholder meeting . " we would like to make a proposal during the next agm , in may 2008 , at the latest , " grube said . earlier this month , a german government spokesperson confirmed that chancellor angela merkel 's administration was looking into ways to protect german interests in the european aerospace company and that it was calling for it to recieve a golden share . golden share have been used in the past by governments of eu member states to allow them to keep controlling voting rights in partially privatized companies , but are not viewed favorably by the european commission . eads is controlled by a group of french and german shareholders which are either public or politically-linked private investors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 27.08.2007 rumor mill churns out jobs in la , london for klinsmann großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann remains tight-lipped over rumors linking him to la galaxy and tottenham you used to know where you were with jürgen klinsmann .
until he took over the german national team , it was most likely to be on a beach in california .
these days , klinsi could be anywhere if you listen to soccer rumors . what a year it has been for jürgen klinsmann .
if one believes everything written about the former germany coach over the past 12 months it appears that klinsi has spent his sabbatical jet-setting around the globe , having high-profile interviews for every vacant managerial position in soccer - and turning every single one of the down .
after relinquishing the reins of the national squad after the 2006 world cup , klinsmann has been linked to coaching jobs with the national teams of the united states , australia and mexico and was touted as a successor to jose moriniho as manager of english premiership side chelsea before the current season began .
now it seems that klinsmann is either going to try his hand at owning a soccer club or add his enthusiastic momentum to the slow revolution of the game in his adopted homeland of the united states .
the latest klinsi rumors surfaced last week as his former international charges beat england in a friendly match in london and tottenham hotspur , his former league club in the english capital , was going through a highly premature coaching crisis .
just two days after a makeshift germany side triumphed 2-1 at wembley , klinsmann 's name was cropping up in relation to one of those who faced his compatriots on wednesday night .
klinsi allegedly in line for galaxy hot-seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham 's arrival has stressed his coach out david beckham , formerly a serious soccer player and now main attraction at la galaxy 's traveling circus , had just arrived back in the us after a grueling transatlantic round trip and could barely muster a limp in his side 's loss to local rivals chivas in the major soccer league western conference clash .
while most of the stateside stories asked whether becks could handle playing for the galaxy and helping england qualify for the 2008 european championships at the same time , others were inserting paragraphs about how galaxy coach frank yallop could n't handle managing the former real madrid and man united mega-star .
with the galaxy languishing second from bottom in the conference and way off the pace for the play-off places , yallop 's days look to be numbered .
and so , with a very high-profile manager 's seat on the verge of becoming vacant , klinsmann 's name was once again churned out by the rumor mill .
oc resident with great cv klinsmann , already a resident of the sunshine state , would not have to travel far to take over from yallop if he were to be forced out of the galaxy hot-seat .
but , true to form , the german has refused to say anything , neither denying nor confirming any involvement and stoking the fires of speculation further by keeping his own counsel .
however , klinsmann worked as a consultant for the galaxy in 2004 before taking over the germany team and with his orange county home just 20 minutes away from the team 's base , it appears as though the connections and infrastructure are already in place for klinsi 's return to coaching .
but as recent history has taught us , we 've been here before .
former spurs striker to return as coach ?
now , depending on which newspapers you 've been reading , klinsmann could be forsaking the chance to coach beckham and co. in the californian sunshine for either the chairman ’ s or manager ’ s job at premiership side tottenham .
four games in and the crazy world of english soccer is already talking about its first potential coaching casualty .
three defeats in four have seen the pressure heaped on incumbent coach martin jol and it appears the man who has taken tottenham to consecutive fifth-place finishes after years of mid-table mediocrity now has only three more matches to save his job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi would get a better car if he returned to spurs as coach if he is sacked by the end of september , some papers have klinsmann battling it out with sevilla coach juande ramos for the vacancy , should it happen .
ramos has an enviable record in spain but klinsmann , a talismanic striker for spurs during two spells with the club in the 90 's , remains a firm favorite with the fans .
other papers , however , paint klinsmann as the knight in shining armor riding into the boardroom at spurs to save both jol and the club from the apparent insanity which has settled over the current board .
again , the strings pulling this potential deal into shape stretch back to california .
a consortium of businessmen are reportedly lining up a financial package which would buy spurs outright and hand klinsmann either the coach ’ s job or a director of soccer position in which he has ultimate control of the playing side -lrb- again , depending on who you read -rrb- .

" if we succeed , then it will be a collective success and if we fail , it will be a collective failure , " gallois told the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday . the eads and its subsidiary airbus previously had an awkward management structure with two co-chairmen and two co-chief executives from france and germany .
the twin-headed management structure had been widely blamed for slow decision-making and inefficiency which lead to significant financial losses and product delays . the new deal , hammered out by german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy in july , gave each country a chance to have one top position in the concern . france 's louis gallois , took over on monday as the sole chief executive of the eads , while his former eads co-chief , germany 's tom enders , took the reins at airbus . gallois said he did not want to be the " french ceo of eads , but the ceo of eads . " old challenges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former eads co-chiefs thomas enders , left , and louis gallois now have separate jobs it is yet to be seen , whether the new management structure will bring the much-needed improvements to the company .
a french trade unionist complained publicly last week about the new board of the group , which is now made up of six germans , two french managers , one spaniard and an english director .
gallois said that the current arrangement , whereby the company has two headquarters , one in paris and one in munich was not ideal .
" one day we will have to agree on a single office , " gallois said . " but the time is not ripe for that , " he said , adding that he could imagine a transition to single headquarters taking place " in a few years . " golden shares also on monday , rudiger grube , who has become the sole chairman of eads backed the idea of " golden shares " in the company , which would be held by chosen shareholders and which could outvote all other shares in certain specified circumstances , such as a hostile takeover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy found a solution to eads ' cumbersome dual management structure " taking into account eads ' contribution to the sovereignty and security of europe , it 's a legitimate question , " grube said in an interview with the french financial daily les echos . " many aerospace companies around the world have protection of this type . " he said a a working group set up by eads shareholders would hand in its conclusions before the next shareholder meeting . " we would like to make a proposal during the next agm , in may 2008 , at the latest , " grube said . earlier this month , a german government spokesperson confirmed that chancellor angela merkel 's administration was looking into ways to protect german interests in the european aerospace company and that it was calling for it to recieve a golden share . golden share have been used in the past by governments of eu member states to allow them to keep controlling voting rights in partially privatized companies , but are not viewed favorably by the european commission . eads is controlled by a group of french and german shareholders which are either public or politically-linked private investors .

until he took over the german national team , it was most likely to be on a beach in california .
these days , klinsi could be anywhere if you listen to soccer rumors . what a year it has been for jürgen klinsmann .
if one believes everything written about the former germany coach over the past 12 months it appears that klinsi has spent his sabbatical jet-setting around the globe , having high-profile interviews for every vacant managerial position in soccer - and turning every single one of the down .
after relinquishing the reins of the national squad after the 2006 world cup , klinsmann has been linked to coaching jobs with the national teams of the united states , australia and mexico and was touted as a successor to jose moriniho as manager of english premiership side chelsea before the current season began .
now it seems that klinsmann is either going to try his hand at owning a soccer club or add his enthusiastic momentum to the slow revolution of the game in his adopted homeland of the united states .
the latest klinsi rumors surfaced last week as his former international charges beat england in a friendly match in london and tottenham hotspur , his former league club in the english capital , was going through a highly premature coaching crisis .
just two days after a makeshift germany side triumphed 2-1 at wembley , klinsmann 's name was cropping up in relation to one of those who faced his compatriots on wednesday night .
klinsi allegedly in line for galaxy hot-seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham 's arrival has stressed his coach out david beckham , formerly a serious soccer player and now main attraction at la galaxy 's traveling circus , had just arrived back in the us after a grueling transatlantic round trip and could barely muster a limp in his side 's loss to local rivals chivas in the major soccer league western conference clash .
while most of the stateside stories asked whether becks could handle playing for the galaxy and helping england qualify for the 2008 european championships at the same time , others were inserting paragraphs about how galaxy coach frank yallop could n't handle managing the former real madrid and man united mega-star .
with the galaxy languishing second from bottom in the conference and way off the pace for the play-off places , yallop 's days look to be numbered .
and so , with a very high-profile manager 's seat on the verge of becoming vacant , klinsmann 's name was once again churned out by the rumor mill .
oc resident with great cv klinsmann , already a resident of the sunshine state , would not have to travel far to take over from yallop if he were to be forced out of the galaxy hot-seat .
but , true to form , the german has refused to say anything , neither denying nor confirming any involvement and stoking the fires of speculation further by keeping his own counsel .
however , klinsmann worked as a consultant for the galaxy in 2004 before taking over the germany team and with his orange county home just 20 minutes away from the team 's base , it appears as though the connections and infrastructure are already in place for klinsi 's return to coaching .
but as recent history has taught us , we 've been here before .
former spurs striker to return as coach ?
now , depending on which newspapers you 've been reading , klinsmann could be forsaking the chance to coach beckham and co. in the californian sunshine for either the chairman ’ s or manager ’ s job at premiership side tottenham .
four games in and the crazy world of english soccer is already talking about its first potential coaching casualty .
three defeats in four have seen the pressure heaped on incumbent coach martin jol and it appears the man who has taken tottenham to consecutive fifth-place finishes after years of mid-table mediocrity now has only three more matches to save his job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi would get a better car if he returned to spurs as coach if he is sacked by the end of september , some papers have klinsmann battling it out with sevilla coach juande ramos for the vacancy , should it happen .
ramos has an enviable record in spain but klinsmann , a talismanic striker for spurs during two spells with the club in the 90 's , remains a firm favorite with the fans .
other papers , however , paint klinsmann as the knight in shining armor riding into the boardroom at spurs to save both jol and the club from the apparent insanity which has settled over the current board .
again , the strings pulling this potential deal into shape stretch back to california .

and so , with a very high-profile manager 's seat on the verge of becoming vacant , klinsmann 's name was once again churned out by the rumor mill .
oc resident with great cv klinsmann , already a resident of the sunshine state , would not have to travel far to take over from yallop if he were to be forced out of the galaxy hot-seat .
but , true to form , the german has refused to say anything , neither denying nor confirming any involvement and stoking the fires of speculation further by keeping his own counsel .
however , klinsmann worked as a consultant for the galaxy in 2004 before taking over the germany team and with his orange county home just 20 minutes away from the team 's base , it appears as though the connections and infrastructure are already in place for klinsi 's return to coaching .
but as recent history has taught us , we 've been here before .
former spurs striker to return as coach ?
now , depending on which newspapers you 've been reading , klinsmann could be forsaking the chance to coach beckham and co. in the californian sunshine for either the chairman ’ s or manager ’ s job at premiership side tottenham .
four games in and the crazy world of english soccer is already talking about its first potential coaching casualty .
three defeats in four have seen the pressure heaped on incumbent coach martin jol and it appears the man who has taken tottenham to consecutive fifth-place finishes after years of mid-table mediocrity now has only three more matches to save his job .

other papers , however , paint klinsmann as the knight in shining armor riding into the boardroom at spurs to save both jol and the club from the apparent insanity which has settled over the current board .

until he took over the german national team , it was most likely to be on a beach in california .
these days , klinsi could be anywhere if you listen to soccer rumors . what a year it has been for jürgen klinsmann .
if one believes everything written about the former germany coach over the past 12 months it appears that klinsi has spent his sabbatical jet-setting around the globe , having high-profile interviews for every vacant managerial position in soccer - and turning every single one of the down .
after relinquishing the reins of the national squad after the 2006 world cup , klinsmann has been linked to coaching jobs with the national teams of the united states , australia and mexico and was touted as a successor to jose moriniho as manager of english premiership side chelsea before the current season began .
now it seems that klinsmann is either going to try his hand at owning a soccer club or add his enthusiastic momentum to the slow revolution of the game in his adopted homeland of the united states .
the latest klinsi rumors surfaced last week as his former international charges beat england in a friendly match in london and tottenham hotspur , his former league club in the english capital , was going through a highly premature coaching crisis .
just two days after a makeshift germany side triumphed 2-1 at wembley , klinsmann 's name was cropping up in relation to one of those who faced his compatriots on wednesday night .
klinsi allegedly in line for galaxy hot-seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham 's arrival has stressed his coach out david beckham , formerly a serious soccer player and now main attraction at la galaxy 's traveling circus , had just arrived back in the us after a grueling transatlantic round trip and could barely muster a limp in his side 's loss to local rivals chivas in the major soccer league western conference clash .
while most of the stateside stories asked whether becks could handle playing for the galaxy and helping england qualify for the 2008 european championships at the same time , others were inserting paragraphs about how galaxy coach frank yallop could n't handle managing the former real madrid and man united mega-star .

merkel 's hosts said they would investigate . merkel said that china needed " to respect the rules of the game , " after talks in beijing touched upon controversial issues such as piracy and unsafe chinese exports . " in our talks , i made clear that every country has the right to development , " merkel told journalists in a joint press conference after the one-hour meeting with the chinese premier wen jiabao .
" but at present there are a great many large countries such as china that are developing fast and there is a need to respect the rules of the game . " the label " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months , especially in the aftermath of a recent recall of 18 million chinese-made products by us toy giant mattel because of safety concerns . an opportunity , not a threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen : " there is no such thing as the ' china threat theory . " '
critics of china have also voiced concerns in recent years that the country 's economic rise could potentially be seen as a threat to the rest of the world , especially in view of china 's deplorable human rights record . " china 's development is an opportunity , not a threat , " wen said .
" we have decades of work ahead before we can be even a moderately well-developed country . " the chinese premier stressed that his country was still struggling with issues such as poverty and population growth , but added that chinese intentions were not sinister . " china will always take the peaceful road , " he said .
" china is very happy to cooperate with all nations but will never threaten ... so it 's clear , everyone please be at ease , there is no such thing as the ' china threat theory . " ' hi-tech espionage ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were german government computers compromised by hackers from china ?
merkel 's talks with the chinese premier came only two days after the german news magazine der spiegel reported that chinese hackers had broken into the government computer network in berlin . according to the magazine , spy programs - which investigations showed could be tracked to the chinese people 's liberation army - were uncovered at merkel 's office , the foreign ministry and other government institutions . " we in the government took -lrb- the reports -rrb- as a matter of grave concern , " wen said . " hackers breaking into and sabotaging computers is a problem faced by the entire world . " the chinese premier emphasized that fighting hacking must be a joint effort and that china will cooperate with germany on this issue . " we are willing to maintain cooperation with the german government and take firm and effective action to prevent all hacking acts that threaten computer systems , " he said . climate goals wen promised china would undertake greater efforts to prevent global warming in its next environmental five-year plan starting in 2011 , but stressed that china 's responsibilities regarding carbon-dioxide emissions were not the same as those of long-time industrialized nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and china are important trade partners even if they do n't see eye-to-eye on human rights " it will be extremely difficult to reach these targets , but we have already shown our determination , " wen said .
" we have a much tougher task than germany does . " china has long maintained that wealthy nations - those that have already benefited from emissions-producing industrial booms - are the ones who should take the lead in cutting greenhouse-gas emissions . " china has taken part of the responsibility for climate change for only 30 years while industrial countries have grown fast for the last 200 years , " he said . merkel , who made climate change a key focus of germany 's presidency over the g8 group of leading industrialized nations , emphasized that all countries needed to work on energy efficiency . " developed countries should help by providing the latest technology , " she said . china has set goals to reduce its energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2011 , but its consumption fell by only 1.23 percent last year .
it also failed to meet its targeted 2-percent reduction in emissions of major water and air pollutants last year , recording instead toxic levels rising by almost 2 percent . merkel also met with chinese president hu jintao later on monday .
she will head for japan on wednesday , where she will also address climate change and economic issues . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a police spokesman said the assailants admitted their involvement in the attack , which put the sudanese in hospital for several days , but denied hitting him on the head with a bottle .
the incident occurred on the same evening as eight indians were attacked and chased through the streets of mügeln after a local festival in the town in germany 's former communist east .
in a series of attacks late friday evening , a man from ghana and an iraqi were assaulted and racially abused in two separate incidents while a mob went on the rampage in another town .
the 36-year-old iraqi was beaten with a baseball bat by a man who set his dog on him at a tram stop in the eastern city of magdeburg .
police said monday they were looking for a suspected right-wing extremist in connection with the assault .
single attacks and mob violence spreads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have faced mobs containing some extremists two men were being questioned in braunschweig on monday after a 49-year-old ghanaian was beaten up in what police said might have been a racially motivated attack or a drug-related incident .
police said one of those involved had links to the right-wing scene .
in another incident on friday evening , a mob of about 40 young men went on the rampage at a fair in the eastern town of bützow , smashing stalls and pelting police with bottles .
police said members of local right-wing groups were involved in the rampage , which also targeted a snack bar operated by a pakistani who has lived in the town since 2002 .
" i was afraid for my life , " mahmood saqib told reporters on monday .
the mob also shouted anti-turkish slogans , said saqib , who was in his flat above the premises at the time .
" we 'll come up and finish you off , " they yelled at him , he said .
efforts to ban npd hit constitutional wall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous attempts to ban the npd have failed the incidents rekindled calls for a ban on the extreme right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which is represented in the regional parliaments of two of the eastern states where the attacks occurred .
leading german politicians have expressed doubts whether a ban could be imposed after a similar attempt was quashed by the country 's top court in 2003 .
the deputy president of the european commission , franco frattini , called for the banning of the npd after the attack in mügeln .
he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper on sunday that neo-nazis represented " a threat " and " an ulcerous cancer for democratic countries like germany . "
german chancellor angela merkel condemned the attack in mügeln as " extremely grim and shameful " and a government spokesman said it was harmful to germany 's image abroad . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the city 's mayor has hailed the work as an " enrichment , " the archbishop reportedly never wanted it . the new window is made up of 11,200 squares and has been installed on the sunny , south-facing side of the gothic cathedral .
more than 1,000 visitors came to witness the event .
eagerly craning their necks upwards to view the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184 square-foot -rrb- artwork , the majority seemed entranced by the kaleidoscope of colors .
" the cathedral has been enriched and so has the city , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said after the unveiling .
top opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the inauguration ceremony , the window was described as producing a " symphony of light " but not everyone is apparently happy with the new design .
the online edition of the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper reported that none less than the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , opposed it .
citing a close confidante of meisner 's , the stadt-anzeiger wrote that the archbishop even tried to stop the project , resulting in serious disputes within the committee responsible for deciding over the window .
" the cardinal did not want this window , " said the source . the archbishop , who is not opposed to modern art per se , reportedly wanted to have a figurative work , for example with representations of saints or 20th century martyrs , rather than an abstract one .
cathedral provost norbert feldhoff said the reason for meisner 's absence at the unveiling ceremony was " purely technical " and was linked to a clash with a previously planned trip to poland .

the 75-year-old artist , who has a reputation for being a man of few words , seemed to be happy with his work and said he was proud " it had n't gone wrong . "
richter said it had been a little bit " nerve-wracking " to create a work that , unlike a picture , could not simply be taken down again .

" if we succeed , then it will be a collective success and if we fail , it will be a collective failure , " gallois told the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday . the eads and its subsidiary airbus previously had an awkward management structure with two co-chairmen and two co-chief executives from france and germany .
the twin-headed management structure had been widely blamed for slow decision-making and inefficiency which lead to significant financial losses and product delays . the new deal , hammered out by german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy in july , gave each country a chance to have one top position in the concern . france 's louis gallois , took over on monday as the sole chief executive of the eads , while his former eads co-chief , germany 's tom enders , took the reins at airbus . gallois said he did not want to be the " french ceo of eads , but the ceo of eads . " old challenges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former eads co-chiefs thomas enders , left , and louis gallois now have separate jobs it is yet to be seen , whether the new management structure will bring the much-needed improvements to the company .
a french trade unionist complained publicly last week about the new board of the group , which is now made up of six germans , two french managers , one spaniard and an english director .
gallois said that the current arrangement , whereby the company has two headquarters , one in paris and one in munich was not ideal .
" one day we will have to agree on a single office , " gallois said . " but the time is not ripe for that , " he said , adding that he could imagine a transition to single headquarters taking place " in a few years . " golden shares also on monday , rudiger grube , who has become the sole chairman of eads backed the idea of " golden shares " in the company , which would be held by chosen shareholders and which could outvote all other shares in certain specified circumstances , such as a hostile takeover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy found a solution to eads ' cumbersome dual management structure " taking into account eads ' contribution to the sovereignty and security of europe , it 's a legitimate question , " grube said in an interview with the french financial daily les echos . " many aerospace companies around the world have protection of this type . " he said a a working group set up by eads shareholders would hand in its conclusions before the next shareholder meeting . " we would like to make a proposal during the next agm , in may 2008 , at the latest , " grube said . earlier this month , a german government spokesperson confirmed that chancellor angela merkel 's administration was looking into ways to protect german interests in the european aerospace company and that it was calling for it to recieve a golden share . golden share have been used in the past by governments of eu member states to allow them to keep controlling voting rights in partially privatized companies , but are not viewed favorably by the european commission . eads is controlled by a group of french and german shareholders which are either public or politically-linked private investors .

until he took over the german national team , it was most likely to be on a beach in california .
these days , klinsi could be anywhere if you listen to soccer rumors . what a year it has been for jürgen klinsmann .
if one believes everything written about the former germany coach over the past 12 months it appears that klinsi has spent his sabbatical jet-setting around the globe , having high-profile interviews for every vacant managerial position in soccer - and turning every single one of the down .
after relinquishing the reins of the national squad after the 2006 world cup , klinsmann has been linked to coaching jobs with the national teams of the united states , australia and mexico and was touted as a successor to jose moriniho as manager of english premiership side chelsea before the current season began .
now it seems that klinsmann is either going to try his hand at owning a soccer club or add his enthusiastic momentum to the slow revolution of the game in his adopted homeland of the united states .
the latest klinsi rumors surfaced last week as his former international charges beat england in a friendly match in london and tottenham hotspur , his former league club in the english capital , was going through a highly premature coaching crisis .
just two days after a makeshift germany side triumphed 2-1 at wembley , klinsmann 's name was cropping up in relation to one of those who faced his compatriots on wednesday night .
klinsi allegedly in line for galaxy hot-seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham 's arrival has stressed his coach out david beckham , formerly a serious soccer player and now main attraction at la galaxy 's traveling circus , had just arrived back in the us after a grueling transatlantic round trip and could barely muster a limp in his side 's loss to local rivals chivas in the major soccer league western conference clash .
while most of the stateside stories asked whether becks could handle playing for the galaxy and helping england qualify for the 2008 european championships at the same time , others were inserting paragraphs about how galaxy coach frank yallop could n't handle managing the former real madrid and man united mega-star .
with the galaxy languishing second from bottom in the conference and way off the pace for the play-off places , yallop 's days look to be numbered .
and so , with a very high-profile manager 's seat on the verge of becoming vacant , klinsmann 's name was once again churned out by the rumor mill .
oc resident with great cv klinsmann , already a resident of the sunshine state , would not have to travel far to take over from yallop if he were to be forced out of the galaxy hot-seat .
but , true to form , the german has refused to say anything , neither denying nor confirming any involvement and stoking the fires of speculation further by keeping his own counsel .
however , klinsmann worked as a consultant for the galaxy in 2004 before taking over the germany team and with his orange county home just 20 minutes away from the team 's base , it appears as though the connections and infrastructure are already in place for klinsi 's return to coaching .
but as recent history has taught us , we 've been here before .
former spurs striker to return as coach ?
now , depending on which newspapers you 've been reading , klinsmann could be forsaking the chance to coach beckham and co. in the californian sunshine for either the chairman ’ s or manager ’ s job at premiership side tottenham .
four games in and the crazy world of english soccer is already talking about its first potential coaching casualty .
three defeats in four have seen the pressure heaped on incumbent coach martin jol and it appears the man who has taken tottenham to consecutive fifth-place finishes after years of mid-table mediocrity now has only three more matches to save his job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi would get a better car if he returned to spurs as coach if he is sacked by the end of september , some papers have klinsmann battling it out with sevilla coach juande ramos for the vacancy , should it happen .
ramos has an enviable record in spain but klinsmann , a talismanic striker for spurs during two spells with the club in the 90 's , remains a firm favorite with the fans .
other papers , however , paint klinsmann as the knight in shining armor riding into the boardroom at spurs to save both jol and the club from the apparent insanity which has settled over the current board .
again , the strings pulling this potential deal into shape stretch back to california .
a consortium of businessmen are reportedly lining up a financial package which would buy spurs outright and hand klinsmann either the coach ’ s job or a director of soccer position in which he has ultimate control of the playing side -lrb- again , depending on who you read -rrb- .
klinsmann , as you would expect , has not commented on this speculation either .

" publishing these films amounts to aiding and abetting incitement of the people , " he told report mainz , adding that the publication of the video clips in germany was " scandalous . " nazi propaganda , neo-nazi music the clips posted on the web site include an anti-semitic film released by the nazis during world war ii called " the jew süss " and a video of the song " kukluxklan " by the outlawed neo-nazi rock group kommando freisler which contains racial slurs and calls for a " total white revolution .

according to sociologist hajo funke , youtube is transgressing against the basic values of liberal democracy by allowing offensive materials to be published on their site . " this is hate speech , " funke told report mainz .
" such texts are indirect incitement to murder and they have in the past - landser texts , for instance - served as triggers for acts of murder in germany . " the fact that youtube freely offers nazi propaganda that hundreds of thousands click on is a crime against young people , " funke said . a recent attack on eight indian men by a mob of 50 germans shouting racist slogans in the town of mügeln in saxony , an attack on two men from sudan and ethiopia in a small town near main in rhineland-palatinate and an attack on an iraqi man in magdeburg in saxony-anhalt have rekindled the debate on xenophobia , racism and right-wing extremism in germany . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" ' hi-tech espionage ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were german government computers compromised by hackers from china ?
merkel 's talks with the chinese premier came only two days after the german news magazine der spiegel reported that chinese hackers had broken into the government computer network in berlin . according to the magazine , spy programs - which investigations showed could be tracked to the chinese people 's liberation army - were uncovered at merkel 's office , the foreign ministry and other government institutions . " we in the government took -lrb- the reports -rrb- as a matter of grave concern , " wen said . " hackers breaking into and sabotaging computers is a problem faced by the entire world . " the chinese premier emphasized that fighting hacking must be a joint effort and that china will cooperate with germany on this issue . " we are willing to maintain cooperation with the german government and take firm and effective action to prevent all hacking acts that threaten computer systems , " he said . climate goals wen promised china would undertake greater efforts to prevent global warming in its next environmental five-year plan starting in 2011 , but stressed that china 's responsibilities regarding carbon-dioxide emissions were not the same as those of long-time industrialized nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and china are important trade partners even if they do n't see eye-to-eye on human rights " it will be extremely difficult to reach these targets , but we have already shown our determination , " wen said .
" we have a much tougher task than germany does . " china has long maintained that wealthy nations - those that have already benefited from emissions-producing industrial booms - are the ones who should take the lead in cutting greenhouse-gas emissions . " china has taken part of the responsibility for climate change for only 30 years while industrial countries have grown fast for the last 200 years , " he said . merkel , who made climate change a key focus of germany 's presidency over the g8 group of leading industrialized nations , emphasized that all countries needed to work on energy efficiency . " developed countries should help by providing the latest technology , " she said . china has set goals to reduce its energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2011 , but its consumption fell by only 1.23 percent last year .
it also failed to meet its targeted 2-percent reduction in emissions of major water and air pollutants last year , recording instead toxic levels rising by almost 2 percent . merkel also met with chinese president hu jintao later on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 27.08.2007 window by artist gerhard richter unveiled at cologne cathedral großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the painter and photographer 's first piece of work for a church a stained glass window by the famous german artist gerhard richter has been unveiled at cologne cathedral .
while the city 's mayor has hailed the work as an " enrichment , " the archbishop reportedly never wanted it . the new window is made up of 11,200 squares and has been installed on the sunny , south-facing side of the gothic cathedral .
more than 1,000 visitors came to witness the event .
eagerly craning their necks upwards to view the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184 square-foot -rrb- artwork , the majority seemed entranced by the kaleidoscope of colors .
" the cathedral has been enriched and so has the city , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said after the unveiling .
top opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the inauguration ceremony , the window was described as producing a " symphony of light " but not everyone is apparently happy with the new design .
the online edition of the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper reported that none less than the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , opposed it .
citing a close confidante of meisner 's , the stadt-anzeiger wrote that the archbishop even tried to stop the project , resulting in serious disputes within the committee responsible for deciding over the window .
" the cardinal did not want this window , " said the source . the archbishop , who is not opposed to modern art per se , reportedly wanted to have a figurative work , for example with representations of saints or 20th century martyrs , rather than an abstract one .
cathedral provost norbert feldhoff said the reason for meisner 's absence at the unveiling ceremony was " purely technical " and was linked to a clash with a previously planned trip to poland .
artist 's gift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter was there to see his work unveiled gerhard richter , who lives in cologne , gave his work on the window for free , while the production costs totaling 370,000 euros -lrb- $ 506,000 -rrb- were covered by private donations .
the 75-year-old artist , who has a reputation for being a man of few words , seemed to be happy with his work and said he was proud " it had n't gone wrong . "
richter said it had been a little bit " nerve-wracking " to create a work that , unlike a picture , could not simply be taken down again .
the original window was destroyed in world war ii and replaced in the 1950s by a nearly transparent piece of glass .
cologne cathedral , which is one of germany 's most famous landmarks , dates back to the 13th century and was added to the world heritage list by unesco in 1996 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as german politicians are reconsidering a ban of the ultra-right npd party after recent xenophobic attacks . fourteen percent of the women canvassed said they would not rule out giving their ballot to a party to the right of the conservative christian democratic union or its bavarian sister party , the csu , at the next state parliamentary elections .
nine percent of men , in comparison , said they would do the same in the emnid survey commissioned by the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
emnid head , klaus-peter schöppner , called the results " surprising . " " women do n't usually lean towards the rightwing spectrum so strongly , " he told the newspaper .
right shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dissatisfaction with family policy may be the reason for the poll results schöppner said conservative women voters with traditional family views were possibly disappointed by the conservatives ' modern family politics . " some have stopped voting , " he said .
" others have turned towards parties of the far-right . "
in addition to the discrepancy between men and women in their voting patterns , the survey also showed a split between eastern and western germany .
eleven percent of western germans canvassed by emnid said they would vote for far-right parties , in comparison to 15 percent in eastern germany .
germany has recently seen a spate of racist violence that has prompted renewed calls to ban the far-right npd party .

a spokesman for the stuttgart-based bank told afp that the sale price would be fixed at the end of the year after lbbw had carried out a more detailed evaluation of the leipzig-based bank .
he said lbbw had also given the bank a 250 million euro -lrb- $ 342 million -rrb- cash injection as " an immediate measure . "
saxony state premier georg milbradt said current turbulence in the capital markets meant that it was impossible for the bank to continue without a partner .
knock-on effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us mortgage crisis has sent stock markets tumbling worldwide news of sachsenlb 's troubles emerged a week ago , when it admitted receiving a financial lifeline of 17.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.7 billion -rrb- from a consortium of other banks in the wake of the us home loans turmoil that sent world markets diving .
but german newspapers reported on friday that this had failed to stem sachsenlb 's liquidity problems caused by its inability to cover the debts of ormond quay , an investment fund under the management of its dublin-based unit .
normalize operations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxony 's state premier says the sale will place operations back on a normal footing milbradt told mdr radio on sunday that the sale of the bank to lbbw would put operations at the bank back on an even keel .
" we promise that the support of baden-württemberg will restore calm , " he said .
" things could be back to normal on monday .
baden-württemberg is not leaping into a black hole with this purchase . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 27.08.2007 rumor mill churns out jobs in la , london for klinsmann großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann remains tight-lipped over rumors linking him to la galaxy and tottenham you used to know where you were with jürgen klinsmann .
until he took over the german national team , it was most likely to be on a beach in california .
these days , klinsi could be anywhere if you listen to soccer rumors . what a year it has been for jürgen klinsmann .
if one believes everything written about the former germany coach over the past 12 months it appears that klinsi has spent his sabbatical jet-setting around the globe , having high-profile interviews for every vacant managerial position in soccer - and turning every single one of the down .
after relinquishing the reins of the national squad after the 2006 world cup , klinsmann has been linked to coaching jobs with the national teams of the united states , australia and mexico and was touted as a successor to jose moriniho as manager of english premiership side chelsea before the current season began .
now it seems that klinsmann is either going to try his hand at owning a soccer club or add his enthusiastic momentum to the slow revolution of the game in his adopted homeland of the united states .
the latest klinsi rumors surfaced last week as his former international charges beat england in a friendly match in london and tottenham hotspur , his former league club in the english capital , was going through a highly premature coaching crisis .
just two days after a makeshift germany side triumphed 2-1 at wembley , klinsmann 's name was cropping up in relation to one of those who faced his compatriots on wednesday night .
klinsi allegedly in line for galaxy hot-seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham 's arrival has stressed his coach out david beckham , formerly a serious soccer player and now main attraction at la galaxy 's traveling circus , had just arrived back in the us after a grueling transatlantic round trip and could barely muster a limp in his side 's loss to local rivals chivas in the major soccer league western conference clash .
while most of the stateside stories asked whether becks could handle playing for the galaxy and helping england qualify for the 2008 european championships at the same time , others were inserting paragraphs about how galaxy coach frank yallop could n't handle managing the former real madrid and man united mega-star .
with the galaxy languishing second from bottom in the conference and way off the pace for the play-off places , yallop 's days look to be numbered .
and so , with a very high-profile manager 's seat on the verge of becoming vacant , klinsmann 's name was once again churned out by the rumor mill .
oc resident with great cv klinsmann , already a resident of the sunshine state , would not have to travel far to take over from yallop if he were to be forced out of the galaxy hot-seat .
but , true to form , the german has refused to say anything , neither denying nor confirming any involvement and stoking the fires of speculation further by keeping his own counsel .
however , klinsmann worked as a consultant for the galaxy in 2004 before taking over the germany team and with his orange county home just 20 minutes away from the team 's base , it appears as though the connections and infrastructure are already in place for klinsi 's return to coaching .
but as recent history has taught us , we 've been here before .
former spurs striker to return as coach ?
now , depending on which newspapers you 've been reading , klinsmann could be forsaking the chance to coach beckham and co. in the californian sunshine for either the chairman ’ s or manager ’ s job at premiership side tottenham .
four games in and the crazy world of english soccer is already talking about its first potential coaching casualty .
three defeats in four have seen the pressure heaped on incumbent coach martin jol and it appears the man who has taken tottenham to consecutive fifth-place finishes after years of mid-table mediocrity now has only three more matches to save his job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi would get a better car if he returned to spurs as coach if he is sacked by the end of september , some papers have klinsmann battling it out with sevilla coach juande ramos for the vacancy , should it happen .
ramos has an enviable record in spain but klinsmann , a talismanic striker for spurs during two spells with the club in the 90 's , remains a firm favorite with the fans .
other papers , however , paint klinsmann as the knight in shining armor riding into the boardroom at spurs to save both jol and the club from the apparent insanity which has settled over the current board .
again , the strings pulling this potential deal into shape stretch back to california .
a consortium of businessmen are reportedly lining up a financial package which would buy spurs outright and hand klinsmann either the coach ’ s job or a director of soccer position in which he has ultimate control of the playing side -lrb- again , depending on who you read -rrb- .
klinsmann , as you would expect , has not commented on this speculation either .

a police spokesman said the assailants admitted their involvement in the attack , which put the sudanese in hospital for several days , but denied hitting him on the head with a bottle .
the incident occurred on the same evening as eight indians were attacked and chased through the streets of mügeln after a local festival in the town in germany 's former communist east .
in a series of attacks late friday evening , a man from ghana and an iraqi were assaulted and racially abused in two separate incidents while a mob went on the rampage in another town .
the 36-year-old iraqi was beaten with a baseball bat by a man who set his dog on him at a tram stop in the eastern city of magdeburg .
police said monday they were looking for a suspected right-wing extremist in connection with the assault .

police said one of those involved had links to the right-wing scene .
in another incident on friday evening , a mob of about 40 young men went on the rampage at a fair in the eastern town of bützow , smashing stalls and pelting police with bottles .
police said members of local right-wing groups were involved in the rampage , which also targeted a snack bar operated by a pakistani who has lived in the town since 2002 .
" i was afraid for my life , " mahmood saqib told reporters on monday .

efforts to ban npd hit constitutional wall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous attempts to ban the npd have failed the incidents rekindled calls for a ban on the extreme right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which is represented in the regional parliaments of two of the eastern states where the attacks occurred .
leading german politicians have expressed doubts whether a ban could be imposed after a similar attempt was quashed by the country 's top court in 2003 .
the deputy president of the european commission , franco frattini , called for the banning of the npd after the attack in mügeln .
he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper on sunday that neo-nazis represented " a threat " and " an ulcerous cancer for democratic countries like germany . "
german chancellor angela merkel condemned the attack in mügeln as " extremely grim and shameful " and a government spokesman said it was harmful to germany 's image abroad . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 27.08.2007 window by artist gerhard richter unveiled at cologne cathedral großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the painter and photographer 's first piece of work for a church a stained glass window by the famous german artist gerhard richter has been unveiled at cologne cathedral .
while the city 's mayor has hailed the work as an " enrichment , " the archbishop reportedly never wanted it . the new window is made up of 11,200 squares and has been installed on the sunny , south-facing side of the gothic cathedral .
more than 1,000 visitors came to witness the event .
eagerly craning their necks upwards to view the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184 square-foot -rrb- artwork , the majority seemed entranced by the kaleidoscope of colors .
" the cathedral has been enriched and so has the city , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said after the unveiling .
top opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the inauguration ceremony , the window was described as producing a " symphony of light " but not everyone is apparently happy with the new design .
the online edition of the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper reported that none less than the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , opposed it .
citing a close confidante of meisner 's , the stadt-anzeiger wrote that the archbishop even tried to stop the project , resulting in serious disputes within the committee responsible for deciding over the window .
" the cardinal did not want this window , " said the source . the archbishop , who is not opposed to modern art per se , reportedly wanted to have a figurative work , for example with representations of saints or 20th century martyrs , rather than an abstract one .
cathedral provost norbert feldhoff said the reason for meisner 's absence at the unveiling ceremony was " purely technical " and was linked to a clash with a previously planned trip to poland .
artist 's gift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter was there to see his work unveiled gerhard richter , who lives in cologne , gave his work on the window for free , while the production costs totaling 370,000 euros -lrb- $ 506,000 -rrb- were covered by private donations .
the 75-year-old artist , who has a reputation for being a man of few words , seemed to be happy with his work and said he was proud " it had n't gone wrong . "
richter said it had been a little bit " nerve-wracking " to create a work that , unlike a picture , could not simply be taken down again .
the original window was destroyed in world war ii and replaced in the 1950s by a nearly transparent piece of glass .
cologne cathedral , which is one of germany 's most famous landmarks , dates back to the 13th century and was added to the world heritage list by unesco in 1996 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a spokesman for the stuttgart-based bank told afp that the sale price would be fixed at the end of the year after lbbw had carried out a more detailed evaluation of the leipzig-based bank .
he said lbbw had also given the bank a 250 million euro -lrb- $ 342 million -rrb- cash injection as " an immediate measure . "
saxony state premier georg milbradt said current turbulence in the capital markets meant that it was impossible for the bank to continue without a partner .

" things could be back to normal on monday .
baden-württemberg is not leaping into a black hole with this purchase . "
he said the lowest price his government was prepared to accept for sachsenlb was 300 million euros .
the leipzig-based financial institution is the second german bank that has had to be bailed out after exposure to credit markets caught in the us sub-prime housing market crisis .

while the city 's mayor has hailed the work as an " enrichment , " the archbishop reportedly never wanted it . the new window is made up of 11,200 squares and has been installed on the sunny , south-facing side of the gothic cathedral .
more than 1,000 visitors came to witness the event .
eagerly craning their necks upwards to view the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184 square-foot -rrb- artwork , the majority seemed entranced by the kaleidoscope of colors .
" the cathedral has been enriched and so has the city , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said after the unveiling .
top opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the inauguration ceremony , the window was described as producing a " symphony of light " but not everyone is apparently happy with the new design .
the online edition of the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper reported that none less than the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , opposed it .
citing a close confidante of meisner 's , the stadt-anzeiger wrote that the archbishop even tried to stop the project , resulting in serious disputes within the committee responsible for deciding over the window .
" the cardinal did not want this window , " said the source . the archbishop , who is not opposed to modern art per se , reportedly wanted to have a figurative work , for example with representations of saints or 20th century martyrs , rather than an abstract one .
cathedral provost norbert feldhoff said the reason for meisner 's absence at the unveiling ceremony was " purely technical " and was linked to a clash with a previously planned trip to poland .
artist 's gift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter was there to see his work unveiled gerhard richter , who lives in cologne , gave his work on the window for free , while the production costs totaling 370,000 euros -lrb- $ 506,000 -rrb- were covered by private donations .
the 75-year-old artist , who has a reputation for being a man of few words , seemed to be happy with his work and said he was proud " it had n't gone wrong . "
richter said it had been a little bit " nerve-wracking " to create a work that , unlike a picture , could not simply be taken down again .
the original window was destroyed in world war ii and replaced in the 1950s by a nearly transparent piece of glass .
cologne cathedral , which is one of germany 's most famous landmarks , dates back to the 13th century and was added to the world heritage list by unesco in 1996 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if we succeed , then it will be a collective success and if we fail , it will be a collective failure , " gallois told the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday . the eads and its subsidiary airbus previously had an awkward management structure with two co-chairmen and two co-chief executives from france and germany .
the twin-headed management structure had been widely blamed for slow decision-making and inefficiency which lead to significant financial losses and product delays . the new deal , hammered out by german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy in july , gave each country a chance to have one top position in the concern . france 's louis gallois , took over on monday as the sole chief executive of the eads , while his former eads co-chief , germany 's tom enders , took the reins at airbus . gallois said he did not want to be the " french ceo of eads , but the ceo of eads .

gallois said that the current arrangement , whereby the company has two headquarters , one in paris and one in munich was not ideal .
" one day we will have to agree on a single office , " gallois said . " but the time is not ripe for that , " he said , adding that he could imagine a transition to single headquarters taking place " in a few years . " golden shares also on monday , rudiger grube , who has become the sole chairman of eads backed the idea of " golden shares " in the company , which would be held by chosen shareholders and which could outvote all other shares in certain specified circumstances , such as a hostile takeover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy found a solution to eads ' cumbersome dual management structure " taking into account eads ' contribution to the sovereignty and security of europe , it 's a legitimate question , " grube said in an interview with the french financial daily les echos . " many aerospace companies around the world have protection of this type . " he said a a working group set up by eads shareholders would hand in its conclusions before the next shareholder meeting . " we would like to make a proposal during the next agm , in may 2008 , at the latest , " grube said . earlier this month , a german government spokesperson confirmed that chancellor angela merkel 's administration was looking into ways to protect german interests in the european aerospace company and that it was calling for it to recieve a golden share . golden share have been used in the past by governments of eu member states to allow them to keep controlling voting rights in partially privatized companies , but are not viewed favorably by the european commission . eads is controlled by a group of french and german shareholders which are either public or politically-linked private investors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 27.08.2007 window by artist gerhard richter unveiled at cologne cathedral großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the painter and photographer 's first piece of work for a church a stained glass window by the famous german artist gerhard richter has been unveiled at cologne cathedral .
while the city 's mayor has hailed the work as an " enrichment , " the archbishop reportedly never wanted it . the new window is made up of 11,200 squares and has been installed on the sunny , south-facing side of the gothic cathedral .
more than 1,000 visitors came to witness the event .
eagerly craning their necks upwards to view the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184 square-foot -rrb- artwork , the majority seemed entranced by the kaleidoscope of colors .
" the cathedral has been enriched and so has the city , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said after the unveiling .
top opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the inauguration ceremony , the window was described as producing a " symphony of light " but not everyone is apparently happy with the new design .
the online edition of the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper reported that none less than the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , opposed it .
citing a close confidante of meisner 's , the stadt-anzeiger wrote that the archbishop even tried to stop the project , resulting in serious disputes within the committee responsible for deciding over the window .
" the cardinal did not want this window , " said the source . the archbishop , who is not opposed to modern art per se , reportedly wanted to have a figurative work , for example with representations of saints or 20th century martyrs , rather than an abstract one .
cathedral provost norbert feldhoff said the reason for meisner 's absence at the unveiling ceremony was " purely technical " and was linked to a clash with a previously planned trip to poland .
artist 's gift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter was there to see his work unveiled gerhard richter , who lives in cologne , gave his work on the window for free , while the production costs totaling 370,000 euros -lrb- $ 506,000 -rrb- were covered by private donations .
the 75-year-old artist , who has a reputation for being a man of few words , seemed to be happy with his work and said he was proud " it had n't gone wrong . "
richter said it had been a little bit " nerve-wracking " to create a work that , unlike a picture , could not simply be taken down again .
the original window was destroyed in world war ii and replaced in the 1950s by a nearly transparent piece of glass .
cologne cathedral , which is one of germany 's most famous landmarks , dates back to the 13th century and was added to the world heritage list by unesco in 1996 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 27.08.2007 window by artist gerhard richter unveiled at cologne cathedral großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the painter and photographer 's first piece of work for a church a stained glass window by the famous german artist gerhard richter has been unveiled at cologne cathedral .
while the city 's mayor has hailed the work as an " enrichment , " the archbishop reportedly never wanted it . the new window is made up of 11,200 squares and has been installed on the sunny , south-facing side of the gothic cathedral .
more than 1,000 visitors came to witness the event .
eagerly craning their necks upwards to view the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184 square-foot -rrb- artwork , the majority seemed entranced by the kaleidoscope of colors .
" the cathedral has been enriched and so has the city , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said after the unveiling .
top opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the inauguration ceremony , the window was described as producing a " symphony of light " but not everyone is apparently happy with the new design .
the online edition of the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper reported that none less than the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , opposed it .
citing a close confidante of meisner 's , the stadt-anzeiger wrote that the archbishop even tried to stop the project , resulting in serious disputes within the committee responsible for deciding over the window .
" the cardinal did not want this window , " said the source . the archbishop , who is not opposed to modern art per se , reportedly wanted to have a figurative work , for example with representations of saints or 20th century martyrs , rather than an abstract one .
cathedral provost norbert feldhoff said the reason for meisner 's absence at the unveiling ceremony was " purely technical " and was linked to a clash with a previously planned trip to poland .
artist 's gift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter was there to see his work unveiled gerhard richter , who lives in cologne , gave his work on the window for free , while the production costs totaling 370,000 euros -lrb- $ 506,000 -rrb- were covered by private donations .
the 75-year-old artist , who has a reputation for being a man of few words , seemed to be happy with his work and said he was proud " it had n't gone wrong . "
richter said it had been a little bit " nerve-wracking " to create a work that , unlike a picture , could not simply be taken down again .
the original window was destroyed in world war ii and replaced in the 1950s by a nearly transparent piece of glass .
cologne cathedral , which is one of germany 's most famous landmarks , dates back to the 13th century and was added to the world heritage list by unesco in 1996 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 27.08.2007 window by artist gerhard richter unveiled at cologne cathedral großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the painter and photographer 's first piece of work for a church a stained glass window by the famous german artist gerhard richter has been unveiled at cologne cathedral .
while the city 's mayor has hailed the work as an " enrichment , " the archbishop reportedly never wanted it . the new window is made up of 11,200 squares and has been installed on the sunny , south-facing side of the gothic cathedral .
more than 1,000 visitors came to witness the event .
eagerly craning their necks upwards to view the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184 square-foot -rrb- artwork , the majority seemed entranced by the kaleidoscope of colors .
" the cathedral has been enriched and so has the city , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said after the unveiling .
top opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the inauguration ceremony , the window was described as producing a " symphony of light " but not everyone is apparently happy with the new design .
the online edition of the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper reported that none less than the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , opposed it .
citing a close confidante of meisner 's , the stadt-anzeiger wrote that the archbishop even tried to stop the project , resulting in serious disputes within the committee responsible for deciding over the window .
" the cardinal did not want this window , " said the source . the archbishop , who is not opposed to modern art per se , reportedly wanted to have a figurative work , for example with representations of saints or 20th century martyrs , rather than an abstract one .
cathedral provost norbert feldhoff said the reason for meisner 's absence at the unveiling ceremony was " purely technical " and was linked to a clash with a previously planned trip to poland .
artist 's gift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter was there to see his work unveiled gerhard richter , who lives in cologne , gave his work on the window for free , while the production costs totaling 370,000 euros -lrb- $ 506,000 -rrb- were covered by private donations .
the 75-year-old artist , who has a reputation for being a man of few words , seemed to be happy with his work and said he was proud " it had n't gone wrong . "
richter said it had been a little bit " nerve-wracking " to create a work that , unlike a picture , could not simply be taken down again .
the original window was destroyed in world war ii and replaced in the 1950s by a nearly transparent piece of glass .
cologne cathedral , which is one of germany 's most famous landmarks , dates back to the 13th century and was added to the world heritage list by unesco in 1996 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as german politicians are reconsidering a ban of the ultra-right npd party after recent xenophobic attacks . fourteen percent of the women canvassed said they would not rule out giving their ballot to a party to the right of the conservative christian democratic union or its bavarian sister party , the csu , at the next state parliamentary elections .
nine percent of men , in comparison , said they would do the same in the emnid survey commissioned by the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
emnid head , klaus-peter schöppner , called the results " surprising . " " women do n't usually lean towards the rightwing spectrum so strongly , " he told the newspaper .
right shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dissatisfaction with family policy may be the reason for the poll results schöppner said conservative women voters with traditional family views were possibly disappointed by the conservatives ' modern family politics . " some have stopped voting , " he said .
" others have turned towards parties of the far-right . "
in addition to the discrepancy between men and women in their voting patterns , the survey also showed a split between eastern and western germany .
eleven percent of western germans canvassed by emnid said they would vote for far-right parties , in comparison to 15 percent in eastern germany .
germany has recently seen a spate of racist violence that has prompted renewed calls to ban the far-right npd party .
racist surge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gorvinda singh was one of the indians injured in the recent attack in mügeln in the latest incident this weekend , a 36-year-old iraqi was attacked with a baseball bat while waiting for a tram in the eastern german city of magdeburg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 27.08.2007 experts say new alert system needed in eu child searches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madeleine mccann 's parents have spread the word with their own media campaign the eu has a lot of experience in dealing with cross-border problems .
so it should come as no surprise that its efforts to solve child abduction cases should focus on cooperation and standardized search procedures . there have probably been as many column inches written about the efforts of kate and gerry mccann to find their missing daughter madeleine as the investigation into the alleged abduction itself .
the campaign by the missing four-year-old 's family and friends to keep maddy 's face in the media has drawn both praise and criticism since it swung into action in the days after her disappearance from the mccanns ' apartment at the praia da luz resort in portugal on may 3 .
whether one admires or criticizes the mccanns ' use of the media in the search for their daughter , one thing can not be ignored : the media strategy has resulted in an unprecedented level of coverage regarding a child 's abduction .
but should a family have to create its own rolling news channel to keep the world informed of the efforts to find a missing child ?
could the creation of the " find madeleine " campaign also be a reaction to inadequate international search procedures ?
incompatibilities obvious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerry and kate mccann gave the public vital information one of the most debated aspects of the mccann investigation has been the extensive criticism of the portuguese police .
critics of the policia judiciaria have highlighted the differences between portuguese methods and those employed in the search for a child in madeleine 's native britain and other eu countries .
in particular , the police have been accused of failing to distribute information for hours after maddy vanished , for delays in passing a description to border or marine police and for refusing offers of help from international experts for almost three months .
the portuguese have defended themselves by saying that under article 86 of the country 's penal code information must not be released , apart from in exceptional circumstances , while the criminal investigation is still taking place .
while similar types of secrecy laws regarding ongoing police investigations exist in most european countries , information covered by these laws tends to apply to evidence and situations that need to be kept under wraps in the search for a suspect .
few prevent the broadcast or distribution of information regarding a missing child .
eu-wide alert system ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police cooperation across the eu is improving slowly the mccann case has raised new calls for a europe-wide response procedure in the case of abducted children .
while the european commission is already trying to increase cooperation in cross-border investigations , there are currently no plans to standardize the response in the case of a missing child .
" we have been told that there are no plans at the moment for an eu-wide alert system , " said carolyn bouchard from independent child protection agency safehands .
" the level of police cooperation is slowly improving and most current systems work well on a national level , but we continue to push for an efficient network across the continent . "
delphine moralis , the acting secretary general for the european federation for missing and sexually exploited children , was more specific .
" based on the experience of its members -lrb- 21 non-governmental organizations in 14 eu countries -rrb- when dealing with missing children cases across the eu , missing children europe advocates the need to develop alert support systems for cases of child abductions or life threatening disappearances of children in countries where no system exists , " she said .
" we also recommend the development of co-ordination procedures and interconnection schemes between existing systems , such as the ones in belgium , france , germany , greece and the uk . "
the closest thing europe currently has to a standardized response is the amber alert , a procedure imported from the united states , although not all countries in the eu use it .
amber alerts a tried and tested response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public is a vaulable resource in any abduction case amber alerts are issued by police when four main criteria of a child abduction case are satisfied : when a child under 16 goes missing ; when the child is believed kidnapped , when a senior police officer fears that death or serious harm may come about , and when the case has sufficient descriptive details , such as photographs of the child or suspected abductor .
the alerts are then broadcast to the public via radio and television stations , immediately interrupting scheduled broadcasting to report the missing child .
the alerts are also shown on electronic motorway signs and sent to email accounts , mobile phones and wireless devices of registered search volunteers .
" a coordinated amber alert system in europe would be hugely beneficial because one of the most critical parts of an abduction investigation is informing the public , " said robert hoever , from the us national center for missing and exploited children -lrb- ncmec -rrb- .
" it would require each country to have a designated amber facilitator and for all the facilitators to meet and plan together a memorandum of understanding as to how they would work together . "
cross-border structures needed for success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations must cross borders seemlessly to succeed hoever believes that having a similar system and a coordinator in every eu member state would greatly improve cross-border child abduction investigations in the bloc .
" contact person ' a ' would be responsible for putting the alert out in his or her own country and if information suggested the child had crossed the border , then ' a ' calls ' b ' and the same system kicks in , " he said .
however , according to hoever , bringing in a standardized amber alert-type system in europe would only work if other investigative strategies were already in place .
" before you have a standardized alert system , you have to address the cross-border problems .
you ca n't try and solve differences in police procedure during a case ; you waste time and endanger the child further .
these strategies between countries should be in place first . "
delphine moralis agreed .
" any system developed at eu level will have to start by looking at what already exists at the national level , " she said . " many questions remain to be analyzed , both regarding the procedures and regarding technical implementation of a system . "
a painful lesson so did the inadequacy of existing structures hinder the search for madeleine mccann in the first hours of her disappearance ?
" in portugal , missing children europe has an ngo member called instituto de apoio à criança i.a.c. , lisbon , which launched a hotline for missing children on may 25 , 2004 , " moralis said . " however , due to a lack of financial means and political support , no fully developed ' child alert ' or ' amber alert system ' has been launched in portugal yet . "
she said a good communication and coordination among existing systems as well as child search programs in countries which do n't currently have them could well have made a difference in the case of madeleine mccann . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so it should come as no surprise that its efforts to solve child abduction cases should focus on cooperation and standardized search procedures . there have probably been as many column inches written about the efforts of kate and gerry mccann to find their missing daughter madeleine as the investigation into the alleged abduction itself .
the campaign by the missing four-year-old 's family and friends to keep maddy 's face in the media has drawn both praise and criticism since it swung into action in the days after her disappearance from the mccanns ' apartment at the praia da luz resort in portugal on may 3 .
whether one admires or criticizes the mccanns ' use of the media in the search for their daughter , one thing can not be ignored : the media strategy has resulted in an unprecedented level of coverage regarding a child 's abduction .
but should a family have to create its own rolling news channel to keep the world informed of the efforts to find a missing child ?
could the creation of the " find madeleine " campaign also be a reaction to inadequate international search procedures ?
incompatibilities obvious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerry and kate mccann gave the public vital information one of the most debated aspects of the mccann investigation has been the extensive criticism of the portuguese police .
critics of the policia judiciaria have highlighted the differences between portuguese methods and those employed in the search for a child in madeleine 's native britain and other eu countries .
in particular , the police have been accused of failing to distribute information for hours after maddy vanished , for delays in passing a description to border or marine police and for refusing offers of help from international experts for almost three months .
the portuguese have defended themselves by saying that under article 86 of the country 's penal code information must not be released , apart from in exceptional circumstances , while the criminal investigation is still taking place .
while similar types of secrecy laws regarding ongoing police investigations exist in most european countries , information covered by these laws tends to apply to evidence and situations that need to be kept under wraps in the search for a suspect .
few prevent the broadcast or distribution of information regarding a missing child .
eu-wide alert system ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police cooperation across the eu is improving slowly the mccann case has raised new calls for a europe-wide response procedure in the case of abducted children .
while the european commission is already trying to increase cooperation in cross-border investigations , there are currently no plans to standardize the response in the case of a missing child .
" we have been told that there are no plans at the moment for an eu-wide alert system , " said carolyn bouchard from independent child protection agency safehands .
" the level of police cooperation is slowly improving and most current systems work well on a national level , but we continue to push for an efficient network across the continent . "
delphine moralis , the acting secretary general for the european federation for missing and sexually exploited children , was more specific .
" based on the experience of its members -lrb- 21 non-governmental organizations in 14 eu countries -rrb- when dealing with missing children cases across the eu , missing children europe advocates the need to develop alert support systems for cases of child abductions or life threatening disappearances of children in countries where no system exists , " she said .
" we also recommend the development of co-ordination procedures and interconnection schemes between existing systems , such as the ones in belgium , france , germany , greece and the uk . "
the closest thing europe currently has to a standardized response is the amber alert , a procedure imported from the united states , although not all countries in the eu use it .
amber alerts a tried and tested response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public is a vaulable resource in any abduction case amber alerts are issued by police when four main criteria of a child abduction case are satisfied : when a child under 16 goes missing ; when the child is believed kidnapped , when a senior police officer fears that death or serious harm may come about , and when the case has sufficient descriptive details , such as photographs of the child or suspected abductor .
the alerts are then broadcast to the public via radio and television stations , immediately interrupting scheduled broadcasting to report the missing child .
the alerts are also shown on electronic motorway signs and sent to email accounts , mobile phones and wireless devices of registered search volunteers .
" a coordinated amber alert system in europe would be hugely beneficial because one of the most critical parts of an abduction investigation is informing the public , " said robert hoever , from the us national center for missing and exploited children -lrb- ncmec -rrb- .
" it would require each country to have a designated amber facilitator and for all the facilitators to meet and plan together a memorandum of understanding as to how they would work together . "
cross-border structures needed for success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations must cross borders seemlessly to succeed hoever believes that having a similar system and a coordinator in every eu member state would greatly improve cross-border child abduction investigations in the bloc .
" contact person ' a ' would be responsible for putting the alert out in his or her own country and if information suggested the child had crossed the border , then ' a ' calls ' b ' and the same system kicks in , " he said .
however , according to hoever , bringing in a standardized amber alert-type system in europe would only work if other investigative strategies were already in place .
" before you have a standardized alert system , you have to address the cross-border problems .
you ca n't try and solve differences in police procedure during a case ; you waste time and endanger the child further .
these strategies between countries should be in place first . "
delphine moralis agreed .
" any system developed at eu level will have to start by looking at what already exists at the national level , " she said . " many questions remain to be analyzed , both regarding the procedures and regarding technical implementation of a system . "
a painful lesson so did the inadequacy of existing structures hinder the search for madeleine mccann in the first hours of her disappearance ?
" in portugal , missing children europe has an ngo member called instituto de apoio à criança i.a.c. , lisbon , which launched a hotline for missing children on may 25 , 2004 , " moralis said . " however , due to a lack of financial means and political support , no fully developed ' child alert ' or ' amber alert system ' has been launched in portugal yet . "

until he took over the german national team , it was most likely to be on a beach in california .
these days , klinsi could be anywhere if you listen to soccer rumors . what a year it has been for jürgen klinsmann .
if one believes everything written about the former germany coach over the past 12 months it appears that klinsi has spent his sabbatical jet-setting around the globe , having high-profile interviews for every vacant managerial position in soccer - and turning every single one of the down .
after relinquishing the reins of the national squad after the 2006 world cup , klinsmann has been linked to coaching jobs with the national teams of the united states , australia and mexico and was touted as a successor to jose moriniho as manager of english premiership side chelsea before the current season began .
now it seems that klinsmann is either going to try his hand at owning a soccer club or add his enthusiastic momentum to the slow revolution of the game in his adopted homeland of the united states .
the latest klinsi rumors surfaced last week as his former international charges beat england in a friendly match in london and tottenham hotspur , his former league club in the english capital , was going through a highly premature coaching crisis .
just two days after a makeshift germany side triumphed 2-1 at wembley , klinsmann 's name was cropping up in relation to one of those who faced his compatriots on wednesday night .

while most of the stateside stories asked whether becks could handle playing for the galaxy and helping england qualify for the 2008 european championships at the same time , others were inserting paragraphs about how galaxy coach frank yallop could n't handle managing the former real madrid and man united mega-star .
with the galaxy languishing second from bottom in the conference and way off the pace for the play-off places , yallop 's days look to be numbered .
and so , with a very high-profile manager 's seat on the verge of becoming vacant , klinsmann 's name was once again churned out by the rumor mill .
oc resident with great cv klinsmann , already a resident of the sunshine state , would not have to travel far to take over from yallop if he were to be forced out of the galaxy hot-seat .
but , true to form , the german has refused to say anything , neither denying nor confirming any involvement and stoking the fires of speculation further by keeping his own counsel .
however , klinsmann worked as a consultant for the galaxy in 2004 before taking over the germany team and with his orange county home just 20 minutes away from the team 's base , it appears as though the connections and infrastructure are already in place for klinsi 's return to coaching .

former spurs striker to return as coach ?
now , depending on which newspapers you 've been reading , klinsmann could be forsaking the chance to coach beckham and co. in the californian sunshine for either the chairman ’ s or manager ’ s job at premiership side tottenham .
four games in and the crazy world of english soccer is already talking about its first potential coaching casualty .
three defeats in four have seen the pressure heaped on incumbent coach martin jol and it appears the man who has taken tottenham to consecutive fifth-place finishes after years of mid-table mediocrity now has only three more matches to save his job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi would get a better car if he returned to spurs as coach if he is sacked by the end of september , some papers have klinsmann battling it out with sevilla coach juande ramos for the vacancy , should it happen .

other papers , however , paint klinsmann as the knight in shining armor riding into the boardroom at spurs to save both jol and the club from the apparent insanity which has settled over the current board .

until he took over the german national team , it was most likely to be on a beach in california .
these days , klinsi could be anywhere if you listen to soccer rumors . what a year it has been for jürgen klinsmann .
if one believes everything written about the former germany coach over the past 12 months it appears that klinsi has spent his sabbatical jet-setting around the globe , having high-profile interviews for every vacant managerial position in soccer - and turning every single one of the down .
after relinquishing the reins of the national squad after the 2006 world cup , klinsmann has been linked to coaching jobs with the national teams of the united states , australia and mexico and was touted as a successor to jose moriniho as manager of english premiership side chelsea before the current season began .
now it seems that klinsmann is either going to try his hand at owning a soccer club or add his enthusiastic momentum to the slow revolution of the game in his adopted homeland of the united states .
the latest klinsi rumors surfaced last week as his former international charges beat england in a friendly match in london and tottenham hotspur , his former league club in the english capital , was going through a highly premature coaching crisis .
just two days after a makeshift germany side triumphed 2-1 at wembley , klinsmann 's name was cropping up in relation to one of those who faced his compatriots on wednesday night .
klinsi allegedly in line for galaxy hot-seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham 's arrival has stressed his coach out david beckham , formerly a serious soccer player and now main attraction at la galaxy 's traveling circus , had just arrived back in the us after a grueling transatlantic round trip and could barely muster a limp in his side 's loss to local rivals chivas in the major soccer league western conference clash .
while most of the stateside stories asked whether becks could handle playing for the galaxy and helping england qualify for the 2008 european championships at the same time , others were inserting paragraphs about how galaxy coach frank yallop could n't handle managing the former real madrid and man united mega-star .
with the galaxy languishing second from bottom in the conference and way off the pace for the play-off places , yallop 's days look to be numbered .
and so , with a very high-profile manager 's seat on the verge of becoming vacant , klinsmann 's name was once again churned out by the rumor mill .
oc resident with great cv klinsmann , already a resident of the sunshine state , would not have to travel far to take over from yallop if he were to be forced out of the galaxy hot-seat .
but , true to form , the german has refused to say anything , neither denying nor confirming any involvement and stoking the fires of speculation further by keeping his own counsel .
however , klinsmann worked as a consultant for the galaxy in 2004 before taking over the germany team and with his orange county home just 20 minutes away from the team 's base , it appears as though the connections and infrastructure are already in place for klinsi 's return to coaching .

former spurs striker to return as coach ?
now , depending on which newspapers you 've been reading , klinsmann could be forsaking the chance to coach beckham and co. in the californian sunshine for either the chairman ’ s or manager ’ s job at premiership side tottenham .
four games in and the crazy world of english soccer is already talking about its first potential coaching casualty .
three defeats in four have seen the pressure heaped on incumbent coach martin jol and it appears the man who has taken tottenham to consecutive fifth-place finishes after years of mid-table mediocrity now has only three more matches to save his job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi would get a better car if he returned to spurs as coach if he is sacked by the end of september , some papers have klinsmann battling it out with sevilla coach juande ramos for the vacancy , should it happen .
ramos has an enviable record in spain but klinsmann , a talismanic striker for spurs during two spells with the club in the 90 's , remains a firm favorite with the fans .
other papers , however , paint klinsmann as the knight in shining armor riding into the boardroom at spurs to save both jol and the club from the apparent insanity which has settled over the current board .

" if we succeed , then it will be a collective success and if we fail , it will be a collective failure , " gallois told the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday . the eads and its subsidiary airbus previously had an awkward management structure with two co-chairmen and two co-chief executives from france and germany .
the twin-headed management structure had been widely blamed for slow decision-making and inefficiency which lead to significant financial losses and product delays . the new deal , hammered out by german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy in july , gave each country a chance to have one top position in the concern . france 's louis gallois , took over on monday as the sole chief executive of the eads , while his former eads co-chief , germany 's tom enders , took the reins at airbus . gallois said he did not want to be the " french ceo of eads , but the ceo of eads . " old challenges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former eads co-chiefs thomas enders , left , and louis gallois now have separate jobs it is yet to be seen , whether the new management structure will bring the much-needed improvements to the company .
a french trade unionist complained publicly last week about the new board of the group , which is now made up of six germans , two french managers , one spaniard and an english director .
gallois said that the current arrangement , whereby the company has two headquarters , one in paris and one in munich was not ideal .
" one day we will have to agree on a single office , " gallois said . " but the time is not ripe for that , " he said , adding that he could imagine a transition to single headquarters taking place " in a few years . " golden shares also on monday , rudiger grube , who has become the sole chairman of eads backed the idea of " golden shares " in the company , which would be held by chosen shareholders and which could outvote all other shares in certain specified circumstances , such as a hostile takeover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy found a solution to eads ' cumbersome dual management structure " taking into account eads ' contribution to the sovereignty and security of europe , it 's a legitimate question , " grube said in an interview with the french financial daily les echos . " many aerospace companies around the world have protection of this type . " he said a a working group set up by eads shareholders would hand in its conclusions before the next shareholder meeting . " we would like to make a proposal during the next agm , in may 2008 , at the latest , " grube said . earlier this month , a german government spokesperson confirmed that chancellor angela merkel 's administration was looking into ways to protect german interests in the european aerospace company and that it was calling for it to recieve a golden share . golden share have been used in the past by governments of eu member states to allow them to keep controlling voting rights in partially privatized companies , but are not viewed favorably by the european commission . eads is controlled by a group of french and german shareholders which are either public or politically-linked private investors .

merkel 's hosts said they would investigate . merkel said that china needed " to respect the rules of the game , " after talks in beijing touched upon controversial issues such as piracy and unsafe chinese exports . " in our talks , i made clear that every country has the right to development , " merkel told journalists in a joint press conference after the one-hour meeting with the chinese premier wen jiabao .
" but at present there are a great many large countries such as china that are developing fast and there is a need to respect the rules of the game . " the label " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months , especially in the aftermath of a recent recall of 18 million chinese-made products by us toy giant mattel because of safety concerns . an opportunity , not a threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen : " there is no such thing as the ' china threat theory . " '
critics of china have also voiced concerns in recent years that the country 's economic rise could potentially be seen as a threat to the rest of the world , especially in view of china 's deplorable human rights record . " china 's development is an opportunity , not a threat , " wen said .
" we have decades of work ahead before we can be even a moderately well-developed country . " the chinese premier stressed that his country was still struggling with issues such as poverty and population growth , but added that chinese intentions were not sinister . " china will always take the peaceful road , " he said .
" china is very happy to cooperate with all nations but will never threaten ... so it 's clear , everyone please be at ease , there is no such thing as the ' china threat theory . " ' hi-tech espionage ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were german government computers compromised by hackers from china ?
merkel 's talks with the chinese premier came only two days after the german news magazine der spiegel reported that chinese hackers had broken into the government computer network in berlin . according to the magazine , spy programs - which investigations showed could be tracked to the chinese people 's liberation army - were uncovered at merkel 's office , the foreign ministry and other government institutions . " we in the government took -lrb- the reports -rrb- as a matter of grave concern , " wen said . " hackers breaking into and sabotaging computers is a problem faced by the entire world . " the chinese premier emphasized that fighting hacking must be a joint effort and that china will cooperate with germany on this issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 27.08.2007 experts say new alert system needed in eu child searches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madeleine mccann 's parents have spread the word with their own media campaign the eu has a lot of experience in dealing with cross-border problems .
so it should come as no surprise that its efforts to solve child abduction cases should focus on cooperation and standardized search procedures . there have probably been as many column inches written about the efforts of kate and gerry mccann to find their missing daughter madeleine as the investigation into the alleged abduction itself .
the campaign by the missing four-year-old 's family and friends to keep maddy 's face in the media has drawn both praise and criticism since it swung into action in the days after her disappearance from the mccanns ' apartment at the praia da luz resort in portugal on may 3 .
whether one admires or criticizes the mccanns ' use of the media in the search for their daughter , one thing can not be ignored : the media strategy has resulted in an unprecedented level of coverage regarding a child 's abduction .
but should a family have to create its own rolling news channel to keep the world informed of the efforts to find a missing child ?
could the creation of the " find madeleine " campaign also be a reaction to inadequate international search procedures ?
incompatibilities obvious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerry and kate mccann gave the public vital information one of the most debated aspects of the mccann investigation has been the extensive criticism of the portuguese police .
critics of the policia judiciaria have highlighted the differences between portuguese methods and those employed in the search for a child in madeleine 's native britain and other eu countries .
in particular , the police have been accused of failing to distribute information for hours after maddy vanished , for delays in passing a description to border or marine police and for refusing offers of help from international experts for almost three months .
the portuguese have defended themselves by saying that under article 86 of the country 's penal code information must not be released , apart from in exceptional circumstances , while the criminal investigation is still taking place .
while similar types of secrecy laws regarding ongoing police investigations exist in most european countries , information covered by these laws tends to apply to evidence and situations that need to be kept under wraps in the search for a suspect .
few prevent the broadcast or distribution of information regarding a missing child .
eu-wide alert system ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police cooperation across the eu is improving slowly the mccann case has raised new calls for a europe-wide response procedure in the case of abducted children .
while the european commission is already trying to increase cooperation in cross-border investigations , there are currently no plans to standardize the response in the case of a missing child .
" we have been told that there are no plans at the moment for an eu-wide alert system , " said carolyn bouchard from independent child protection agency safehands .
" the level of police cooperation is slowly improving and most current systems work well on a national level , but we continue to push for an efficient network across the continent . "
delphine moralis , the acting secretary general for the european federation for missing and sexually exploited children , was more specific .
" based on the experience of its members -lrb- 21 non-governmental organizations in 14 eu countries -rrb- when dealing with missing children cases across the eu , missing children europe advocates the need to develop alert support systems for cases of child abductions or life threatening disappearances of children in countries where no system exists , " she said .
" we also recommend the development of co-ordination procedures and interconnection schemes between existing systems , such as the ones in belgium , france , germany , greece and the uk . "
the closest thing europe currently has to a standardized response is the amber alert , a procedure imported from the united states , although not all countries in the eu use it .
amber alerts a tried and tested response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public is a vaulable resource in any abduction case amber alerts are issued by police when four main criteria of a child abduction case are satisfied : when a child under 16 goes missing ; when the child is believed kidnapped , when a senior police officer fears that death or serious harm may come about , and when the case has sufficient descriptive details , such as photographs of the child or suspected abductor .
the alerts are then broadcast to the public via radio and television stations , immediately interrupting scheduled broadcasting to report the missing child .
the alerts are also shown on electronic motorway signs and sent to email accounts , mobile phones and wireless devices of registered search volunteers .
" a coordinated amber alert system in europe would be hugely beneficial because one of the most critical parts of an abduction investigation is informing the public , " said robert hoever , from the us national center for missing and exploited children -lrb- ncmec -rrb- .
" it would require each country to have a designated amber facilitator and for all the facilitators to meet and plan together a memorandum of understanding as to how they would work together . "
cross-border structures needed for success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations must cross borders seemlessly to succeed hoever believes that having a similar system and a coordinator in every eu member state would greatly improve cross-border child abduction investigations in the bloc .
" contact person ' a ' would be responsible for putting the alert out in his or her own country and if information suggested the child had crossed the border , then ' a ' calls ' b ' and the same system kicks in , " he said .
however , according to hoever , bringing in a standardized amber alert-type system in europe would only work if other investigative strategies were already in place .
" before you have a standardized alert system , you have to address the cross-border problems .
you ca n't try and solve differences in police procedure during a case ; you waste time and endanger the child further .
these strategies between countries should be in place first . "
delphine moralis agreed .
" any system developed at eu level will have to start by looking at what already exists at the national level , " she said . " many questions remain to be analyzed , both regarding the procedures and regarding technical implementation of a system . "
a painful lesson so did the inadequacy of existing structures hinder the search for madeleine mccann in the first hours of her disappearance ?
" in portugal , missing children europe has an ngo member called instituto de apoio à criança i.a.c. , lisbon , which launched a hotline for missing children on may 25 , 2004 , " moralis said . " however , due to a lack of financial means and political support , no fully developed ' child alert ' or ' amber alert system ' has been launched in portugal yet . "
she said a good communication and coordination among existing systems as well as child search programs in countries which do n't currently have them could well have made a difference in the case of madeleine mccann . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 27.08.2007 experts say new alert system needed in eu child searches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madeleine mccann 's parents have spread the word with their own media campaign the eu has a lot of experience in dealing with cross-border problems .
so it should come as no surprise that its efforts to solve child abduction cases should focus on cooperation and standardized search procedures . there have probably been as many column inches written about the efforts of kate and gerry mccann to find their missing daughter madeleine as the investigation into the alleged abduction itself .
the campaign by the missing four-year-old 's family and friends to keep maddy 's face in the media has drawn both praise and criticism since it swung into action in the days after her disappearance from the mccanns ' apartment at the praia da luz resort in portugal on may 3 .
whether one admires or criticizes the mccanns ' use of the media in the search for their daughter , one thing can not be ignored : the media strategy has resulted in an unprecedented level of coverage regarding a child 's abduction .
but should a family have to create its own rolling news channel to keep the world informed of the efforts to find a missing child ?
could the creation of the " find madeleine " campaign also be a reaction to inadequate international search procedures ?
incompatibilities obvious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerry and kate mccann gave the public vital information one of the most debated aspects of the mccann investigation has been the extensive criticism of the portuguese police .
critics of the policia judiciaria have highlighted the differences between portuguese methods and those employed in the search for a child in madeleine 's native britain and other eu countries .
in particular , the police have been accused of failing to distribute information for hours after maddy vanished , for delays in passing a description to border or marine police and for refusing offers of help from international experts for almost three months .
the portuguese have defended themselves by saying that under article 86 of the country 's penal code information must not be released , apart from in exceptional circumstances , while the criminal investigation is still taking place .
while similar types of secrecy laws regarding ongoing police investigations exist in most european countries , information covered by these laws tends to apply to evidence and situations that need to be kept under wraps in the search for a suspect .
few prevent the broadcast or distribution of information regarding a missing child .
eu-wide alert system ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police cooperation across the eu is improving slowly the mccann case has raised new calls for a europe-wide response procedure in the case of abducted children .
while the european commission is already trying to increase cooperation in cross-border investigations , there are currently no plans to standardize the response in the case of a missing child .
" we have been told that there are no plans at the moment for an eu-wide alert system , " said carolyn bouchard from independent child protection agency safehands .
" the level of police cooperation is slowly improving and most current systems work well on a national level , but we continue to push for an efficient network across the continent . "
delphine moralis , the acting secretary general for the european federation for missing and sexually exploited children , was more specific .
" based on the experience of its members -lrb- 21 non-governmental organizations in 14 eu countries -rrb- when dealing with missing children cases across the eu , missing children europe advocates the need to develop alert support systems for cases of child abductions or life threatening disappearances of children in countries where no system exists , " she said .
" we also recommend the development of co-ordination procedures and interconnection schemes between existing systems , such as the ones in belgium , france , germany , greece and the uk . "
the closest thing europe currently has to a standardized response is the amber alert , a procedure imported from the united states , although not all countries in the eu use it .
amber alerts a tried and tested response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public is a vaulable resource in any abduction case amber alerts are issued by police when four main criteria of a child abduction case are satisfied : when a child under 16 goes missing ; when the child is believed kidnapped , when a senior police officer fears that death or serious harm may come about , and when the case has sufficient descriptive details , such as photographs of the child or suspected abductor .
the alerts are then broadcast to the public via radio and television stations , immediately interrupting scheduled broadcasting to report the missing child .
the alerts are also shown on electronic motorway signs and sent to email accounts , mobile phones and wireless devices of registered search volunteers .
" a coordinated amber alert system in europe would be hugely beneficial because one of the most critical parts of an abduction investigation is informing the public , " said robert hoever , from the us national center for missing and exploited children -lrb- ncmec -rrb- .
" it would require each country to have a designated amber facilitator and for all the facilitators to meet and plan together a memorandum of understanding as to how they would work together . "
cross-border structures needed for success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations must cross borders seemlessly to succeed hoever believes that having a similar system and a coordinator in every eu member state would greatly improve cross-border child abduction investigations in the bloc .
" contact person ' a ' would be responsible for putting the alert out in his or her own country and if information suggested the child had crossed the border , then ' a ' calls ' b ' and the same system kicks in , " he said .
however , according to hoever , bringing in a standardized amber alert-type system in europe would only work if other investigative strategies were already in place .
" before you have a standardized alert system , you have to address the cross-border problems .
you ca n't try and solve differences in police procedure during a case ; you waste time and endanger the child further .
these strategies between countries should be in place first . "
delphine moralis agreed .
" any system developed at eu level will have to start by looking at what already exists at the national level , " she said . " many questions remain to be analyzed , both regarding the procedures and regarding technical implementation of a system . "
a painful lesson so did the inadequacy of existing structures hinder the search for madeleine mccann in the first hours of her disappearance ?
" in portugal , missing children europe has an ngo member called instituto de apoio à criança i.a.c. , lisbon , which launched a hotline for missing children on may 25 , 2004 , " moralis said . " however , due to a lack of financial means and political support , no fully developed ' child alert ' or ' amber alert system ' has been launched in portugal yet . "
she said a good communication and coordination among existing systems as well as child search programs in countries which do n't currently have them could well have made a difference in the case of madeleine mccann . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as german politicians are reconsidering a ban of the ultra-right npd party after recent xenophobic attacks . fourteen percent of the women canvassed said they would not rule out giving their ballot to a party to the right of the conservative christian democratic union or its bavarian sister party , the csu , at the next state parliamentary elections .
nine percent of men , in comparison , said they would do the same in the emnid survey commissioned by the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
emnid head , klaus-peter schöppner , called the results " surprising . " " women do n't usually lean towards the rightwing spectrum so strongly , " he told the newspaper .
right shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dissatisfaction with family policy may be the reason for the poll results schöppner said conservative women voters with traditional family views were possibly disappointed by the conservatives ' modern family politics . " some have stopped voting , " he said .
" others have turned towards parties of the far-right . "
in addition to the discrepancy between men and women in their voting patterns , the survey also showed a split between eastern and western germany .
eleven percent of western germans canvassed by emnid said they would vote for far-right parties , in comparison to 15 percent in eastern germany .
germany has recently seen a spate of racist violence that has prompted renewed calls to ban the far-right npd party .
racist surge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gorvinda singh was one of the indians injured in the recent attack in mügeln in the latest incident this weekend , a 36-year-old iraqi was attacked with a baseball bat while waiting for a tram in the eastern german city of magdeburg .
the perpetrator , who has not yet been traced , also set his dog on the man and showered him with racist abuse .
this comes after two attacks just over a week ago .
eight indians were set upon by a mob after a festival on aug .
18 and chased through the streets of mügeln , a small town in the eastern german state of saxony .
no onlookers intervened to help the men and a contingent of 70 police officers were required to get the situation under control .

merkel 's hosts said they would investigate . merkel said that china needed " to respect the rules of the game , " after talks in beijing touched upon controversial issues such as piracy and unsafe chinese exports . " in our talks , i made clear that every country has the right to development , " merkel told journalists in a joint press conference after the one-hour meeting with the chinese premier wen jiabao .
" but at present there are a great many large countries such as china that are developing fast and there is a need to respect the rules of the game . " the label " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months , especially in the aftermath of a recent recall of 18 million chinese-made products by us toy giant mattel because of safety concerns . an opportunity , not a threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen : " there is no such thing as the ' china threat theory . " '
critics of china have also voiced concerns in recent years that the country 's economic rise could potentially be seen as a threat to the rest of the world , especially in view of china 's deplorable human rights record . " china 's development is an opportunity , not a threat , " wen said .
" we have decades of work ahead before we can be even a moderately well-developed country . " the chinese premier stressed that his country was still struggling with issues such as poverty and population growth , but added that chinese intentions were not sinister . " china will always take the peaceful road , " he said .

" ' hi-tech espionage ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were german government computers compromised by hackers from china ?
merkel 's talks with the chinese premier came only two days after the german news magazine der spiegel reported that chinese hackers had broken into the government computer network in berlin . according to the magazine , spy programs - which investigations showed could be tracked to the chinese people 's liberation army - were uncovered at merkel 's office , the foreign ministry and other government institutions . " we in the government took -lrb- the reports -rrb- as a matter of grave concern , " wen said . " hackers breaking into and sabotaging computers is a problem faced by the entire world . " the chinese premier emphasized that fighting hacking must be a joint effort and that china will cooperate with germany on this issue . " we are willing to maintain cooperation with the german government and take firm and effective action to prevent all hacking acts that threaten computer systems , " he said . climate goals wen promised china would undertake greater efforts to prevent global warming in its next environmental five-year plan starting in 2011 , but stressed that china 's responsibilities regarding carbon-dioxide emissions were not the same as those of long-time industrialized nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and china are important trade partners even if they do n't see eye-to-eye on human rights " it will be extremely difficult to reach these targets , but we have already shown our determination , " wen said .
" we have a much tougher task than germany does . " china has long maintained that wealthy nations - those that have already benefited from emissions-producing industrial booms - are the ones who should take the lead in cutting greenhouse-gas emissions . " china has taken part of the responsibility for climate change for only 30 years while industrial countries have grown fast for the last 200 years , " he said . merkel , who made climate change a key focus of germany 's presidency over the g8 group of leading industrialized nations , emphasized that all countries needed to work on energy efficiency . " developed countries should help by providing the latest technology , " she said . china has set goals to reduce its energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2011 , but its consumption fell by only 1.23 percent last year .
it also failed to meet its targeted 2-percent reduction in emissions of major water and air pollutants last year , recording instead toxic levels rising by almost 2 percent . merkel also met with chinese president hu jintao later on monday .

merkel 's hosts said they would investigate . merkel said that china needed " to respect the rules of the game , " after talks in beijing touched upon controversial issues such as piracy and unsafe chinese exports . " in our talks , i made clear that every country has the right to development , " merkel told journalists in a joint press conference after the one-hour meeting with the chinese premier wen jiabao .
" but at present there are a great many large countries such as china that are developing fast and there is a need to respect the rules of the game . " the label " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months , especially in the aftermath of a recent recall of 18 million chinese-made products by us toy giant mattel because of safety concerns . an opportunity , not a threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen : " there is no such thing as the ' china threat theory . " '
critics of china have also voiced concerns in recent years that the country 's economic rise could potentially be seen as a threat to the rest of the world , especially in view of china 's deplorable human rights record . " china 's development is an opportunity , not a threat , " wen said .
" we have decades of work ahead before we can be even a moderately well-developed country . " the chinese premier stressed that his country was still struggling with issues such as poverty and population growth , but added that chinese intentions were not sinister . " china will always take the peaceful road , " he said .
" china is very happy to cooperate with all nations but will never threaten ... so it 's clear , everyone please be at ease , there is no such thing as the ' china threat theory . " ' hi-tech espionage ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were german government computers compromised by hackers from china ?
merkel 's talks with the chinese premier came only two days after the german news magazine der spiegel reported that chinese hackers had broken into the government computer network in berlin . according to the magazine , spy programs - which investigations showed could be tracked to the chinese people 's liberation army - were uncovered at merkel 's office , the foreign ministry and other government institutions . " we in the government took -lrb- the reports -rrb- as a matter of grave concern , " wen said . " hackers breaking into and sabotaging computers is a problem faced by the entire world . " the chinese premier emphasized that fighting hacking must be a joint effort and that china will cooperate with germany on this issue . " we are willing to maintain cooperation with the german government and take firm and effective action to prevent all hacking acts that threaten computer systems , " he said . climate goals wen promised china would undertake greater efforts to prevent global warming in its next environmental five-year plan starting in 2011 , but stressed that china 's responsibilities regarding carbon-dioxide emissions were not the same as those of long-time industrialized nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and china are important trade partners even if they do n't see eye-to-eye on human rights " it will be extremely difficult to reach these targets , but we have already shown our determination , " wen said .
" we have a much tougher task than germany does . " china has long maintained that wealthy nations - those that have already benefited from emissions-producing industrial booms - are the ones who should take the lead in cutting greenhouse-gas emissions . " china has taken part of the responsibility for climate change for only 30 years while industrial countries have grown fast for the last 200 years , " he said . merkel , who made climate change a key focus of germany 's presidency over the g8 group of leading industrialized nations , emphasized that all countries needed to work on energy efficiency . " developed countries should help by providing the latest technology , " she said . china has set goals to reduce its energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2011 , but its consumption fell by only 1.23 percent last year .
it also failed to meet its targeted 2-percent reduction in emissions of major water and air pollutants last year , recording instead toxic levels rising by almost 2 percent . merkel also met with chinese president hu jintao later on monday .
she will head for japan on wednesday , where she will also address climate change and economic issues . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in addition to the discrepancy between men and women in their voting patterns , the survey also showed a split between eastern and western germany .

" if we succeed , then it will be a collective success and if we fail , it will be a collective failure , " gallois told the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday . the eads and its subsidiary airbus previously had an awkward management structure with two co-chairmen and two co-chief executives from france and germany .
the twin-headed management structure had been widely blamed for slow decision-making and inefficiency which lead to significant financial losses and product delays . the new deal , hammered out by german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy in july , gave each country a chance to have one top position in the concern . france 's louis gallois , took over on monday as the sole chief executive of the eads , while his former eads co-chief , germany 's tom enders , took the reins at airbus . gallois said he did not want to be the " french ceo of eads , but the ceo of eads . " old challenges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former eads co-chiefs thomas enders , left , and louis gallois now have separate jobs it is yet to be seen , whether the new management structure will bring the much-needed improvements to the company .
a french trade unionist complained publicly last week about the new board of the group , which is now made up of six germans , two french managers , one spaniard and an english director .
gallois said that the current arrangement , whereby the company has two headquarters , one in paris and one in munich was not ideal .
" one day we will have to agree on a single office , " gallois said . " but the time is not ripe for that , " he said , adding that he could imagine a transition to single headquarters taking place " in a few years . " golden shares also on monday , rudiger grube , who has become the sole chairman of eads backed the idea of " golden shares " in the company , which would be held by chosen shareholders and which could outvote all other shares in certain specified circumstances , such as a hostile takeover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy found a solution to eads ' cumbersome dual management structure " taking into account eads ' contribution to the sovereignty and security of europe , it 's a legitimate question , " grube said in an interview with the french financial daily les echos . " many aerospace companies around the world have protection of this type . " he said a a working group set up by eads shareholders would hand in its conclusions before the next shareholder meeting . " we would like to make a proposal during the next agm , in may 2008 , at the latest , " grube said . earlier this month , a german government spokesperson confirmed that chancellor angela merkel 's administration was looking into ways to protect german interests in the european aerospace company and that it was calling for it to recieve a golden share . golden share have been used in the past by governments of eu member states to allow them to keep controlling voting rights in partially privatized companies , but are not viewed favorably by the european commission . eads is controlled by a group of french and german shareholders which are either public or politically-linked private investors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 27.08.2007 experts say new alert system needed in eu child searches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madeleine mccann 's parents have spread the word with their own media campaign the eu has a lot of experience in dealing with cross-border problems .
so it should come as no surprise that its efforts to solve child abduction cases should focus on cooperation and standardized search procedures . there have probably been as many column inches written about the efforts of kate and gerry mccann to find their missing daughter madeleine as the investigation into the alleged abduction itself .
the campaign by the missing four-year-old 's family and friends to keep maddy 's face in the media has drawn both praise and criticism since it swung into action in the days after her disappearance from the mccanns ' apartment at the praia da luz resort in portugal on may 3 .
whether one admires or criticizes the mccanns ' use of the media in the search for their daughter , one thing can not be ignored : the media strategy has resulted in an unprecedented level of coverage regarding a child 's abduction .
but should a family have to create its own rolling news channel to keep the world informed of the efforts to find a missing child ?
could the creation of the " find madeleine " campaign also be a reaction to inadequate international search procedures ?
incompatibilities obvious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerry and kate mccann gave the public vital information one of the most debated aspects of the mccann investigation has been the extensive criticism of the portuguese police .
critics of the policia judiciaria have highlighted the differences between portuguese methods and those employed in the search for a child in madeleine 's native britain and other eu countries .
in particular , the police have been accused of failing to distribute information for hours after maddy vanished , for delays in passing a description to border or marine police and for refusing offers of help from international experts for almost three months .
the portuguese have defended themselves by saying that under article 86 of the country 's penal code information must not be released , apart from in exceptional circumstances , while the criminal investigation is still taking place .
while similar types of secrecy laws regarding ongoing police investigations exist in most european countries , information covered by these laws tends to apply to evidence and situations that need to be kept under wraps in the search for a suspect .
few prevent the broadcast or distribution of information regarding a missing child .
eu-wide alert system ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police cooperation across the eu is improving slowly the mccann case has raised new calls for a europe-wide response procedure in the case of abducted children .
while the european commission is already trying to increase cooperation in cross-border investigations , there are currently no plans to standardize the response in the case of a missing child .
" we have been told that there are no plans at the moment for an eu-wide alert system , " said carolyn bouchard from independent child protection agency safehands .
" the level of police cooperation is slowly improving and most current systems work well on a national level , but we continue to push for an efficient network across the continent . "
delphine moralis , the acting secretary general for the european federation for missing and sexually exploited children , was more specific .
" based on the experience of its members -lrb- 21 non-governmental organizations in 14 eu countries -rrb- when dealing with missing children cases across the eu , missing children europe advocates the need to develop alert support systems for cases of child abductions or life threatening disappearances of children in countries where no system exists , " she said .
" we also recommend the development of co-ordination procedures and interconnection schemes between existing systems , such as the ones in belgium , france , germany , greece and the uk . "
the closest thing europe currently has to a standardized response is the amber alert , a procedure imported from the united states , although not all countries in the eu use it .
amber alerts a tried and tested response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public is a vaulable resource in any abduction case amber alerts are issued by police when four main criteria of a child abduction case are satisfied : when a child under 16 goes missing ; when the child is believed kidnapped , when a senior police officer fears that death or serious harm may come about , and when the case has sufficient descriptive details , such as photographs of the child or suspected abductor .
the alerts are then broadcast to the public via radio and television stations , immediately interrupting scheduled broadcasting to report the missing child .
the alerts are also shown on electronic motorway signs and sent to email accounts , mobile phones and wireless devices of registered search volunteers .
" a coordinated amber alert system in europe would be hugely beneficial because one of the most critical parts of an abduction investigation is informing the public , " said robert hoever , from the us national center for missing and exploited children -lrb- ncmec -rrb- .
" it would require each country to have a designated amber facilitator and for all the facilitators to meet and plan together a memorandum of understanding as to how they would work together . "
cross-border structures needed for success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations must cross borders seemlessly to succeed hoever believes that having a similar system and a coordinator in every eu member state would greatly improve cross-border child abduction investigations in the bloc .
" contact person ' a ' would be responsible for putting the alert out in his or her own country and if information suggested the child had crossed the border , then ' a ' calls ' b ' and the same system kicks in , " he said .
however , according to hoever , bringing in a standardized amber alert-type system in europe would only work if other investigative strategies were already in place .
" before you have a standardized alert system , you have to address the cross-border problems .
you ca n't try and solve differences in police procedure during a case ; you waste time and endanger the child further .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 27.08.2007 experts say new alert system needed in eu child searches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madeleine mccann 's parents have spread the word with their own media campaign the eu has a lot of experience in dealing with cross-border problems .
so it should come as no surprise that its efforts to solve child abduction cases should focus on cooperation and standardized search procedures . there have probably been as many column inches written about the efforts of kate and gerry mccann to find their missing daughter madeleine as the investigation into the alleged abduction itself .
the campaign by the missing four-year-old 's family and friends to keep maddy 's face in the media has drawn both praise and criticism since it swung into action in the days after her disappearance from the mccanns ' apartment at the praia da luz resort in portugal on may 3 .
whether one admires or criticizes the mccanns ' use of the media in the search for their daughter , one thing can not be ignored : the media strategy has resulted in an unprecedented level of coverage regarding a child 's abduction .
but should a family have to create its own rolling news channel to keep the world informed of the efforts to find a missing child ?
could the creation of the " find madeleine " campaign also be a reaction to inadequate international search procedures ?
incompatibilities obvious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerry and kate mccann gave the public vital information one of the most debated aspects of the mccann investigation has been the extensive criticism of the portuguese police .
critics of the policia judiciaria have highlighted the differences between portuguese methods and those employed in the search for a child in madeleine 's native britain and other eu countries .
in particular , the police have been accused of failing to distribute information for hours after maddy vanished , for delays in passing a description to border or marine police and for refusing offers of help from international experts for almost three months .
the portuguese have defended themselves by saying that under article 86 of the country 's penal code information must not be released , apart from in exceptional circumstances , while the criminal investigation is still taking place .
while similar types of secrecy laws regarding ongoing police investigations exist in most european countries , information covered by these laws tends to apply to evidence and situations that need to be kept under wraps in the search for a suspect .
few prevent the broadcast or distribution of information regarding a missing child .
eu-wide alert system ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police cooperation across the eu is improving slowly the mccann case has raised new calls for a europe-wide response procedure in the case of abducted children .
while the european commission is already trying to increase cooperation in cross-border investigations , there are currently no plans to standardize the response in the case of a missing child .
" we have been told that there are no plans at the moment for an eu-wide alert system , " said carolyn bouchard from independent child protection agency safehands .
" the level of police cooperation is slowly improving and most current systems work well on a national level , but we continue to push for an efficient network across the continent . "
delphine moralis , the acting secretary general for the european federation for missing and sexually exploited children , was more specific .
" based on the experience of its members -lrb- 21 non-governmental organizations in 14 eu countries -rrb- when dealing with missing children cases across the eu , missing children europe advocates the need to develop alert support systems for cases of child abductions or life threatening disappearances of children in countries where no system exists , " she said .
" we also recommend the development of co-ordination procedures and interconnection schemes between existing systems , such as the ones in belgium , france , germany , greece and the uk . "
the closest thing europe currently has to a standardized response is the amber alert , a procedure imported from the united states , although not all countries in the eu use it .
amber alerts a tried and tested response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public is a vaulable resource in any abduction case amber alerts are issued by police when four main criteria of a child abduction case are satisfied : when a child under 16 goes missing ; when the child is believed kidnapped , when a senior police officer fears that death or serious harm may come about , and when the case has sufficient descriptive details , such as photographs of the child or suspected abductor .
the alerts are then broadcast to the public via radio and television stations , immediately interrupting scheduled broadcasting to report the missing child .
the alerts are also shown on electronic motorway signs and sent to email accounts , mobile phones and wireless devices of registered search volunteers .
" a coordinated amber alert system in europe would be hugely beneficial because one of the most critical parts of an abduction investigation is informing the public , " said robert hoever , from the us national center for missing and exploited children -lrb- ncmec -rrb- .
" it would require each country to have a designated amber facilitator and for all the facilitators to meet and plan together a memorandum of understanding as to how they would work together . "
cross-border structures needed for success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations must cross borders seemlessly to succeed hoever believes that having a similar system and a coordinator in every eu member state would greatly improve cross-border child abduction investigations in the bloc .
" contact person ' a ' would be responsible for putting the alert out in his or her own country and if information suggested the child had crossed the border , then ' a ' calls ' b ' and the same system kicks in , " he said .
however , according to hoever , bringing in a standardized amber alert-type system in europe would only work if other investigative strategies were already in place .
" before you have a standardized alert system , you have to address the cross-border problems .
you ca n't try and solve differences in police procedure during a case ; you waste time and endanger the child further .
these strategies between countries should be in place first . "
delphine moralis agreed .
" any system developed at eu level will have to start by looking at what already exists at the national level , " she said . " many questions remain to be analyzed , both regarding the procedures and regarding technical implementation of a system . "
a painful lesson so did the inadequacy of existing structures hinder the search for madeleine mccann in the first hours of her disappearance ?

merkel 's hosts said they would investigate . merkel said that china needed " to respect the rules of the game , " after talks in beijing touched upon controversial issues such as piracy and unsafe chinese exports . " in our talks , i made clear that every country has the right to development , " merkel told journalists in a joint press conference after the one-hour meeting with the chinese premier wen jiabao .
" but at present there are a great many large countries such as china that are developing fast and there is a need to respect the rules of the game . " the label " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months , especially in the aftermath of a recent recall of 18 million chinese-made products by us toy giant mattel because of safety concerns . an opportunity , not a threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen : " there is no such thing as the ' china threat theory . " '
critics of china have also voiced concerns in recent years that the country 's economic rise could potentially be seen as a threat to the rest of the world , especially in view of china 's deplorable human rights record . " china 's development is an opportunity , not a threat , " wen said .
" we have decades of work ahead before we can be even a moderately well-developed country . " the chinese premier stressed that his country was still struggling with issues such as poverty and population growth , but added that chinese intentions were not sinister . " china will always take the peaceful road , " he said .
" china is very happy to cooperate with all nations but will never threaten ... so it 's clear , everyone please be at ease , there is no such thing as the ' china threat theory . " ' hi-tech espionage ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were german government computers compromised by hackers from china ?
merkel 's talks with the chinese premier came only two days after the german news magazine der spiegel reported that chinese hackers had broken into the government computer network in berlin . according to the magazine , spy programs - which investigations showed could be tracked to the chinese people 's liberation army - were uncovered at merkel 's office , the foreign ministry and other government institutions . " we in the government took -lrb- the reports -rrb- as a matter of grave concern , " wen said . " hackers breaking into and sabotaging computers is a problem faced by the entire world . " the chinese premier emphasized that fighting hacking must be a joint effort and that china will cooperate with germany on this issue . " we are willing to maintain cooperation with the german government and take firm and effective action to prevent all hacking acts that threaten computer systems , " he said . climate goals wen promised china would undertake greater efforts to prevent global warming in its next environmental five-year plan starting in 2011 , but stressed that china 's responsibilities regarding carbon-dioxide emissions were not the same as those of long-time industrialized nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and china are important trade partners even if they do n't see eye-to-eye on human rights " it will be extremely difficult to reach these targets , but we have already shown our determination , " wen said .
" we have a much tougher task than germany does . " china has long maintained that wealthy nations - those that have already benefited from emissions-producing industrial booms - are the ones who should take the lead in cutting greenhouse-gas emissions . " china has taken part of the responsibility for climate change for only 30 years while industrial countries have grown fast for the last 200 years , " he said . merkel , who made climate change a key focus of germany 's presidency over the g8 group of leading industrialized nations , emphasized that all countries needed to work on energy efficiency . " developed countries should help by providing the latest technology , " she said . china has set goals to reduce its energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2011 , but its consumption fell by only 1.23 percent last year .
it also failed to meet its targeted 2-percent reduction in emissions of major water and air pollutants last year , recording instead toxic levels rising by almost 2 percent . merkel also met with chinese president hu jintao later on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 27.08.2007 experts say new alert system needed in eu child searches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madeleine mccann 's parents have spread the word with their own media campaign the eu has a lot of experience in dealing with cross-border problems .
so it should come as no surprise that its efforts to solve child abduction cases should focus on cooperation and standardized search procedures . there have probably been as many column inches written about the efforts of kate and gerry mccann to find their missing daughter madeleine as the investigation into the alleged abduction itself .
the campaign by the missing four-year-old 's family and friends to keep maddy 's face in the media has drawn both praise and criticism since it swung into action in the days after her disappearance from the mccanns ' apartment at the praia da luz resort in portugal on may 3 .
whether one admires or criticizes the mccanns ' use of the media in the search for their daughter , one thing can not be ignored : the media strategy has resulted in an unprecedented level of coverage regarding a child 's abduction .
but should a family have to create its own rolling news channel to keep the world informed of the efforts to find a missing child ?
could the creation of the " find madeleine " campaign also be a reaction to inadequate international search procedures ?
incompatibilities obvious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerry and kate mccann gave the public vital information one of the most debated aspects of the mccann investigation has been the extensive criticism of the portuguese police .
critics of the policia judiciaria have highlighted the differences between portuguese methods and those employed in the search for a child in madeleine 's native britain and other eu countries .
in particular , the police have been accused of failing to distribute information for hours after maddy vanished , for delays in passing a description to border or marine police and for refusing offers of help from international experts for almost three months .
the portuguese have defended themselves by saying that under article 86 of the country 's penal code information must not be released , apart from in exceptional circumstances , while the criminal investigation is still taking place .
while similar types of secrecy laws regarding ongoing police investigations exist in most european countries , information covered by these laws tends to apply to evidence and situations that need to be kept under wraps in the search for a suspect .
few prevent the broadcast or distribution of information regarding a missing child .
eu-wide alert system ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police cooperation across the eu is improving slowly the mccann case has raised new calls for a europe-wide response procedure in the case of abducted children .
while the european commission is already trying to increase cooperation in cross-border investigations , there are currently no plans to standardize the response in the case of a missing child .
" we have been told that there are no plans at the moment for an eu-wide alert system , " said carolyn bouchard from independent child protection agency safehands .
" the level of police cooperation is slowly improving and most current systems work well on a national level , but we continue to push for an efficient network across the continent . "
delphine moralis , the acting secretary general for the european federation for missing and sexually exploited children , was more specific .
" based on the experience of its members -lrb- 21 non-governmental organizations in 14 eu countries -rrb- when dealing with missing children cases across the eu , missing children europe advocates the need to develop alert support systems for cases of child abductions or life threatening disappearances of children in countries where no system exists , " she said .
" we also recommend the development of co-ordination procedures and interconnection schemes between existing systems , such as the ones in belgium , france , germany , greece and the uk . "
the closest thing europe currently has to a standardized response is the amber alert , a procedure imported from the united states , although not all countries in the eu use it .
amber alerts a tried and tested response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public is a vaulable resource in any abduction case amber alerts are issued by police when four main criteria of a child abduction case are satisfied : when a child under 16 goes missing ; when the child is believed kidnapped , when a senior police officer fears that death or serious harm may come about , and when the case has sufficient descriptive details , such as photographs of the child or suspected abductor .
the alerts are then broadcast to the public via radio and television stations , immediately interrupting scheduled broadcasting to report the missing child .
the alerts are also shown on electronic motorway signs and sent to email accounts , mobile phones and wireless devices of registered search volunteers .
" a coordinated amber alert system in europe would be hugely beneficial because one of the most critical parts of an abduction investigation is informing the public , " said robert hoever , from the us national center for missing and exploited children -lrb- ncmec -rrb- .
" it would require each country to have a designated amber facilitator and for all the facilitators to meet and plan together a memorandum of understanding as to how they would work together . "
cross-border structures needed for success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations must cross borders seemlessly to succeed hoever believes that having a similar system and a coordinator in every eu member state would greatly improve cross-border child abduction investigations in the bloc .
" contact person ' a ' would be responsible for putting the alert out in his or her own country and if information suggested the child had crossed the border , then ' a ' calls ' b ' and the same system kicks in , " he said .
however , according to hoever , bringing in a standardized amber alert-type system in europe would only work if other investigative strategies were already in place .
" before you have a standardized alert system , you have to address the cross-border problems .
you ca n't try and solve differences in police procedure during a case ; you waste time and endanger the child further .
these strategies between countries should be in place first . "
delphine moralis agreed .
" any system developed at eu level will have to start by looking at what already exists at the national level , " she said . " many questions remain to be analyzed , both regarding the procedures and regarding technical implementation of a system . "
a painful lesson so did the inadequacy of existing structures hinder the search for madeleine mccann in the first hours of her disappearance ?
" in portugal , missing children europe has an ngo member called instituto de apoio à criança i.a.c. , lisbon , which launched a hotline for missing children on may 25 , 2004 , " moralis said . " however , due to a lack of financial means and political support , no fully developed ' child alert ' or ' amber alert system ' has been launched in portugal yet . "
she said a good communication and coordination among existing systems as well as child search programs in countries which do n't currently have them could well have made a difference in the case of madeleine mccann . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the portuguese have defended themselves by saying that under article 86 of the country 's penal code information must not be released , apart from in exceptional circumstances , while the criminal investigation is still taking place .
while similar types of secrecy laws regarding ongoing police investigations exist in most european countries , information covered by these laws tends to apply to evidence and situations that need to be kept under wraps in the search for a suspect .
few prevent the broadcast or distribution of information regarding a missing child .
eu-wide alert system ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police cooperation across the eu is improving slowly the mccann case has raised new calls for a europe-wide response procedure in the case of abducted children .
while the european commission is already trying to increase cooperation in cross-border investigations , there are currently no plans to standardize the response in the case of a missing child .
" we have been told that there are no plans at the moment for an eu-wide alert system , " said carolyn bouchard from independent child protection agency safehands .
" the level of police cooperation is slowly improving and most current systems work well on a national level , but we continue to push for an efficient network across the continent . "
delphine moralis , the acting secretary general for the european federation for missing and sexually exploited children , was more specific .
" based on the experience of its members -lrb- 21 non-governmental organizations in 14 eu countries -rrb- when dealing with missing children cases across the eu , missing children europe advocates the need to develop alert support systems for cases of child abductions or life threatening disappearances of children in countries where no system exists , " she said .
" we also recommend the development of co-ordination procedures and interconnection schemes between existing systems , such as the ones in belgium , france , germany , greece and the uk . "
the closest thing europe currently has to a standardized response is the amber alert , a procedure imported from the united states , although not all countries in the eu use it .
amber alerts a tried and tested response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public is a vaulable resource in any abduction case amber alerts are issued by police when four main criteria of a child abduction case are satisfied : when a child under 16 goes missing ; when the child is believed kidnapped , when a senior police officer fears that death or serious harm may come about , and when the case has sufficient descriptive details , such as photographs of the child or suspected abductor .
the alerts are then broadcast to the public via radio and television stations , immediately interrupting scheduled broadcasting to report the missing child .
the alerts are also shown on electronic motorway signs and sent to email accounts , mobile phones and wireless devices of registered search volunteers .
" a coordinated amber alert system in europe would be hugely beneficial because one of the most critical parts of an abduction investigation is informing the public , " said robert hoever , from the us national center for missing and exploited children -lrb- ncmec -rrb- .
" it would require each country to have a designated amber facilitator and for all the facilitators to meet and plan together a memorandum of understanding as to how they would work together . "
cross-border structures needed for success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations must cross borders seemlessly to succeed hoever believes that having a similar system and a coordinator in every eu member state would greatly improve cross-border child abduction investigations in the bloc .
" contact person ' a ' would be responsible for putting the alert out in his or her own country and if information suggested the child had crossed the border , then ' a ' calls ' b ' and the same system kicks in , " he said .
however , according to hoever , bringing in a standardized amber alert-type system in europe would only work if other investigative strategies were already in place .
" before you have a standardized alert system , you have to address the cross-border problems .
you ca n't try and solve differences in police procedure during a case ; you waste time and endanger the child further .
these strategies between countries should be in place first . "
delphine moralis agreed .
" any system developed at eu level will have to start by looking at what already exists at the national level , " she said . " many questions remain to be analyzed , both regarding the procedures and regarding technical implementation of a system . "
a painful lesson so did the inadequacy of existing structures hinder the search for madeleine mccann in the first hours of her disappearance ?
" in portugal , missing children europe has an ngo member called instituto de apoio à criança i.a.c. , lisbon , which launched a hotline for missing children on may 25 , 2004 , " moralis said . " however , due to a lack of financial means and political support , no fully developed ' child alert ' or ' amber alert system ' has been launched in portugal yet . "
she said a good communication and coordination among existing systems as well as child search programs in countries which do n't currently have them could well have made a difference in the case of madeleine mccann . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so it should come as no surprise that its efforts to solve child abduction cases should focus on cooperation and standardized search procedures . there have probably been as many column inches written about the efforts of kate and gerry mccann to find their missing daughter madeleine as the investigation into the alleged abduction itself .
the campaign by the missing four-year-old 's family and friends to keep maddy 's face in the media has drawn both praise and criticism since it swung into action in the days after her disappearance from the mccanns ' apartment at the praia da luz resort in portugal on may 3 .
whether one admires or criticizes the mccanns ' use of the media in the search for their daughter , one thing can not be ignored : the media strategy has resulted in an unprecedented level of coverage regarding a child 's abduction .
but should a family have to create its own rolling news channel to keep the world informed of the efforts to find a missing child ?
could the creation of the " find madeleine " campaign also be a reaction to inadequate international search procedures ?
incompatibilities obvious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerry and kate mccann gave the public vital information one of the most debated aspects of the mccann investigation has been the extensive criticism of the portuguese police .
critics of the policia judiciaria have highlighted the differences between portuguese methods and those employed in the search for a child in madeleine 's native britain and other eu countries .
in particular , the police have been accused of failing to distribute information for hours after maddy vanished , for delays in passing a description to border or marine police and for refusing offers of help from international experts for almost three months .

a spokesman for the stuttgart-based bank told afp that the sale price would be fixed at the end of the year after lbbw had carried out a more detailed evaluation of the leipzig-based bank .
he said lbbw had also given the bank a 250 million euro -lrb- $ 342 million -rrb- cash injection as " an immediate measure . "
saxony state premier georg milbradt said current turbulence in the capital markets meant that it was impossible for the bank to continue without a partner .
knock-on effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us mortgage crisis has sent stock markets tumbling worldwide news of sachsenlb 's troubles emerged a week ago , when it admitted receiving a financial lifeline of 17.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.7 billion -rrb- from a consortium of other banks in the wake of the us home loans turmoil that sent world markets diving .
but german newspapers reported on friday that this had failed to stem sachsenlb 's liquidity problems caused by its inability to cover the debts of ormond quay , an investment fund under the management of its dublin-based unit .
normalize operations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxony 's state premier says the sale will place operations back on a normal footing milbradt told mdr radio on sunday that the sale of the bank to lbbw would put operations at the bank back on an even keel .
" we promise that the support of baden-württemberg will restore calm , " he said .
" things could be back to normal on monday .
baden-württemberg is not leaping into a black hole with this purchase . "
he said the lowest price his government was prepared to accept for sachsenlb was 300 million euros .
the leipzig-based financial institution is the second german bank that has had to be bailed out after exposure to credit markets caught in the us sub-prime housing market crisis .
the ikb bank - a relatively small financial institution that lends to medium-sized businesses - was subject to a 3.5 billion-euro rescue operation last month by the state-owned kfw - a bank set up immediately after world war ii to finance germany 's reconstruction . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the city 's mayor has hailed the work as an " enrichment , " the archbishop reportedly never wanted it . the new window is made up of 11,200 squares and has been installed on the sunny , south-facing side of the gothic cathedral .
more than 1,000 visitors came to witness the event .
eagerly craning their necks upwards to view the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184 square-foot -rrb- artwork , the majority seemed entranced by the kaleidoscope of colors .
" the cathedral has been enriched and so has the city , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said after the unveiling .
top opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the inauguration ceremony , the window was described as producing a " symphony of light " but not everyone is apparently happy with the new design .
the online edition of the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper reported that none less than the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , opposed it .
citing a close confidante of meisner 's , the stadt-anzeiger wrote that the archbishop even tried to stop the project , resulting in serious disputes within the committee responsible for deciding over the window .
" the cardinal did not want this window , " said the source . the archbishop , who is not opposed to modern art per se , reportedly wanted to have a figurative work , for example with representations of saints or 20th century martyrs , rather than an abstract one .
cathedral provost norbert feldhoff said the reason for meisner 's absence at the unveiling ceremony was " purely technical " and was linked to a clash with a previously planned trip to poland .
artist 's gift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter was there to see his work unveiled gerhard richter , who lives in cologne , gave his work on the window for free , while the production costs totaling 370,000 euros -lrb- $ 506,000 -rrb- were covered by private donations .
the 75-year-old artist , who has a reputation for being a man of few words , seemed to be happy with his work and said he was proud " it had n't gone wrong . "
richter said it had been a little bit " nerve-wracking " to create a work that , unlike a picture , could not simply be taken down again .
the original window was destroyed in world war ii and replaced in the 1950s by a nearly transparent piece of glass .
cologne cathedral , which is one of germany 's most famous landmarks , dates back to the 13th century and was added to the world heritage list by unesco in 1996 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 27.08.2007 rumor mill churns out jobs in la , london for klinsmann großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann remains tight-lipped over rumors linking him to la galaxy and tottenham you used to know where you were with jürgen klinsmann .
until he took over the german national team , it was most likely to be on a beach in california .
these days , klinsi could be anywhere if you listen to soccer rumors . what a year it has been for jürgen klinsmann .
if one believes everything written about the former germany coach over the past 12 months it appears that klinsi has spent his sabbatical jet-setting around the globe , having high-profile interviews for every vacant managerial position in soccer - and turning every single one of the down .
after relinquishing the reins of the national squad after the 2006 world cup , klinsmann has been linked to coaching jobs with the national teams of the united states , australia and mexico and was touted as a successor to jose moriniho as manager of english premiership side chelsea before the current season began .
now it seems that klinsmann is either going to try his hand at owning a soccer club or add his enthusiastic momentum to the slow revolution of the game in his adopted homeland of the united states .
the latest klinsi rumors surfaced last week as his former international charges beat england in a friendly match in london and tottenham hotspur , his former league club in the english capital , was going through a highly premature coaching crisis .
just two days after a makeshift germany side triumphed 2-1 at wembley , klinsmann 's name was cropping up in relation to one of those who faced his compatriots on wednesday night .
klinsi allegedly in line for galaxy hot-seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham 's arrival has stressed his coach out david beckham , formerly a serious soccer player and now main attraction at la galaxy 's traveling circus , had just arrived back in the us after a grueling transatlantic round trip and could barely muster a limp in his side 's loss to local rivals chivas in the major soccer league western conference clash .
while most of the stateside stories asked whether becks could handle playing for the galaxy and helping england qualify for the 2008 european championships at the same time , others were inserting paragraphs about how galaxy coach frank yallop could n't handle managing the former real madrid and man united mega-star .
with the galaxy languishing second from bottom in the conference and way off the pace for the play-off places , yallop 's days look to be numbered .
and so , with a very high-profile manager 's seat on the verge of becoming vacant , klinsmann 's name was once again churned out by the rumor mill .
oc resident with great cv klinsmann , already a resident of the sunshine state , would not have to travel far to take over from yallop if he were to be forced out of the galaxy hot-seat .
but , true to form , the german has refused to say anything , neither denying nor confirming any involvement and stoking the fires of speculation further by keeping his own counsel .
however , klinsmann worked as a consultant for the galaxy in 2004 before taking over the germany team and with his orange county home just 20 minutes away from the team 's base , it appears as though the connections and infrastructure are already in place for klinsi 's return to coaching .
but as recent history has taught us , we 've been here before .
former spurs striker to return as coach ?
now , depending on which newspapers you 've been reading , klinsmann could be forsaking the chance to coach beckham and co. in the californian sunshine for either the chairman ’ s or manager ’ s job at premiership side tottenham .
four games in and the crazy world of english soccer is already talking about its first potential coaching casualty .
three defeats in four have seen the pressure heaped on incumbent coach martin jol and it appears the man who has taken tottenham to consecutive fifth-place finishes after years of mid-table mediocrity now has only three more matches to save his job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi would get a better car if he returned to spurs as coach if he is sacked by the end of september , some papers have klinsmann battling it out with sevilla coach juande ramos for the vacancy , should it happen .
ramos has an enviable record in spain but klinsmann , a talismanic striker for spurs during two spells with the club in the 90 's , remains a firm favorite with the fans .
other papers , however , paint klinsmann as the knight in shining armor riding into the boardroom at spurs to save both jol and the club from the apparent insanity which has settled over the current board .
again , the strings pulling this potential deal into shape stretch back to california .
a consortium of businessmen are reportedly lining up a financial package which would buy spurs outright and hand klinsmann either the coach ’ s job or a director of soccer position in which he has ultimate control of the playing side -lrb- again , depending on who you read -rrb- .
klinsmann , as you would expect , has not commented on this speculation either .

until he took over the german national team , it was most likely to be on a beach in california .
these days , klinsi could be anywhere if you listen to soccer rumors . what a year it has been for jürgen klinsmann .
if one believes everything written about the former germany coach over the past 12 months it appears that klinsi has spent his sabbatical jet-setting around the globe , having high-profile interviews for every vacant managerial position in soccer - and turning every single one of the down .
after relinquishing the reins of the national squad after the 2006 world cup , klinsmann has been linked to coaching jobs with the national teams of the united states , australia and mexico and was touted as a successor to jose moriniho as manager of english premiership side chelsea before the current season began .
now it seems that klinsmann is either going to try his hand at owning a soccer club or add his enthusiastic momentum to the slow revolution of the game in his adopted homeland of the united states .
the latest klinsi rumors surfaced last week as his former international charges beat england in a friendly match in london and tottenham hotspur , his former league club in the english capital , was going through a highly premature coaching crisis .
just two days after a makeshift germany side triumphed 2-1 at wembley , klinsmann 's name was cropping up in relation to one of those who faced his compatriots on wednesday night .
klinsi allegedly in line for galaxy hot-seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham 's arrival has stressed his coach out david beckham , formerly a serious soccer player and now main attraction at la galaxy 's traveling circus , had just arrived back in the us after a grueling transatlantic round trip and could barely muster a limp in his side 's loss to local rivals chivas in the major soccer league western conference clash .
while most of the stateside stories asked whether becks could handle playing for the galaxy and helping england qualify for the 2008 european championships at the same time , others were inserting paragraphs about how galaxy coach frank yallop could n't handle managing the former real madrid and man united mega-star .
with the galaxy languishing second from bottom in the conference and way off the pace for the play-off places , yallop 's days look to be numbered .
and so , with a very high-profile manager 's seat on the verge of becoming vacant , klinsmann 's name was once again churned out by the rumor mill .
oc resident with great cv klinsmann , already a resident of the sunshine state , would not have to travel far to take over from yallop if he were to be forced out of the galaxy hot-seat .
but , true to form , the german has refused to say anything , neither denying nor confirming any involvement and stoking the fires of speculation further by keeping his own counsel .
however , klinsmann worked as a consultant for the galaxy in 2004 before taking over the germany team and with his orange county home just 20 minutes away from the team 's base , it appears as though the connections and infrastructure are already in place for klinsi 's return to coaching .
but as recent history has taught us , we 've been here before .
former spurs striker to return as coach ?
now , depending on which newspapers you 've been reading , klinsmann could be forsaking the chance to coach beckham and co. in the californian sunshine for either the chairman ’ s or manager ’ s job at premiership side tottenham .
four games in and the crazy world of english soccer is already talking about its first potential coaching casualty .
three defeats in four have seen the pressure heaped on incumbent coach martin jol and it appears the man who has taken tottenham to consecutive fifth-place finishes after years of mid-table mediocrity now has only three more matches to save his job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi would get a better car if he returned to spurs as coach if he is sacked by the end of september , some papers have klinsmann battling it out with sevilla coach juande ramos for the vacancy , should it happen .
ramos has an enviable record in spain but klinsmann , a talismanic striker for spurs during two spells with the club in the 90 's , remains a firm favorite with the fans .
other papers , however , paint klinsmann as the knight in shining armor riding into the boardroom at spurs to save both jol and the club from the apparent insanity which has settled over the current board .
again , the strings pulling this potential deal into shape stretch back to california .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 27.08.2007 window by artist gerhard richter unveiled at cologne cathedral großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the painter and photographer 's first piece of work for a church a stained glass window by the famous german artist gerhard richter has been unveiled at cologne cathedral .
while the city 's mayor has hailed the work as an " enrichment , " the archbishop reportedly never wanted it . the new window is made up of 11,200 squares and has been installed on the sunny , south-facing side of the gothic cathedral .
more than 1,000 visitors came to witness the event .
eagerly craning their necks upwards to view the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184 square-foot -rrb- artwork , the majority seemed entranced by the kaleidoscope of colors .
" the cathedral has been enriched and so has the city , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said after the unveiling .
top opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the inauguration ceremony , the window was described as producing a " symphony of light " but not everyone is apparently happy with the new design .
the online edition of the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper reported that none less than the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , opposed it .
citing a close confidante of meisner 's , the stadt-anzeiger wrote that the archbishop even tried to stop the project , resulting in serious disputes within the committee responsible for deciding over the window .
" the cardinal did not want this window , " said the source . the archbishop , who is not opposed to modern art per se , reportedly wanted to have a figurative work , for example with representations of saints or 20th century martyrs , rather than an abstract one .
cathedral provost norbert feldhoff said the reason for meisner 's absence at the unveiling ceremony was " purely technical " and was linked to a clash with a previously planned trip to poland .
artist 's gift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter was there to see his work unveiled gerhard richter , who lives in cologne , gave his work on the window for free , while the production costs totaling 370,000 euros -lrb- $ 506,000 -rrb- were covered by private donations .
the 75-year-old artist , who has a reputation for being a man of few words , seemed to be happy with his work and said he was proud " it had n't gone wrong . "
richter said it had been a little bit " nerve-wracking " to create a work that , unlike a picture , could not simply be taken down again .
the original window was destroyed in world war ii and replaced in the 1950s by a nearly transparent piece of glass .
cologne cathedral , which is one of germany 's most famous landmarks , dates back to the 13th century and was added to the world heritage list by unesco in 1996 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the city 's mayor has hailed the work as an " enrichment , " the archbishop reportedly never wanted it . the new window is made up of 11,200 squares and has been installed on the sunny , south-facing side of the gothic cathedral .
more than 1,000 visitors came to witness the event .
eagerly craning their necks upwards to view the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184 square-foot -rrb- artwork , the majority seemed entranced by the kaleidoscope of colors .
" the cathedral has been enriched and so has the city , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said after the unveiling .
top opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the inauguration ceremony , the window was described as producing a " symphony of light " but not everyone is apparently happy with the new design .
the online edition of the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper reported that none less than the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , opposed it .
citing a close confidante of meisner 's , the stadt-anzeiger wrote that the archbishop even tried to stop the project , resulting in serious disputes within the committee responsible for deciding over the window .
" the cardinal did not want this window , " said the source . the archbishop , who is not opposed to modern art per se , reportedly wanted to have a figurative work , for example with representations of saints or 20th century martyrs , rather than an abstract one .
cathedral provost norbert feldhoff said the reason for meisner 's absence at the unveiling ceremony was " purely technical " and was linked to a clash with a previously planned trip to poland .
artist 's gift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter was there to see his work unveiled gerhard richter , who lives in cologne , gave his work on the window for free , while the production costs totaling 370,000 euros -lrb- $ 506,000 -rrb- were covered by private donations .
the 75-year-old artist , who has a reputation for being a man of few words , seemed to be happy with his work and said he was proud " it had n't gone wrong . "
richter said it had been a little bit " nerve-wracking " to create a work that , unlike a picture , could not simply be taken down again .
the original window was destroyed in world war ii and replaced in the 1950s by a nearly transparent piece of glass .
cologne cathedral , which is one of germany 's most famous landmarks , dates back to the 13th century and was added to the world heritage list by unesco in 1996 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if we succeed , then it will be a collective success and if we fail , it will be a collective failure , " gallois told the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday . the eads and its subsidiary airbus previously had an awkward management structure with two co-chairmen and two co-chief executives from france and germany .
the twin-headed management structure had been widely blamed for slow decision-making and inefficiency which lead to significant financial losses and product delays . the new deal , hammered out by german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy in july , gave each country a chance to have one top position in the concern . france 's louis gallois , took over on monday as the sole chief executive of the eads , while his former eads co-chief , germany 's tom enders , took the reins at airbus . gallois said he did not want to be the " french ceo of eads , but the ceo of eads . " old challenges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former eads co-chiefs thomas enders , left , and louis gallois now have separate jobs it is yet to be seen , whether the new management structure will bring the much-needed improvements to the company .
a french trade unionist complained publicly last week about the new board of the group , which is now made up of six germans , two french managers , one spaniard and an english director .
gallois said that the current arrangement , whereby the company has two headquarters , one in paris and one in munich was not ideal .
" one day we will have to agree on a single office , " gallois said . " but the time is not ripe for that , " he said , adding that he could imagine a transition to single headquarters taking place " in a few years . " golden shares also on monday , rudiger grube , who has become the sole chairman of eads backed the idea of " golden shares " in the company , which would be held by chosen shareholders and which could outvote all other shares in certain specified circumstances , such as a hostile takeover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy found a solution to eads ' cumbersome dual management structure " taking into account eads ' contribution to the sovereignty and security of europe , it 's a legitimate question , " grube said in an interview with the french financial daily les echos . " many aerospace companies around the world have protection of this type . " he said a a working group set up by eads shareholders would hand in its conclusions before the next shareholder meeting . " we would like to make a proposal during the next agm , in may 2008 , at the latest , " grube said . earlier this month , a german government spokesperson confirmed that chancellor angela merkel 's administration was looking into ways to protect german interests in the european aerospace company and that it was calling for it to recieve a golden share . golden share have been used in the past by governments of eu member states to allow them to keep controlling voting rights in partially privatized companies , but are not viewed favorably by the european commission . eads is controlled by a group of french and german shareholders which are either public or politically-linked private investors .

merkel 's hosts said they would investigate . merkel said that china needed " to respect the rules of the game , " after talks in beijing touched upon controversial issues such as piracy and unsafe chinese exports . " in our talks , i made clear that every country has the right to development , " merkel told journalists in a joint press conference after the one-hour meeting with the chinese premier wen jiabao .
" but at present there are a great many large countries such as china that are developing fast and there is a need to respect the rules of the game . " the label " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months , especially in the aftermath of a recent recall of 18 million chinese-made products by us toy giant mattel because of safety concerns . an opportunity , not a threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen : " there is no such thing as the ' china threat theory . " '
critics of china have also voiced concerns in recent years that the country 's economic rise could potentially be seen as a threat to the rest of the world , especially in view of china 's deplorable human rights record . " china 's development is an opportunity , not a threat , " wen said .
" we have decades of work ahead before we can be even a moderately well-developed country . " the chinese premier stressed that his country was still struggling with issues such as poverty and population growth , but added that chinese intentions were not sinister .

merkel 's talks with the chinese premier came only two days after the german news magazine der spiegel reported that chinese hackers had broken into the government computer network in berlin . according to the magazine , spy programs - which investigations showed could be tracked to the chinese people 's liberation army - were uncovered at merkel 's office , the foreign ministry and other government institutions . " we in the government took -lrb- the reports -rrb- as a matter of grave concern , " wen said . " hackers breaking into and sabotaging computers is a problem faced by the entire world . " the chinese premier emphasized that fighting hacking must be a joint effort and that china will cooperate with germany on this issue .

" we have a much tougher task than germany does . " china has long maintained that wealthy nations - those that have already benefited from emissions-producing industrial booms - are the ones who should take the lead in cutting greenhouse-gas emissions . " china has taken part of the responsibility for climate change for only 30 years while industrial countries have grown fast for the last 200 years , " he said . merkel , who made climate change a key focus of germany 's presidency over the g8 group of leading industrialized nations , emphasized that all countries needed to work on energy efficiency . " developed countries should help by providing the latest technology , " she said . china has set goals to reduce its energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2011 , but its consumption fell by only 1.23 percent last year .
it also failed to meet its targeted 2-percent reduction in emissions of major water and air pollutants last year , recording instead toxic levels rising by almost 2 percent . merkel also met with chinese president hu jintao later on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 27.08.2007 window by artist gerhard richter unveiled at cologne cathedral großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the painter and photographer 's first piece of work for a church a stained glass window by the famous german artist gerhard richter has been unveiled at cologne cathedral .
while the city 's mayor has hailed the work as an " enrichment , " the archbishop reportedly never wanted it . the new window is made up of 11,200 squares and has been installed on the sunny , south-facing side of the gothic cathedral .
more than 1,000 visitors came to witness the event .
eagerly craning their necks upwards to view the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184 square-foot -rrb- artwork , the majority seemed entranced by the kaleidoscope of colors .
" the cathedral has been enriched and so has the city , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said after the unveiling .
top opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the inauguration ceremony , the window was described as producing a " symphony of light " but not everyone is apparently happy with the new design .
the online edition of the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper reported that none less than the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , opposed it .
citing a close confidante of meisner 's , the stadt-anzeiger wrote that the archbishop even tried to stop the project , resulting in serious disputes within the committee responsible for deciding over the window .
" the cardinal did not want this window , " said the source . the archbishop , who is not opposed to modern art per se , reportedly wanted to have a figurative work , for example with representations of saints or 20th century martyrs , rather than an abstract one .
cathedral provost norbert feldhoff said the reason for meisner 's absence at the unveiling ceremony was " purely technical " and was linked to a clash with a previously planned trip to poland .
artist 's gift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter was there to see his work unveiled gerhard richter , who lives in cologne , gave his work on the window for free , while the production costs totaling 370,000 euros -lrb- $ 506,000 -rrb- were covered by private donations .
the 75-year-old artist , who has a reputation for being a man of few words , seemed to be happy with his work and said he was proud " it had n't gone wrong . "
richter said it had been a little bit " nerve-wracking " to create a work that , unlike a picture , could not simply be taken down again .
the original window was destroyed in world war ii and replaced in the 1950s by a nearly transparent piece of glass .
cologne cathedral , which is one of germany 's most famous landmarks , dates back to the 13th century and was added to the world heritage list by unesco in 1996 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's hosts said they would investigate . merkel said that china needed " to respect the rules of the game , " after talks in beijing touched upon controversial issues such as piracy and unsafe chinese exports . " in our talks , i made clear that every country has the right to development , " merkel told journalists in a joint press conference after the one-hour meeting with the chinese premier wen jiabao .
" but at present there are a great many large countries such as china that are developing fast and there is a need to respect the rules of the game . " the label " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months , especially in the aftermath of a recent recall of 18 million chinese-made products by us toy giant mattel because of safety concerns . an opportunity , not a threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen : " there is no such thing as the ' china threat theory . " '
critics of china have also voiced concerns in recent years that the country 's economic rise could potentially be seen as a threat to the rest of the world , especially in view of china 's deplorable human rights record . " china 's development is an opportunity , not a threat , " wen said .
" we have decades of work ahead before we can be even a moderately well-developed country . " the chinese premier stressed that his country was still struggling with issues such as poverty and population growth , but added that chinese intentions were not sinister . " china will always take the peaceful road , " he said .
" china is very happy to cooperate with all nations but will never threaten ... so it 's clear , everyone please be at ease , there is no such thing as the ' china threat theory . " ' hi-tech espionage ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were german government computers compromised by hackers from china ?
merkel 's talks with the chinese premier came only two days after the german news magazine der spiegel reported that chinese hackers had broken into the government computer network in berlin . according to the magazine , spy programs - which investigations showed could be tracked to the chinese people 's liberation army - were uncovered at merkel 's office , the foreign ministry and other government institutions . " we in the government took -lrb- the reports -rrb- as a matter of grave concern , " wen said . " hackers breaking into and sabotaging computers is a problem faced by the entire world . " the chinese premier emphasized that fighting hacking must be a joint effort and that china will cooperate with germany on this issue . " we are willing to maintain cooperation with the german government and take firm and effective action to prevent all hacking acts that threaten computer systems , " he said . climate goals wen promised china would undertake greater efforts to prevent global warming in its next environmental five-year plan starting in 2011 , but stressed that china 's responsibilities regarding carbon-dioxide emissions were not the same as those of long-time industrialized nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and china are important trade partners even if they do n't see eye-to-eye on human rights " it will be extremely difficult to reach these targets , but we have already shown our determination , " wen said .
" we have a much tougher task than germany does . " china has long maintained that wealthy nations - those that have already benefited from emissions-producing industrial booms - are the ones who should take the lead in cutting greenhouse-gas emissions . " china has taken part of the responsibility for climate change for only 30 years while industrial countries have grown fast for the last 200 years , " he said . merkel , who made climate change a key focus of germany 's presidency over the g8 group of leading industrialized nations , emphasized that all countries needed to work on energy efficiency . " developed countries should help by providing the latest technology , " she said . china has set goals to reduce its energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2011 , but its consumption fell by only 1.23 percent last year .
it also failed to meet its targeted 2-percent reduction in emissions of major water and air pollutants last year , recording instead toxic levels rising by almost 2 percent . merkel also met with chinese president hu jintao later on monday .

now it seems that klinsmann is either going to try his hand at owning a soccer club or add his enthusiastic momentum to the slow revolution of the game in his adopted homeland of the united states .
the latest klinsi rumors surfaced last week as his former international charges beat england in a friendly match in london and tottenham hotspur , his former league club in the english capital , was going through a highly premature coaching crisis .
just two days after a makeshift germany side triumphed 2-1 at wembley , klinsmann 's name was cropping up in relation to one of those who faced his compatriots on wednesday night .
klinsi allegedly in line for galaxy hot-seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham 's arrival has stressed his coach out david beckham , formerly a serious soccer player and now main attraction at la galaxy 's traveling circus , had just arrived back in the us after a grueling transatlantic round trip and could barely muster a limp in his side 's loss to local rivals chivas in the major soccer league western conference clash .
while most of the stateside stories asked whether becks could handle playing for the galaxy and helping england qualify for the 2008 european championships at the same time , others were inserting paragraphs about how galaxy coach frank yallop could n't handle managing the former real madrid and man united mega-star .
with the galaxy languishing second from bottom in the conference and way off the pace for the play-off places , yallop 's days look to be numbered .
and so , with a very high-profile manager 's seat on the verge of becoming vacant , klinsmann 's name was once again churned out by the rumor mill .
oc resident with great cv klinsmann , already a resident of the sunshine state , would not have to travel far to take over from yallop if he were to be forced out of the galaxy hot-seat .
but , true to form , the german has refused to say anything , neither denying nor confirming any involvement and stoking the fires of speculation further by keeping his own counsel .
however , klinsmann worked as a consultant for the galaxy in 2004 before taking over the germany team and with his orange county home just 20 minutes away from the team 's base , it appears as though the connections and infrastructure are already in place for klinsi 's return to coaching .
but as recent history has taught us , we 've been here before .

four games in and the crazy world of english soccer is already talking about its first potential coaching casualty .
three defeats in four have seen the pressure heaped on incumbent coach martin jol and it appears the man who has taken tottenham to consecutive fifth-place finishes after years of mid-table mediocrity now has only three more matches to save his job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi would get a better car if he returned to spurs as coach if he is sacked by the end of september , some papers have klinsmann battling it out with sevilla coach juande ramos for the vacancy , should it happen .

" if we succeed , then it will be a collective success and if we fail , it will be a collective failure , " gallois told the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday . the eads and its subsidiary airbus previously had an awkward management structure with two co-chairmen and two co-chief executives from france and germany .
the twin-headed management structure had been widely blamed for slow decision-making and inefficiency which lead to significant financial losses and product delays . the new deal , hammered out by german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy in july , gave each country a chance to have one top position in the concern . france 's louis gallois , took over on monday as the sole chief executive of the eads , while his former eads co-chief , germany 's tom enders , took the reins at airbus . gallois said he did not want to be the " french ceo of eads , but the ceo of eads . " old challenges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former eads co-chiefs thomas enders , left , and louis gallois now have separate jobs it is yet to be seen , whether the new management structure will bring the much-needed improvements to the company .
a french trade unionist complained publicly last week about the new board of the group , which is now made up of six germans , two french managers , one spaniard and an english director .
gallois said that the current arrangement , whereby the company has two headquarters , one in paris and one in munich was not ideal .
" one day we will have to agree on a single office , " gallois said . " but the time is not ripe for that , " he said , adding that he could imagine a transition to single headquarters taking place " in a few years . " golden shares also on monday , rudiger grube , who has become the sole chairman of eads backed the idea of " golden shares " in the company , which would be held by chosen shareholders and which could outvote all other shares in certain specified circumstances , such as a hostile takeover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy found a solution to eads ' cumbersome dual management structure " taking into account eads ' contribution to the sovereignty and security of europe , it 's a legitimate question , " grube said in an interview with the french financial daily les echos . " many aerospace companies around the world have protection of this type . " he said a a working group set up by eads shareholders would hand in its conclusions before the next shareholder meeting . " we would like to make a proposal during the next agm , in may 2008 , at the latest , " grube said . earlier this month , a german government spokesperson confirmed that chancellor angela merkel 's administration was looking into ways to protect german interests in the european aerospace company and that it was calling for it to recieve a golden share . golden share have been used in the past by governments of eu member states to allow them to keep controlling voting rights in partially privatized companies , but are not viewed favorably by the european commission . eads is controlled by a group of french and german shareholders which are either public or politically-linked private investors .

while the city 's mayor has hailed the work as an " enrichment , " the archbishop reportedly never wanted it . the new window is made up of 11,200 squares and has been installed on the sunny , south-facing side of the gothic cathedral .
more than 1,000 visitors came to witness the event .
eagerly craning their necks upwards to view the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184 square-foot -rrb- artwork , the majority seemed entranced by the kaleidoscope of colors .
" the cathedral has been enriched and so has the city , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said after the unveiling .
top opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the inauguration ceremony , the window was described as producing a " symphony of light " but not everyone is apparently happy with the new design .
the online edition of the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper reported that none less than the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , opposed it .
citing a close confidante of meisner 's , the stadt-anzeiger wrote that the archbishop even tried to stop the project , resulting in serious disputes within the committee responsible for deciding over the window .
" the cardinal did not want this window , " said the source . the archbishop , who is not opposed to modern art per se , reportedly wanted to have a figurative work , for example with representations of saints or 20th century martyrs , rather than an abstract one .
cathedral provost norbert feldhoff said the reason for meisner 's absence at the unveiling ceremony was " purely technical " and was linked to a clash with a previously planned trip to poland .
artist 's gift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter was there to see his work unveiled gerhard richter , who lives in cologne , gave his work on the window for free , while the production costs totaling 370,000 euros -lrb- $ 506,000 -rrb- were covered by private donations .
the 75-year-old artist , who has a reputation for being a man of few words , seemed to be happy with his work and said he was proud " it had n't gone wrong . "
richter said it had been a little bit " nerve-wracking " to create a work that , unlike a picture , could not simply be taken down again .
the original window was destroyed in world war ii and replaced in the 1950s by a nearly transparent piece of glass .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 27.08.2007 rumor mill churns out jobs in la , london for klinsmann großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann remains tight-lipped over rumors linking him to la galaxy and tottenham you used to know where you were with jürgen klinsmann .
until he took over the german national team , it was most likely to be on a beach in california .
these days , klinsi could be anywhere if you listen to soccer rumors . what a year it has been for jürgen klinsmann .
if one believes everything written about the former germany coach over the past 12 months it appears that klinsi has spent his sabbatical jet-setting around the globe , having high-profile interviews for every vacant managerial position in soccer - and turning every single one of the down .
after relinquishing the reins of the national squad after the 2006 world cup , klinsmann has been linked to coaching jobs with the national teams of the united states , australia and mexico and was touted as a successor to jose moriniho as manager of english premiership side chelsea before the current season began .
now it seems that klinsmann is either going to try his hand at owning a soccer club or add his enthusiastic momentum to the slow revolution of the game in his adopted homeland of the united states .
the latest klinsi rumors surfaced last week as his former international charges beat england in a friendly match in london and tottenham hotspur , his former league club in the english capital , was going through a highly premature coaching crisis .
just two days after a makeshift germany side triumphed 2-1 at wembley , klinsmann 's name was cropping up in relation to one of those who faced his compatriots on wednesday night .
klinsi allegedly in line for galaxy hot-seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham 's arrival has stressed his coach out david beckham , formerly a serious soccer player and now main attraction at la galaxy 's traveling circus , had just arrived back in the us after a grueling transatlantic round trip and could barely muster a limp in his side 's loss to local rivals chivas in the major soccer league western conference clash .
while most of the stateside stories asked whether becks could handle playing for the galaxy and helping england qualify for the 2008 european championships at the same time , others were inserting paragraphs about how galaxy coach frank yallop could n't handle managing the former real madrid and man united mega-star .
with the galaxy languishing second from bottom in the conference and way off the pace for the play-off places , yallop 's days look to be numbered .
and so , with a very high-profile manager 's seat on the verge of becoming vacant , klinsmann 's name was once again churned out by the rumor mill .
oc resident with great cv klinsmann , already a resident of the sunshine state , would not have to travel far to take over from yallop if he were to be forced out of the galaxy hot-seat .
but , true to form , the german has refused to say anything , neither denying nor confirming any involvement and stoking the fires of speculation further by keeping his own counsel .
however , klinsmann worked as a consultant for the galaxy in 2004 before taking over the germany team and with his orange county home just 20 minutes away from the team 's base , it appears as though the connections and infrastructure are already in place for klinsi 's return to coaching .
but as recent history has taught us , we 've been here before .
former spurs striker to return as coach ?
now , depending on which newspapers you 've been reading , klinsmann could be forsaking the chance to coach beckham and co. in the californian sunshine for either the chairman ’ s or manager ’ s job at premiership side tottenham .
four games in and the crazy world of english soccer is already talking about its first potential coaching casualty .
three defeats in four have seen the pressure heaped on incumbent coach martin jol and it appears the man who has taken tottenham to consecutive fifth-place finishes after years of mid-table mediocrity now has only three more matches to save his job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi would get a better car if he returned to spurs as coach if he is sacked by the end of september , some papers have klinsmann battling it out with sevilla coach juande ramos for the vacancy , should it happen .
ramos has an enviable record in spain but klinsmann , a talismanic striker for spurs during two spells with the club in the 90 's , remains a firm favorite with the fans .
other papers , however , paint klinsmann as the knight in shining armor riding into the boardroom at spurs to save both jol and the club from the apparent insanity which has settled over the current board .
again , the strings pulling this potential deal into shape stretch back to california .
a consortium of businessmen are reportedly lining up a financial package which would buy spurs outright and hand klinsmann either the coach ’ s job or a director of soccer position in which he has ultimate control of the playing side -lrb- again , depending on who you read -rrb- .
klinsmann , as you would expect , has not commented on this speculation either .

a police spokesman said the assailants admitted their involvement in the attack , which put the sudanese in hospital for several days , but denied hitting him on the head with a bottle .
the incident occurred on the same evening as eight indians were attacked and chased through the streets of mügeln after a local festival in the town in germany 's former communist east .
in a series of attacks late friday evening , a man from ghana and an iraqi were assaulted and racially abused in two separate incidents while a mob went on the rampage in another town .
the 36-year-old iraqi was beaten with a baseball bat by a man who set his dog on him at a tram stop in the eastern city of magdeburg .

until he took over the german national team , it was most likely to be on a beach in california .
these days , klinsi could be anywhere if you listen to soccer rumors . what a year it has been for jürgen klinsmann .
if one believes everything written about the former germany coach over the past 12 months it appears that klinsi has spent his sabbatical jet-setting around the globe , having high-profile interviews for every vacant managerial position in soccer - and turning every single one of the down .
after relinquishing the reins of the national squad after the 2006 world cup , klinsmann has been linked to coaching jobs with the national teams of the united states , australia and mexico and was touted as a successor to jose moriniho as manager of english premiership side chelsea before the current season began .
now it seems that klinsmann is either going to try his hand at owning a soccer club or add his enthusiastic momentum to the slow revolution of the game in his adopted homeland of the united states .
the latest klinsi rumors surfaced last week as his former international charges beat england in a friendly match in london and tottenham hotspur , his former league club in the english capital , was going through a highly premature coaching crisis .
just two days after a makeshift germany side triumphed 2-1 at wembley , klinsmann 's name was cropping up in relation to one of those who faced his compatriots on wednesday night .
klinsi allegedly in line for galaxy hot-seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham 's arrival has stressed his coach out david beckham , formerly a serious soccer player and now main attraction at la galaxy 's traveling circus , had just arrived back in the us after a grueling transatlantic round trip and could barely muster a limp in his side 's loss to local rivals chivas in the major soccer league western conference clash .
while most of the stateside stories asked whether becks could handle playing for the galaxy and helping england qualify for the 2008 european championships at the same time , others were inserting paragraphs about how galaxy coach frank yallop could n't handle managing the former real madrid and man united mega-star .
with the galaxy languishing second from bottom in the conference and way off the pace for the play-off places , yallop 's days look to be numbered .
and so , with a very high-profile manager 's seat on the verge of becoming vacant , klinsmann 's name was once again churned out by the rumor mill .
oc resident with great cv klinsmann , already a resident of the sunshine state , would not have to travel far to take over from yallop if he were to be forced out of the galaxy hot-seat .
but , true to form , the german has refused to say anything , neither denying nor confirming any involvement and stoking the fires of speculation further by keeping his own counsel .
however , klinsmann worked as a consultant for the galaxy in 2004 before taking over the germany team and with his orange county home just 20 minutes away from the team 's base , it appears as though the connections and infrastructure are already in place for klinsi 's return to coaching .
but as recent history has taught us , we 've been here before .
former spurs striker to return as coach ?
now , depending on which newspapers you 've been reading , klinsmann could be forsaking the chance to coach beckham and co. in the californian sunshine for either the chairman ’ s or manager ’ s job at premiership side tottenham .
four games in and the crazy world of english soccer is already talking about its first potential coaching casualty .
three defeats in four have seen the pressure heaped on incumbent coach martin jol and it appears the man who has taken tottenham to consecutive fifth-place finishes after years of mid-table mediocrity now has only three more matches to save his job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi would get a better car if he returned to spurs as coach if he is sacked by the end of september , some papers have klinsmann battling it out with sevilla coach juande ramos for the vacancy , should it happen .
ramos has an enviable record in spain but klinsmann , a talismanic striker for spurs during two spells with the club in the 90 's , remains a firm favorite with the fans .
other papers , however , paint klinsmann as the knight in shining armor riding into the boardroom at spurs to save both jol and the club from the apparent insanity which has settled over the current board .
again , the strings pulling this potential deal into shape stretch back to california .
a consortium of businessmen are reportedly lining up a financial package which would buy spurs outright and hand klinsmann either the coach ’ s job or a director of soccer position in which he has ultimate control of the playing side -lrb- again , depending on who you read -rrb- .
klinsmann , as you would expect , has not commented on this speculation either .

until he took over the german national team , it was most likely to be on a beach in california .
these days , klinsi could be anywhere if you listen to soccer rumors . what a year it has been for jürgen klinsmann .
if one believes everything written about the former germany coach over the past 12 months it appears that klinsi has spent his sabbatical jet-setting around the globe , having high-profile interviews for every vacant managerial position in soccer - and turning every single one of the down .
after relinquishing the reins of the national squad after the 2006 world cup , klinsmann has been linked to coaching jobs with the national teams of the united states , australia and mexico and was touted as a successor to jose moriniho as manager of english premiership side chelsea before the current season began .
now it seems that klinsmann is either going to try his hand at owning a soccer club or add his enthusiastic momentum to the slow revolution of the game in his adopted homeland of the united states .
the latest klinsi rumors surfaced last week as his former international charges beat england in a friendly match in london and tottenham hotspur , his former league club in the english capital , was going through a highly premature coaching crisis .
just two days after a makeshift germany side triumphed 2-1 at wembley , klinsmann 's name was cropping up in relation to one of those who faced his compatriots on wednesday night .
klinsi allegedly in line for galaxy hot-seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham 's arrival has stressed his coach out david beckham , formerly a serious soccer player and now main attraction at la galaxy 's traveling circus , had just arrived back in the us after a grueling transatlantic round trip and could barely muster a limp in his side 's loss to local rivals chivas in the major soccer league western conference clash .
while most of the stateside stories asked whether becks could handle playing for the galaxy and helping england qualify for the 2008 european championships at the same time , others were inserting paragraphs about how galaxy coach frank yallop could n't handle managing the former real madrid and man united mega-star .
with the galaxy languishing second from bottom in the conference and way off the pace for the play-off places , yallop 's days look to be numbered .
and so , with a very high-profile manager 's seat on the verge of becoming vacant , klinsmann 's name was once again churned out by the rumor mill .
oc resident with great cv klinsmann , already a resident of the sunshine state , would not have to travel far to take over from yallop if he were to be forced out of the galaxy hot-seat .
but , true to form , the german has refused to say anything , neither denying nor confirming any involvement and stoking the fires of speculation further by keeping his own counsel .
however , klinsmann worked as a consultant for the galaxy in 2004 before taking over the germany team and with his orange county home just 20 minutes away from the team 's base , it appears as though the connections and infrastructure are already in place for klinsi 's return to coaching .
but as recent history has taught us , we 've been here before .
former spurs striker to return as coach ?
now , depending on which newspapers you 've been reading , klinsmann could be forsaking the chance to coach beckham and co. in the californian sunshine for either the chairman ’ s or manager ’ s job at premiership side tottenham .
four games in and the crazy world of english soccer is already talking about its first potential coaching casualty .
three defeats in four have seen the pressure heaped on incumbent coach martin jol and it appears the man who has taken tottenham to consecutive fifth-place finishes after years of mid-table mediocrity now has only three more matches to save his job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi would get a better car if he returned to spurs as coach if he is sacked by the end of september , some papers have klinsmann battling it out with sevilla coach juande ramos for the vacancy , should it happen .
ramos has an enviable record in spain but klinsmann , a talismanic striker for spurs during two spells with the club in the 90 's , remains a firm favorite with the fans .
other papers , however , paint klinsmann as the knight in shining armor riding into the boardroom at spurs to save both jol and the club from the apparent insanity which has settled over the current board .
again , the strings pulling this potential deal into shape stretch back to california .
a consortium of businessmen are reportedly lining up a financial package which would buy spurs outright and hand klinsmann either the coach ’ s job or a director of soccer position in which he has ultimate control of the playing side -lrb- again , depending on who you read -rrb- .
klinsmann , as you would expect , has not commented on this speculation either .

this comes as german politicians are reconsidering a ban of the ultra-right npd party after recent xenophobic attacks . fourteen percent of the women canvassed said they would not rule out giving their ballot to a party to the right of the conservative christian democratic union or its bavarian sister party , the csu , at the next state parliamentary elections .

in addition to the discrepancy between men and women in their voting patterns , the survey also showed a split between eastern and western germany .

a spokesman for the stuttgart-based bank told afp that the sale price would be fixed at the end of the year after lbbw had carried out a more detailed evaluation of the leipzig-based bank .
he said lbbw had also given the bank a 250 million euro -lrb- $ 342 million -rrb- cash injection as " an immediate measure . "
saxony state premier georg milbradt said current turbulence in the capital markets meant that it was impossible for the bank to continue without a partner .
knock-on effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us mortgage crisis has sent stock markets tumbling worldwide news of sachsenlb 's troubles emerged a week ago , when it admitted receiving a financial lifeline of 17.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.7 billion -rrb- from a consortium of other banks in the wake of the us home loans turmoil that sent world markets diving .
but german newspapers reported on friday that this had failed to stem sachsenlb 's liquidity problems caused by its inability to cover the debts of ormond quay , an investment fund under the management of its dublin-based unit .
normalize operations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxony 's state premier says the sale will place operations back on a normal footing milbradt told mdr radio on sunday that the sale of the bank to lbbw would put operations at the bank back on an even keel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 27.08.2007 window by artist gerhard richter unveiled at cologne cathedral großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the painter and photographer 's first piece of work for a church a stained glass window by the famous german artist gerhard richter has been unveiled at cologne cathedral .
while the city 's mayor has hailed the work as an " enrichment , " the archbishop reportedly never wanted it . the new window is made up of 11,200 squares and has been installed on the sunny , south-facing side of the gothic cathedral .
more than 1,000 visitors came to witness the event .
eagerly craning their necks upwards to view the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184 square-foot -rrb- artwork , the majority seemed entranced by the kaleidoscope of colors .
" the cathedral has been enriched and so has the city , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said after the unveiling .
top opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the inauguration ceremony , the window was described as producing a " symphony of light " but not everyone is apparently happy with the new design .
the online edition of the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper reported that none less than the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , opposed it .
citing a close confidante of meisner 's , the stadt-anzeiger wrote that the archbishop even tried to stop the project , resulting in serious disputes within the committee responsible for deciding over the window .
" the cardinal did not want this window , " said the source . the archbishop , who is not opposed to modern art per se , reportedly wanted to have a figurative work , for example with representations of saints or 20th century martyrs , rather than an abstract one .
cathedral provost norbert feldhoff said the reason for meisner 's absence at the unveiling ceremony was " purely technical " and was linked to a clash with a previously planned trip to poland .
artist 's gift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter was there to see his work unveiled gerhard richter , who lives in cologne , gave his work on the window for free , while the production costs totaling 370,000 euros -lrb- $ 506,000 -rrb- were covered by private donations .
the 75-year-old artist , who has a reputation for being a man of few words , seemed to be happy with his work and said he was proud " it had n't gone wrong . "
richter said it had been a little bit " nerve-wracking " to create a work that , unlike a picture , could not simply be taken down again .
the original window was destroyed in world war ii and replaced in the 1950s by a nearly transparent piece of glass .
cologne cathedral , which is one of germany 's most famous landmarks , dates back to the 13th century and was added to the world heritage list by unesco in 1996 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 27.08.2007 experts say new alert system needed in eu child searches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madeleine mccann 's parents have spread the word with their own media campaign the eu has a lot of experience in dealing with cross-border problems .
so it should come as no surprise that its efforts to solve child abduction cases should focus on cooperation and standardized search procedures . there have probably been as many column inches written about the efforts of kate and gerry mccann to find their missing daughter madeleine as the investigation into the alleged abduction itself .
the campaign by the missing four-year-old 's family and friends to keep maddy 's face in the media has drawn both praise and criticism since it swung into action in the days after her disappearance from the mccanns ' apartment at the praia da luz resort in portugal on may 3 .
whether one admires or criticizes the mccanns ' use of the media in the search for their daughter , one thing can not be ignored : the media strategy has resulted in an unprecedented level of coverage regarding a child 's abduction .
but should a family have to create its own rolling news channel to keep the world informed of the efforts to find a missing child ?
could the creation of the " find madeleine " campaign also be a reaction to inadequate international search procedures ?
incompatibilities obvious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerry and kate mccann gave the public vital information one of the most debated aspects of the mccann investigation has been the extensive criticism of the portuguese police .
critics of the policia judiciaria have highlighted the differences between portuguese methods and those employed in the search for a child in madeleine 's native britain and other eu countries .
in particular , the police have been accused of failing to distribute information for hours after maddy vanished , for delays in passing a description to border or marine police and for refusing offers of help from international experts for almost three months .
the portuguese have defended themselves by saying that under article 86 of the country 's penal code information must not be released , apart from in exceptional circumstances , while the criminal investigation is still taking place .
while similar types of secrecy laws regarding ongoing police investigations exist in most european countries , information covered by these laws tends to apply to evidence and situations that need to be kept under wraps in the search for a suspect .
few prevent the broadcast or distribution of information regarding a missing child .
eu-wide alert system ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police cooperation across the eu is improving slowly the mccann case has raised new calls for a europe-wide response procedure in the case of abducted children .
while the european commission is already trying to increase cooperation in cross-border investigations , there are currently no plans to standardize the response in the case of a missing child .
" we have been told that there are no plans at the moment for an eu-wide alert system , " said carolyn bouchard from independent child protection agency safehands .
" the level of police cooperation is slowly improving and most current systems work well on a national level , but we continue to push for an efficient network across the continent . "
delphine moralis , the acting secretary general for the european federation for missing and sexually exploited children , was more specific .
" based on the experience of its members -lrb- 21 non-governmental organizations in 14 eu countries -rrb- when dealing with missing children cases across the eu , missing children europe advocates the need to develop alert support systems for cases of child abductions or life threatening disappearances of children in countries where no system exists , " she said .
" we also recommend the development of co-ordination procedures and interconnection schemes between existing systems , such as the ones in belgium , france , germany , greece and the uk . "
the closest thing europe currently has to a standardized response is the amber alert , a procedure imported from the united states , although not all countries in the eu use it .
amber alerts a tried and tested response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public is a vaulable resource in any abduction case amber alerts are issued by police when four main criteria of a child abduction case are satisfied : when a child under 16 goes missing ; when the child is believed kidnapped , when a senior police officer fears that death or serious harm may come about , and when the case has sufficient descriptive details , such as photographs of the child or suspected abductor .
the alerts are then broadcast to the public via radio and television stations , immediately interrupting scheduled broadcasting to report the missing child .
the alerts are also shown on electronic motorway signs and sent to email accounts , mobile phones and wireless devices of registered search volunteers .
" a coordinated amber alert system in europe would be hugely beneficial because one of the most critical parts of an abduction investigation is informing the public , " said robert hoever , from the us national center for missing and exploited children -lrb- ncmec -rrb- .
" it would require each country to have a designated amber facilitator and for all the facilitators to meet and plan together a memorandum of understanding as to how they would work together . "
cross-border structures needed for success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations must cross borders seemlessly to succeed hoever believes that having a similar system and a coordinator in every eu member state would greatly improve cross-border child abduction investigations in the bloc .
" contact person ' a ' would be responsible for putting the alert out in his or her own country and if information suggested the child had crossed the border , then ' a ' calls ' b ' and the same system kicks in , " he said .
however , according to hoever , bringing in a standardized amber alert-type system in europe would only work if other investigative strategies were already in place .
" before you have a standardized alert system , you have to address the cross-border problems .
you ca n't try and solve differences in police procedure during a case ; you waste time and endanger the child further .
these strategies between countries should be in place first . "
delphine moralis agreed .
" any system developed at eu level will have to start by looking at what already exists at the national level , " she said . " many questions remain to be analyzed , both regarding the procedures and regarding technical implementation of a system . "
a painful lesson so did the inadequacy of existing structures hinder the search for madeleine mccann in the first hours of her disappearance ?
" in portugal , missing children europe has an ngo member called instituto de apoio à criança i.a.c. , lisbon , which launched a hotline for missing children on may 25 , 2004 , " moralis said . " however , due to a lack of financial means and political support , no fully developed ' child alert ' or ' amber alert system ' has been launched in portugal yet . "
she said a good communication and coordination among existing systems as well as child search programs in countries which do n't currently have them could well have made a difference in the case of madeleine mccann . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the level of police cooperation is slowly improving and most current systems work well on a national level , but we continue to push for an efficient network across the continent . "
delphine moralis , the acting secretary general for the european federation for missing and sexually exploited children , was more specific .
" based on the experience of its members -lrb- 21 non-governmental organizations in 14 eu countries -rrb- when dealing with missing children cases across the eu , missing children europe advocates the need to develop alert support systems for cases of child abductions or life threatening disappearances of children in countries where no system exists , " she said .
" we also recommend the development of co-ordination procedures and interconnection schemes between existing systems , such as the ones in belgium , france , germany , greece and the uk . "
the closest thing europe currently has to a standardized response is the amber alert , a procedure imported from the united states , although not all countries in the eu use it .
amber alerts a tried and tested response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public is a vaulable resource in any abduction case amber alerts are issued by police when four main criteria of a child abduction case are satisfied : when a child under 16 goes missing ; when the child is believed kidnapped , when a senior police officer fears that death or serious harm may come about , and when the case has sufficient descriptive details , such as photographs of the child or suspected abductor .
the alerts are then broadcast to the public via radio and television stations , immediately interrupting scheduled broadcasting to report the missing child .
the alerts are also shown on electronic motorway signs and sent to email accounts , mobile phones and wireless devices of registered search volunteers .
" a coordinated amber alert system in europe would be hugely beneficial because one of the most critical parts of an abduction investigation is informing the public , " said robert hoever , from the us national center for missing and exploited children -lrb- ncmec -rrb- .
" it would require each country to have a designated amber facilitator and for all the facilitators to meet and plan together a memorandum of understanding as to how they would work together . "
cross-border structures needed for success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations must cross borders seemlessly to succeed hoever believes that having a similar system and a coordinator in every eu member state would greatly improve cross-border child abduction investigations in the bloc .
" contact person ' a ' would be responsible for putting the alert out in his or her own country and if information suggested the child had crossed the border , then ' a ' calls ' b ' and the same system kicks in , " he said .
however , according to hoever , bringing in a standardized amber alert-type system in europe would only work if other investigative strategies were already in place .
" before you have a standardized alert system , you have to address the cross-border problems .
you ca n't try and solve differences in police procedure during a case ; you waste time and endanger the child further .
these strategies between countries should be in place first . "
delphine moralis agreed .
" any system developed at eu level will have to start by looking at what already exists at the national level , " she said . " many questions remain to be analyzed , both regarding the procedures and regarding technical implementation of a system . "
a painful lesson so did the inadequacy of existing structures hinder the search for madeleine mccann in the first hours of her disappearance ?
" in portugal , missing children europe has an ngo member called instituto de apoio à criança i.a.c. , lisbon , which launched a hotline for missing children on may 25 , 2004 , " moralis said . " however , due to a lack of financial means and political support , no fully developed ' child alert ' or ' amber alert system ' has been launched in portugal yet . "
she said a good communication and coordination among existing systems as well as child search programs in countries which do n't currently have them could well have made a difference in the case of madeleine mccann . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as german politicians are reconsidering a ban of the ultra-right npd party after recent xenophobic attacks . fourteen percent of the women canvassed said they would not rule out giving their ballot to a party to the right of the conservative christian democratic union or its bavarian sister party , the csu , at the next state parliamentary elections .
nine percent of men , in comparison , said they would do the same in the emnid survey commissioned by the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
emnid head , klaus-peter schöppner , called the results " surprising . " " women do n't usually lean towards the rightwing spectrum so strongly , " he told the newspaper .
right shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dissatisfaction with family policy may be the reason for the poll results schöppner said conservative women voters with traditional family views were possibly disappointed by the conservatives ' modern family politics . " some have stopped voting , " he said .
" others have turned towards parties of the far-right . "
in addition to the discrepancy between men and women in their voting patterns , the survey also showed a split between eastern and western germany .
eleven percent of western germans canvassed by emnid said they would vote for far-right parties , in comparison to 15 percent in eastern germany .
germany has recently seen a spate of racist violence that has prompted renewed calls to ban the far-right npd party .
racist surge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gorvinda singh was one of the indians injured in the recent attack in mügeln in the latest incident this weekend , a 36-year-old iraqi was attacked with a baseball bat while waiting for a tram in the eastern german city of magdeburg .

while the city 's mayor has hailed the work as an " enrichment , " the archbishop reportedly never wanted it . the new window is made up of 11,200 squares and has been installed on the sunny , south-facing side of the gothic cathedral .

citing a close confidante of meisner 's , the stadt-anzeiger wrote that the archbishop even tried to stop the project , resulting in serious disputes within the committee responsible for deciding over the window .
" the cardinal did not want this window , " said the source . the archbishop , who is not opposed to modern art per se , reportedly wanted to have a figurative work , for example with representations of saints or 20th century martyrs , rather than an abstract one .

a spokesman for the stuttgart-based bank told afp that the sale price would be fixed at the end of the year after lbbw had carried out a more detailed evaluation of the leipzig-based bank .
he said lbbw had also given the bank a 250 million euro -lrb- $ 342 million -rrb- cash injection as " an immediate measure . "
saxony state premier georg milbradt said current turbulence in the capital markets meant that it was impossible for the bank to continue without a partner .
knock-on effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us mortgage crisis has sent stock markets tumbling worldwide news of sachsenlb 's troubles emerged a week ago , when it admitted receiving a financial lifeline of 17.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.7 billion -rrb- from a consortium of other banks in the wake of the us home loans turmoil that sent world markets diving .
but german newspapers reported on friday that this had failed to stem sachsenlb 's liquidity problems caused by its inability to cover the debts of ormond quay , an investment fund under the management of its dublin-based unit .
normalize operations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxony 's state premier says the sale will place operations back on a normal footing milbradt told mdr radio on sunday that the sale of the bank to lbbw would put operations at the bank back on an even keel .
" we promise that the support of baden-württemberg will restore calm , " he said .
" things could be back to normal on monday .
baden-württemberg is not leaping into a black hole with this purchase . "
he said the lowest price his government was prepared to accept for sachsenlb was 300 million euros .
the leipzig-based financial institution is the second german bank that has had to be bailed out after exposure to credit markets caught in the us sub-prime housing market crisis .
the ikb bank - a relatively small financial institution that lends to medium-sized businesses - was subject to a 3.5 billion-euro rescue operation last month by the state-owned kfw - a bank set up immediately after world war ii to finance germany 's reconstruction . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's hosts said they would investigate . merkel said that china needed " to respect the rules of the game , " after talks in beijing touched upon controversial issues such as piracy and unsafe chinese exports . " in our talks , i made clear that every country has the right to development , " merkel told journalists in a joint press conference after the one-hour meeting with the chinese premier wen jiabao .
" but at present there are a great many large countries such as china that are developing fast and there is a need to respect the rules of the game . " the label " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months , especially in the aftermath of a recent recall of 18 million chinese-made products by us toy giant mattel because of safety concerns . an opportunity , not a threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen : " there is no such thing as the ' china threat theory . " '
critics of china have also voiced concerns in recent years that the country 's economic rise could potentially be seen as a threat to the rest of the world , especially in view of china 's deplorable human rights record . " china 's development is an opportunity , not a threat , " wen said .
" we have decades of work ahead before we can be even a moderately well-developed country . " the chinese premier stressed that his country was still struggling with issues such as poverty and population growth , but added that chinese intentions were not sinister . " china will always take the peaceful road , " he said .
" china is very happy to cooperate with all nations but will never threaten ... so it 's clear , everyone please be at ease , there is no such thing as the ' china threat theory . " ' hi-tech espionage ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were german government computers compromised by hackers from china ?
merkel 's talks with the chinese premier came only two days after the german news magazine der spiegel reported that chinese hackers had broken into the government computer network in berlin . according to the magazine , spy programs - which investigations showed could be tracked to the chinese people 's liberation army - were uncovered at merkel 's office , the foreign ministry and other government institutions . " we in the government took -lrb- the reports -rrb- as a matter of grave concern , " wen said . " hackers breaking into and sabotaging computers is a problem faced by the entire world . " the chinese premier emphasized that fighting hacking must be a joint effort and that china will cooperate with germany on this issue . " we are willing to maintain cooperation with the german government and take firm and effective action to prevent all hacking acts that threaten computer systems , " he said . climate goals wen promised china would undertake greater efforts to prevent global warming in its next environmental five-year plan starting in 2011 , but stressed that china 's responsibilities regarding carbon-dioxide emissions were not the same as those of long-time industrialized nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and china are important trade partners even if they do n't see eye-to-eye on human rights " it will be extremely difficult to reach these targets , but we have already shown our determination , " wen said .
" we have a much tougher task than germany does . " china has long maintained that wealthy nations - those that have already benefited from emissions-producing industrial booms - are the ones who should take the lead in cutting greenhouse-gas emissions . " china has taken part of the responsibility for climate change for only 30 years while industrial countries have grown fast for the last 200 years , " he said . merkel , who made climate change a key focus of germany 's presidency over the g8 group of leading industrialized nations , emphasized that all countries needed to work on energy efficiency . " developed countries should help by providing the latest technology , " she said . china has set goals to reduce its energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2011 , but its consumption fell by only 1.23 percent last year .
it also failed to meet its targeted 2-percent reduction in emissions of major water and air pollutants last year , recording instead toxic levels rising by almost 2 percent . merkel also met with chinese president hu jintao later on monday .
she will head for japan on wednesday , where she will also address climate change and economic issues . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's hosts said they would investigate . merkel said that china needed " to respect the rules of the game , " after talks in beijing touched upon controversial issues such as piracy and unsafe chinese exports . " in our talks , i made clear that every country has the right to development , " merkel told journalists in a joint press conference after the one-hour meeting with the chinese premier wen jiabao .
" but at present there are a great many large countries such as china that are developing fast and there is a need to respect the rules of the game . " the label " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months , especially in the aftermath of a recent recall of 18 million chinese-made products by us toy giant mattel because of safety concerns . an opportunity , not a threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen : " there is no such thing as the ' china threat theory . " '
critics of china have also voiced concerns in recent years that the country 's economic rise could potentially be seen as a threat to the rest of the world , especially in view of china 's deplorable human rights record . " china 's development is an opportunity , not a threat , " wen said .
" we have decades of work ahead before we can be even a moderately well-developed country . " the chinese premier stressed that his country was still struggling with issues such as poverty and population growth , but added that chinese intentions were not sinister . " china will always take the peaceful road , " he said .
" china is very happy to cooperate with all nations but will never threaten ... so it 's clear , everyone please be at ease , there is no such thing as the ' china threat theory . " ' hi-tech espionage ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were german government computers compromised by hackers from china ?
merkel 's talks with the chinese premier came only two days after the german news magazine der spiegel reported that chinese hackers had broken into the government computer network in berlin . according to the magazine , spy programs - which investigations showed could be tracked to the chinese people 's liberation army - were uncovered at merkel 's office , the foreign ministry and other government institutions . " we in the government took -lrb- the reports -rrb- as a matter of grave concern , " wen said . " hackers breaking into and sabotaging computers is a problem faced by the entire world . " the chinese premier emphasized that fighting hacking must be a joint effort and that china will cooperate with germany on this issue . " we are willing to maintain cooperation with the german government and take firm and effective action to prevent all hacking acts that threaten computer systems , " he said . climate goals wen promised china would undertake greater efforts to prevent global warming in its next environmental five-year plan starting in 2011 , but stressed that china 's responsibilities regarding carbon-dioxide emissions were not the same as those of long-time industrialized nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and china are important trade partners even if they do n't see eye-to-eye on human rights " it will be extremely difficult to reach these targets , but we have already shown our determination , " wen said .
" we have a much tougher task than germany does . " china has long maintained that wealthy nations - those that have already benefited from emissions-producing industrial booms - are the ones who should take the lead in cutting greenhouse-gas emissions . " china has taken part of the responsibility for climate change for only 30 years while industrial countries have grown fast for the last 200 years , " he said . merkel , who made climate change a key focus of germany 's presidency over the g8 group of leading industrialized nations , emphasized that all countries needed to work on energy efficiency . " developed countries should help by providing the latest technology , " she said . china has set goals to reduce its energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2011 , but its consumption fell by only 1.23 percent last year .
it also failed to meet its targeted 2-percent reduction in emissions of major water and air pollutants last year , recording instead toxic levels rising by almost 2 percent . merkel also met with chinese president hu jintao later on monday .
she will head for japan on wednesday , where she will also address climate change and economic issues . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 27.08.2007 experts say new alert system needed in eu child searches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madeleine mccann 's parents have spread the word with their own media campaign the eu has a lot of experience in dealing with cross-border problems .
so it should come as no surprise that its efforts to solve child abduction cases should focus on cooperation and standardized search procedures . there have probably been as many column inches written about the efforts of kate and gerry mccann to find their missing daughter madeleine as the investigation into the alleged abduction itself .
the campaign by the missing four-year-old 's family and friends to keep maddy 's face in the media has drawn both praise and criticism since it swung into action in the days after her disappearance from the mccanns ' apartment at the praia da luz resort in portugal on may 3 .
whether one admires or criticizes the mccanns ' use of the media in the search for their daughter , one thing can not be ignored : the media strategy has resulted in an unprecedented level of coverage regarding a child 's abduction .
but should a family have to create its own rolling news channel to keep the world informed of the efforts to find a missing child ?
could the creation of the " find madeleine " campaign also be a reaction to inadequate international search procedures ?
incompatibilities obvious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerry and kate mccann gave the public vital information one of the most debated aspects of the mccann investigation has been the extensive criticism of the portuguese police .
critics of the policia judiciaria have highlighted the differences between portuguese methods and those employed in the search for a child in madeleine 's native britain and other eu countries .
in particular , the police have been accused of failing to distribute information for hours after maddy vanished , for delays in passing a description to border or marine police and for refusing offers of help from international experts for almost three months .
the portuguese have defended themselves by saying that under article 86 of the country 's penal code information must not be released , apart from in exceptional circumstances , while the criminal investigation is still taking place .
while similar types of secrecy laws regarding ongoing police investigations exist in most european countries , information covered by these laws tends to apply to evidence and situations that need to be kept under wraps in the search for a suspect .
few prevent the broadcast or distribution of information regarding a missing child .
eu-wide alert system ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police cooperation across the eu is improving slowly the mccann case has raised new calls for a europe-wide response procedure in the case of abducted children .
while the european commission is already trying to increase cooperation in cross-border investigations , there are currently no plans to standardize the response in the case of a missing child .
" we have been told that there are no plans at the moment for an eu-wide alert system , " said carolyn bouchard from independent child protection agency safehands .
" the level of police cooperation is slowly improving and most current systems work well on a national level , but we continue to push for an efficient network across the continent . "
delphine moralis , the acting secretary general for the european federation for missing and sexually exploited children , was more specific .
" based on the experience of its members -lrb- 21 non-governmental organizations in 14 eu countries -rrb- when dealing with missing children cases across the eu , missing children europe advocates the need to develop alert support systems for cases of child abductions or life threatening disappearances of children in countries where no system exists , " she said .
" we also recommend the development of co-ordination procedures and interconnection schemes between existing systems , such as the ones in belgium , france , germany , greece and the uk . "
the closest thing europe currently has to a standardized response is the amber alert , a procedure imported from the united states , although not all countries in the eu use it .
amber alerts a tried and tested response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public is a vaulable resource in any abduction case amber alerts are issued by police when four main criteria of a child abduction case are satisfied : when a child under 16 goes missing ; when the child is believed kidnapped , when a senior police officer fears that death or serious harm may come about , and when the case has sufficient descriptive details , such as photographs of the child or suspected abductor .
the alerts are then broadcast to the public via radio and television stations , immediately interrupting scheduled broadcasting to report the missing child .
the alerts are also shown on electronic motorway signs and sent to email accounts , mobile phones and wireless devices of registered search volunteers .
" a coordinated amber alert system in europe would be hugely beneficial because one of the most critical parts of an abduction investigation is informing the public , " said robert hoever , from the us national center for missing and exploited children -lrb- ncmec -rrb- .
" it would require each country to have a designated amber facilitator and for all the facilitators to meet and plan together a memorandum of understanding as to how they would work together . "
cross-border structures needed for success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations must cross borders seemlessly to succeed hoever believes that having a similar system and a coordinator in every eu member state would greatly improve cross-border child abduction investigations in the bloc .
" contact person ' a ' would be responsible for putting the alert out in his or her own country and if information suggested the child had crossed the border , then ' a ' calls ' b ' and the same system kicks in , " he said .
however , according to hoever , bringing in a standardized amber alert-type system in europe would only work if other investigative strategies were already in place .
" before you have a standardized alert system , you have to address the cross-border problems .
you ca n't try and solve differences in police procedure during a case ; you waste time and endanger the child further .
these strategies between countries should be in place first . "
delphine moralis agreed .
" any system developed at eu level will have to start by looking at what already exists at the national level , " she said . " many questions remain to be analyzed , both regarding the procedures and regarding technical implementation of a system . "
a painful lesson so did the inadequacy of existing structures hinder the search for madeleine mccann in the first hours of her disappearance ?
" in portugal , missing children europe has an ngo member called instituto de apoio à criança i.a.c. , lisbon , which launched a hotline for missing children on may 25 , 2004 , " moralis said . " however , due to a lack of financial means and political support , no fully developed ' child alert ' or ' amber alert system ' has been launched in portugal yet . "
she said a good communication and coordination among existing systems as well as child search programs in countries which do n't currently have them could well have made a difference in the case of madeleine mccann . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we shall continue our dialogue on the themes we have had in the past year , " store told norwegian news agency ntb .
the two foreign ministers had earlier met in berlin and at melkoya near hammerfest , northern norway where norwegian energy giant statoil is building a production facility for liquefied natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- from the snohvit gas field .
energy meeting with " responsible " partner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier visited norway with german business leaders the first stop on steinmeier 's visit is the city of tromso , known as the gateway to the arctic where the ministers attended a seminar on energy .
steinmeier was accompanied by several top german business executives from firms including siemens , eon ruhrgas , rwe , and wintershall .
oslo aimed to present itself as a " responsible " partner and steward of oil and gas reserves , store said according to ntb .
norway is germany 's second biggest energy supplier after russia , accounting for 27 per cent of its natural gas needs and 20 per cent of its oil requirements .
from tromso , the german minister flies to the norwegian polar island of spitzbergen on tuesday for a firsthand look at the effects of climate change .
inspection of damaged polar ice cap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers say glaciers are melting at an alarming rate " today , you can see from satellite images how cracks are developing in the polar ice cap from spitzbergen to the north pole , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said earlier .
steinmeier will also be inspecting international projects to protect the environment and offset the impact of climate change .
earlier this month german chancellor angela merkel , a former environment minister , visited greenland to see for herself how global warming was affecting the semiautonomous danish territory 's artic landscape .
from norway , steinmeier flies to the us state of california on wednesday where he will meet governor arnold schwarzenegger .
one of the topics of their talks will be to explore ways to combine the european union 's carbon trading scheme to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with those in operation in the united states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 27.08.2007 experts say new alert system needed in eu child searches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madeleine mccann 's parents have spread the word with their own media campaign the eu has a lot of experience in dealing with cross-border problems .
so it should come as no surprise that its efforts to solve child abduction cases should focus on cooperation and standardized search procedures . there have probably been as many column inches written about the efforts of kate and gerry mccann to find their missing daughter madeleine as the investigation into the alleged abduction itself .
the campaign by the missing four-year-old 's family and friends to keep maddy 's face in the media has drawn both praise and criticism since it swung into action in the days after her disappearance from the mccanns ' apartment at the praia da luz resort in portugal on may 3 .
whether one admires or criticizes the mccanns ' use of the media in the search for their daughter , one thing can not be ignored : the media strategy has resulted in an unprecedented level of coverage regarding a child 's abduction .
but should a family have to create its own rolling news channel to keep the world informed of the efforts to find a missing child ?
could the creation of the " find madeleine " campaign also be a reaction to inadequate international search procedures ?
incompatibilities obvious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerry and kate mccann gave the public vital information one of the most debated aspects of the mccann investigation has been the extensive criticism of the portuguese police .
critics of the policia judiciaria have highlighted the differences between portuguese methods and those employed in the search for a child in madeleine 's native britain and other eu countries .
in particular , the police have been accused of failing to distribute information for hours after maddy vanished , for delays in passing a description to border or marine police and for refusing offers of help from international experts for almost three months .
the portuguese have defended themselves by saying that under article 86 of the country 's penal code information must not be released , apart from in exceptional circumstances , while the criminal investigation is still taking place .
while similar types of secrecy laws regarding ongoing police investigations exist in most european countries , information covered by these laws tends to apply to evidence and situations that need to be kept under wraps in the search for a suspect .
few prevent the broadcast or distribution of information regarding a missing child .
eu-wide alert system ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police cooperation across the eu is improving slowly the mccann case has raised new calls for a europe-wide response procedure in the case of abducted children .
while the european commission is already trying to increase cooperation in cross-border investigations , there are currently no plans to standardize the response in the case of a missing child .
" we have been told that there are no plans at the moment for an eu-wide alert system , " said carolyn bouchard from independent child protection agency safehands .
" the level of police cooperation is slowly improving and most current systems work well on a national level , but we continue to push for an efficient network across the continent . "
delphine moralis , the acting secretary general for the european federation for missing and sexually exploited children , was more specific .
" based on the experience of its members -lrb- 21 non-governmental organizations in 14 eu countries -rrb- when dealing with missing children cases across the eu , missing children europe advocates the need to develop alert support systems for cases of child abductions or life threatening disappearances of children in countries where no system exists , " she said .
" we also recommend the development of co-ordination procedures and interconnection schemes between existing systems , such as the ones in belgium , france , germany , greece and the uk . "
the closest thing europe currently has to a standardized response is the amber alert , a procedure imported from the united states , although not all countries in the eu use it .
amber alerts a tried and tested response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public is a vaulable resource in any abduction case amber alerts are issued by police when four main criteria of a child abduction case are satisfied : when a child under 16 goes missing ; when the child is believed kidnapped , when a senior police officer fears that death or serious harm may come about , and when the case has sufficient descriptive details , such as photographs of the child or suspected abductor .
the alerts are then broadcast to the public via radio and television stations , immediately interrupting scheduled broadcasting to report the missing child .
the alerts are also shown on electronic motorway signs and sent to email accounts , mobile phones and wireless devices of registered search volunteers .
" a coordinated amber alert system in europe would be hugely beneficial because one of the most critical parts of an abduction investigation is informing the public , " said robert hoever , from the us national center for missing and exploited children -lrb- ncmec -rrb- .
" it would require each country to have a designated amber facilitator and for all the facilitators to meet and plan together a memorandum of understanding as to how they would work together . "
cross-border structures needed for success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations must cross borders seemlessly to succeed hoever believes that having a similar system and a coordinator in every eu member state would greatly improve cross-border child abduction investigations in the bloc .
" contact person ' a ' would be responsible for putting the alert out in his or her own country and if information suggested the child had crossed the border , then ' a ' calls ' b ' and the same system kicks in , " he said .
however , according to hoever , bringing in a standardized amber alert-type system in europe would only work if other investigative strategies were already in place .
" before you have a standardized alert system , you have to address the cross-border problems .
you ca n't try and solve differences in police procedure during a case ; you waste time and endanger the child further .
these strategies between countries should be in place first . "
delphine moralis agreed .
" any system developed at eu level will have to start by looking at what already exists at the national level , " she said . " many questions remain to be analyzed , both regarding the procedures and regarding technical implementation of a system . "
a painful lesson so did the inadequacy of existing structures hinder the search for madeleine mccann in the first hours of her disappearance ?
" in portugal , missing children europe has an ngo member called instituto de apoio à criança i.a.c. , lisbon , which launched a hotline for missing children on may 25 , 2004 , " moralis said . " however , due to a lack of financial means and political support , no fully developed ' child alert ' or ' amber alert system ' has been launched in portugal yet . "
she said a good communication and coordination among existing systems as well as child search programs in countries which do n't currently have them could well have made a difference in the case of madeleine mccann . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 27.08.2007 experts say new alert system needed in eu child searches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madeleine mccann 's parents have spread the word with their own media campaign the eu has a lot of experience in dealing with cross-border problems .
so it should come as no surprise that its efforts to solve child abduction cases should focus on cooperation and standardized search procedures . there have probably been as many column inches written about the efforts of kate and gerry mccann to find their missing daughter madeleine as the investigation into the alleged abduction itself .
the campaign by the missing four-year-old 's family and friends to keep maddy 's face in the media has drawn both praise and criticism since it swung into action in the days after her disappearance from the mccanns ' apartment at the praia da luz resort in portugal on may 3 .
whether one admires or criticizes the mccanns ' use of the media in the search for their daughter , one thing can not be ignored : the media strategy has resulted in an unprecedented level of coverage regarding a child 's abduction .
but should a family have to create its own rolling news channel to keep the world informed of the efforts to find a missing child ?
could the creation of the " find madeleine " campaign also be a reaction to inadequate international search procedures ?
incompatibilities obvious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerry and kate mccann gave the public vital information one of the most debated aspects of the mccann investigation has been the extensive criticism of the portuguese police .
critics of the policia judiciaria have highlighted the differences between portuguese methods and those employed in the search for a child in madeleine 's native britain and other eu countries .
in particular , the police have been accused of failing to distribute information for hours after maddy vanished , for delays in passing a description to border or marine police and for refusing offers of help from international experts for almost three months .
the portuguese have defended themselves by saying that under article 86 of the country 's penal code information must not be released , apart from in exceptional circumstances , while the criminal investigation is still taking place .
while similar types of secrecy laws regarding ongoing police investigations exist in most european countries , information covered by these laws tends to apply to evidence and situations that need to be kept under wraps in the search for a suspect .
few prevent the broadcast or distribution of information regarding a missing child .
eu-wide alert system ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police cooperation across the eu is improving slowly the mccann case has raised new calls for a europe-wide response procedure in the case of abducted children .
while the european commission is already trying to increase cooperation in cross-border investigations , there are currently no plans to standardize the response in the case of a missing child .
" we have been told that there are no plans at the moment for an eu-wide alert system , " said carolyn bouchard from independent child protection agency safehands .
" the level of police cooperation is slowly improving and most current systems work well on a national level , but we continue to push for an efficient network across the continent . "
delphine moralis , the acting secretary general for the european federation for missing and sexually exploited children , was more specific .
" based on the experience of its members -lrb- 21 non-governmental organizations in 14 eu countries -rrb- when dealing with missing children cases across the eu , missing children europe advocates the need to develop alert support systems for cases of child abductions or life threatening disappearances of children in countries where no system exists , " she said .
" we also recommend the development of co-ordination procedures and interconnection schemes between existing systems , such as the ones in belgium , france , germany , greece and the uk . "
the closest thing europe currently has to a standardized response is the amber alert , a procedure imported from the united states , although not all countries in the eu use it .
amber alerts a tried and tested response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public is a vaulable resource in any abduction case amber alerts are issued by police when four main criteria of a child abduction case are satisfied : when a child under 16 goes missing ; when the child is believed kidnapped , when a senior police officer fears that death or serious harm may come about , and when the case has sufficient descriptive details , such as photographs of the child or suspected abductor .
the alerts are then broadcast to the public via radio and television stations , immediately interrupting scheduled broadcasting to report the missing child .
the alerts are also shown on electronic motorway signs and sent to email accounts , mobile phones and wireless devices of registered search volunteers .
" a coordinated amber alert system in europe would be hugely beneficial because one of the most critical parts of an abduction investigation is informing the public , " said robert hoever , from the us national center for missing and exploited children -lrb- ncmec -rrb- .
" it would require each country to have a designated amber facilitator and for all the facilitators to meet and plan together a memorandum of understanding as to how they would work together . "
cross-border structures needed for success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations must cross borders seemlessly to succeed hoever believes that having a similar system and a coordinator in every eu member state would greatly improve cross-border child abduction investigations in the bloc .
" contact person ' a ' would be responsible for putting the alert out in his or her own country and if information suggested the child had crossed the border , then ' a ' calls ' b ' and the same system kicks in , " he said .
however , according to hoever , bringing in a standardized amber alert-type system in europe would only work if other investigative strategies were already in place .

" in our talks , i made clear that every country has the right to development , " merkel told journalists in a joint press conference after the one-hour meeting with the chinese premier wen jiabao .
" but at present there are a great many large countries such as china that are developing fast and there is a need to respect the rules of the game . " the label " made in china " has suffered enormous image damage in recent months , especially in the aftermath of a recent recall of 18 million chinese-made products by us toy giant mattel because of safety concerns . an opportunity , not a threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen : " there is no such thing as the ' china threat theory .

" we have decades of work ahead before we can be even a moderately well-developed country .

merkel 's talks with the chinese premier came only two days after the german news magazine der spiegel reported that chinese hackers had broken into the government computer network in berlin . according to the magazine , spy programs - which investigations showed could be tracked to the chinese people 's liberation army - were uncovered at merkel 's office , the foreign ministry and other government institutions . " we in the government took -lrb- the reports -rrb- as a matter of grave concern , " wen said . " hackers breaking into and sabotaging computers is a problem faced by the entire world .

" china has taken part of the responsibility for climate change for only 30 years while industrial countries have grown fast for the last 200 years , " he said . merkel , who made climate change a key focus of germany 's presidency over the g8 group of leading industrialized nations , emphasized that all countries needed to work on energy efficiency . " developed countries should help by providing the latest technology , " she said . china has set goals to reduce its energy consumption by 20 percent by the year 2011 , but its consumption fell by only 1.23 percent last year .
it also failed to meet its targeted 2-percent reduction in emissions of major water and air pollutants last year , recording instead toxic levels rising by almost 2 percent . merkel also met with chinese president hu jintao later on monday .

while the city 's mayor has hailed the work as an " enrichment , " the archbishop reportedly never wanted it . the new window is made up of 11,200 squares and has been installed on the sunny , south-facing side of the gothic cathedral .
more than 1,000 visitors came to witness the event .
eagerly craning their necks upwards to view the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184 square-foot -rrb- artwork , the majority seemed entranced by the kaleidoscope of colors .
" the cathedral has been enriched and so has the city , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said after the unveiling .
top opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the inauguration ceremony , the window was described as producing a " symphony of light " but not everyone is apparently happy with the new design .
the online edition of the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper reported that none less than the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , opposed it .
citing a close confidante of meisner 's , the stadt-anzeiger wrote that the archbishop even tried to stop the project , resulting in serious disputes within the committee responsible for deciding over the window .
" the cardinal did not want this window , " said the source . the archbishop , who is not opposed to modern art per se , reportedly wanted to have a figurative work , for example with representations of saints or 20th century martyrs , rather than an abstract one .
cathedral provost norbert feldhoff said the reason for meisner 's absence at the unveiling ceremony was " purely technical " and was linked to a clash with a previously planned trip to poland .

the 75-year-old artist , who has a reputation for being a man of few words , seemed to be happy with his work and said he was proud " it had n't gone wrong . "

while the city 's mayor has hailed the work as an " enrichment , " the archbishop reportedly never wanted it . the new window is made up of 11,200 squares and has been installed on the sunny , south-facing side of the gothic cathedral .
more than 1,000 visitors came to witness the event .
eagerly craning their necks upwards to view the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184 square-foot -rrb- artwork , the majority seemed entranced by the kaleidoscope of colors .
" the cathedral has been enriched and so has the city , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said after the unveiling .
top opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the inauguration ceremony , the window was described as producing a " symphony of light " but not everyone is apparently happy with the new design .
the online edition of the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper reported that none less than the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , opposed it .
citing a close confidante of meisner 's , the stadt-anzeiger wrote that the archbishop even tried to stop the project , resulting in serious disputes within the committee responsible for deciding over the window .
" the cardinal did not want this window , " said the source . the archbishop , who is not opposed to modern art per se , reportedly wanted to have a figurative work , for example with representations of saints or 20th century martyrs , rather than an abstract one .
cathedral provost norbert feldhoff said the reason for meisner 's absence at the unveiling ceremony was " purely technical " and was linked to a clash with a previously planned trip to poland .
artist 's gift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter was there to see his work unveiled gerhard richter , who lives in cologne , gave his work on the window for free , while the production costs totaling 370,000 euros -lrb- $ 506,000 -rrb- were covered by private donations .
the 75-year-old artist , who has a reputation for being a man of few words , seemed to be happy with his work and said he was proud " it had n't gone wrong . "
richter said it had been a little bit " nerve-wracking " to create a work that , unlike a picture , could not simply be taken down again .
the original window was destroyed in world war ii and replaced in the 1950s by a nearly transparent piece of glass .

until he took over the german national team , it was most likely to be on a beach in california .
these days , klinsi could be anywhere if you listen to soccer rumors . what a year it has been for jürgen klinsmann .
if one believes everything written about the former germany coach over the past 12 months it appears that klinsi has spent his sabbatical jet-setting around the globe , having high-profile interviews for every vacant managerial position in soccer - and turning every single one of the down .
after relinquishing the reins of the national squad after the 2006 world cup , klinsmann has been linked to coaching jobs with the national teams of the united states , australia and mexico and was touted as a successor to jose moriniho as manager of english premiership side chelsea before the current season began .
now it seems that klinsmann is either going to try his hand at owning a soccer club or add his enthusiastic momentum to the slow revolution of the game in his adopted homeland of the united states .
the latest klinsi rumors surfaced last week as his former international charges beat england in a friendly match in london and tottenham hotspur , his former league club in the english capital , was going through a highly premature coaching crisis .
just two days after a makeshift germany side triumphed 2-1 at wembley , klinsmann 's name was cropping up in relation to one of those who faced his compatriots on wednesday night .
klinsi allegedly in line for galaxy hot-seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham 's arrival has stressed his coach out david beckham , formerly a serious soccer player and now main attraction at la galaxy 's traveling circus , had just arrived back in the us after a grueling transatlantic round trip and could barely muster a limp in his side 's loss to local rivals chivas in the major soccer league western conference clash .
while most of the stateside stories asked whether becks could handle playing for the galaxy and helping england qualify for the 2008 european championships at the same time , others were inserting paragraphs about how galaxy coach frank yallop could n't handle managing the former real madrid and man united mega-star .
with the galaxy languishing second from bottom in the conference and way off the pace for the play-off places , yallop 's days look to be numbered .
and so , with a very high-profile manager 's seat on the verge of becoming vacant , klinsmann 's name was once again churned out by the rumor mill .
oc resident with great cv klinsmann , already a resident of the sunshine state , would not have to travel far to take over from yallop if he were to be forced out of the galaxy hot-seat .
but , true to form , the german has refused to say anything , neither denying nor confirming any involvement and stoking the fires of speculation further by keeping his own counsel .
however , klinsmann worked as a consultant for the galaxy in 2004 before taking over the germany team and with his orange county home just 20 minutes away from the team 's base , it appears as though the connections and infrastructure are already in place for klinsi 's return to coaching .
but as recent history has taught us , we 've been here before .
former spurs striker to return as coach ?
now , depending on which newspapers you 've been reading , klinsmann could be forsaking the chance to coach beckham and co. in the californian sunshine for either the chairman ’ s or manager ’ s job at premiership side tottenham .
four games in and the crazy world of english soccer is already talking about its first potential coaching casualty .
three defeats in four have seen the pressure heaped on incumbent coach martin jol and it appears the man who has taken tottenham to consecutive fifth-place finishes after years of mid-table mediocrity now has only three more matches to save his job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi would get a better car if he returned to spurs as coach if he is sacked by the end of september , some papers have klinsmann battling it out with sevilla coach juande ramos for the vacancy , should it happen .
ramos has an enviable record in spain but klinsmann , a talismanic striker for spurs during two spells with the club in the 90 's , remains a firm favorite with the fans .
other papers , however , paint klinsmann as the knight in shining armor riding into the boardroom at spurs to save both jol and the club from the apparent insanity which has settled over the current board .
again , the strings pulling this potential deal into shape stretch back to california .
a consortium of businessmen are reportedly lining up a financial package which would buy spurs outright and hand klinsmann either the coach ’ s job or a director of soccer position in which he has ultimate control of the playing side -lrb- again , depending on who you read -rrb- .
klinsmann , as you would expect , has not commented on this speculation either .

until he took over the german national team , it was most likely to be on a beach in california .
these days , klinsi could be anywhere if you listen to soccer rumors . what a year it has been for jürgen klinsmann .
if one believes everything written about the former germany coach over the past 12 months it appears that klinsi has spent his sabbatical jet-setting around the globe , having high-profile interviews for every vacant managerial position in soccer - and turning every single one of the down .
after relinquishing the reins of the national squad after the 2006 world cup , klinsmann has been linked to coaching jobs with the national teams of the united states , australia and mexico and was touted as a successor to jose moriniho as manager of english premiership side chelsea before the current season began .
now it seems that klinsmann is either going to try his hand at owning a soccer club or add his enthusiastic momentum to the slow revolution of the game in his adopted homeland of the united states .
the latest klinsi rumors surfaced last week as his former international charges beat england in a friendly match in london and tottenham hotspur , his former league club in the english capital , was going through a highly premature coaching crisis .

while most of the stateside stories asked whether becks could handle playing for the galaxy and helping england qualify for the 2008 european championships at the same time , others were inserting paragraphs about how galaxy coach frank yallop could n't handle managing the former real madrid and man united mega-star .
with the galaxy languishing second from bottom in the conference and way off the pace for the play-off places , yallop 's days look to be numbered .
and so , with a very high-profile manager 's seat on the verge of becoming vacant , klinsmann 's name was once again churned out by the rumor mill .
oc resident with great cv klinsmann , already a resident of the sunshine state , would not have to travel far to take over from yallop if he were to be forced out of the galaxy hot-seat .
but , true to form , the german has refused to say anything , neither denying nor confirming any involvement and stoking the fires of speculation further by keeping his own counsel .
however , klinsmann worked as a consultant for the galaxy in 2004 before taking over the germany team and with his orange county home just 20 minutes away from the team 's base , it appears as though the connections and infrastructure are already in place for klinsi 's return to coaching .

now , depending on which newspapers you 've been reading , klinsmann could be forsaking the chance to coach beckham and co. in the californian sunshine for either the chairman ’ s or manager ’ s job at premiership side tottenham .
four games in and the crazy world of english soccer is already talking about its first potential coaching casualty .
three defeats in four have seen the pressure heaped on incumbent coach martin jol and it appears the man who has taken tottenham to consecutive fifth-place finishes after years of mid-table mediocrity now has only three more matches to save his job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi would get a better car if he returned to spurs as coach if he is sacked by the end of september , some papers have klinsmann battling it out with sevilla coach juande ramos for the vacancy , should it happen .
ramos has an enviable record in spain but klinsmann , a talismanic striker for spurs during two spells with the club in the 90 's , remains a firm favorite with the fans .
other papers , however , paint klinsmann as the knight in shining armor riding into the boardroom at spurs to save both jol and the club from the apparent insanity which has settled over the current board .
again , the strings pulling this potential deal into shape stretch back to california .
a consortium of businessmen are reportedly lining up a financial package which would buy spurs outright and hand klinsmann either the coach ’ s job or a director of soccer position in which he has ultimate control of the playing side -lrb- again , depending on who you read -rrb- .
klinsmann , as you would expect , has not commented on this speculation either .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 27.08.2007 experts say new alert system needed in eu child searches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madeleine mccann 's parents have spread the word with their own media campaign the eu has a lot of experience in dealing with cross-border problems .
so it should come as no surprise that its efforts to solve child abduction cases should focus on cooperation and standardized search procedures . there have probably been as many column inches written about the efforts of kate and gerry mccann to find their missing daughter madeleine as the investigation into the alleged abduction itself .
the campaign by the missing four-year-old 's family and friends to keep maddy 's face in the media has drawn both praise and criticism since it swung into action in the days after her disappearance from the mccanns ' apartment at the praia da luz resort in portugal on may 3 .
whether one admires or criticizes the mccanns ' use of the media in the search for their daughter , one thing can not be ignored : the media strategy has resulted in an unprecedented level of coverage regarding a child 's abduction .
but should a family have to create its own rolling news channel to keep the world informed of the efforts to find a missing child ?
could the creation of the " find madeleine " campaign also be a reaction to inadequate international search procedures ?
incompatibilities obvious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerry and kate mccann gave the public vital information one of the most debated aspects of the mccann investigation has been the extensive criticism of the portuguese police .
critics of the policia judiciaria have highlighted the differences between portuguese methods and those employed in the search for a child in madeleine 's native britain and other eu countries .
in particular , the police have been accused of failing to distribute information for hours after maddy vanished , for delays in passing a description to border or marine police and for refusing offers of help from international experts for almost three months .
the portuguese have defended themselves by saying that under article 86 of the country 's penal code information must not be released , apart from in exceptional circumstances , while the criminal investigation is still taking place .
while similar types of secrecy laws regarding ongoing police investigations exist in most european countries , information covered by these laws tends to apply to evidence and situations that need to be kept under wraps in the search for a suspect .
few prevent the broadcast or distribution of information regarding a missing child .
eu-wide alert system ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police cooperation across the eu is improving slowly the mccann case has raised new calls for a europe-wide response procedure in the case of abducted children .
while the european commission is already trying to increase cooperation in cross-border investigations , there are currently no plans to standardize the response in the case of a missing child .
" we have been told that there are no plans at the moment for an eu-wide alert system , " said carolyn bouchard from independent child protection agency safehands .
" the level of police cooperation is slowly improving and most current systems work well on a national level , but we continue to push for an efficient network across the continent . "
delphine moralis , the acting secretary general for the european federation for missing and sexually exploited children , was more specific .
" based on the experience of its members -lrb- 21 non-governmental organizations in 14 eu countries -rrb- when dealing with missing children cases across the eu , missing children europe advocates the need to develop alert support systems for cases of child abductions or life threatening disappearances of children in countries where no system exists , " she said .
" we also recommend the development of co-ordination procedures and interconnection schemes between existing systems , such as the ones in belgium , france , germany , greece and the uk . "
the closest thing europe currently has to a standardized response is the amber alert , a procedure imported from the united states , although not all countries in the eu use it .
amber alerts a tried and tested response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public is a vaulable resource in any abduction case amber alerts are issued by police when four main criteria of a child abduction case are satisfied : when a child under 16 goes missing ; when the child is believed kidnapped , when a senior police officer fears that death or serious harm may come about , and when the case has sufficient descriptive details , such as photographs of the child or suspected abductor .
the alerts are then broadcast to the public via radio and television stations , immediately interrupting scheduled broadcasting to report the missing child .
the alerts are also shown on electronic motorway signs and sent to email accounts , mobile phones and wireless devices of registered search volunteers .
" a coordinated amber alert system in europe would be hugely beneficial because one of the most critical parts of an abduction investigation is informing the public , " said robert hoever , from the us national center for missing and exploited children -lrb- ncmec -rrb- .
" it would require each country to have a designated amber facilitator and for all the facilitators to meet and plan together a memorandum of understanding as to how they would work together . "
cross-border structures needed for success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations must cross borders seemlessly to succeed hoever believes that having a similar system and a coordinator in every eu member state would greatly improve cross-border child abduction investigations in the bloc .
" contact person ' a ' would be responsible for putting the alert out in his or her own country and if information suggested the child had crossed the border , then ' a ' calls ' b ' and the same system kicks in , " he said .
however , according to hoever , bringing in a standardized amber alert-type system in europe would only work if other investigative strategies were already in place .
" before you have a standardized alert system , you have to address the cross-border problems .
you ca n't try and solve differences in police procedure during a case ; you waste time and endanger the child further .
these strategies between countries should be in place first . "
delphine moralis agreed .
" any system developed at eu level will have to start by looking at what already exists at the national level , " she said . " many questions remain to be analyzed , both regarding the procedures and regarding technical implementation of a system . "
a painful lesson so did the inadequacy of existing structures hinder the search for madeleine mccann in the first hours of her disappearance ?
" in portugal , missing children europe has an ngo member called instituto de apoio à criança i.a.c. , lisbon , which launched a hotline for missing children on may 25 , 2004 , " moralis said . " however , due to a lack of financial means and political support , no fully developed ' child alert ' or ' amber alert system ' has been launched in portugal yet . "
she said a good communication and coordination among existing systems as well as child search programs in countries which do n't currently have them could well have made a difference in the case of madeleine mccann . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 27.08.2007 experts say new alert system needed in eu child searches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madeleine mccann 's parents have spread the word with their own media campaign the eu has a lot of experience in dealing with cross-border problems .
so it should come as no surprise that its efforts to solve child abduction cases should focus on cooperation and standardized search procedures . there have probably been as many column inches written about the efforts of kate and gerry mccann to find their missing daughter madeleine as the investigation into the alleged abduction itself .
the campaign by the missing four-year-old 's family and friends to keep maddy 's face in the media has drawn both praise and criticism since it swung into action in the days after her disappearance from the mccanns ' apartment at the praia da luz resort in portugal on may 3 .
whether one admires or criticizes the mccanns ' use of the media in the search for their daughter , one thing can not be ignored : the media strategy has resulted in an unprecedented level of coverage regarding a child 's abduction .
but should a family have to create its own rolling news channel to keep the world informed of the efforts to find a missing child ?
could the creation of the " find madeleine " campaign also be a reaction to inadequate international search procedures ?
incompatibilities obvious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerry and kate mccann gave the public vital information one of the most debated aspects of the mccann investigation has been the extensive criticism of the portuguese police .
critics of the policia judiciaria have highlighted the differences between portuguese methods and those employed in the search for a child in madeleine 's native britain and other eu countries .
in particular , the police have been accused of failing to distribute information for hours after maddy vanished , for delays in passing a description to border or marine police and for refusing offers of help from international experts for almost three months .
the portuguese have defended themselves by saying that under article 86 of the country 's penal code information must not be released , apart from in exceptional circumstances , while the criminal investigation is still taking place .
while similar types of secrecy laws regarding ongoing police investigations exist in most european countries , information covered by these laws tends to apply to evidence and situations that need to be kept under wraps in the search for a suspect .
few prevent the broadcast or distribution of information regarding a missing child .
eu-wide alert system ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police cooperation across the eu is improving slowly the mccann case has raised new calls for a europe-wide response procedure in the case of abducted children .
while the european commission is already trying to increase cooperation in cross-border investigations , there are currently no plans to standardize the response in the case of a missing child .
" we have been told that there are no plans at the moment for an eu-wide alert system , " said carolyn bouchard from independent child protection agency safehands .
" the level of police cooperation is slowly improving and most current systems work well on a national level , but we continue to push for an efficient network across the continent . "

this comes as german politicians are reconsidering a ban of the ultra-right npd party after recent xenophobic attacks . fourteen percent of the women canvassed said they would not rule out giving their ballot to a party to the right of the conservative christian democratic union or its bavarian sister party , the csu , at the next state parliamentary elections .
nine percent of men , in comparison , said they would do the same in the emnid survey commissioned by the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
emnid head , klaus-peter schöppner , called the results " surprising . " " women do n't usually lean towards the rightwing spectrum so strongly , " he told the newspaper .
right shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dissatisfaction with family policy may be the reason for the poll results schöppner said conservative women voters with traditional family views were possibly disappointed by the conservatives ' modern family politics . " some have stopped voting , " he said .
" others have turned towards parties of the far-right . "
in addition to the discrepancy between men and women in their voting patterns , the survey also showed a split between eastern and western germany .
eleven percent of western germans canvassed by emnid said they would vote for far-right parties , in comparison to 15 percent in eastern germany .
germany has recently seen a spate of racist violence that has prompted renewed calls to ban the far-right npd party .

" publishing these films amounts to aiding and abetting incitement of the people , " he told report mainz , adding that the publication of the video clips in germany was " scandalous .

while the city 's mayor has hailed the work as an " enrichment , " the archbishop reportedly never wanted it . the new window is made up of 11,200 squares and has been installed on the sunny , south-facing side of the gothic cathedral .
more than 1,000 visitors came to witness the event .
eagerly craning their necks upwards to view the 110-square-meter -lrb- 1,184 square-foot -rrb- artwork , the majority seemed entranced by the kaleidoscope of colors .
" the cathedral has been enriched and so has the city , " cologne mayor fritz schramma said after the unveiling .
top opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the inauguration ceremony , the window was described as producing a " symphony of light " but not everyone is apparently happy with the new design .
the online edition of the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper reported that none less than the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , opposed it .
citing a close confidante of meisner 's , the stadt-anzeiger wrote that the archbishop even tried to stop the project , resulting in serious disputes within the committee responsible for deciding over the window .
" the cardinal did not want this window , " said the source . the archbishop , who is not opposed to modern art per se , reportedly wanted to have a figurative work , for example with representations of saints or 20th century martyrs , rather than an abstract one .
cathedral provost norbert feldhoff said the reason for meisner 's absence at the unveiling ceremony was " purely technical " and was linked to a clash with a previously planned trip to poland .
artist 's gift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter was there to see his work unveiled gerhard richter , who lives in cologne , gave his work on the window for free , while the production costs totaling 370,000 euros -lrb- $ 506,000 -rrb- were covered by private donations .
the 75-year-old artist , who has a reputation for being a man of few words , seemed to be happy with his work and said he was proud " it had n't gone wrong . "
richter said it had been a little bit " nerve-wracking " to create a work that , unlike a picture , could not simply be taken down again .
the original window was destroyed in world war ii and replaced in the 1950s by a nearly transparent piece of glass .

a police spokesman said the assailants admitted their involvement in the attack , which put the sudanese in hospital for several days , but denied hitting him on the head with a bottle .
the incident occurred on the same evening as eight indians were attacked and chased through the streets of mügeln after a local festival in the town in germany 's former communist east .
in a series of attacks late friday evening , a man from ghana and an iraqi were assaulted and racially abused in two separate incidents while a mob went on the rampage in another town .
the 36-year-old iraqi was beaten with a baseball bat by a man who set his dog on him at a tram stop in the eastern city of magdeburg .
police said monday they were looking for a suspected right-wing extremist in connection with the assault .
single attacks and mob violence spreads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have faced mobs containing some extremists two men were being questioned in braunschweig on monday after a 49-year-old ghanaian was beaten up in what police said might have been a racially motivated attack or a drug-related incident .
police said one of those involved had links to the right-wing scene .
in another incident on friday evening , a mob of about 40 young men went on the rampage at a fair in the eastern town of bützow , smashing stalls and pelting police with bottles .
police said members of local right-wing groups were involved in the rampage , which also targeted a snack bar operated by a pakistani who has lived in the town since 2002 .
" i was afraid for my life , " mahmood saqib told reporters on monday .
the mob also shouted anti-turkish slogans , said saqib , who was in his flat above the premises at the time .
" we 'll come up and finish you off , " they yelled at him , he said .
efforts to ban npd hit constitutional wall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous attempts to ban the npd have failed the incidents rekindled calls for a ban on the extreme right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which is represented in the regional parliaments of two of the eastern states where the attacks occurred .
leading german politicians have expressed doubts whether a ban could be imposed after a similar attempt was quashed by the country 's top court in 2003 .
the deputy president of the european commission , franco frattini , called for the banning of the npd after the attack in mügeln .
he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper on sunday that neo-nazis represented " a threat " and " an ulcerous cancer for democratic countries like germany . "
german chancellor angela merkel condemned the attack in mügeln as " extremely grim and shameful " and a government spokesman said it was harmful to germany 's image abroad . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the men were working at an illegal mine on the outskirts of beijing when the rock fall occurred on 18 august .
rescuers called off search efforts after two days , but the men crawled and dug their way to the surface .
they were taken to hospital , where doctors said that they had suffered kidney damage due to lack of water .
" they are getting better , but we still keep close observation on them , " a doctor told xinhua news agency .
" they are not out of danger yet . "
rescuers searched for the men - two brothers from the inner mongolia region - for two days but stopped because of fears of another collapse , media reports said .
the men survived because they were experienced miners , china daily said .
the owner of the mine was reported to have fled .
xintai flooding china 's mines are among the most dangerous in the world .
hundreds of miners joined in the rescue effort in xintai about 5,000 deaths are reported every year , but independent groups say the annual death toll is much higher .
the chinese government has introduced legislation aimed at cracking down on illegal or unsafe mines , but mine owners and local officials are frequently accused of ignoring government regulations in search of greater profits .
last week , a senior provincial official admitted that there was " no hope " for 181 miners trapped underground by flooding at collieries in xintai , shandong province .
the workers were trapped when a nearby river burst its banks , sending flood waters cascading into the mine shafts .
by sunday , 50m yuan -lrb- us $ 6.6m , £ 3.3m -rrb- had been donated for rescue efforts and for the families of the trapped miners , xinhua news agency said .
