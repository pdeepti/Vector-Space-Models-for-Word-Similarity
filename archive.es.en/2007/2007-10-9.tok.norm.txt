a recent tv documentary revealed that exploitation of nazi prisoners made the family what it is .
now they 're ready to uncover the past . the quandt family announced on friday , oct .
5 that they were planning a research project to look into their relatives ' activities during the nazi regime .
the move represents a dramatic u-turn in the family 's policy of silence on the issue over the past several decades . " the accusations that have been raised against our family have moved us , " family members said in a statement .
" we recognize that , in our history as a german business family , the years 1933 to 1945 have not been sufficiently cleared up . " indeed , the quandt family 's dark side had been forgotten for many years - until german broadcaster ndr came out with a documentary film , which premiered on sunday , sept .
30 at the hamburg film festival . prisoners contributed to war effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther quandt 's son herbert ran a subsidiary of afa , which may have also used forced labor in the film , which was broadcast later that sunday night on germany 's ard television station , former prisoners of the nazis shared stories of their work during the war years in the afa battery factory , owned by günter quandt .
though munitions were also produced in the factory , the batteries themselves were also vital to hitler 's war effort . the forced laborers who appeared in the documentary told of beatings , mistreatment , and death . historians suspect that günther quandt made use of forced labor as early as 1938 .
by 1941 , thousands of prisoners were working in his battery factories in hanover , berlin and vienna , which also produced munitions .
hundreds died .
evidence suggests there may have even been a concentration camp facility complete with execution grounds and gallows . quandt referred in an internal document to a " fluctuation " of 80 people - most likely the planned death rate , reported german daily süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goebbels and magda quandt are seen here at their marriage ceremony ; hitler -lrb- far right -rrb- was best man in addition to allegedly exploiting nazi prisoners , the quandts also had personal ties to the nazi regime .
günther quandts first wife , magda ritschel , remarried joseph goebbels , hitler 's future propaganda minister , in 1931 , two years after her divorce from the business giant .
magda brought her son , harald quandt , into the marriage and he lived together with her and goebbels .
while the goebbels committed suicide in 1945 after poisoning their own children , harald - who was not with them - survived . documentary presented clandestinely two journalists spent five years researching the startling documentary , which was broadcast unannounced and not until 11:30 p.m.
the german weekly der spiegel speculated that the broadcaster may have been afraid of the powerful quandt family , which owns 46.6 percent of bmw and large portions of numerous other firms , including altana .
an ard spokesman , however , said a desire to avoid legal injunction played no role . only one member of the family , sven quandt , actually appeared in the film . " we finally have to try to forget about it , " he told der spiegel .
" every family has its dark side , " added quandt when asked about his grandfather 's ill reputed battery factory . precisely to what extent quandt profited from the forced labor and how bad the conditions there really were will have to be cleared up over the course of the planned historical research . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us administration also has asserted the so-called state secrets privilege in an effort to dismiss the lawsuits over the warrantless domestic spying program that president george w. bush created after the sept .
11 attacks . el-masri 's lawsuit sought damages of at least $ 75,000 -lrb- 53,000 euros -rrb- and was brought against former cia director george tenet , three private aviation companies and 20 unnamed employees of the cia and the companies . the 44-year-old german is currently in protective custody and is accused of an arson stack on a cash-and-carry market causing 500,000 euros worth of damage .

a recent tv documentary revealed that exploitation of nazi prisoners made the family what it is .
now they 're ready to uncover the past . the quandt family announced on friday , oct .
5 that they were planning a research project to look into their relatives ' activities during the nazi regime .
the move represents a dramatic u-turn in the family 's policy of silence on the issue over the past several decades . " the accusations that have been raised against our family have moved us , " family members said in a statement .
" we recognize that , in our history as a german business family , the years 1933 to 1945 have not been sufficiently cleared up . " indeed , the quandt family 's dark side had been forgotten for many years - until german broadcaster ndr came out with a documentary film , which premiered on sunday , sept .
30 at the hamburg film festival . prisoners contributed to war effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther quandt 's son herbert ran a subsidiary of afa , which may have also used forced labor in the film , which was broadcast later that sunday night on germany 's ard television station , former prisoners of the nazis shared stories of their work during the war years in the afa battery factory , owned by günter quandt .
though munitions were also produced in the factory , the batteries themselves were also vital to hitler 's war effort . the forced laborers who appeared in the documentary told of beatings , mistreatment , and death . historians suspect that günther quandt made use of forced labor as early as 1938 .
by 1941 , thousands of prisoners were working in his battery factories in hanover , berlin and vienna , which also produced munitions .
hundreds died .
evidence suggests there may have even been a concentration camp facility complete with execution grounds and gallows . quandt referred in an internal document to a " fluctuation " of 80 people - most likely the planned death rate , reported german daily süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goebbels and magda quandt are seen here at their marriage ceremony ; hitler -lrb- far right -rrb- was best man in addition to allegedly exploiting nazi prisoners , the quandts also had personal ties to the nazi regime .
günther quandts first wife , magda ritschel , remarried joseph goebbels , hitler 's future propaganda minister , in 1931 , two years after her divorce from the business giant .
magda brought her son , harald quandt , into the marriage and he lived together with her and goebbels .
while the goebbels committed suicide in 1945 after poisoning their own children , harald - who was not with them - survived . documentary presented clandestinely two journalists spent five years researching the startling documentary , which was broadcast unannounced and not until 11:30 p.m.
the german weekly der spiegel speculated that the broadcaster may have been afraid of the powerful quandt family , which owns 46.6 percent of bmw and large portions of numerous other firms , including altana .
an ard spokesman , however , said a desire to avoid legal injunction played no role . only one member of the family , sven quandt , actually appeared in the film . " we finally have to try to forget about it , " he told der spiegel .
" every family has its dark side , " added quandt when asked about his grandfather 's ill reputed battery factory . precisely to what extent quandt profited from the forced labor and how bad the conditions there really were will have to be cleared up over the course of the planned historical research . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's not only irritated some spaniards , it 's brought forth appeals for broader categories about cultural identity . in a statement released on the eve of the event , the head of the german branch of the writers ' association pen , johano strasser , said he was concerned about the message that was being sent .
" as important as it is to bring individual cultures into a dialog with one another , there 's an equally great danger of provincialism , " strasser said .
" cultural identity politics is always a double-edged sword . "
nationalism , regionalism and vanity the choice of catalonia , the northeastern region in spain with some seven million inhabitants and its own language , catalan , has been controversial right from the start .
some spanish writers invited to participated have refused to come , objecting to catalan organizers ' original decision to invite only authors who wrote in catalan .
bildunterschrift : for some catalonians , guest culture status is a point of pride " almost all of the spanish-language authors , including those who are catalan , are not attending , " book fair director jürgen boos said at a press conference shortly before tuesday 's official opening ceremony .
" there are a whole range of reasons including nationalism , regionalism , and vanity .
i think this is a great pity , i would like to have had all of them here . "
but politicians from the semi-autonomous region have stressed their culture 's special role at the fair does not reinforce provincialism .
" we catalans are europeans , and that 's why we 've come to frankfurt , " the former president of the region , pasquall maragall , told the dpa news agency .
new record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt book fair is a must for everyone in the publishing industry neither the debate about diversity versus cosmopolitanism nor sluggish sales figures in the book industry have dampened publishers ' desire to participate in the frankfurt event .
the fair - already the largest of its kind in the world - has more exhibitors than ever before : 7448 compared with 7272 last year .
organizers also say they expect around 290,000 visitors , roughly the same as at the 2006 event .

bildunterschrift : zwanziger said political views have no place in soccer dfb president theo zwanziger meanwhile made his own opposition clear in a statement .
" i respect the decision of the coaches not to travel with the player because they told me that the player stated private and appropriate reasons , " he said .
" however , my position and that of the dfb is clear : we will not accept that a german national player refuses to play in an international match for reasons associated with his views on world politics . "
the central council of the jews in germany responded with indignation to dejagah ’ s decision .
" it is inconceivable and impossible that a national player initiates his own private jewish boycott , " vice-president dieter graumann told german magazine der spiegel ’ s online portal .

a recent tv documentary revealed that exploitation of nazi prisoners made the family what it is .
now they 're ready to uncover the past . the quandt family announced on friday , oct .
5 that they were planning a research project to look into their relatives ' activities during the nazi regime .
the move represents a dramatic u-turn in the family 's policy of silence on the issue over the past several decades . " the accusations that have been raised against our family have moved us , " family members said in a statement .
" we recognize that , in our history as a german business family , the years 1933 to 1945 have not been sufficiently cleared up . " indeed , the quandt family 's dark side had been forgotten for many years - until german broadcaster ndr came out with a documentary film , which premiered on sunday , sept .
30 at the hamburg film festival . prisoners contributed to war effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther quandt 's son herbert ran a subsidiary of afa , which may have also used forced labor in the film , which was broadcast later that sunday night on germany 's ard television station , former prisoners of the nazis shared stories of their work during the war years in the afa battery factory , owned by günter quandt .
though munitions were also produced in the factory , the batteries themselves were also vital to hitler 's war effort . the forced laborers who appeared in the documentary told of beatings , mistreatment , and death . historians suspect that günther quandt made use of forced labor as early as 1938 .
by 1941 , thousands of prisoners were working in his battery factories in hanover , berlin and vienna , which also produced munitions .
hundreds died .
evidence suggests there may have even been a concentration camp facility complete with execution grounds and gallows . quandt referred in an internal document to a " fluctuation " of 80 people - most likely the planned death rate , reported german daily süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goebbels and magda quandt are seen here at their marriage ceremony ; hitler -lrb- far right -rrb- was best man in addition to allegedly exploiting nazi prisoners , the quandts also had personal ties to the nazi regime .
günther quandts first wife , magda ritschel , remarried joseph goebbels , hitler 's future propaganda minister , in 1931 , two years after her divorce from the business giant .
magda brought her son , harald quandt , into the marriage and he lived together with her and goebbels .
while the goebbels committed suicide in 1945 after poisoning their own children , harald - who was not with them - survived . documentary presented clandestinely two journalists spent five years researching the startling documentary , which was broadcast unannounced and not until 11:30 p.m.
the german weekly der spiegel speculated that the broadcaster may have been afraid of the powerful quandt family , which owns 46.6 percent of bmw and large portions of numerous other firms , including altana .
an ard spokesman , however , said a desire to avoid legal injunction played no role . only one member of the family , sven quandt , actually appeared in the film . " we finally have to try to forget about it , " he told der spiegel .
" every family has its dark side , " added quandt when asked about his grandfather 's ill reputed battery factory . precisely to what extent quandt profited from the forced labor and how bad the conditions there really were will have to be cleared up over the course of the planned historical research . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
grünberg and fert discovered in 1988 that minute magnetic changes in a gmr system lead to huge differences in electrical resistance .
these differences in turn cause changes in the current in the readout head , which scans a hard disk to spot the ones and zeroes in which the data is stored .
as a result , the readout head is able to read smaller and weaker magnetic areas - and this sensitivity means information can be packed more densely on the hard disk .
prize for practical application of nanotechnology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert fert is honored for his work on the miniature hard drive martin durrani , editor of physics world , a journal published by britain 's institute of physics , said the award was fitting .
" i am really pleased that it has gone for something very practically based and rooted in research relevant to industry , " he said .
" it shows that physics has a real relevance not just to understanding natural phenomena but to real products in everyday life . "
last year , the physics prize went to us space scientists john mather and george smoot for a pioneering space mission which supports the " big bang " theory about the origins of the universe .
grünberg and fert will be honored at a formal prize ceremony held as tradition dictates on dec .
10 , the anniversary of the death in 1896 of the prize 's creator , swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite alfred nobel .
the 2007 laureates will receive a gold medal , a diploma and 10 million swedish kronor -lrb- $ 1.53 million , 1.08 million euros -rrb- to be split between them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but literary critics disagree as to whether it 's a page-turner or a bore . julia franck 's lady midday -lrb- die mittagsfrau -rrb- tells the story of a woman who abandons her son at a train station in the final years of the third reich .
the story was based in part on the life of franck 's father who was , in fact abandoned by his grandmother in 1945 .
in honoring franck 's novel , the jury called it " spellbinding in its verbal immediacy , storytelling energy and psychological intensity . "
the german book prize carries a cash award of 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- and is considered a major literary springboard - previous winners have been translated into other languages , including english .
franck is a 37-year-old mother of two who was born in the former communist east germany but moved to the west as a child .
lady midday is her fifth book .
precise or pretentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franck has a reputation for being earnest like most high-profile literary awards , the german book prize gives critics the chance to argue long-windedly about whether the winner is any good .
and lady midday has proved no exception - with reviewers more or less evenly split on its quality .
" she may reign in her style but she gives it sufficient cold space to breathe and to resonate in precise images , " wrote one critic in the daily newspaper die welt .
" she constructs an almost classical drama of stations . "
but others are far less impressed .
" the book is overrun with stereotypical figures from 1920s berlin , and there , especially where the dialogue is concerned , the ' narrative intensity ' lauded by the jury descends into pretension , imprecision and , sometimes , kitsch , " carped another critic in the daily berliner der tagesspiegel .
franck will surely be the subject of further discussion at the frankfurt book fair , which starts on tuesday evening . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but literary critics disagree as to whether it 's a page-turner or a bore . julia franck 's lady midday -lrb- die mittagsfrau -rrb- tells the story of a woman who abandons her son at a train station in the final years of the third reich .
the story was based in part on the life of franck 's father who was , in fact abandoned by his grandmother in 1945 .
in honoring franck 's novel , the jury called it " spellbinding in its verbal immediacy , storytelling energy and psychological intensity . "
the german book prize carries a cash award of 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- and is considered a major literary springboard - previous winners have been translated into other languages , including english .
franck is a 37-year-old mother of two who was born in the former communist east germany but moved to the west as a child .
lady midday is her fifth book .
precise or pretentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franck has a reputation for being earnest like most high-profile literary awards , the german book prize gives critics the chance to argue long-windedly about whether the winner is any good .
and lady midday has proved no exception - with reviewers more or less evenly split on its quality .
" she may reign in her style but she gives it sufficient cold space to breathe and to resonate in precise images , " wrote one critic in the daily newspaper die welt .
" she constructs an almost classical drama of stations . "
but others are far less impressed .
" the book is overrun with stereotypical figures from 1920s berlin , and there , especially where the dialogue is concerned , the ' narrative intensity ' lauded by the jury descends into pretension , imprecision and , sometimes , kitsch , " carped another critic in the daily berliner der tagesspiegel .

us administration officials had called on the court to reject the case on national security grounds , arguing a public trial would reveal state secrets . " we are very disappointed , " el-masri 's german lawyer manfred gnjidic said of the decision , according to the associated press .

" the central facts of this case are not state secrets and do not become so simply because the government insists otherwise , " ben wizner of the american civil liberties union wrote in the appeal . european criticism el-masri 's accusations sparked outrage in germany and drew worldwide attention to the cia 's " extraordinary rendition " program , which transported terror suspects to secret prisons in third countries for interrogation .

a recent tv documentary revealed that exploitation of nazi prisoners made the family what it is .
now they 're ready to uncover the past . the quandt family announced on friday , oct .
5 that they were planning a research project to look into their relatives ' activities during the nazi regime .
the move represents a dramatic u-turn in the family 's policy of silence on the issue over the past several decades . " the accusations that have been raised against our family have moved us , " family members said in a statement .
" we recognize that , in our history as a german business family , the years 1933 to 1945 have not been sufficiently cleared up . " indeed , the quandt family 's dark side had been forgotten for many years - until german broadcaster ndr came out with a documentary film , which premiered on sunday , sept .
30 at the hamburg film festival . prisoners contributed to war effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther quandt 's son herbert ran a subsidiary of afa , which may have also used forced labor in the film , which was broadcast later that sunday night on germany 's ard television station , former prisoners of the nazis shared stories of their work during the war years in the afa battery factory , owned by günter quandt .
though munitions were also produced in the factory , the batteries themselves were also vital to hitler 's war effort . the forced laborers who appeared in the documentary told of beatings , mistreatment , and death . historians suspect that günther quandt made use of forced labor as early as 1938 .
by 1941 , thousands of prisoners were working in his battery factories in hanover , berlin and vienna , which also produced munitions .
hundreds died .
evidence suggests there may have even been a concentration camp facility complete with execution grounds and gallows . quandt referred in an internal document to a " fluctuation " of 80 people - most likely the planned death rate , reported german daily süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goebbels and magda quandt are seen here at their marriage ceremony ; hitler -lrb- far right -rrb- was best man in addition to allegedly exploiting nazi prisoners , the quandts also had personal ties to the nazi regime .
günther quandts first wife , magda ritschel , remarried joseph goebbels , hitler 's future propaganda minister , in 1931 , two years after her divorce from the business giant .
magda brought her son , harald quandt , into the marriage and he lived together with her and goebbels .
while the goebbels committed suicide in 1945 after poisoning their own children , harald - who was not with them - survived . documentary presented clandestinely two journalists spent five years researching the startling documentary , which was broadcast unannounced and not until 11:30 p.m.
the german weekly der spiegel speculated that the broadcaster may have been afraid of the powerful quandt family , which owns 46.6 percent of bmw and large portions of numerous other firms , including altana .
an ard spokesman , however , said a desire to avoid legal injunction played no role . only one member of the family , sven quandt , actually appeared in the film . " we finally have to try to forget about it , " he told der spiegel .
" every family has its dark side , " added quandt when asked about his grandfather 's ill reputed battery factory . precisely to what extent quandt profited from the forced labor and how bad the conditions there really were will have to be cleared up over the course of the planned historical research . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's not only irritated some spaniards , it 's brought forth appeals for broader categories about cultural identity . in a statement released on the eve of the event , the head of the german branch of the writers ' association pen , johano strasser , said he was concerned about the message that was being sent .
" as important as it is to bring individual cultures into a dialog with one another , there 's an equally great danger of provincialism , " strasser said .
" cultural identity politics is always a double-edged sword . "
nationalism , regionalism and vanity the choice of catalonia , the northeastern region in spain with some seven million inhabitants and its own language , catalan , has been controversial right from the start .
some spanish writers invited to participated have refused to come , objecting to catalan organizers ' original decision to invite only authors who wrote in catalan .
bildunterschrift : for some catalonians , guest culture status is a point of pride " almost all of the spanish-language authors , including those who are catalan , are not attending , " book fair director jürgen boos said at a press conference shortly before tuesday 's official opening ceremony .
" there are a whole range of reasons including nationalism , regionalism , and vanity .
i think this is a great pity , i would like to have had all of them here . "
but politicians from the semi-autonomous region have stressed their culture 's special role at the fair does not reinforce provincialism .
" we catalans are europeans , and that 's why we 've come to frankfurt , " the former president of the region , pasquall maragall , told the dpa news agency .
new record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt book fair is a must for everyone in the publishing industry neither the debate about diversity versus cosmopolitanism nor sluggish sales figures in the book industry have dampened publishers ' desire to participate in the frankfurt event .
the fair - already the largest of its kind in the world - has more exhibitors than ever before : 7448 compared with 7272 last year .
organizers also say they expect around 290,000 visitors , roughly the same as at the 2006 event .
the event proper kicks off for people in the industry on wednesday - doors are open to the general public on the weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 09.10.2007 günther beckstein sworn in as new bavarian premier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein is the new face of bavaria the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has ruled bavaria for 50 years .
günther beckstein , a 63-year-old lawyer , is expected to stay the course after his election as state premier on tuesday , oct .
9 . günther beckstein , 63 , received 122 of 178 votes in the bavarian state parliament , which is dominated by his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
he built a reputation as a law-and-order man during his years as bavaria 's powerful , hard-line interior minister .
as premier of germany 's largest and wealthiest state , he 'll have to ensure that his own party toes the line if it wants to maintain its popularity .
the csu found itself in turmoil earlier this year .
edmund stoiber , the party 's charismatic premier and party chief , lost the confidence of his party after mishandling allegations that one of his aids had snooped into the personal life of a fellow csu politician .
once he announced his plans to step down in september , an unusually public power struggle broke out among those who wanted to succeed him as party chair .
bavarian economics minister erwin huber was eventually chosen .
it 's normal to have some disorder when a " dominating personality " like stoiber leaves the political scene , beckstein said .
but now party members need to form a " tidy combat order " and prepare a united front for next year 's elections , beckstein told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag .
beckstein consistently scores highest in opinion polls and will play an important role in the 2008 state elections .
observers have said he 's likely to carry on stoiber 's agenda .
" i will continue with the policies that have made bavaria the best , " he told a csu conference on saturday .
high-profile post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber is out the bavarian premier is a symbolic successor to the former kings of bavaria .
while the royal perks are limited to using the region 's palaces for state business , the premier does have a high profile in europe because of the state 's economic might .
the csu has been bavaria 's governing - or as some might say " ruling " - party for the last half century .
the party has controlled bavaria 's premiership since 1957 and during most of that time , has also had the state parliament in its hands with an absolute majority .
the csu is the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- sister party .
under a power-sharing agreement , merkel 's cdu does not seek office in bavaria and the csu does not venture out of bavaria .
chancellor angela merkel relies on the bavarian csu for votes in the federal parliament .
a little different bildunterschrift : beckstein has vocal critics beckstein will likely focus his energy on running bavaria and leave the politicking in berlin to huber . beckstein has been part of bavarian politics for such a long time that he was a natural choice for the job , said werner patzelt , a political science professor in dresden who studies german political parties .
beckstein does not fit the typical profile of a csu politician .
he is a protestant in a party that has traditionally been dominated by catholics .
he hails from the northern bavarian region of franconia , while his predecessors have come from the south .
thirty years ago , beckstein 's background might have made it difficult to advance within the csu .
but those issues are irrelevant today , said gerhard hirscher , a political scientist with the hanns seidel foundation , a munich research institution supported by the csu .
" we 're in a time of competence politics , " hirscher said .
impeccable conservative credentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein -lrb- left -rrb- and huber unlike many of his compatriots , beckstein has managed to stay clear of personal and professional scandals .
he is close to his wife marga , considering her an important advisor .
the couple has three children .
beckstein 's law-and-order credentials will be important in the upcoming elections , patzelt predicts , since the views are popular in bavaria .
he ’ s seen as one of the more outspokenly conservative members of the csu .
his comments frequently draw criticism from opposition parties , immigrant rights groups and privacy advocates .
beckstein was criticized by muslims and social democrats in september when he suggested that law enforcement should keep tabs on germans who convert to islam .
the remarks came after two german converts to islam were arrested for allegedly taking part in a plot to bomb united states military installations and other targets in germany .
when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one , " beckstein told a german newspaper .
earlier , beckstein had said social democrats , who make up the liberal half of merkel 's ruling grand coalition , would share the blame for future terrorist attacks in germany .
the social democratic party has opposed conservatives ' plans to drastically widen security authorities ' access to personal data .
despite his reputation as a hardliner , beckstein is soft spoken in person and has the reputation of being a good boss , hirscher said .
" his track record in his political field is really very good . "
hirscher said .
if it 's not broken ...
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's economy is going strong bavaria is home to corporate giants like bmw and siemens .
in contrast to other german states , the economy there has performed well for several years and it 's unlikely that beckstein will decide on a drastic change in course .
he 'll likely carry forward plans stoiber put in place , experts say .
while the ruckus over stoiber 's departure caused a dip in the party 's popularity earlier this year , the latest polls show that the party has between 53 and 58 percent support among bavarians . the csu will aim to maintain its majority in the 2008 state elections .
after that , beckstein 's real test will be to make sure the csu has a good showing in the next round of european and national elections , currently planned for 2009 . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but literary critics disagree as to whether it 's a page-turner or a bore . julia franck 's lady midday -lrb- die mittagsfrau -rrb- tells the story of a woman who abandons her son at a train station in the final years of the third reich .
the story was based in part on the life of franck 's father who was , in fact abandoned by his grandmother in 1945 .
in honoring franck 's novel , the jury called it " spellbinding in its verbal immediacy , storytelling energy and psychological intensity . "
the german book prize carries a cash award of 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- and is considered a major literary springboard - previous winners have been translated into other languages , including english .
franck is a 37-year-old mother of two who was born in the former communist east germany but moved to the west as a child .
lady midday is her fifth book .
precise or pretentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franck has a reputation for being earnest like most high-profile literary awards , the german book prize gives critics the chance to argue long-windedly about whether the winner is any good .
and lady midday has proved no exception - with reviewers more or less evenly split on its quality .
" she may reign in her style but she gives it sufficient cold space to breathe and to resonate in precise images , " wrote one critic in the daily newspaper die welt .
" she constructs an almost classical drama of stations . "
but others are far less impressed .
" the book is overrun with stereotypical figures from 1920s berlin , and there , especially where the dialogue is concerned , the ' narrative intensity ' lauded by the jury descends into pretension , imprecision and , sometimes , kitsch , " carped another critic in the daily berliner der tagesspiegel .
franck will surely be the subject of further discussion at the frankfurt book fair , which starts on tuesday evening . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
grünberg and fert discovered in 1988 that minute magnetic changes in a gmr system lead to huge differences in electrical resistance .
these differences in turn cause changes in the current in the readout head , which scans a hard disk to spot the ones and zeroes in which the data is stored .
as a result , the readout head is able to read smaller and weaker magnetic areas - and this sensitivity means information can be packed more densely on the hard disk .
prize for practical application of nanotechnology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert fert is honored for his work on the miniature hard drive martin durrani , editor of physics world , a journal published by britain 's institute of physics , said the award was fitting .
" i am really pleased that it has gone for something very practically based and rooted in research relevant to industry , " he said .
" it shows that physics has a real relevance not just to understanding natural phenomena but to real products in everyday life . "
last year , the physics prize went to us space scientists john mather and george smoot for a pioneering space mission which supports the " big bang " theory about the origins of the universe .
grünberg and fert will be honored at a formal prize ceremony held as tradition dictates on dec .
10 , the anniversary of the death in 1896 of the prize 's creator , swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite alfred nobel .
the 2007 laureates will receive a gold medal , a diploma and 10 million swedish kronor -lrb- $ 1.53 million , 1.08 million euros -rrb- to be split between them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 09.10.2007 günther beckstein sworn in as new bavarian premier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein is the new face of bavaria the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has ruled bavaria for 50 years .
günther beckstein , a 63-year-old lawyer , is expected to stay the course after his election as state premier on tuesday , oct .
9 . günther beckstein , 63 , received 122 of 178 votes in the bavarian state parliament , which is dominated by his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
he built a reputation as a law-and-order man during his years as bavaria 's powerful , hard-line interior minister .
as premier of germany 's largest and wealthiest state , he 'll have to ensure that his own party toes the line if it wants to maintain its popularity .
the csu found itself in turmoil earlier this year .
edmund stoiber , the party 's charismatic premier and party chief , lost the confidence of his party after mishandling allegations that one of his aids had snooped into the personal life of a fellow csu politician .
once he announced his plans to step down in september , an unusually public power struggle broke out among those who wanted to succeed him as party chair .
bavarian economics minister erwin huber was eventually chosen .
it 's normal to have some disorder when a " dominating personality " like stoiber leaves the political scene , beckstein said .
but now party members need to form a " tidy combat order " and prepare a united front for next year 's elections , beckstein told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag .
beckstein consistently scores highest in opinion polls and will play an important role in the 2008 state elections .
observers have said he 's likely to carry on stoiber 's agenda .
" i will continue with the policies that have made bavaria the best , " he told a csu conference on saturday .
high-profile post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber is out the bavarian premier is a symbolic successor to the former kings of bavaria .
while the royal perks are limited to using the region 's palaces for state business , the premier does have a high profile in europe because of the state 's economic might .
the csu has been bavaria 's governing - or as some might say " ruling " - party for the last half century .
the party has controlled bavaria 's premiership since 1957 and during most of that time , has also had the state parliament in its hands with an absolute majority .
the csu is the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- sister party .
under a power-sharing agreement , merkel 's cdu does not seek office in bavaria and the csu does not venture out of bavaria .
chancellor angela merkel relies on the bavarian csu for votes in the federal parliament .
a little different bildunterschrift : beckstein has vocal critics beckstein will likely focus his energy on running bavaria and leave the politicking in berlin to huber . beckstein has been part of bavarian politics for such a long time that he was a natural choice for the job , said werner patzelt , a political science professor in dresden who studies german political parties .
beckstein does not fit the typical profile of a csu politician .
he is a protestant in a party that has traditionally been dominated by catholics .
he hails from the northern bavarian region of franconia , while his predecessors have come from the south .
thirty years ago , beckstein 's background might have made it difficult to advance within the csu .
but those issues are irrelevant today , said gerhard hirscher , a political scientist with the hanns seidel foundation , a munich research institution supported by the csu .
" we 're in a time of competence politics , " hirscher said .
impeccable conservative credentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein -lrb- left -rrb- and huber unlike many of his compatriots , beckstein has managed to stay clear of personal and professional scandals .
he is close to his wife marga , considering her an important advisor .
the couple has three children .
beckstein 's law-and-order credentials will be important in the upcoming elections , patzelt predicts , since the views are popular in bavaria .
he ’ s seen as one of the more outspokenly conservative members of the csu .
his comments frequently draw criticism from opposition parties , immigrant rights groups and privacy advocates .
beckstein was criticized by muslims and social democrats in september when he suggested that law enforcement should keep tabs on germans who convert to islam .
the remarks came after two german converts to islam were arrested for allegedly taking part in a plot to bomb united states military installations and other targets in germany .
when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one , " beckstein told a german newspaper .
earlier , beckstein had said social democrats , who make up the liberal half of merkel 's ruling grand coalition , would share the blame for future terrorist attacks in germany .
the social democratic party has opposed conservatives ' plans to drastically widen security authorities ' access to personal data .
despite his reputation as a hardliner , beckstein is soft spoken in person and has the reputation of being a good boss , hirscher said .
" his track record in his political field is really very good . "
hirscher said .
if it 's not broken ...
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's economy is going strong bavaria is home to corporate giants like bmw and siemens .
in contrast to other german states , the economy there has performed well for several years and it 's unlikely that beckstein will decide on a drastic change in course .
he 'll likely carry forward plans stoiber put in place , experts say .
while the ruckus over stoiber 's departure caused a dip in the party 's popularity earlier this year , the latest polls show that the party has between 53 and 58 percent support among bavarians . the csu will aim to maintain its majority in the 2008 state elections .
after that , beckstein 's real test will be to make sure the csu has a good showing in the next round of european and national elections , currently planned for 2009 . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

günther beckstein , a 63-year-old lawyer , is expected to stay the course after his election as state premier on tuesday , oct .
9 . günther beckstein , 63 , received 122 of 178 votes in the bavarian state parliament , which is dominated by his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
he built a reputation as a law-and-order man during his years as bavaria 's powerful , hard-line interior minister .
as premier of germany 's largest and wealthiest state , he 'll have to ensure that his own party toes the line if it wants to maintain its popularity .
the csu found itself in turmoil earlier this year .
edmund stoiber , the party 's charismatic premier and party chief , lost the confidence of his party after mishandling allegations that one of his aids had snooped into the personal life of a fellow csu politician .
once he announced his plans to step down in september , an unusually public power struggle broke out among those who wanted to succeed him as party chair .
bavarian economics minister erwin huber was eventually chosen .
it 's normal to have some disorder when a " dominating personality " like stoiber leaves the political scene , beckstein said .
but now party members need to form a " tidy combat order " and prepare a united front for next year 's elections , beckstein told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag .
beckstein consistently scores highest in opinion polls and will play an important role in the 2008 state elections .
observers have said he 's likely to carry on stoiber 's agenda .
" i will continue with the policies that have made bavaria the best , " he told a csu conference on saturday .
high-profile post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber is out the bavarian premier is a symbolic successor to the former kings of bavaria .
while the royal perks are limited to using the region 's palaces for state business , the premier does have a high profile in europe because of the state 's economic might .
the csu has been bavaria 's governing - or as some might say " ruling " - party for the last half century .
the party has controlled bavaria 's premiership since 1957 and during most of that time , has also had the state parliament in its hands with an absolute majority .
the csu is the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- sister party .
under a power-sharing agreement , merkel 's cdu does not seek office in bavaria and the csu does not venture out of bavaria .
chancellor angela merkel relies on the bavarian csu for votes in the federal parliament .
a little different bildunterschrift : beckstein has vocal critics beckstein will likely focus his energy on running bavaria and leave the politicking in berlin to huber . beckstein has been part of bavarian politics for such a long time that he was a natural choice for the job , said werner patzelt , a political science professor in dresden who studies german political parties .
beckstein does not fit the typical profile of a csu politician .
he is a protestant in a party that has traditionally been dominated by catholics .
he hails from the northern bavarian region of franconia , while his predecessors have come from the south .
thirty years ago , beckstein 's background might have made it difficult to advance within the csu .
but those issues are irrelevant today , said gerhard hirscher , a political scientist with the hanns seidel foundation , a munich research institution supported by the csu .
" we 're in a time of competence politics , " hirscher said .
impeccable conservative credentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein -lrb- left -rrb- and huber unlike many of his compatriots , beckstein has managed to stay clear of personal and professional scandals .
he is close to his wife marga , considering her an important advisor .
the couple has three children .
beckstein 's law-and-order credentials will be important in the upcoming elections , patzelt predicts , since the views are popular in bavaria .
he ’ s seen as one of the more outspokenly conservative members of the csu .
his comments frequently draw criticism from opposition parties , immigrant rights groups and privacy advocates .
beckstein was criticized by muslims and social democrats in september when he suggested that law enforcement should keep tabs on germans who convert to islam .
the remarks came after two german converts to islam were arrested for allegedly taking part in a plot to bomb united states military installations and other targets in germany .
when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one , " beckstein told a german newspaper .
earlier , beckstein had said social democrats , who make up the liberal half of merkel 's ruling grand coalition , would share the blame for future terrorist attacks in germany .

" complaints like this are always the last resort when all the political measures have been exhausted , " dieter ameling , president of the german steel federation , said .
china , which was the world 's biggest importer of steel in 2004 , has since become the world 's biggest exporter and is now responsible for 34 percent of the world 's steel production .
environmental and quality standards questioned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german steel firms feel their product is being under cut european producers accuse chinese factories of failing to respect the environment and making poor quality steel .
the europeans also complain that about the large subsidies the state-run chinese steel companies receive .
" it is a situation of state-run production , while in the rest of the world steel is produced by private companies designed to create value , " said karl-ulrich koehler , the head of germany 's thyssenkrupp steel , the world 's tenth-biggest producer .
ameling said that " instead of exporting the steel that is produced in china at great cost to the environment , it would be better if the chinese withdrew their polluting products from the market . "
zhang xiaogang , chairman of the china iron and steel association , responded by telling the conference that inefficient steel mills would be closed by the end of the decade in a move towards consolidation .
" by 2010 , the iron and steel enterprises will be decreased greatly in number and production by the top 10 enterprise groups in the country will make up over 50 percent of gross crude steel production in china , " he said .
demand for steel expected to increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's economy will be one of those driving steel demand the international iron and steel institute -lrb- iisi -rrb- , which is hosting the conference , said in its latest forecast on monday that global demand for steel will keep growing next year in response to strong economies in china , africa and the middle east .
iisi expected steel demand to grow by 6.8 percent this year and by around the same level in 2008 , slightly more than a forecast earlier this year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
" he came to us citing personal reasons that seemed very plausible , " dfb spokesman jens grittner said in a statement .
dejagah was quoted by mass-circulation tabloid daily bz as saying his motive was cultural .
" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " he said in a report published tuesday .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "
dejagah was born in tehran , but later moved with his parents to germany .
he holds a german passport .
iranian citizens have been forbidden from traveling to israel ever since the 1979 islamic revolution , the point from which iran also began to refuse to recognize israel 's right to exist .
ex-bayern star pulled from tel aviv game in 2004 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vahid hashemian the under-21 star 's decision is not the first to bring the tensions of the middle east into german soccer .
former bayern munich striker vahid hashemian , now with hanover 96 , was pulled from the bayern squad to face israeli team maccabi tel aviv in a champions league game in 2004 .
although bayern cited a back injury as the reason for the iranian 's withdrawal , the potential visit proved controversial with opposition to hashemian 's involvement coming from iran 's national sporting body .
calls for exclusion from national team dejagah 's withdrawal has stirred controversy in germany .
bild , germany 's biggest-selling newspaper , called for dejagah 's exclusion from the national team , a call which was backed by friedbert pflüger , a leading member of the berlin branch of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : zwanziger said political views have no place in soccer dfb president theo zwanziger meanwhile made his own opposition clear in a statement .
" i respect the decision of the coaches not to travel with the player because they told me that the player stated private and appropriate reasons , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 09.10.2007 günther beckstein sworn in as new bavarian premier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein is the new face of bavaria the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has ruled bavaria for 50 years .
günther beckstein , a 63-year-old lawyer , is expected to stay the course after his election as state premier on tuesday , oct .
9 . günther beckstein , 63 , received 122 of 178 votes in the bavarian state parliament , which is dominated by his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
he built a reputation as a law-and-order man during his years as bavaria 's powerful , hard-line interior minister .
as premier of germany 's largest and wealthiest state , he 'll have to ensure that his own party toes the line if it wants to maintain its popularity .
the csu found itself in turmoil earlier this year .
edmund stoiber , the party 's charismatic premier and party chief , lost the confidence of his party after mishandling allegations that one of his aids had snooped into the personal life of a fellow csu politician .
once he announced his plans to step down in september , an unusually public power struggle broke out among those who wanted to succeed him as party chair .
bavarian economics minister erwin huber was eventually chosen .
it 's normal to have some disorder when a " dominating personality " like stoiber leaves the political scene , beckstein said .
but now party members need to form a " tidy combat order " and prepare a united front for next year 's elections , beckstein told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag .
beckstein consistently scores highest in opinion polls and will play an important role in the 2008 state elections .
observers have said he 's likely to carry on stoiber 's agenda .
" i will continue with the policies that have made bavaria the best , " he told a csu conference on saturday .
high-profile post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber is out the bavarian premier is a symbolic successor to the former kings of bavaria .
while the royal perks are limited to using the region 's palaces for state business , the premier does have a high profile in europe because of the state 's economic might .
the csu has been bavaria 's governing - or as some might say " ruling " - party for the last half century .
the party has controlled bavaria 's premiership since 1957 and during most of that time , has also had the state parliament in its hands with an absolute majority .
the csu is the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- sister party .
under a power-sharing agreement , merkel 's cdu does not seek office in bavaria and the csu does not venture out of bavaria .
chancellor angela merkel relies on the bavarian csu for votes in the federal parliament .
a little different bildunterschrift : beckstein has vocal critics beckstein will likely focus his energy on running bavaria and leave the politicking in berlin to huber . beckstein has been part of bavarian politics for such a long time that he was a natural choice for the job , said werner patzelt , a political science professor in dresden who studies german political parties .
beckstein does not fit the typical profile of a csu politician .
he is a protestant in a party that has traditionally been dominated by catholics .
he hails from the northern bavarian region of franconia , while his predecessors have come from the south .
thirty years ago , beckstein 's background might have made it difficult to advance within the csu .
but those issues are irrelevant today , said gerhard hirscher , a political scientist with the hanns seidel foundation , a munich research institution supported by the csu .
" we 're in a time of competence politics , " hirscher said .
impeccable conservative credentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein -lrb- left -rrb- and huber unlike many of his compatriots , beckstein has managed to stay clear of personal and professional scandals .
he is close to his wife marga , considering her an important advisor .
the couple has three children .
beckstein 's law-and-order credentials will be important in the upcoming elections , patzelt predicts , since the views are popular in bavaria .
he ’ s seen as one of the more outspokenly conservative members of the csu .
his comments frequently draw criticism from opposition parties , immigrant rights groups and privacy advocates .
beckstein was criticized by muslims and social democrats in september when he suggested that law enforcement should keep tabs on germans who convert to islam .
the remarks came after two german converts to islam were arrested for allegedly taking part in a plot to bomb united states military installations and other targets in germany .
when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one , " beckstein told a german newspaper .
earlier , beckstein had said social democrats , who make up the liberal half of merkel 's ruling grand coalition , would share the blame for future terrorist attacks in germany .
the social democratic party has opposed conservatives ' plans to drastically widen security authorities ' access to personal data .
despite his reputation as a hardliner , beckstein is soft spoken in person and has the reputation of being a good boss , hirscher said .
" his track record in his political field is really very good . "
hirscher said .
if it 's not broken ...
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's economy is going strong bavaria is home to corporate giants like bmw and siemens .
in contrast to other german states , the economy there has performed well for several years and it 's unlikely that beckstein will decide on a drastic change in course .
he 'll likely carry forward plans stoiber put in place , experts say .
while the ruckus over stoiber 's departure caused a dip in the party 's popularity earlier this year , the latest polls show that the party has between 53 and 58 percent support among bavarians . the csu will aim to maintain its majority in the 2008 state elections .
after that , beckstein 's real test will be to make sure the csu has a good showing in the next round of european and national elections , currently planned for 2009 . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the party has controlled bavaria 's premiership since 1957 and during most of that time , has also had the state parliament in its hands with an absolute majority .
the csu is the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- sister party .
under a power-sharing agreement , merkel 's cdu does not seek office in bavaria and the csu does not venture out of bavaria .
chancellor angela merkel relies on the bavarian csu for votes in the federal parliament .
a little different bildunterschrift : beckstein has vocal critics beckstein will likely focus his energy on running bavaria and leave the politicking in berlin to huber . beckstein has been part of bavarian politics for such a long time that he was a natural choice for the job , said werner patzelt , a political science professor in dresden who studies german political parties .
beckstein does not fit the typical profile of a csu politician .
he is a protestant in a party that has traditionally been dominated by catholics .
he hails from the northern bavarian region of franconia , while his predecessors have come from the south .
thirty years ago , beckstein 's background might have made it difficult to advance within the csu .
but those issues are irrelevant today , said gerhard hirscher , a political scientist with the hanns seidel foundation , a munich research institution supported by the csu .
" we 're in a time of competence politics , " hirscher said .
impeccable conservative credentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein -lrb- left -rrb- and huber unlike many of his compatriots , beckstein has managed to stay clear of personal and professional scandals .
he is close to his wife marga , considering her an important advisor .
the couple has three children .
beckstein 's law-and-order credentials will be important in the upcoming elections , patzelt predicts , since the views are popular in bavaria .
he ’ s seen as one of the more outspokenly conservative members of the csu .
his comments frequently draw criticism from opposition parties , immigrant rights groups and privacy advocates .
beckstein was criticized by muslims and social democrats in september when he suggested that law enforcement should keep tabs on germans who convert to islam .
the remarks came after two german converts to islam were arrested for allegedly taking part in a plot to bomb united states military installations and other targets in germany .
when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one , " beckstein told a german newspaper .
earlier , beckstein had said social democrats , who make up the liberal half of merkel 's ruling grand coalition , would share the blame for future terrorist attacks in germany .
the social democratic party has opposed conservatives ' plans to drastically widen security authorities ' access to personal data .
despite his reputation as a hardliner , beckstein is soft spoken in person and has the reputation of being a good boss , hirscher said .
" his track record in his political field is really very good . "
hirscher said .

günther beckstein , a 63-year-old lawyer , is expected to stay the course after his election as state premier on tuesday , oct .
9 . günther beckstein , 63 , received 122 of 178 votes in the bavarian state parliament , which is dominated by his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
he built a reputation as a law-and-order man during his years as bavaria 's powerful , hard-line interior minister .
as premier of germany 's largest and wealthiest state , he 'll have to ensure that his own party toes the line if it wants to maintain its popularity .
the csu found itself in turmoil earlier this year .
edmund stoiber , the party 's charismatic premier and party chief , lost the confidence of his party after mishandling allegations that one of his aids had snooped into the personal life of a fellow csu politician .
once he announced his plans to step down in september , an unusually public power struggle broke out among those who wanted to succeed him as party chair .
bavarian economics minister erwin huber was eventually chosen .
it 's normal to have some disorder when a " dominating personality " like stoiber leaves the political scene , beckstein said .
but now party members need to form a " tidy combat order " and prepare a united front for next year 's elections , beckstein told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag .
beckstein consistently scores highest in opinion polls and will play an important role in the 2008 state elections .
observers have said he 's likely to carry on stoiber 's agenda .
" i will continue with the policies that have made bavaria the best , " he told a csu conference on saturday .

a recent tv documentary revealed that exploitation of nazi prisoners made the family what it is .
now they 're ready to uncover the past . the quandt family announced on friday , oct .
5 that they were planning a research project to look into their relatives ' activities during the nazi regime .
the move represents a dramatic u-turn in the family 's policy of silence on the issue over the past several decades . " the accusations that have been raised against our family have moved us , " family members said in a statement .
" we recognize that , in our history as a german business family , the years 1933 to 1945 have not been sufficiently cleared up . " indeed , the quandt family 's dark side had been forgotten for many years - until german broadcaster ndr came out with a documentary film , which premiered on sunday , sept .
30 at the hamburg film festival . prisoners contributed to war effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther quandt 's son herbert ran a subsidiary of afa , which may have also used forced labor in the film , which was broadcast later that sunday night on germany 's ard television station , former prisoners of the nazis shared stories of their work during the war years in the afa battery factory , owned by günter quandt .
though munitions were also produced in the factory , the batteries themselves were also vital to hitler 's war effort . the forced laborers who appeared in the documentary told of beatings , mistreatment , and death . historians suspect that günther quandt made use of forced labor as early as 1938 .
by 1941 , thousands of prisoners were working in his battery factories in hanover , berlin and vienna , which also produced munitions .
hundreds died .
evidence suggests there may have even been a concentration camp facility complete with execution grounds and gallows . quandt referred in an internal document to a " fluctuation " of 80 people - most likely the planned death rate , reported german daily süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goebbels and magda quandt are seen here at their marriage ceremony ; hitler -lrb- far right -rrb- was best man in addition to allegedly exploiting nazi prisoners , the quandts also had personal ties to the nazi regime .
günther quandts first wife , magda ritschel , remarried joseph goebbels , hitler 's future propaganda minister , in 1931 , two years after her divorce from the business giant .
magda brought her son , harald quandt , into the marriage and he lived together with her and goebbels .
while the goebbels committed suicide in 1945 after poisoning their own children , harald - who was not with them - survived . documentary presented clandestinely two journalists spent five years researching the startling documentary , which was broadcast unannounced and not until 11:30 p.m.
the german weekly der spiegel speculated that the broadcaster may have been afraid of the powerful quandt family , which owns 46.6 percent of bmw and large portions of numerous other firms , including altana .
an ard spokesman , however , said a desire to avoid legal injunction played no role . only one member of the family , sven quandt , actually appeared in the film . " we finally have to try to forget about it , " he told der spiegel .
" every family has its dark side , " added quandt when asked about his grandfather 's ill reputed battery factory . precisely to what extent quandt profited from the forced labor and how bad the conditions there really were will have to be cleared up over the course of the planned historical research . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but literary critics disagree as to whether it 's a page-turner or a bore . julia franck 's lady midday -lrb- die mittagsfrau -rrb- tells the story of a woman who abandons her son at a train station in the final years of the third reich .
the story was based in part on the life of franck 's father who was , in fact abandoned by his grandmother in 1945 .
in honoring franck 's novel , the jury called it " spellbinding in its verbal immediacy , storytelling energy and psychological intensity . "
the german book prize carries a cash award of 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- and is considered a major literary springboard - previous winners have been translated into other languages , including english .
franck is a 37-year-old mother of two who was born in the former communist east germany but moved to the west as a child .
lady midday is her fifth book .
precise or pretentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franck has a reputation for being earnest like most high-profile literary awards , the german book prize gives critics the chance to argue long-windedly about whether the winner is any good .
and lady midday has proved no exception - with reviewers more or less evenly split on its quality .
" she may reign in her style but she gives it sufficient cold space to breathe and to resonate in precise images , " wrote one critic in the daily newspaper die welt .
" she constructs an almost classical drama of stations . "
but others are far less impressed .
" the book is overrun with stereotypical figures from 1920s berlin , and there , especially where the dialogue is concerned , the ' narrative intensity ' lauded by the jury descends into pretension , imprecision and , sometimes , kitsch , " carped another critic in the daily berliner der tagesspiegel .

"
" he came to us citing personal reasons that seemed very plausible , " dfb spokesman jens grittner said in a statement .
dejagah was quoted by mass-circulation tabloid daily bz as saying his motive was cultural .
" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " he said in a report published tuesday .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "
dejagah was born in tehran , but later moved with his parents to germany .
he holds a german passport .
iranian citizens have been forbidden from traveling to israel ever since the 1979 islamic revolution , the point from which iran also began to refuse to recognize israel 's right to exist .
ex-bayern star pulled from tel aviv game in 2004 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vahid hashemian the under-21 star 's decision is not the first to bring the tensions of the middle east into german soccer .
former bayern munich striker vahid hashemian , now with hanover 96 , was pulled from the bayern squad to face israeli team maccabi tel aviv in a champions league game in 2004 .
although bayern cited a back injury as the reason for the iranian 's withdrawal , the potential visit proved controversial with opposition to hashemian 's involvement coming from iran 's national sporting body .
calls for exclusion from national team dejagah 's withdrawal has stirred controversy in germany .
bild , germany 's biggest-selling newspaper , called for dejagah 's exclusion from the national team , a call which was backed by friedbert pflüger , a leading member of the berlin branch of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : zwanziger said political views have no place in soccer dfb president theo zwanziger meanwhile made his own opposition clear in a statement .
" i respect the decision of the coaches not to travel with the player because they told me that the player stated private and appropriate reasons , " he said .
" however , my position and that of the dfb is clear : we will not accept that a german national player refuses to play in an international match for reasons associated with his views on world politics . "
the central council of the jews in germany responded with indignation to dejagah ’ s decision .
" it is inconceivable and impossible that a national player initiates his own private jewish boycott , " vice-president dieter graumann told german magazine der spiegel ’ s online portal .

"
grünberg and fert discovered in 1988 that minute magnetic changes in a gmr system lead to huge differences in electrical resistance .
these differences in turn cause changes in the current in the readout head , which scans a hard disk to spot the ones and zeroes in which the data is stored .
as a result , the readout head is able to read smaller and weaker magnetic areas - and this sensitivity means information can be packed more densely on the hard disk .
prize for practical application of nanotechnology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert fert is honored for his work on the miniature hard drive martin durrani , editor of physics world , a journal published by britain 's institute of physics , said the award was fitting .
" i am really pleased that it has gone for something very practically based and rooted in research relevant to industry , " he said .
" it shows that physics has a real relevance not just to understanding natural phenomena but to real products in everyday life . "
last year , the physics prize went to us space scientists john mather and george smoot for a pioneering space mission which supports the " big bang " theory about the origins of the universe .
grünberg and fert will be honored at a formal prize ceremony held as tradition dictates on dec .
10 , the anniversary of the death in 1896 of the prize 's creator , swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite alfred nobel .
the 2007 laureates will receive a gold medal , a diploma and 10 million swedish kronor -lrb- $ 1.53 million , 1.08 million euros -rrb- to be split between them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's not only irritated some spaniards , it 's brought forth appeals for broader categories about cultural identity . in a statement released on the eve of the event , the head of the german branch of the writers ' association pen , johano strasser , said he was concerned about the message that was being sent .
" as important as it is to bring individual cultures into a dialog with one another , there 's an equally great danger of provincialism , " strasser said .
" cultural identity politics is always a double-edged sword . "
nationalism , regionalism and vanity the choice of catalonia , the northeastern region in spain with some seven million inhabitants and its own language , catalan , has been controversial right from the start .
some spanish writers invited to participated have refused to come , objecting to catalan organizers ' original decision to invite only authors who wrote in catalan .
bildunterschrift : for some catalonians , guest culture status is a point of pride " almost all of the spanish-language authors , including those who are catalan , are not attending , " book fair director jürgen boos said at a press conference shortly before tuesday 's official opening ceremony .
" there are a whole range of reasons including nationalism , regionalism , and vanity .
i think this is a great pity , i would like to have had all of them here . "
but politicians from the semi-autonomous region have stressed their culture 's special role at the fair does not reinforce provincialism .
" we catalans are europeans , and that 's why we 've come to frankfurt , " the former president of the region , pasquall maragall , told the dpa news agency .
new record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt book fair is a must for everyone in the publishing industry neither the debate about diversity versus cosmopolitanism nor sluggish sales figures in the book industry have dampened publishers ' desire to participate in the frankfurt event .
the fair - already the largest of its kind in the world - has more exhibitors than ever before : 7448 compared with 7272 last year .
organizers also say they expect around 290,000 visitors , roughly the same as at the 2006 event .
the event proper kicks off for people in the industry on wednesday - doors are open to the general public on the weekend .

the attorneys argued that , in the past , courts had limited evidence to what could be legally presented instead of completely stopping cases dealing with national security . " the central facts of this case are not state secrets and do not become so simply because the government insists otherwise , " ben wizner of the american civil liberties union wrote in the appeal . european criticism el-masri 's accusations sparked outrage in germany and drew worldwide attention to the cia 's " extraordinary rendition " program , which transported terror suspects to secret prisons in third countries for interrogation .

the us administration also has asserted the so-called state secrets privilege in an effort to dismiss the lawsuits over the warrantless domestic spying program that president george w. bush created after the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 09.10.2007 günther beckstein sworn in as new bavarian premier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein is the new face of bavaria the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has ruled bavaria for 50 years .
günther beckstein , a 63-year-old lawyer , is expected to stay the course after his election as state premier on tuesday , oct .
9 . günther beckstein , 63 , received 122 of 178 votes in the bavarian state parliament , which is dominated by his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
he built a reputation as a law-and-order man during his years as bavaria 's powerful , hard-line interior minister .
as premier of germany 's largest and wealthiest state , he 'll have to ensure that his own party toes the line if it wants to maintain its popularity .
the csu found itself in turmoil earlier this year .
edmund stoiber , the party 's charismatic premier and party chief , lost the confidence of his party after mishandling allegations that one of his aids had snooped into the personal life of a fellow csu politician .
once he announced his plans to step down in september , an unusually public power struggle broke out among those who wanted to succeed him as party chair .
bavarian economics minister erwin huber was eventually chosen .
it 's normal to have some disorder when a " dominating personality " like stoiber leaves the political scene , beckstein said .
but now party members need to form a " tidy combat order " and prepare a united front for next year 's elections , beckstein told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag .
beckstein consistently scores highest in opinion polls and will play an important role in the 2008 state elections .
observers have said he 's likely to carry on stoiber 's agenda .
" i will continue with the policies that have made bavaria the best , " he told a csu conference on saturday .
high-profile post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber is out the bavarian premier is a symbolic successor to the former kings of bavaria .
while the royal perks are limited to using the region 's palaces for state business , the premier does have a high profile in europe because of the state 's economic might .
the csu has been bavaria 's governing - or as some might say " ruling " - party for the last half century .
the party has controlled bavaria 's premiership since 1957 and during most of that time , has also had the state parliament in its hands with an absolute majority .
the csu is the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- sister party .
under a power-sharing agreement , merkel 's cdu does not seek office in bavaria and the csu does not venture out of bavaria .
chancellor angela merkel relies on the bavarian csu for votes in the federal parliament .
a little different bildunterschrift : beckstein has vocal critics beckstein will likely focus his energy on running bavaria and leave the politicking in berlin to huber . beckstein has been part of bavarian politics for such a long time that he was a natural choice for the job , said werner patzelt , a political science professor in dresden who studies german political parties .
beckstein does not fit the typical profile of a csu politician .
he is a protestant in a party that has traditionally been dominated by catholics .
he hails from the northern bavarian region of franconia , while his predecessors have come from the south .
thirty years ago , beckstein 's background might have made it difficult to advance within the csu .
but those issues are irrelevant today , said gerhard hirscher , a political scientist with the hanns seidel foundation , a munich research institution supported by the csu .
" we 're in a time of competence politics , " hirscher said .
impeccable conservative credentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein -lrb- left -rrb- and huber unlike many of his compatriots , beckstein has managed to stay clear of personal and professional scandals .
he is close to his wife marga , considering her an important advisor .
the couple has three children .
beckstein 's law-and-order credentials will be important in the upcoming elections , patzelt predicts , since the views are popular in bavaria .
he ’ s seen as one of the more outspokenly conservative members of the csu .
his comments frequently draw criticism from opposition parties , immigrant rights groups and privacy advocates .
beckstein was criticized by muslims and social democrats in september when he suggested that law enforcement should keep tabs on germans who convert to islam .
the remarks came after two german converts to islam were arrested for allegedly taking part in a plot to bomb united states military installations and other targets in germany .
when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one , " beckstein told a german newspaper .
earlier , beckstein had said social democrats , who make up the liberal half of merkel 's ruling grand coalition , would share the blame for future terrorist attacks in germany .
the social democratic party has opposed conservatives ' plans to drastically widen security authorities ' access to personal data .
despite his reputation as a hardliner , beckstein is soft spoken in person and has the reputation of being a good boss , hirscher said .
" his track record in his political field is really very good . "
hirscher said .
if it 's not broken ...
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's economy is going strong bavaria is home to corporate giants like bmw and siemens .
in contrast to other german states , the economy there has performed well for several years and it 's unlikely that beckstein will decide on a drastic change in course .
he 'll likely carry forward plans stoiber put in place , experts say .
while the ruckus over stoiber 's departure caused a dip in the party 's popularity earlier this year , the latest polls show that the party has between 53 and 58 percent support among bavarians . the csu will aim to maintain its majority in the 2008 state elections .
after that , beckstein 's real test will be to make sure the csu has a good showing in the next round of european and national elections , currently planned for 2009 . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the csu is the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- sister party .
under a power-sharing agreement , merkel 's cdu does not seek office in bavaria and the csu does not venture out of bavaria .
chancellor angela merkel relies on the bavarian csu for votes in the federal parliament .
a little different bildunterschrift : beckstein has vocal critics beckstein will likely focus his energy on running bavaria and leave the politicking in berlin to huber . beckstein has been part of bavarian politics for such a long time that he was a natural choice for the job , said werner patzelt , a political science professor in dresden who studies german political parties .
beckstein does not fit the typical profile of a csu politician .
he is a protestant in a party that has traditionally been dominated by catholics .
he hails from the northern bavarian region of franconia , while his predecessors have come from the south .
thirty years ago , beckstein 's background might have made it difficult to advance within the csu .
but those issues are irrelevant today , said gerhard hirscher , a political scientist with the hanns seidel foundation , a munich research institution supported by the csu .
" we 're in a time of competence politics , " hirscher said .
impeccable conservative credentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein -lrb- left -rrb- and huber unlike many of his compatriots , beckstein has managed to stay clear of personal and professional scandals .
he is close to his wife marga , considering her an important advisor .
the couple has three children .
beckstein 's law-and-order credentials will be important in the upcoming elections , patzelt predicts , since the views are popular in bavaria .
he ’ s seen as one of the more outspokenly conservative members of the csu .
his comments frequently draw criticism from opposition parties , immigrant rights groups and privacy advocates .
beckstein was criticized by muslims and social democrats in september when he suggested that law enforcement should keep tabs on germans who convert to islam .
the remarks came after two german converts to islam were arrested for allegedly taking part in a plot to bomb united states military installations and other targets in germany .
when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one , " beckstein told a german newspaper .
earlier , beckstein had said social democrats , who make up the liberal half of merkel 's ruling grand coalition , would share the blame for future terrorist attacks in germany .
the social democratic party has opposed conservatives ' plans to drastically widen security authorities ' access to personal data .
despite his reputation as a hardliner , beckstein is soft spoken in person and has the reputation of being a good boss , hirscher said .
" his track record in his political field is really very good . "
hirscher said .

günther beckstein , a 63-year-old lawyer , is expected to stay the course after his election as state premier on tuesday , oct .
9 . günther beckstein , 63 , received 122 of 178 votes in the bavarian state parliament , which is dominated by his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
he built a reputation as a law-and-order man during his years as bavaria 's powerful , hard-line interior minister .
as premier of germany 's largest and wealthiest state , he 'll have to ensure that his own party toes the line if it wants to maintain its popularity .
the csu found itself in turmoil earlier this year .
edmund stoiber , the party 's charismatic premier and party chief , lost the confidence of his party after mishandling allegations that one of his aids had snooped into the personal life of a fellow csu politician .
once he announced his plans to step down in september , an unusually public power struggle broke out among those who wanted to succeed him as party chair .
bavarian economics minister erwin huber was eventually chosen .
it 's normal to have some disorder when a " dominating personality " like stoiber leaves the political scene , beckstein said .
but now party members need to form a " tidy combat order " and prepare a united front for next year 's elections , beckstein told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag .
beckstein consistently scores highest in opinion polls and will play an important role in the 2008 state elections .
observers have said he 's likely to carry on stoiber 's agenda .
" i will continue with the policies that have made bavaria the best , " he told a csu conference on saturday .
high-profile post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber is out the bavarian premier is a symbolic successor to the former kings of bavaria .
while the royal perks are limited to using the region 's palaces for state business , the premier does have a high profile in europe because of the state 's economic might .

but literary critics disagree as to whether it 's a page-turner or a bore . julia franck 's lady midday -lrb- die mittagsfrau -rrb- tells the story of a woman who abandons her son at a train station in the final years of the third reich .
the story was based in part on the life of franck 's father who was , in fact abandoned by his grandmother in 1945 .
in honoring franck 's novel , the jury called it " spellbinding in its verbal immediacy , storytelling energy and psychological intensity . "
the german book prize carries a cash award of 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- and is considered a major literary springboard - previous winners have been translated into other languages , including english .
franck is a 37-year-old mother of two who was born in the former communist east germany but moved to the west as a child .
lady midday is her fifth book .
precise or pretentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franck has a reputation for being earnest like most high-profile literary awards , the german book prize gives critics the chance to argue long-windedly about whether the winner is any good .
and lady midday has proved no exception - with reviewers more or less evenly split on its quality .
" she may reign in her style but she gives it sufficient cold space to breathe and to resonate in precise images , " wrote one critic in the daily newspaper die welt .
" she constructs an almost classical drama of stations . "
but others are far less impressed .
" the book is overrun with stereotypical figures from 1920s berlin , and there , especially where the dialogue is concerned , the ' narrative intensity ' lauded by the jury descends into pretension , imprecision and , sometimes , kitsch , " carped another critic in the daily berliner der tagesspiegel .
franck will surely be the subject of further discussion at the frankfurt book fair , which starts on tuesday evening . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
grünberg and fert discovered in 1988 that minute magnetic changes in a gmr system lead to huge differences in electrical resistance .
these differences in turn cause changes in the current in the readout head , which scans a hard disk to spot the ones and zeroes in which the data is stored .
as a result , the readout head is able to read smaller and weaker magnetic areas - and this sensitivity means information can be packed more densely on the hard disk .

" i am really pleased that it has gone for something very practically based and rooted in research relevant to industry , " he said .
" it shows that physics has a real relevance not just to understanding natural phenomena but to real products in everyday life . "

" complaints like this are always the last resort when all the political measures have been exhausted , " dieter ameling , president of the german steel federation , said .
china , which was the world 's biggest importer of steel in 2004 , has since become the world 's biggest exporter and is now responsible for 34 percent of the world 's steel production .
environmental and quality standards questioned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german steel firms feel their product is being under cut european producers accuse chinese factories of failing to respect the environment and making poor quality steel .

ameling said that " instead of exporting the steel that is produced in china at great cost to the environment , it would be better if the chinese withdrew their polluting products from the market . "
zhang xiaogang , chairman of the china iron and steel association , responded by telling the conference that inefficient steel mills would be closed by the end of the decade in a move towards consolidation .

"
" he came to us citing personal reasons that seemed very plausible , " dfb spokesman jens grittner said in a statement .
dejagah was quoted by mass-circulation tabloid daily bz as saying his motive was cultural .
" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " he said in a report published tuesday .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "
dejagah was born in tehran , but later moved with his parents to germany .
he holds a german passport .
iranian citizens have been forbidden from traveling to israel ever since the 1979 islamic revolution , the point from which iran also began to refuse to recognize israel 's right to exist .
ex-bayern star pulled from tel aviv game in 2004 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vahid hashemian the under-21 star 's decision is not the first to bring the tensions of the middle east into german soccer .
former bayern munich striker vahid hashemian , now with hanover 96 , was pulled from the bayern squad to face israeli team maccabi tel aviv in a champions league game in 2004 .
although bayern cited a back injury as the reason for the iranian 's withdrawal , the potential visit proved controversial with opposition to hashemian 's involvement coming from iran 's national sporting body .
calls for exclusion from national team dejagah 's withdrawal has stirred controversy in germany .
bild , germany 's biggest-selling newspaper , called for dejagah 's exclusion from the national team , a call which was backed by friedbert pflüger , a leading member of the berlin branch of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : zwanziger said political views have no place in soccer dfb president theo zwanziger meanwhile made his own opposition clear in a statement .
" i respect the decision of the coaches not to travel with the player because they told me that the player stated private and appropriate reasons , " he said .
" however , my position and that of the dfb is clear : we will not accept that a german national player refuses to play in an international match for reasons associated with his views on world politics . "
the central council of the jews in germany responded with indignation to dejagah ’ s decision .
" it is inconceivable and impossible that a national player initiates his own private jewish boycott , " vice-president dieter graumann told german magazine der spiegel ’ s online portal .

that 's not only irritated some spaniards , it 's brought forth appeals for broader categories about cultural identity . in a statement released on the eve of the event , the head of the german branch of the writers ' association pen , johano strasser , said he was concerned about the message that was being sent .
" as important as it is to bring individual cultures into a dialog with one another , there 's an equally great danger of provincialism , " strasser said .
" cultural identity politics is always a double-edged sword . "
nationalism , regionalism and vanity the choice of catalonia , the northeastern region in spain with some seven million inhabitants and its own language , catalan , has been controversial right from the start .
some spanish writers invited to participated have refused to come , objecting to catalan organizers ' original decision to invite only authors who wrote in catalan .
bildunterschrift : for some catalonians , guest culture status is a point of pride " almost all of the spanish-language authors , including those who are catalan , are not attending , " book fair director jürgen boos said at a press conference shortly before tuesday 's official opening ceremony .
" there are a whole range of reasons including nationalism , regionalism , and vanity .
i think this is a great pity , i would like to have had all of them here . "
but politicians from the semi-autonomous region have stressed their culture 's special role at the fair does not reinforce provincialism .
" we catalans are europeans , and that 's why we 've come to frankfurt , " the former president of the region , pasquall maragall , told the dpa news agency .
new record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt book fair is a must for everyone in the publishing industry neither the debate about diversity versus cosmopolitanism nor sluggish sales figures in the book industry have dampened publishers ' desire to participate in the frankfurt event .
the fair - already the largest of its kind in the world - has more exhibitors than ever before : 7448 compared with 7272 last year .
organizers also say they expect around 290,000 visitors , roughly the same as at the 2006 event .

" complaints like this are always the last resort when all the political measures have been exhausted , " dieter ameling , president of the german steel federation , said .
china , which was the world 's biggest importer of steel in 2004 , has since become the world 's biggest exporter and is now responsible for 34 percent of the world 's steel production .
environmental and quality standards questioned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german steel firms feel their product is being under cut european producers accuse chinese factories of failing to respect the environment and making poor quality steel .
the europeans also complain that about the large subsidies the state-run chinese steel companies receive .
" it is a situation of state-run production , while in the rest of the world steel is produced by private companies designed to create value , " said karl-ulrich koehler , the head of germany 's thyssenkrupp steel , the world 's tenth-biggest producer .
ameling said that " instead of exporting the steel that is produced in china at great cost to the environment , it would be better if the chinese withdrew their polluting products from the market . "
zhang xiaogang , chairman of the china iron and steel association , responded by telling the conference that inefficient steel mills would be closed by the end of the decade in a move towards consolidation .
" by 2010 , the iron and steel enterprises will be decreased greatly in number and production by the top 10 enterprise groups in the country will make up over 50 percent of gross crude steel production in china , " he said .
demand for steel expected to increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's economy will be one of those driving steel demand the international iron and steel institute -lrb- iisi -rrb- , which is hosting the conference , said in its latest forecast on monday that global demand for steel will keep growing next year in response to strong economies in china , africa and the middle east .
iisi expected steel demand to grow by 6.8 percent this year and by around the same level in 2008 , slightly more than a forecast earlier this year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
grünberg and fert discovered in 1988 that minute magnetic changes in a gmr system lead to huge differences in electrical resistance .
these differences in turn cause changes in the current in the readout head , which scans a hard disk to spot the ones and zeroes in which the data is stored .
as a result , the readout head is able to read smaller and weaker magnetic areas - and this sensitivity means information can be packed more densely on the hard disk .
prize for practical application of nanotechnology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert fert is honored for his work on the miniature hard drive martin durrani , editor of physics world , a journal published by britain 's institute of physics , said the award was fitting .
" i am really pleased that it has gone for something very practically based and rooted in research relevant to industry , " he said .
" it shows that physics has a real relevance not just to understanding natural phenomena but to real products in everyday life . "
last year , the physics prize went to us space scientists john mather and george smoot for a pioneering space mission which supports the " big bang " theory about the origins of the universe .
grünberg and fert will be honored at a formal prize ceremony held as tradition dictates on dec .
10 , the anniversary of the death in 1896 of the prize 's creator , swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite alfred nobel .
the 2007 laureates will receive a gold medal , a diploma and 10 million swedish kronor -lrb- $ 1.53 million , 1.08 million euros -rrb- to be split between them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now they 're ready to uncover the past . the quandt family announced on friday , oct .
5 that they were planning a research project to look into their relatives ' activities during the nazi regime .
the move represents a dramatic u-turn in the family 's policy of silence on the issue over the past several decades . " the accusations that have been raised against our family have moved us , " family members said in a statement .
" we recognize that , in our history as a german business family , the years 1933 to 1945 have not been sufficiently cleared up . " indeed , the quandt family 's dark side had been forgotten for many years - until german broadcaster ndr came out with a documentary film , which premiered on sunday , sept .
30 at the hamburg film festival . prisoners contributed to war effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther quandt 's son herbert ran a subsidiary of afa , which may have also used forced labor in the film , which was broadcast later that sunday night on germany 's ard television station , former prisoners of the nazis shared stories of their work during the war years in the afa battery factory , owned by günter quandt .
though munitions were also produced in the factory , the batteries themselves were also vital to hitler 's war effort . the forced laborers who appeared in the documentary told of beatings , mistreatment , and death . historians suspect that günther quandt made use of forced labor as early as 1938 .
by 1941 , thousands of prisoners were working in his battery factories in hanover , berlin and vienna , which also produced munitions .
hundreds died .
evidence suggests there may have even been a concentration camp facility complete with execution grounds and gallows . quandt referred in an internal document to a " fluctuation " of 80 people - most likely the planned death rate , reported german daily süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goebbels and magda quandt are seen here at their marriage ceremony ; hitler -lrb- far right -rrb- was best man in addition to allegedly exploiting nazi prisoners , the quandts also had personal ties to the nazi regime .
günther quandts first wife , magda ritschel , remarried joseph goebbels , hitler 's future propaganda minister , in 1931 , two years after her divorce from the business giant .
magda brought her son , harald quandt , into the marriage and he lived together with her and goebbels .
while the goebbels committed suicide in 1945 after poisoning their own children , harald - who was not with them - survived . documentary presented clandestinely two journalists spent five years researching the startling documentary , which was broadcast unannounced and not until 11:30 p.m.
the german weekly der spiegel speculated that the broadcaster may have been afraid of the powerful quandt family , which owns 46.6 percent of bmw and large portions of numerous other firms , including altana .
an ard spokesman , however , said a desire to avoid legal injunction played no role . only one member of the family , sven quandt , actually appeared in the film . " we finally have to try to forget about it , " he told der spiegel .
" every family has its dark side , " added quandt when asked about his grandfather 's ill reputed battery factory . precisely to what extent quandt profited from the forced labor and how bad the conditions there really were will have to be cleared up over the course of the planned historical research . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's not only irritated some spaniards , it 's brought forth appeals for broader categories about cultural identity . in a statement released on the eve of the event , the head of the german branch of the writers ' association pen , johano strasser , said he was concerned about the message that was being sent .
" as important as it is to bring individual cultures into a dialog with one another , there 's an equally great danger of provincialism , " strasser said .
" cultural identity politics is always a double-edged sword . "
nationalism , regionalism and vanity the choice of catalonia , the northeastern region in spain with some seven million inhabitants and its own language , catalan , has been controversial right from the start .
some spanish writers invited to participated have refused to come , objecting to catalan organizers ' original decision to invite only authors who wrote in catalan .
bildunterschrift : for some catalonians , guest culture status is a point of pride " almost all of the spanish-language authors , including those who are catalan , are not attending , " book fair director jürgen boos said at a press conference shortly before tuesday 's official opening ceremony .
" there are a whole range of reasons including nationalism , regionalism , and vanity .
i think this is a great pity , i would like to have had all of them here . "
but politicians from the semi-autonomous region have stressed their culture 's special role at the fair does not reinforce provincialism .
" we catalans are europeans , and that 's why we 've come to frankfurt , " the former president of the region , pasquall maragall , told the dpa news agency .

the move represents a dramatic u-turn in the family 's policy of silence on the issue over the past several decades . " the accusations that have been raised against our family have moved us , " family members said in a statement .
" we recognize that , in our history as a german business family , the years 1933 to 1945 have not been sufficiently cleared up .

though munitions were also produced in the factory , the batteries themselves were also vital to hitler 's war effort . the forced laborers who appeared in the documentary told of beatings , mistreatment , and death . historians suspect that günther quandt made use of forced labor as early as 1938 .
by 1941 , thousands of prisoners were working in his battery factories in hanover , berlin and vienna , which also produced munitions .

günther quandts first wife , magda ritschel , remarried joseph goebbels , hitler 's future propaganda minister , in 1931 , two years after her divorce from the business giant .
magda brought her son , harald quandt , into the marriage and he lived together with her and goebbels .

though munitions were also produced in the factory , the batteries themselves were also vital to hitler 's war effort . the forced laborers who appeared in the documentary told of beatings , mistreatment , and death . historians suspect that günther quandt made use of forced labor as early as 1938 .
by 1941 , thousands of prisoners were working in his battery factories in hanover , berlin and vienna , which also produced munitions .
hundreds died .
evidence suggests there may have even been a concentration camp facility complete with execution grounds and gallows . quandt referred in an internal document to a " fluctuation " of 80 people - most likely the planned death rate , reported german daily süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goebbels and magda quandt are seen here at their marriage ceremony ; hitler -lrb- far right -rrb- was best man in addition to allegedly exploiting nazi prisoners , the quandts also had personal ties to the nazi regime .
günther quandts first wife , magda ritschel , remarried joseph goebbels , hitler 's future propaganda minister , in 1931 , two years after her divorce from the business giant .
magda brought her son , harald quandt , into the marriage and he lived together with her and goebbels .
while the goebbels committed suicide in 1945 after poisoning their own children , harald - who was not with them - survived . documentary presented clandestinely two journalists spent five years researching the startling documentary , which was broadcast unannounced and not until 11:30 p.m.
the german weekly der spiegel speculated that the broadcaster may have been afraid of the powerful quandt family , which owns 46.6 percent of bmw and large portions of numerous other firms , including altana .
an ard spokesman , however , said a desire to avoid legal injunction played no role . only one member of the family , sven quandt , actually appeared in the film . " we finally have to try to forget about it , " he told der spiegel .
" every family has its dark side , " added quandt when asked about his grandfather 's ill reputed battery factory . precisely to what extent quandt profited from the forced labor and how bad the conditions there really were will have to be cleared up over the course of the planned historical research . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 09.10.2007 günther beckstein sworn in as new bavarian premier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein is the new face of bavaria the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has ruled bavaria for 50 years .
günther beckstein , a 63-year-old lawyer , is expected to stay the course after his election as state premier on tuesday , oct .
9 . günther beckstein , 63 , received 122 of 178 votes in the bavarian state parliament , which is dominated by his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
he built a reputation as a law-and-order man during his years as bavaria 's powerful , hard-line interior minister .
as premier of germany 's largest and wealthiest state , he 'll have to ensure that his own party toes the line if it wants to maintain its popularity .
the csu found itself in turmoil earlier this year .
edmund stoiber , the party 's charismatic premier and party chief , lost the confidence of his party after mishandling allegations that one of his aids had snooped into the personal life of a fellow csu politician .
once he announced his plans to step down in september , an unusually public power struggle broke out among those who wanted to succeed him as party chair .
bavarian economics minister erwin huber was eventually chosen .
it 's normal to have some disorder when a " dominating personality " like stoiber leaves the political scene , beckstein said .
but now party members need to form a " tidy combat order " and prepare a united front for next year 's elections , beckstein told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag .
beckstein consistently scores highest in opinion polls and will play an important role in the 2008 state elections .
observers have said he 's likely to carry on stoiber 's agenda .
" i will continue with the policies that have made bavaria the best , " he told a csu conference on saturday .
high-profile post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber is out the bavarian premier is a symbolic successor to the former kings of bavaria .
while the royal perks are limited to using the region 's palaces for state business , the premier does have a high profile in europe because of the state 's economic might .
the csu has been bavaria 's governing - or as some might say " ruling " - party for the last half century .
the party has controlled bavaria 's premiership since 1957 and during most of that time , has also had the state parliament in its hands with an absolute majority .
the csu is the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- sister party .
under a power-sharing agreement , merkel 's cdu does not seek office in bavaria and the csu does not venture out of bavaria .
chancellor angela merkel relies on the bavarian csu for votes in the federal parliament .
a little different bildunterschrift : beckstein has vocal critics beckstein will likely focus his energy on running bavaria and leave the politicking in berlin to huber . beckstein has been part of bavarian politics for such a long time that he was a natural choice for the job , said werner patzelt , a political science professor in dresden who studies german political parties .
beckstein does not fit the typical profile of a csu politician .
he is a protestant in a party that has traditionally been dominated by catholics .
he hails from the northern bavarian region of franconia , while his predecessors have come from the south .
thirty years ago , beckstein 's background might have made it difficult to advance within the csu .
but those issues are irrelevant today , said gerhard hirscher , a political scientist with the hanns seidel foundation , a munich research institution supported by the csu .
" we 're in a time of competence politics , " hirscher said .
impeccable conservative credentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein -lrb- left -rrb- and huber unlike many of his compatriots , beckstein has managed to stay clear of personal and professional scandals .
he is close to his wife marga , considering her an important advisor .
the couple has three children .
beckstein 's law-and-order credentials will be important in the upcoming elections , patzelt predicts , since the views are popular in bavaria .
he ’ s seen as one of the more outspokenly conservative members of the csu .
his comments frequently draw criticism from opposition parties , immigrant rights groups and privacy advocates .
beckstein was criticized by muslims and social democrats in september when he suggested that law enforcement should keep tabs on germans who convert to islam .
the remarks came after two german converts to islam were arrested for allegedly taking part in a plot to bomb united states military installations and other targets in germany .
when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one , " beckstein told a german newspaper .
earlier , beckstein had said social democrats , who make up the liberal half of merkel 's ruling grand coalition , would share the blame for future terrorist attacks in germany .
the social democratic party has opposed conservatives ' plans to drastically widen security authorities ' access to personal data .
despite his reputation as a hardliner , beckstein is soft spoken in person and has the reputation of being a good boss , hirscher said .
" his track record in his political field is really very good . "
hirscher said .
if it 's not broken ...
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's economy is going strong bavaria is home to corporate giants like bmw and siemens .
in contrast to other german states , the economy there has performed well for several years and it 's unlikely that beckstein will decide on a drastic change in course .
he 'll likely carry forward plans stoiber put in place , experts say .
while the ruckus over stoiber 's departure caused a dip in the party 's popularity earlier this year , the latest polls show that the party has between 53 and 58 percent support among bavarians . the csu will aim to maintain its majority in the 2008 state elections .
after that , beckstein 's real test will be to make sure the csu has a good showing in the next round of european and national elections , currently planned for 2009 . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" complaints like this are always the last resort when all the political measures have been exhausted , " dieter ameling , president of the german steel federation , said .
china , which was the world 's biggest importer of steel in 2004 , has since become the world 's biggest exporter and is now responsible for 34 percent of the world 's steel production .
environmental and quality standards questioned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german steel firms feel their product is being under cut european producers accuse chinese factories of failing to respect the environment and making poor quality steel .
the europeans also complain that about the large subsidies the state-run chinese steel companies receive .
" it is a situation of state-run production , while in the rest of the world steel is produced by private companies designed to create value , " said karl-ulrich koehler , the head of germany 's thyssenkrupp steel , the world 's tenth-biggest producer .
ameling said that " instead of exporting the steel that is produced in china at great cost to the environment , it would be better if the chinese withdrew their polluting products from the market . "
zhang xiaogang , chairman of the china iron and steel association , responded by telling the conference that inefficient steel mills would be closed by the end of the decade in a move towards consolidation .
" by 2010 , the iron and steel enterprises will be decreased greatly in number and production by the top 10 enterprise groups in the country will make up over 50 percent of gross crude steel production in china , " he said .
demand for steel expected to increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's economy will be one of those driving steel demand the international iron and steel institute -lrb- iisi -rrb- , which is hosting the conference , said in its latest forecast on monday that global demand for steel will keep growing next year in response to strong economies in china , africa and the middle east .
iisi expected steel demand to grow by 6.8 percent this year and by around the same level in 2008 , slightly more than a forecast earlier this year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 09.10.2007 günther beckstein sworn in as new bavarian premier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein is the new face of bavaria the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has ruled bavaria for 50 years .
günther beckstein , a 63-year-old lawyer , is expected to stay the course after his election as state premier on tuesday , oct .
9 . günther beckstein , 63 , received 122 of 178 votes in the bavarian state parliament , which is dominated by his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
he built a reputation as a law-and-order man during his years as bavaria 's powerful , hard-line interior minister .
as premier of germany 's largest and wealthiest state , he 'll have to ensure that his own party toes the line if it wants to maintain its popularity .
the csu found itself in turmoil earlier this year .
edmund stoiber , the party 's charismatic premier and party chief , lost the confidence of his party after mishandling allegations that one of his aids had snooped into the personal life of a fellow csu politician .
once he announced his plans to step down in september , an unusually public power struggle broke out among those who wanted to succeed him as party chair .
bavarian economics minister erwin huber was eventually chosen .
it 's normal to have some disorder when a " dominating personality " like stoiber leaves the political scene , beckstein said .
but now party members need to form a " tidy combat order " and prepare a united front for next year 's elections , beckstein told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag .
beckstein consistently scores highest in opinion polls and will play an important role in the 2008 state elections .
observers have said he 's likely to carry on stoiber 's agenda .
" i will continue with the policies that have made bavaria the best , " he told a csu conference on saturday .
high-profile post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber is out the bavarian premier is a symbolic successor to the former kings of bavaria .
while the royal perks are limited to using the region 's palaces for state business , the premier does have a high profile in europe because of the state 's economic might .
the csu has been bavaria 's governing - or as some might say " ruling " - party for the last half century .
the party has controlled bavaria 's premiership since 1957 and during most of that time , has also had the state parliament in its hands with an absolute majority .
the csu is the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- sister party .
under a power-sharing agreement , merkel 's cdu does not seek office in bavaria and the csu does not venture out of bavaria .
chancellor angela merkel relies on the bavarian csu for votes in the federal parliament .
a little different bildunterschrift : beckstein has vocal critics beckstein will likely focus his energy on running bavaria and leave the politicking in berlin to huber . beckstein has been part of bavarian politics for such a long time that he was a natural choice for the job , said werner patzelt , a political science professor in dresden who studies german political parties .
beckstein does not fit the typical profile of a csu politician .
he is a protestant in a party that has traditionally been dominated by catholics .
he hails from the northern bavarian region of franconia , while his predecessors have come from the south .
thirty years ago , beckstein 's background might have made it difficult to advance within the csu .
but those issues are irrelevant today , said gerhard hirscher , a political scientist with the hanns seidel foundation , a munich research institution supported by the csu .
" we 're in a time of competence politics , " hirscher said .
impeccable conservative credentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein -lrb- left -rrb- and huber unlike many of his compatriots , beckstein has managed to stay clear of personal and professional scandals .
he is close to his wife marga , considering her an important advisor .
the couple has three children .
beckstein 's law-and-order credentials will be important in the upcoming elections , patzelt predicts , since the views are popular in bavaria .
he ’ s seen as one of the more outspokenly conservative members of the csu .
his comments frequently draw criticism from opposition parties , immigrant rights groups and privacy advocates .
beckstein was criticized by muslims and social democrats in september when he suggested that law enforcement should keep tabs on germans who convert to islam .
the remarks came after two german converts to islam were arrested for allegedly taking part in a plot to bomb united states military installations and other targets in germany .
when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one , " beckstein told a german newspaper .
earlier , beckstein had said social democrats , who make up the liberal half of merkel 's ruling grand coalition , would share the blame for future terrorist attacks in germany .
the social democratic party has opposed conservatives ' plans to drastically widen security authorities ' access to personal data .
despite his reputation as a hardliner , beckstein is soft spoken in person and has the reputation of being a good boss , hirscher said .
" his track record in his political field is really very good . "
hirscher said .
if it 's not broken ...
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's economy is going strong bavaria is home to corporate giants like bmw and siemens .
in contrast to other german states , the economy there has performed well for several years and it 's unlikely that beckstein will decide on a drastic change in course .
he 'll likely carry forward plans stoiber put in place , experts say .
while the ruckus over stoiber 's departure caused a dip in the party 's popularity earlier this year , the latest polls show that the party has between 53 and 58 percent support among bavarians . the csu will aim to maintain its majority in the 2008 state elections .
after that , beckstein 's real test will be to make sure the csu has a good showing in the next round of european and national elections , currently planned for 2009 . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
" he came to us citing personal reasons that seemed very plausible , " dfb spokesman jens grittner said in a statement .
dejagah was quoted by mass-circulation tabloid daily bz as saying his motive was cultural .
" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " he said in a report published tuesday .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "
dejagah was born in tehran , but later moved with his parents to germany .
he holds a german passport .
iranian citizens have been forbidden from traveling to israel ever since the 1979 islamic revolution , the point from which iran also began to refuse to recognize israel 's right to exist .
ex-bayern star pulled from tel aviv game in 2004 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vahid hashemian the under-21 star 's decision is not the first to bring the tensions of the middle east into german soccer .
former bayern munich striker vahid hashemian , now with hanover 96 , was pulled from the bayern squad to face israeli team maccabi tel aviv in a champions league game in 2004 .
although bayern cited a back injury as the reason for the iranian 's withdrawal , the potential visit proved controversial with opposition to hashemian 's involvement coming from iran 's national sporting body .
calls for exclusion from national team dejagah 's withdrawal has stirred controversy in germany .
bild , germany 's biggest-selling newspaper , called for dejagah 's exclusion from the national team , a call which was backed by friedbert pflüger , a leading member of the berlin branch of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : zwanziger said political views have no place in soccer dfb president theo zwanziger meanwhile made his own opposition clear in a statement .
" i respect the decision of the coaches not to travel with the player because they told me that the player stated private and appropriate reasons , " he said .
" however , my position and that of the dfb is clear : we will not accept that a german national player refuses to play in an international match for reasons associated with his views on world politics . "
the central council of the jews in germany responded with indignation to dejagah ’ s decision .
" it is inconceivable and impossible that a national player initiates his own private jewish boycott , " vice-president dieter graumann told german magazine der spiegel ’ s online portal .
" it would be scandalous if the dfb does not take action . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 , to refuse the appeal of khaled el-masri , a lebanese-born german .
us administration officials had called on the court to reject the case on national security grounds , arguing a public trial would reveal state secrets . " we are very disappointed , " el-masri 's german lawyer manfred gnjidic said of the decision , according to the associated press .
" this is going to completely shake all confidence in the american justice system .

the attorneys argued that , in the past , courts had limited evidence to what could be legally presented instead of completely stopping cases dealing with national security . " the central facts of this case are not state secrets and do not become so simply because the government insists otherwise , " ben wizner of the american civil liberties union wrote in the appeal . european criticism el-masri 's accusations sparked outrage in germany and drew worldwide attention to the cia 's " extraordinary rendition " program , which transported terror suspects to secret prisons in third countries for interrogation .
human rights groups , as well as several european governments and the european union have criticized the program . both the german government and the european parliament launched inquires into the program to find out what their authorities may have known about the us rendition program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extraordinary rendition program moved terror suspects over national borders for interrogation a german court in southern munich in january issued arrest warrants for 13 suspects in el-masri 's alleged kidnapping , but federal officials in berlin said in september that they would not pursue the suspects ' extradition to germany . el-masri accused the cia of kidnapping him on dec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 09.10.2007 günther beckstein sworn in as new bavarian premier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein is the new face of bavaria the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has ruled bavaria for 50 years .
günther beckstein , a 63-year-old lawyer , is expected to stay the course after his election as state premier on tuesday , oct .
9 . günther beckstein , 63 , received 122 of 178 votes in the bavarian state parliament , which is dominated by his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
he built a reputation as a law-and-order man during his years as bavaria 's powerful , hard-line interior minister .
as premier of germany 's largest and wealthiest state , he 'll have to ensure that his own party toes the line if it wants to maintain its popularity .
the csu found itself in turmoil earlier this year .
edmund stoiber , the party 's charismatic premier and party chief , lost the confidence of his party after mishandling allegations that one of his aids had snooped into the personal life of a fellow csu politician .
once he announced his plans to step down in september , an unusually public power struggle broke out among those who wanted to succeed him as party chair .
bavarian economics minister erwin huber was eventually chosen .
it 's normal to have some disorder when a " dominating personality " like stoiber leaves the political scene , beckstein said .
but now party members need to form a " tidy combat order " and prepare a united front for next year 's elections , beckstein told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag .
beckstein consistently scores highest in opinion polls and will play an important role in the 2008 state elections .
observers have said he 's likely to carry on stoiber 's agenda .
" i will continue with the policies that have made bavaria the best , " he told a csu conference on saturday .
high-profile post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber is out the bavarian premier is a symbolic successor to the former kings of bavaria .
while the royal perks are limited to using the region 's palaces for state business , the premier does have a high profile in europe because of the state 's economic might .
the csu has been bavaria 's governing - or as some might say " ruling " - party for the last half century .
the party has controlled bavaria 's premiership since 1957 and during most of that time , has also had the state parliament in its hands with an absolute majority .
the csu is the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- sister party .
under a power-sharing agreement , merkel 's cdu does not seek office in bavaria and the csu does not venture out of bavaria .
chancellor angela merkel relies on the bavarian csu for votes in the federal parliament .
a little different bildunterschrift : beckstein has vocal critics beckstein will likely focus his energy on running bavaria and leave the politicking in berlin to huber . beckstein has been part of bavarian politics for such a long time that he was a natural choice for the job , said werner patzelt , a political science professor in dresden who studies german political parties .
beckstein does not fit the typical profile of a csu politician .
he is a protestant in a party that has traditionally been dominated by catholics .
he hails from the northern bavarian region of franconia , while his predecessors have come from the south .
thirty years ago , beckstein 's background might have made it difficult to advance within the csu .
but those issues are irrelevant today , said gerhard hirscher , a political scientist with the hanns seidel foundation , a munich research institution supported by the csu .
" we 're in a time of competence politics , " hirscher said .
impeccable conservative credentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein -lrb- left -rrb- and huber unlike many of his compatriots , beckstein has managed to stay clear of personal and professional scandals .
he is close to his wife marga , considering her an important advisor .
the couple has three children .
beckstein 's law-and-order credentials will be important in the upcoming elections , patzelt predicts , since the views are popular in bavaria .
he ’ s seen as one of the more outspokenly conservative members of the csu .
his comments frequently draw criticism from opposition parties , immigrant rights groups and privacy advocates .
beckstein was criticized by muslims and social democrats in september when he suggested that law enforcement should keep tabs on germans who convert to islam .
the remarks came after two german converts to islam were arrested for allegedly taking part in a plot to bomb united states military installations and other targets in germany .
when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one , " beckstein told a german newspaper .
earlier , beckstein had said social democrats , who make up the liberal half of merkel 's ruling grand coalition , would share the blame for future terrorist attacks in germany .
the social democratic party has opposed conservatives ' plans to drastically widen security authorities ' access to personal data .
despite his reputation as a hardliner , beckstein is soft spoken in person and has the reputation of being a good boss , hirscher said .
" his track record in his political field is really very good . "
hirscher said .
if it 's not broken ...
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's economy is going strong bavaria is home to corporate giants like bmw and siemens .
in contrast to other german states , the economy there has performed well for several years and it 's unlikely that beckstein will decide on a drastic change in course .
he 'll likely carry forward plans stoiber put in place , experts say .
while the ruckus over stoiber 's departure caused a dip in the party 's popularity earlier this year , the latest polls show that the party has between 53 and 58 percent support among bavarians . the csu will aim to maintain its majority in the 2008 state elections .
after that , beckstein 's real test will be to make sure the csu has a good showing in the next round of european and national elections , currently planned for 2009 . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a recent tv documentary revealed that exploitation of nazi prisoners made the family what it is .

5 that they were planning a research project to look into their relatives ' activities during the nazi regime .
the move represents a dramatic u-turn in the family 's policy of silence on the issue over the past several decades . " the accusations that have been raised against our family have moved us , " family members said in a statement .
" we recognize that , in our history as a german business family , the years 1933 to 1945 have not been sufficiently cleared up .

though munitions were also produced in the factory , the batteries themselves were also vital to hitler 's war effort . the forced laborers who appeared in the documentary told of beatings , mistreatment , and death . historians suspect that günther quandt made use of forced labor as early as 1938 .
by 1941 , thousands of prisoners were working in his battery factories in hanover , berlin and vienna , which also produced munitions .
hundreds died .
evidence suggests there may have even been a concentration camp facility complete with execution grounds and gallows . quandt referred in an internal document to a " fluctuation " of 80 people - most likely the planned death rate , reported german daily süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goebbels and magda quandt are seen here at their marriage ceremony ; hitler -lrb- far right -rrb- was best man in addition to allegedly exploiting nazi prisoners , the quandts also had personal ties to the nazi regime .
günther quandts first wife , magda ritschel , remarried joseph goebbels , hitler 's future propaganda minister , in 1931 , two years after her divorce from the business giant .
magda brought her son , harald quandt , into the marriage and he lived together with her and goebbels .
while the goebbels committed suicide in 1945 after poisoning their own children , harald - who was not with them - survived . documentary presented clandestinely two journalists spent five years researching the startling documentary , which was broadcast unannounced and not until 11:30 p.m.
the german weekly der spiegel speculated that the broadcaster may have been afraid of the powerful quandt family , which owns 46.6 percent of bmw and large portions of numerous other firms , including altana .
an ard spokesman , however , said a desire to avoid legal injunction played no role . only one member of the family , sven quandt , actually appeared in the film . " we finally have to try to forget about it , " he told der spiegel .
" every family has its dark side , " added quandt when asked about his grandfather 's ill reputed battery factory . precisely to what extent quandt profited from the forced labor and how bad the conditions there really were will have to be cleared up over the course of the planned historical research . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as premier of germany 's largest and wealthiest state , he 'll have to ensure that his own party toes the line if it wants to maintain its popularity .
the csu found itself in turmoil earlier this year .
edmund stoiber , the party 's charismatic premier and party chief , lost the confidence of his party after mishandling allegations that one of his aids had snooped into the personal life of a fellow csu politician .
once he announced his plans to step down in september , an unusually public power struggle broke out among those who wanted to succeed him as party chair .
bavarian economics minister erwin huber was eventually chosen .
it 's normal to have some disorder when a " dominating personality " like stoiber leaves the political scene , beckstein said .
but now party members need to form a " tidy combat order " and prepare a united front for next year 's elections , beckstein told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag .
beckstein consistently scores highest in opinion polls and will play an important role in the 2008 state elections .
observers have said he 's likely to carry on stoiber 's agenda .
" i will continue with the policies that have made bavaria the best , " he told a csu conference on saturday .
high-profile post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber is out the bavarian premier is a symbolic successor to the former kings of bavaria .
while the royal perks are limited to using the region 's palaces for state business , the premier does have a high profile in europe because of the state 's economic might .
the csu has been bavaria 's governing - or as some might say " ruling " - party for the last half century .
the party has controlled bavaria 's premiership since 1957 and during most of that time , has also had the state parliament in its hands with an absolute majority .
the csu is the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- sister party .
under a power-sharing agreement , merkel 's cdu does not seek office in bavaria and the csu does not venture out of bavaria .
chancellor angela merkel relies on the bavarian csu for votes in the federal parliament .
a little different bildunterschrift : beckstein has vocal critics beckstein will likely focus his energy on running bavaria and leave the politicking in berlin to huber . beckstein has been part of bavarian politics for such a long time that he was a natural choice for the job , said werner patzelt , a political science professor in dresden who studies german political parties .
beckstein does not fit the typical profile of a csu politician .
he is a protestant in a party that has traditionally been dominated by catholics .
he hails from the northern bavarian region of franconia , while his predecessors have come from the south .
thirty years ago , beckstein 's background might have made it difficult to advance within the csu .
but those issues are irrelevant today , said gerhard hirscher , a political scientist with the hanns seidel foundation , a munich research institution supported by the csu .
" we 're in a time of competence politics , " hirscher said .
impeccable conservative credentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein -lrb- left -rrb- and huber unlike many of his compatriots , beckstein has managed to stay clear of personal and professional scandals .
he is close to his wife marga , considering her an important advisor .
the couple has three children .
beckstein 's law-and-order credentials will be important in the upcoming elections , patzelt predicts , since the views are popular in bavaria .
he ’ s seen as one of the more outspokenly conservative members of the csu .
his comments frequently draw criticism from opposition parties , immigrant rights groups and privacy advocates .
beckstein was criticized by muslims and social democrats in september when he suggested that law enforcement should keep tabs on germans who convert to islam .
the remarks came after two german converts to islam were arrested for allegedly taking part in a plot to bomb united states military installations and other targets in germany .
when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one , " beckstein told a german newspaper .
earlier , beckstein had said social democrats , who make up the liberal half of merkel 's ruling grand coalition , would share the blame for future terrorist attacks in germany .
the social democratic party has opposed conservatives ' plans to drastically widen security authorities ' access to personal data .
despite his reputation as a hardliner , beckstein is soft spoken in person and has the reputation of being a good boss , hirscher said .
" his track record in his political field is really very good . "
hirscher said .
if it 's not broken ...
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's economy is going strong bavaria is home to corporate giants like bmw and siemens .
in contrast to other german states , the economy there has performed well for several years and it 's unlikely that beckstein will decide on a drastic change in course .
he 'll likely carry forward plans stoiber put in place , experts say .
while the ruckus over stoiber 's departure caused a dip in the party 's popularity earlier this year , the latest polls show that the party has between 53 and 58 percent support among bavarians . the csu will aim to maintain its majority in the 2008 state elections .
after that , beckstein 's real test will be to make sure the csu has a good showing in the next round of european and national elections , currently planned for 2009 . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but literary critics disagree as to whether it 's a page-turner or a bore . julia franck 's lady midday -lrb- die mittagsfrau -rrb- tells the story of a woman who abandons her son at a train station in the final years of the third reich .
the story was based in part on the life of franck 's father who was , in fact abandoned by his grandmother in 1945 .
in honoring franck 's novel , the jury called it " spellbinding in its verbal immediacy , storytelling energy and psychological intensity . "
the german book prize carries a cash award of 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- and is considered a major literary springboard - previous winners have been translated into other languages , including english .
franck is a 37-year-old mother of two who was born in the former communist east germany but moved to the west as a child .
lady midday is her fifth book .
precise or pretentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franck has a reputation for being earnest like most high-profile literary awards , the german book prize gives critics the chance to argue long-windedly about whether the winner is any good .
and lady midday has proved no exception - with reviewers more or less evenly split on its quality .
" she may reign in her style but she gives it sufficient cold space to breathe and to resonate in precise images , " wrote one critic in the daily newspaper die welt .
" she constructs an almost classical drama of stations . "
but others are far less impressed .
" the book is overrun with stereotypical figures from 1920s berlin , and there , especially where the dialogue is concerned , the ' narrative intensity ' lauded by the jury descends into pretension , imprecision and , sometimes , kitsch , " carped another critic in the daily berliner der tagesspiegel .
franck will surely be the subject of further discussion at the frankfurt book fair , which starts on tuesday evening . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
grünberg and fert discovered in 1988 that minute magnetic changes in a gmr system lead to huge differences in electrical resistance .
these differences in turn cause changes in the current in the readout head , which scans a hard disk to spot the ones and zeroes in which the data is stored .
as a result , the readout head is able to read smaller and weaker magnetic areas - and this sensitivity means information can be packed more densely on the hard disk .
prize for practical application of nanotechnology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert fert is honored for his work on the miniature hard drive martin durrani , editor of physics world , a journal published by britain 's institute of physics , said the award was fitting .
" i am really pleased that it has gone for something very practically based and rooted in research relevant to industry , " he said .
" it shows that physics has a real relevance not just to understanding natural phenomena but to real products in everyday life . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 09.10.2007 günther beckstein sworn in as new bavarian premier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein is the new face of bavaria the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has ruled bavaria for 50 years .
günther beckstein , a 63-year-old lawyer , is expected to stay the course after his election as state premier on tuesday , oct .
9 . günther beckstein , 63 , received 122 of 178 votes in the bavarian state parliament , which is dominated by his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
he built a reputation as a law-and-order man during his years as bavaria 's powerful , hard-line interior minister .
as premier of germany 's largest and wealthiest state , he 'll have to ensure that his own party toes the line if it wants to maintain its popularity .
the csu found itself in turmoil earlier this year .
edmund stoiber , the party 's charismatic premier and party chief , lost the confidence of his party after mishandling allegations that one of his aids had snooped into the personal life of a fellow csu politician .
once he announced his plans to step down in september , an unusually public power struggle broke out among those who wanted to succeed him as party chair .
bavarian economics minister erwin huber was eventually chosen .
it 's normal to have some disorder when a " dominating personality " like stoiber leaves the political scene , beckstein said .
but now party members need to form a " tidy combat order " and prepare a united front for next year 's elections , beckstein told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag .
beckstein consistently scores highest in opinion polls and will play an important role in the 2008 state elections .
observers have said he 's likely to carry on stoiber 's agenda .
" i will continue with the policies that have made bavaria the best , " he told a csu conference on saturday .
high-profile post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber is out the bavarian premier is a symbolic successor to the former kings of bavaria .
while the royal perks are limited to using the region 's palaces for state business , the premier does have a high profile in europe because of the state 's economic might .
the csu has been bavaria 's governing - or as some might say " ruling " - party for the last half century .
the party has controlled bavaria 's premiership since 1957 and during most of that time , has also had the state parliament in its hands with an absolute majority .
the csu is the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- sister party .
under a power-sharing agreement , merkel 's cdu does not seek office in bavaria and the csu does not venture out of bavaria .
chancellor angela merkel relies on the bavarian csu for votes in the federal parliament .
a little different bildunterschrift : beckstein has vocal critics beckstein will likely focus his energy on running bavaria and leave the politicking in berlin to huber . beckstein has been part of bavarian politics for such a long time that he was a natural choice for the job , said werner patzelt , a political science professor in dresden who studies german political parties .
beckstein does not fit the typical profile of a csu politician .
he is a protestant in a party that has traditionally been dominated by catholics .
he hails from the northern bavarian region of franconia , while his predecessors have come from the south .
thirty years ago , beckstein 's background might have made it difficult to advance within the csu .
but those issues are irrelevant today , said gerhard hirscher , a political scientist with the hanns seidel foundation , a munich research institution supported by the csu .
" we 're in a time of competence politics , " hirscher said .
impeccable conservative credentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein -lrb- left -rrb- and huber unlike many of his compatriots , beckstein has managed to stay clear of personal and professional scandals .
he is close to his wife marga , considering her an important advisor .
the couple has three children .
beckstein 's law-and-order credentials will be important in the upcoming elections , patzelt predicts , since the views are popular in bavaria .
he ’ s seen as one of the more outspokenly conservative members of the csu .
his comments frequently draw criticism from opposition parties , immigrant rights groups and privacy advocates .
beckstein was criticized by muslims and social democrats in september when he suggested that law enforcement should keep tabs on germans who convert to islam .
the remarks came after two german converts to islam were arrested for allegedly taking part in a plot to bomb united states military installations and other targets in germany .
when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one , " beckstein told a german newspaper .
earlier , beckstein had said social democrats , who make up the liberal half of merkel 's ruling grand coalition , would share the blame for future terrorist attacks in germany .
the social democratic party has opposed conservatives ' plans to drastically widen security authorities ' access to personal data .
despite his reputation as a hardliner , beckstein is soft spoken in person and has the reputation of being a good boss , hirscher said .
" his track record in his political field is really very good . "
hirscher said .
if it 's not broken ...
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's economy is going strong bavaria is home to corporate giants like bmw and siemens .
in contrast to other german states , the economy there has performed well for several years and it 's unlikely that beckstein will decide on a drastic change in course .
he 'll likely carry forward plans stoiber put in place , experts say .
while the ruckus over stoiber 's departure caused a dip in the party 's popularity earlier this year , the latest polls show that the party has between 53 and 58 percent support among bavarians . the csu will aim to maintain its majority in the 2008 state elections .
after that , beckstein 's real test will be to make sure the csu has a good showing in the next round of european and national elections , currently planned for 2009 . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" complaints like this are always the last resort when all the political measures have been exhausted , " dieter ameling , president of the german steel federation , said .
china , which was the world 's biggest importer of steel in 2004 , has since become the world 's biggest exporter and is now responsible for 34 percent of the world 's steel production .
environmental and quality standards questioned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german steel firms feel their product is being under cut european producers accuse chinese factories of failing to respect the environment and making poor quality steel .
the europeans also complain that about the large subsidies the state-run chinese steel companies receive .
" it is a situation of state-run production , while in the rest of the world steel is produced by private companies designed to create value , " said karl-ulrich koehler , the head of germany 's thyssenkrupp steel , the world 's tenth-biggest producer .
ameling said that " instead of exporting the steel that is produced in china at great cost to the environment , it would be better if the chinese withdrew their polluting products from the market . "
zhang xiaogang , chairman of the china iron and steel association , responded by telling the conference that inefficient steel mills would be closed by the end of the decade in a move towards consolidation .
" by 2010 , the iron and steel enterprises will be decreased greatly in number and production by the top 10 enterprise groups in the country will make up over 50 percent of gross crude steel production in china , " he said .

" complaints like this are always the last resort when all the political measures have been exhausted , " dieter ameling , president of the german steel federation , said .
china , which was the world 's biggest importer of steel in 2004 , has since become the world 's biggest exporter and is now responsible for 34 percent of the world 's steel production .
environmental and quality standards questioned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german steel firms feel their product is being under cut european producers accuse chinese factories of failing to respect the environment and making poor quality steel .
the europeans also complain that about the large subsidies the state-run chinese steel companies receive .
" it is a situation of state-run production , while in the rest of the world steel is produced by private companies designed to create value , " said karl-ulrich koehler , the head of germany 's thyssenkrupp steel , the world 's tenth-biggest producer .
ameling said that " instead of exporting the steel that is produced in china at great cost to the environment , it would be better if the chinese withdrew their polluting products from the market . "
zhang xiaogang , chairman of the china iron and steel association , responded by telling the conference that inefficient steel mills would be closed by the end of the decade in a move towards consolidation .
" by 2010 , the iron and steel enterprises will be decreased greatly in number and production by the top 10 enterprise groups in the country will make up over 50 percent of gross crude steel production in china , " he said .
demand for steel expected to increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's economy will be one of those driving steel demand the international iron and steel institute -lrb- iisi -rrb- , which is hosting the conference , said in its latest forecast on monday that global demand for steel will keep growing next year in response to strong economies in china , africa and the middle east .
iisi expected steel demand to grow by 6.8 percent this year and by around the same level in 2008 , slightly more than a forecast earlier this year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but literary critics disagree as to whether it 's a page-turner or a bore . julia franck 's lady midday -lrb- die mittagsfrau -rrb- tells the story of a woman who abandons her son at a train station in the final years of the third reich .
the story was based in part on the life of franck 's father who was , in fact abandoned by his grandmother in 1945 .
in honoring franck 's novel , the jury called it " spellbinding in its verbal immediacy , storytelling energy and psychological intensity . "
the german book prize carries a cash award of 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- and is considered a major literary springboard - previous winners have been translated into other languages , including english .
franck is a 37-year-old mother of two who was born in the former communist east germany but moved to the west as a child .
lady midday is her fifth book .
precise or pretentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franck has a reputation for being earnest like most high-profile literary awards , the german book prize gives critics the chance to argue long-windedly about whether the winner is any good .
and lady midday has proved no exception - with reviewers more or less evenly split on its quality .
" she may reign in her style but she gives it sufficient cold space to breathe and to resonate in precise images , " wrote one critic in the daily newspaper die welt .
" she constructs an almost classical drama of stations . "
but others are far less impressed .
" the book is overrun with stereotypical figures from 1920s berlin , and there , especially where the dialogue is concerned , the ' narrative intensity ' lauded by the jury descends into pretension , imprecision and , sometimes , kitsch , " carped another critic in the daily berliner der tagesspiegel .

grünberg and fert discovered in 1988 that minute magnetic changes in a gmr system lead to huge differences in electrical resistance .
these differences in turn cause changes in the current in the readout head , which scans a hard disk to spot the ones and zeroes in which the data is stored .

" i am really pleased that it has gone for something very practically based and rooted in research relevant to industry , " he said .
" it shows that physics has a real relevance not just to understanding natural phenomena but to real products in everyday life . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 09.10.2007 günther beckstein sworn in as new bavarian premier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein is the new face of bavaria the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has ruled bavaria for 50 years .
günther beckstein , a 63-year-old lawyer , is expected to stay the course after his election as state premier on tuesday , oct .
9 . günther beckstein , 63 , received 122 of 178 votes in the bavarian state parliament , which is dominated by his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
he built a reputation as a law-and-order man during his years as bavaria 's powerful , hard-line interior minister .
as premier of germany 's largest and wealthiest state , he 'll have to ensure that his own party toes the line if it wants to maintain its popularity .
the csu found itself in turmoil earlier this year .
edmund stoiber , the party 's charismatic premier and party chief , lost the confidence of his party after mishandling allegations that one of his aids had snooped into the personal life of a fellow csu politician .
once he announced his plans to step down in september , an unusually public power struggle broke out among those who wanted to succeed him as party chair .
bavarian economics minister erwin huber was eventually chosen .
it 's normal to have some disorder when a " dominating personality " like stoiber leaves the political scene , beckstein said .
but now party members need to form a " tidy combat order " and prepare a united front for next year 's elections , beckstein told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag .
beckstein consistently scores highest in opinion polls and will play an important role in the 2008 state elections .
observers have said he 's likely to carry on stoiber 's agenda .
" i will continue with the policies that have made bavaria the best , " he told a csu conference on saturday .
high-profile post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber is out the bavarian premier is a symbolic successor to the former kings of bavaria .
while the royal perks are limited to using the region 's palaces for state business , the premier does have a high profile in europe because of the state 's economic might .
the csu has been bavaria 's governing - or as some might say " ruling " - party for the last half century .

günther beckstein , a 63-year-old lawyer , is expected to stay the course after his election as state premier on tuesday , oct .
9 . günther beckstein , 63 , received 122 of 178 votes in the bavarian state parliament , which is dominated by his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
he built a reputation as a law-and-order man during his years as bavaria 's powerful , hard-line interior minister .
as premier of germany 's largest and wealthiest state , he 'll have to ensure that his own party toes the line if it wants to maintain its popularity .
the csu found itself in turmoil earlier this year .
edmund stoiber , the party 's charismatic premier and party chief , lost the confidence of his party after mishandling allegations that one of his aids had snooped into the personal life of a fellow csu politician .
once he announced his plans to step down in september , an unusually public power struggle broke out among those who wanted to succeed him as party chair .
bavarian economics minister erwin huber was eventually chosen .
it 's normal to have some disorder when a " dominating personality " like stoiber leaves the political scene , beckstein said .
but now party members need to form a " tidy combat order " and prepare a united front for next year 's elections , beckstein told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag .
beckstein consistently scores highest in opinion polls and will play an important role in the 2008 state elections .
observers have said he 's likely to carry on stoiber 's agenda .
" i will continue with the policies that have made bavaria the best , " he told a csu conference on saturday .
high-profile post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber is out the bavarian premier is a symbolic successor to the former kings of bavaria .
while the royal perks are limited to using the region 's palaces for state business , the premier does have a high profile in europe because of the state 's economic might .
the csu has been bavaria 's governing - or as some might say " ruling " - party for the last half century .
the party has controlled bavaria 's premiership since 1957 and during most of that time , has also had the state parliament in its hands with an absolute majority .

günther beckstein , a 63-year-old lawyer , is expected to stay the course after his election as state premier on tuesday , oct .
9 . günther beckstein , 63 , received 122 of 178 votes in the bavarian state parliament , which is dominated by his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
he built a reputation as a law-and-order man during his years as bavaria 's powerful , hard-line interior minister .
as premier of germany 's largest and wealthiest state , he 'll have to ensure that his own party toes the line if it wants to maintain its popularity .
the csu found itself in turmoil earlier this year .
edmund stoiber , the party 's charismatic premier and party chief , lost the confidence of his party after mishandling allegations that one of his aids had snooped into the personal life of a fellow csu politician .
once he announced his plans to step down in september , an unusually public power struggle broke out among those who wanted to succeed him as party chair .
bavarian economics minister erwin huber was eventually chosen .
it 's normal to have some disorder when a " dominating personality " like stoiber leaves the political scene , beckstein said .
but now party members need to form a " tidy combat order " and prepare a united front for next year 's elections , beckstein told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag .
beckstein consistently scores highest in opinion polls and will play an important role in the 2008 state elections .
observers have said he 's likely to carry on stoiber 's agenda .
" i will continue with the policies that have made bavaria the best , " he told a csu conference on saturday .
high-profile post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber is out the bavarian premier is a symbolic successor to the former kings of bavaria .
while the royal perks are limited to using the region 's palaces for state business , the premier does have a high profile in europe because of the state 's economic might .
the csu has been bavaria 's governing - or as some might say " ruling " - party for the last half century .
the party has controlled bavaria 's premiership since 1957 and during most of that time , has also had the state parliament in its hands with an absolute majority .
the csu is the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- sister party .
under a power-sharing agreement , merkel 's cdu does not seek office in bavaria and the csu does not venture out of bavaria .
chancellor angela merkel relies on the bavarian csu for votes in the federal parliament .
a little different bildunterschrift : beckstein has vocal critics beckstein will likely focus his energy on running bavaria and leave the politicking in berlin to huber . beckstein has been part of bavarian politics for such a long time that he was a natural choice for the job , said werner patzelt , a political science professor in dresden who studies german political parties .
beckstein does not fit the typical profile of a csu politician .
he is a protestant in a party that has traditionally been dominated by catholics .
he hails from the northern bavarian region of franconia , while his predecessors have come from the south .
thirty years ago , beckstein 's background might have made it difficult to advance within the csu .
but those issues are irrelevant today , said gerhard hirscher , a political scientist with the hanns seidel foundation , a munich research institution supported by the csu .
" we 're in a time of competence politics , " hirscher said .
impeccable conservative credentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein -lrb- left -rrb- and huber unlike many of his compatriots , beckstein has managed to stay clear of personal and professional scandals .
he is close to his wife marga , considering her an important advisor .
the couple has three children .
beckstein 's law-and-order credentials will be important in the upcoming elections , patzelt predicts , since the views are popular in bavaria .
he ’ s seen as one of the more outspokenly conservative members of the csu .
his comments frequently draw criticism from opposition parties , immigrant rights groups and privacy advocates .
beckstein was criticized by muslims and social democrats in september when he suggested that law enforcement should keep tabs on germans who convert to islam .
the remarks came after two german converts to islam were arrested for allegedly taking part in a plot to bomb united states military installations and other targets in germany .
when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one , " beckstein told a german newspaper .
earlier , beckstein had said social democrats , who make up the liberal half of merkel 's ruling grand coalition , would share the blame for future terrorist attacks in germany .
the social democratic party has opposed conservatives ' plans to drastically widen security authorities ' access to personal data .
despite his reputation as a hardliner , beckstein is soft spoken in person and has the reputation of being a good boss , hirscher said .
" his track record in his political field is really very good . "
hirscher said .
if it 's not broken ...
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's economy is going strong bavaria is home to corporate giants like bmw and siemens .
in contrast to other german states , the economy there has performed well for several years and it 's unlikely that beckstein will decide on a drastic change in course .
he 'll likely carry forward plans stoiber put in place , experts say .

" complaints like this are always the last resort when all the political measures have been exhausted , " dieter ameling , president of the german steel federation , said .
china , which was the world 's biggest importer of steel in 2004 , has since become the world 's biggest exporter and is now responsible for 34 percent of the world 's steel production .
environmental and quality standards questioned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german steel firms feel their product is being under cut european producers accuse chinese factories of failing to respect the environment and making poor quality steel .

ameling said that " instead of exporting the steel that is produced in china at great cost to the environment , it would be better if the chinese withdrew their polluting products from the market . "

the move represents a dramatic u-turn in the family 's policy of silence on the issue over the past several decades . " the accusations that have been raised against our family have moved us , " family members said in a statement .
" we recognize that , in our history as a german business family , the years 1933 to 1945 have not been sufficiently cleared up . " indeed , the quandt family 's dark side had been forgotten for many years - until german broadcaster ndr came out with a documentary film , which premiered on sunday , sept .

though munitions were also produced in the factory , the batteries themselves were also vital to hitler 's war effort . the forced laborers who appeared in the documentary told of beatings , mistreatment , and death . historians suspect that günther quandt made use of forced labor as early as 1938 .
by 1941 , thousands of prisoners were working in his battery factories in hanover , berlin and vienna , which also produced munitions .
hundreds died .
evidence suggests there may have even been a concentration camp facility complete with execution grounds and gallows . quandt referred in an internal document to a " fluctuation " of 80 people - most likely the planned death rate , reported german daily süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goebbels and magda quandt are seen here at their marriage ceremony ; hitler -lrb- far right -rrb- was best man in addition to allegedly exploiting nazi prisoners , the quandts also had personal ties to the nazi regime .
günther quandts first wife , magda ritschel , remarried joseph goebbels , hitler 's future propaganda minister , in 1931 , two years after her divorce from the business giant .
magda brought her son , harald quandt , into the marriage and he lived together with her and goebbels .
while the goebbels committed suicide in 1945 after poisoning their own children , harald - who was not with them - survived . documentary presented clandestinely two journalists spent five years researching the startling documentary , which was broadcast unannounced and not until 11:30 p.m.
the german weekly der spiegel speculated that the broadcaster may have been afraid of the powerful quandt family , which owns 46.6 percent of bmw and large portions of numerous other firms , including altana .

"
grünberg and fert discovered in 1988 that minute magnetic changes in a gmr system lead to huge differences in electrical resistance .
these differences in turn cause changes in the current in the readout head , which scans a hard disk to spot the ones and zeroes in which the data is stored .
as a result , the readout head is able to read smaller and weaker magnetic areas - and this sensitivity means information can be packed more densely on the hard disk .
prize for practical application of nanotechnology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert fert is honored for his work on the miniature hard drive martin durrani , editor of physics world , a journal published by britain 's institute of physics , said the award was fitting .
" i am really pleased that it has gone for something very practically based and rooted in research relevant to industry , " he said .
" it shows that physics has a real relevance not just to understanding natural phenomena but to real products in everyday life . "
last year , the physics prize went to us space scientists john mather and george smoot for a pioneering space mission which supports the " big bang " theory about the origins of the universe .
grünberg and fert will be honored at a formal prize ceremony held as tradition dictates on dec .
10 , the anniversary of the death in 1896 of the prize 's creator , swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite alfred nobel .

a recent tv documentary revealed that exploitation of nazi prisoners made the family what it is .
now they 're ready to uncover the past . the quandt family announced on friday , oct .
5 that they were planning a research project to look into their relatives ' activities during the nazi regime .
the move represents a dramatic u-turn in the family 's policy of silence on the issue over the past several decades . " the accusations that have been raised against our family have moved us , " family members said in a statement .
" we recognize that , in our history as a german business family , the years 1933 to 1945 have not been sufficiently cleared up . " indeed , the quandt family 's dark side had been forgotten for many years - until german broadcaster ndr came out with a documentary film , which premiered on sunday , sept .
30 at the hamburg film festival . prisoners contributed to war effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther quandt 's son herbert ran a subsidiary of afa , which may have also used forced labor in the film , which was broadcast later that sunday night on germany 's ard television station , former prisoners of the nazis shared stories of their work during the war years in the afa battery factory , owned by günter quandt .
though munitions were also produced in the factory , the batteries themselves were also vital to hitler 's war effort . the forced laborers who appeared in the documentary told of beatings , mistreatment , and death . historians suspect that günther quandt made use of forced labor as early as 1938 .
by 1941 , thousands of prisoners were working in his battery factories in hanover , berlin and vienna , which also produced munitions .
hundreds died .
evidence suggests there may have even been a concentration camp facility complete with execution grounds and gallows . quandt referred in an internal document to a " fluctuation " of 80 people - most likely the planned death rate , reported german daily süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goebbels and magda quandt are seen here at their marriage ceremony ; hitler -lrb- far right -rrb- was best man in addition to allegedly exploiting nazi prisoners , the quandts also had personal ties to the nazi regime .
günther quandts first wife , magda ritschel , remarried joseph goebbels , hitler 's future propaganda minister , in 1931 , two years after her divorce from the business giant .
magda brought her son , harald quandt , into the marriage and he lived together with her and goebbels .
while the goebbels committed suicide in 1945 after poisoning their own children , harald - who was not with them - survived . documentary presented clandestinely two journalists spent five years researching the startling documentary , which was broadcast unannounced and not until 11:30 p.m.
the german weekly der spiegel speculated that the broadcaster may have been afraid of the powerful quandt family , which owns 46.6 percent of bmw and large portions of numerous other firms , including altana .
an ard spokesman , however , said a desire to avoid legal injunction played no role . only one member of the family , sven quandt , actually appeared in the film . " we finally have to try to forget about it , " he told der spiegel .
" every family has its dark side , " added quandt when asked about his grandfather 's ill reputed battery factory . precisely to what extent quandt profited from the forced labor and how bad the conditions there really were will have to be cleared up over the course of the planned historical research . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's not only irritated some spaniards , it 's brought forth appeals for broader categories about cultural identity . in a statement released on the eve of the event , the head of the german branch of the writers ' association pen , johano strasser , said he was concerned about the message that was being sent .
" as important as it is to bring individual cultures into a dialog with one another , there 's an equally great danger of provincialism , " strasser said .
" cultural identity politics is always a double-edged sword . "
nationalism , regionalism and vanity the choice of catalonia , the northeastern region in spain with some seven million inhabitants and its own language , catalan , has been controversial right from the start .
some spanish writers invited to participated have refused to come , objecting to catalan organizers ' original decision to invite only authors who wrote in catalan .
bildunterschrift : for some catalonians , guest culture status is a point of pride " almost all of the spanish-language authors , including those who are catalan , are not attending , " book fair director jürgen boos said at a press conference shortly before tuesday 's official opening ceremony .
" there are a whole range of reasons including nationalism , regionalism , and vanity .
i think this is a great pity , i would like to have had all of them here . "
but politicians from the semi-autonomous region have stressed their culture 's special role at the fair does not reinforce provincialism .
" we catalans are europeans , and that 's why we 've come to frankfurt , " the former president of the region , pasquall maragall , told the dpa news agency .
new record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt book fair is a must for everyone in the publishing industry neither the debate about diversity versus cosmopolitanism nor sluggish sales figures in the book industry have dampened publishers ' desire to participate in the frankfurt event .
the fair - already the largest of its kind in the world - has more exhibitors than ever before : 7448 compared with 7272 last year .
organizers also say they expect around 290,000 visitors , roughly the same as at the 2006 event .

günther beckstein , a 63-year-old lawyer , is expected to stay the course after his election as state premier on tuesday , oct .
9 . günther beckstein , 63 , received 122 of 178 votes in the bavarian state parliament , which is dominated by his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
he built a reputation as a law-and-order man during his years as bavaria 's powerful , hard-line interior minister .
as premier of germany 's largest and wealthiest state , he 'll have to ensure that his own party toes the line if it wants to maintain its popularity .
the csu found itself in turmoil earlier this year .
edmund stoiber , the party 's charismatic premier and party chief , lost the confidence of his party after mishandling allegations that one of his aids had snooped into the personal life of a fellow csu politician .
once he announced his plans to step down in september , an unusually public power struggle broke out among those who wanted to succeed him as party chair .
bavarian economics minister erwin huber was eventually chosen .
it 's normal to have some disorder when a " dominating personality " like stoiber leaves the political scene , beckstein said .
but now party members need to form a " tidy combat order " and prepare a united front for next year 's elections , beckstein told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag .
beckstein consistently scores highest in opinion polls and will play an important role in the 2008 state elections .
observers have said he 's likely to carry on stoiber 's agenda .
" i will continue with the policies that have made bavaria the best , " he told a csu conference on saturday .
high-profile post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber is out the bavarian premier is a symbolic successor to the former kings of bavaria .
while the royal perks are limited to using the region 's palaces for state business , the premier does have a high profile in europe because of the state 's economic might .
the csu has been bavaria 's governing - or as some might say " ruling " - party for the last half century .
the party has controlled bavaria 's premiership since 1957 and during most of that time , has also had the state parliament in its hands with an absolute majority .
the csu is the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- sister party .
under a power-sharing agreement , merkel 's cdu does not seek office in bavaria and the csu does not venture out of bavaria .
chancellor angela merkel relies on the bavarian csu for votes in the federal parliament .
a little different bildunterschrift : beckstein has vocal critics beckstein will likely focus his energy on running bavaria and leave the politicking in berlin to huber . beckstein has been part of bavarian politics for such a long time that he was a natural choice for the job , said werner patzelt , a political science professor in dresden who studies german political parties .
beckstein does not fit the typical profile of a csu politician .
he is a protestant in a party that has traditionally been dominated by catholics .
he hails from the northern bavarian region of franconia , while his predecessors have come from the south .
thirty years ago , beckstein 's background might have made it difficult to advance within the csu .
but those issues are irrelevant today , said gerhard hirscher , a political scientist with the hanns seidel foundation , a munich research institution supported by the csu .
" we 're in a time of competence politics , " hirscher said .
impeccable conservative credentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein -lrb- left -rrb- and huber unlike many of his compatriots , beckstein has managed to stay clear of personal and professional scandals .
he is close to his wife marga , considering her an important advisor .
the couple has three children .
beckstein 's law-and-order credentials will be important in the upcoming elections , patzelt predicts , since the views are popular in bavaria .
he ’ s seen as one of the more outspokenly conservative members of the csu .
his comments frequently draw criticism from opposition parties , immigrant rights groups and privacy advocates .
beckstein was criticized by muslims and social democrats in september when he suggested that law enforcement should keep tabs on germans who convert to islam .
the remarks came after two german converts to islam were arrested for allegedly taking part in a plot to bomb united states military installations and other targets in germany .
when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one , " beckstein told a german newspaper .
earlier , beckstein had said social democrats , who make up the liberal half of merkel 's ruling grand coalition , would share the blame for future terrorist attacks in germany .
the social democratic party has opposed conservatives ' plans to drastically widen security authorities ' access to personal data .
despite his reputation as a hardliner , beckstein is soft spoken in person and has the reputation of being a good boss , hirscher said .
" his track record in his political field is really very good . "
hirscher said .
if it 's not broken ...

in contrast to other german states , the economy there has performed well for several years and it 's unlikely that beckstein will decide on a drastic change in course .
he 'll likely carry forward plans stoiber put in place , experts say .
while the ruckus over stoiber 's departure caused a dip in the party 's popularity earlier this year , the latest polls show that the party has between 53 and 58 percent support among bavarians . the csu will aim to maintain its majority in the 2008 state elections .
after that , beckstein 's real test will be to make sure the csu has a good showing in the next round of european and national elections , currently planned for 2009 . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
grünberg and fert discovered in 1988 that minute magnetic changes in a gmr system lead to huge differences in electrical resistance .
these differences in turn cause changes in the current in the readout head , which scans a hard disk to spot the ones and zeroes in which the data is stored .
as a result , the readout head is able to read smaller and weaker magnetic areas - and this sensitivity means information can be packed more densely on the hard disk .
prize for practical application of nanotechnology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert fert is honored for his work on the miniature hard drive martin durrani , editor of physics world , a journal published by britain 's institute of physics , said the award was fitting .
" i am really pleased that it has gone for something very practically based and rooted in research relevant to industry , " he said .
" it shows that physics has a real relevance not just to understanding natural phenomena but to real products in everyday life . "
last year , the physics prize went to us space scientists john mather and george smoot for a pioneering space mission which supports the " big bang " theory about the origins of the universe .
grünberg and fert will be honored at a formal prize ceremony held as tradition dictates on dec .
10 , the anniversary of the death in 1896 of the prize 's creator , swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite alfred nobel .
the 2007 laureates will receive a gold medal , a diploma and 10 million swedish kronor -lrb- $ 1.53 million , 1.08 million euros -rrb- to be split between them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but literary critics disagree as to whether it 's a page-turner or a bore . julia franck 's lady midday -lrb- die mittagsfrau -rrb- tells the story of a woman who abandons her son at a train station in the final years of the third reich .
the story was based in part on the life of franck 's father who was , in fact abandoned by his grandmother in 1945 .
in honoring franck 's novel , the jury called it " spellbinding in its verbal immediacy , storytelling energy and psychological intensity . "
the german book prize carries a cash award of 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- and is considered a major literary springboard - previous winners have been translated into other languages , including english .
franck is a 37-year-old mother of two who was born in the former communist east germany but moved to the west as a child .
lady midday is her fifth book .
precise or pretentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franck has a reputation for being earnest like most high-profile literary awards , the german book prize gives critics the chance to argue long-windedly about whether the winner is any good .
and lady midday has proved no exception - with reviewers more or less evenly split on its quality .
" she may reign in her style but she gives it sufficient cold space to breathe and to resonate in precise images , " wrote one critic in the daily newspaper die welt .
" she constructs an almost classical drama of stations . "
but others are far less impressed .
" the book is overrun with stereotypical figures from 1920s berlin , and there , especially where the dialogue is concerned , the ' narrative intensity ' lauded by the jury descends into pretension , imprecision and , sometimes , kitsch , " carped another critic in the daily berliner der tagesspiegel .

a recent tv documentary revealed that exploitation of nazi prisoners made the family what it is .
now they 're ready to uncover the past . the quandt family announced on friday , oct .
5 that they were planning a research project to look into their relatives ' activities during the nazi regime .
the move represents a dramatic u-turn in the family 's policy of silence on the issue over the past several decades . " the accusations that have been raised against our family have moved us , " family members said in a statement .

" complaints like this are always the last resort when all the political measures have been exhausted , " dieter ameling , president of the german steel federation , said .

ameling said that " instead of exporting the steel that is produced in china at great cost to the environment , it would be better if the chinese withdrew their polluting products from the market . "
zhang xiaogang , chairman of the china iron and steel association , responded by telling the conference that inefficient steel mills would be closed by the end of the decade in a move towards consolidation .

"
grünberg and fert discovered in 1988 that minute magnetic changes in a gmr system lead to huge differences in electrical resistance .
these differences in turn cause changes in the current in the readout head , which scans a hard disk to spot the ones and zeroes in which the data is stored .
as a result , the readout head is able to read smaller and weaker magnetic areas - and this sensitivity means information can be packed more densely on the hard disk .
prize for practical application of nanotechnology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert fert is honored for his work on the miniature hard drive martin durrani , editor of physics world , a journal published by britain 's institute of physics , said the award was fitting .
" i am really pleased that it has gone for something very practically based and rooted in research relevant to industry , " he said .
" it shows that physics has a real relevance not just to understanding natural phenomena but to real products in everyday life . "
last year , the physics prize went to us space scientists john mather and george smoot for a pioneering space mission which supports the " big bang " theory about the origins of the universe .
grünberg and fert will be honored at a formal prize ceremony held as tradition dictates on dec .
10 , the anniversary of the death in 1896 of the prize 's creator , swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite alfred nobel .
the 2007 laureates will receive a gold medal , a diploma and 10 million swedish kronor -lrb- $ 1.53 million , 1.08 million euros -rrb- to be split between them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but literary critics disagree as to whether it 's a page-turner or a bore . julia franck 's lady midday -lrb- die mittagsfrau -rrb- tells the story of a woman who abandons her son at a train station in the final years of the third reich .
the story was based in part on the life of franck 's father who was , in fact abandoned by his grandmother in 1945 .
in honoring franck 's novel , the jury called it " spellbinding in its verbal immediacy , storytelling energy and psychological intensity . "
the german book prize carries a cash award of 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- and is considered a major literary springboard - previous winners have been translated into other languages , including english .
franck is a 37-year-old mother of two who was born in the former communist east germany but moved to the west as a child .
lady midday is her fifth book .
precise or pretentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franck has a reputation for being earnest like most high-profile literary awards , the german book prize gives critics the chance to argue long-windedly about whether the winner is any good .
and lady midday has proved no exception - with reviewers more or less evenly split on its quality .
" she may reign in her style but she gives it sufficient cold space to breathe and to resonate in precise images , " wrote one critic in the daily newspaper die welt .
" she constructs an almost classical drama of stations . "
but others are far less impressed .
" the book is overrun with stereotypical figures from 1920s berlin , and there , especially where the dialogue is concerned , the ' narrative intensity ' lauded by the jury descends into pretension , imprecision and , sometimes , kitsch , " carped another critic in the daily berliner der tagesspiegel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 09.10.2007 günther beckstein sworn in as new bavarian premier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein is the new face of bavaria the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has ruled bavaria for 50 years .
günther beckstein , a 63-year-old lawyer , is expected to stay the course after his election as state premier on tuesday , oct .
9 . günther beckstein , 63 , received 122 of 178 votes in the bavarian state parliament , which is dominated by his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
he built a reputation as a law-and-order man during his years as bavaria 's powerful , hard-line interior minister .
as premier of germany 's largest and wealthiest state , he 'll have to ensure that his own party toes the line if it wants to maintain its popularity .
the csu found itself in turmoil earlier this year .
edmund stoiber , the party 's charismatic premier and party chief , lost the confidence of his party after mishandling allegations that one of his aids had snooped into the personal life of a fellow csu politician .
once he announced his plans to step down in september , an unusually public power struggle broke out among those who wanted to succeed him as party chair .
bavarian economics minister erwin huber was eventually chosen .
it 's normal to have some disorder when a " dominating personality " like stoiber leaves the political scene , beckstein said .
but now party members need to form a " tidy combat order " and prepare a united front for next year 's elections , beckstein told the weekly newspaper welt am sonntag .
beckstein consistently scores highest in opinion polls and will play an important role in the 2008 state elections .
observers have said he 's likely to carry on stoiber 's agenda .
" i will continue with the policies that have made bavaria the best , " he told a csu conference on saturday .
high-profile post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber is out the bavarian premier is a symbolic successor to the former kings of bavaria .
while the royal perks are limited to using the region 's palaces for state business , the premier does have a high profile in europe because of the state 's economic might .
the csu has been bavaria 's governing - or as some might say " ruling " - party for the last half century .
the party has controlled bavaria 's premiership since 1957 and during most of that time , has also had the state parliament in its hands with an absolute majority .
the csu is the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- sister party .
under a power-sharing agreement , merkel 's cdu does not seek office in bavaria and the csu does not venture out of bavaria .
chancellor angela merkel relies on the bavarian csu for votes in the federal parliament .
a little different bildunterschrift : beckstein has vocal critics beckstein will likely focus his energy on running bavaria and leave the politicking in berlin to huber . beckstein has been part of bavarian politics for such a long time that he was a natural choice for the job , said werner patzelt , a political science professor in dresden who studies german political parties .
beckstein does not fit the typical profile of a csu politician .
he is a protestant in a party that has traditionally been dominated by catholics .
he hails from the northern bavarian region of franconia , while his predecessors have come from the south .
thirty years ago , beckstein 's background might have made it difficult to advance within the csu .
but those issues are irrelevant today , said gerhard hirscher , a political scientist with the hanns seidel foundation , a munich research institution supported by the csu .
" we 're in a time of competence politics , " hirscher said .
impeccable conservative credentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein -lrb- left -rrb- and huber unlike many of his compatriots , beckstein has managed to stay clear of personal and professional scandals .
he is close to his wife marga , considering her an important advisor .
the couple has three children .
beckstein 's law-and-order credentials will be important in the upcoming elections , patzelt predicts , since the views are popular in bavaria .
he ’ s seen as one of the more outspokenly conservative members of the csu .
his comments frequently draw criticism from opposition parties , immigrant rights groups and privacy advocates .
beckstein was criticized by muslims and social democrats in september when he suggested that law enforcement should keep tabs on germans who convert to islam .
the remarks came after two german converts to islam were arrested for allegedly taking part in a plot to bomb united states military installations and other targets in germany .
when " security forces learn of a conversion , they should establish whether it involves a liberal and humane form of islam or an islamist one , " beckstein told a german newspaper .
earlier , beckstein had said social democrats , who make up the liberal half of merkel 's ruling grand coalition , would share the blame for future terrorist attacks in germany .
the social democratic party has opposed conservatives ' plans to drastically widen security authorities ' access to personal data .
despite his reputation as a hardliner , beckstein is soft spoken in person and has the reputation of being a good boss , hirscher said .
" his track record in his political field is really very good . "
hirscher said .
if it 's not broken ...
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's economy is going strong bavaria is home to corporate giants like bmw and siemens .
in contrast to other german states , the economy there has performed well for several years and it 's unlikely that beckstein will decide on a drastic change in course .
he 'll likely carry forward plans stoiber put in place , experts say .
while the ruckus over stoiber 's departure caused a dip in the party 's popularity earlier this year , the latest polls show that the party has between 53 and 58 percent support among bavarians . the csu will aim to maintain its majority in the 2008 state elections .
after that , beckstein 's real test will be to make sure the csu has a good showing in the next round of european and national elections , currently planned for 2009 . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but literary critics disagree as to whether it 's a page-turner or a bore . julia franck 's lady midday -lrb- die mittagsfrau -rrb- tells the story of a woman who abandons her son at a train station in the final years of the third reich .
the story was based in part on the life of franck 's father who was , in fact abandoned by his grandmother in 1945 .
in honoring franck 's novel , the jury called it " spellbinding in its verbal immediacy , storytelling energy and psychological intensity . "
the german book prize carries a cash award of 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- and is considered a major literary springboard - previous winners have been translated into other languages , including english .
franck is a 37-year-old mother of two who was born in the former communist east germany but moved to the west as a child .
lady midday is her fifth book .
precise or pretentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franck has a reputation for being earnest like most high-profile literary awards , the german book prize gives critics the chance to argue long-windedly about whether the winner is any good .
and lady midday has proved no exception - with reviewers more or less evenly split on its quality .
" she may reign in her style but she gives it sufficient cold space to breathe and to resonate in precise images , " wrote one critic in the daily newspaper die welt .
" she constructs an almost classical drama of stations . "
but others are far less impressed .
" the book is overrun with stereotypical figures from 1920s berlin , and there , especially where the dialogue is concerned , the ' narrative intensity ' lauded by the jury descends into pretension , imprecision and , sometimes , kitsch , " carped another critic in the daily berliner der tagesspiegel .
franck will surely be the subject of further discussion at the frankfurt book fair , which starts on tuesday evening . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
grünberg and fert discovered in 1988 that minute magnetic changes in a gmr system lead to huge differences in electrical resistance .
these differences in turn cause changes in the current in the readout head , which scans a hard disk to spot the ones and zeroes in which the data is stored .
as a result , the readout head is able to read smaller and weaker magnetic areas - and this sensitivity means information can be packed more densely on the hard disk .
prize for practical application of nanotechnology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert fert is honored for his work on the miniature hard drive martin durrani , editor of physics world , a journal published by britain 's institute of physics , said the award was fitting .
" i am really pleased that it has gone for something very practically based and rooted in research relevant to industry , " he said .
" it shows that physics has a real relevance not just to understanding natural phenomena but to real products in everyday life . "
last year , the physics prize went to us space scientists john mather and george smoot for a pioneering space mission which supports the " big bang " theory about the origins of the universe .
grünberg and fert will be honored at a formal prize ceremony held as tradition dictates on dec .
10 , the anniversary of the death in 1896 of the prize 's creator , swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite alfred nobel .
the 2007 laureates will receive a gold medal , a diploma and 10 million swedish kronor -lrb- $ 1.53 million , 1.08 million euros -rrb- to be split between them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 , to refuse the appeal of khaled el-masri , a lebanese-born german .
us administration officials had called on the court to reject the case on national security grounds , arguing a public trial would reveal state secrets . " we are very disappointed , " el-masri 's german lawyer manfred gnjidic said of the decision , according to the associated press .
" this is going to completely shake all confidence in the american justice system . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gnjidic -lrb- right -rrb- and el-masri have appeared before several inquests into cia actions el-masri 's lawyers turned to the supreme court to clarify the limits of state secrecy after suits in two lower us courts were rejected .
the attorneys argued that , in the past , courts had limited evidence to what could be legally presented instead of completely stopping cases dealing with national security . " the central facts of this case are not state secrets and do not become so simply because the government insists otherwise , " ben wizner of the american civil liberties union wrote in the appeal . european criticism el-masri 's accusations sparked outrage in germany and drew worldwide attention to the cia 's " extraordinary rendition " program , which transported terror suspects to secret prisons in third countries for interrogation .
human rights groups , as well as several european governments and the european union have criticized the program . both the german government and the european parliament launched inquires into the program to find out what their authorities may have known about the us rendition program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extraordinary rendition program moved terror suspects over national borders for interrogation a german court in southern munich in january issued arrest warrants for 13 suspects in el-masri 's alleged kidnapping , but federal officials in berlin said in september that they would not pursue the suspects ' extradition to germany . el-masri accused the cia of kidnapping him on dec .
31 , 2003 in macedonia after he was confused with a sept .
11 terror suspect , then transporting him to afghanistan , where he says he was interrogated and tortured for four months before being released in albania . state secrets privilege the united states has never admitted that it played any role in el-masri 's detention .
the us administration also has asserted the so-called state secrets privilege in an effort to dismiss the lawsuits over the warrantless domestic spying program that president george w. bush created after the sept .
11 attacks . el-masri 's lawsuit sought damages of at least $ 75,000 -lrb- 53,000 euros -rrb- and was brought against former cia director george tenet , three private aviation companies and 20 unnamed employees of the cia and the companies . the 44-year-old german is currently in protective custody and is accused of an arson stack on a cash-and-carry market causing 500,000 euros worth of damage .
gnjidic has said that el-masri 's violent actions were caused by his torture at the hands of us officials . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" complaints like this are always the last resort when all the political measures have been exhausted , " dieter ameling , president of the german steel federation , said .
china , which was the world 's biggest importer of steel in 2004 , has since become the world 's biggest exporter and is now responsible for 34 percent of the world 's steel production .
environmental and quality standards questioned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german steel firms feel their product is being under cut european producers accuse chinese factories of failing to respect the environment and making poor quality steel .
the europeans also complain that about the large subsidies the state-run chinese steel companies receive .
" it is a situation of state-run production , while in the rest of the world steel is produced by private companies designed to create value , " said karl-ulrich koehler , the head of germany 's thyssenkrupp steel , the world 's tenth-biggest producer .
ameling said that " instead of exporting the steel that is produced in china at great cost to the environment , it would be better if the chinese withdrew their polluting products from the market . "
zhang xiaogang , chairman of the china iron and steel association , responded by telling the conference that inefficient steel mills would be closed by the end of the decade in a move towards consolidation .
" by 2010 , the iron and steel enterprises will be decreased greatly in number and production by the top 10 enterprise groups in the country will make up over 50 percent of gross crude steel production in china , " he said .
demand for steel expected to increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's economy will be one of those driving steel demand the international iron and steel institute -lrb- iisi -rrb- , which is hosting the conference , said in its latest forecast on monday that global demand for steel will keep growing next year in response to strong economies in china , africa and the middle east .
iisi expected steel demand to grow by 6.8 percent this year and by around the same level in 2008 , slightly more than a forecast earlier this year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a recent tv documentary revealed that exploitation of nazi prisoners made the family what it is .
now they 're ready to uncover the past . the quandt family announced on friday , oct .
5 that they were planning a research project to look into their relatives ' activities during the nazi regime .
the move represents a dramatic u-turn in the family 's policy of silence on the issue over the past several decades . " the accusations that have been raised against our family have moved us , " family members said in a statement .
" we recognize that , in our history as a german business family , the years 1933 to 1945 have not been sufficiently cleared up . " indeed , the quandt family 's dark side had been forgotten for many years - until german broadcaster ndr came out with a documentary film , which premiered on sunday , sept .
30 at the hamburg film festival . prisoners contributed to war effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther quandt 's son herbert ran a subsidiary of afa , which may have also used forced labor in the film , which was broadcast later that sunday night on germany 's ard television station , former prisoners of the nazis shared stories of their work during the war years in the afa battery factory , owned by günter quandt .
though munitions were also produced in the factory , the batteries themselves were also vital to hitler 's war effort . the forced laborers who appeared in the documentary told of beatings , mistreatment , and death . historians suspect that günther quandt made use of forced labor as early as 1938 .
by 1941 , thousands of prisoners were working in his battery factories in hanover , berlin and vienna , which also produced munitions .
hundreds died .
evidence suggests there may have even been a concentration camp facility complete with execution grounds and gallows . quandt referred in an internal document to a " fluctuation " of 80 people - most likely the planned death rate , reported german daily süddeutsche zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goebbels and magda quandt are seen here at their marriage ceremony ; hitler -lrb- far right -rrb- was best man in addition to allegedly exploiting nazi prisoners , the quandts also had personal ties to the nazi regime .
günther quandts first wife , magda ritschel , remarried joseph goebbels , hitler 's future propaganda minister , in 1931 , two years after her divorce from the business giant .
magda brought her son , harald quandt , into the marriage and he lived together with her and goebbels .
while the goebbels committed suicide in 1945 after poisoning their own children , harald - who was not with them - survived . documentary presented clandestinely two journalists spent five years researching the startling documentary , which was broadcast unannounced and not until 11:30 p.m.
the german weekly der spiegel speculated that the broadcaster may have been afraid of the powerful quandt family , which owns 46.6 percent of bmw and large portions of numerous other firms , including altana .
an ard spokesman , however , said a desire to avoid legal injunction played no role . only one member of the family , sven quandt , actually appeared in the film . " we finally have to try to forget about it , " he told der spiegel .
" every family has its dark side , " added quandt when asked about his grandfather 's ill reputed battery factory . precisely to what extent quandt profited from the forced labor and how bad the conditions there really were will have to be cleared up over the course of the planned historical research . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the study , published on tuesday by a team based at stirling university , says the annual death toll from occupational cancer may be as high as 24,000 .
the figure is four times as much as the official estimate .
meanwhile , a bbc investigation has found britain has lagged behind some other european countries in controlling known workplace carcinogens .
for the last 25 years the government 's occupational health watchdog , the health and safety executive , has estimated that only four per cent of cancers are work related - resulting in about 6,000 deaths a year .
' gross underestimate ' but the authors of the new study say that is a gross underestimate , which fails to take account of new chemicals , new under-regulated industries and the number of women in work .
they claim britain is facing an epidemic of work-related cancers costing the economy at least £ 29bn a year and the hse 's recommendations for action range " from complacent to non-existent . "
the head of the hse 's disease reduction programme told the bbc that cancer prevention is his top priority .
but an investigation by radio 4 's file on 4 programme has found the agency keeps no complete register of exposures to carcinogens in the workplace , that it has been slow to impose restrictions on some known cancer-causing chemicals .
it has also ruled out paying for a national investigation into health concerns in the microelectronics industry - even though it originally recommended one .

the study , published on tuesday by a team based at stirling university , says the annual death toll from occupational cancer may be as high as 24,000 .
the figure is four times as much as the official estimate .
meanwhile , a bbc investigation has found britain has lagged behind some other european countries in controlling known workplace carcinogens .
for the last 25 years the government 's occupational health watchdog , the health and safety executive , has estimated that only four per cent of cancers are work related - resulting in about 6,000 deaths a year .
' gross underestimate ' but the authors of the new study say that is a gross underestimate , which fails to take account of new chemicals , new under-regulated industries and the number of women in work .

the review will also look at how to protect young people from net pornography .
leading figures in the games industry give their views on the review .
david braben , founder frontier games a review might be useful but the review should not just look at one media , especially when media are intersecting .
one of my concerns is that the application of ratings and consideration of ratings is largely spoken to by how people consider film .
unifying the two would be helpful .
creating a review that is just one narrow part of the entertainment industry is a mistake .
perhaps 18 certificate games should not be sold in retail that is available to children david braben historically there has always been in government a luddite sentiment - whatever the new industry trends to take the blame of the latest ailment of society .
this is an industry which often does not answer back .
occasionally game ratings are seen as aspirational - i 've seen games with 18 ratings that do not deserve it .
if you look at comparison with film , the industry is dealing with similar issues .
we need to deal with awkward , moral issues in games .
the lack of interactivity in a film is worse - in a game you are in control .
we do n't have real enforcement of ratings .
perhaps 18 certificate games should not be sold in retail that is available to children .
just like adult only games in the us .
it 's a disgrace that there are games designed for 18 year olds being played by eight year olds .
there is an expectation of " it 's only a game " .
it 's as much an education issue as anything else and it applies equally to films .
" we do tend to be the people who get the blame first at the moment .
and that is a tragedy - because this industry is one of the most interesting media .
philip oliver , chief executive blitz games there are kids playing games that they should n't be .
and for that reason i welcome the review .
is the industry doing the right thing ?
i firmly believe we are .
everything is clearly labelled .
all the games have certificates on them .
i feel the breakdown in the games industry , as it is in every other media , is with parent 's understanding .
they are n't paying attention to the certificates .
that is partly because they do n't understand them and have a distorted image of games - that either they are harmless or totally evil .
the games industry makes titles for older gamers because that is where the market is .
they are not aimed at children philip oliver we need to educate parents - and if that is what this government review does , then i am very happy about that .
only a small percentage of games are rated 15 or over and the average age of a gamer is 28 years old .
the games industry makes titles for older gamers because that is where the market is .
they are not aimed at children .
if the movie industry did n't make titles for 18 audiences , you would n't have schindler 's list , saving private ryan and reservoir dogs .
there are games that do n't need to be made , such as manhunt 2 .
that title was banned , which shows the system is working .
margaret robertson , former editor of edge magazine the response to this review in the industry has been a deep sigh because we have been through this so many times .
there is need for a review but probably not for more legislation .
from within the games industry this problem is well mapped .
the games industry is holding itself to higher standards than the film industry .
this is a solved problem margaret robertson the uk games industry feels , quite justifiably , they are doing as much as they reasonably can so shop that games are for all and not just for children and therefore some of them have adult themes and are not suitable for younger players .
the combination of the bbfc and the pegi european ratings and the size of these ratings on boxes - typically larger than certificates on dvds - is an indication of that seriousness .
staff at most game shops are trained but again and again what we hear is that there is still a problem of getting parents to understand that a game may not be suitable for their children .
it 's hard to see what more could be done .
the games industry is holding itself to higher standards than the film industry .
this is a solved problem .
allowing that , everyone is united in not wanting material for older gamers to get into the hands of children .
this report may start finding some wider ways to do that .
paul jackson , chairman of elspa we feel quite positively about this review .
it 's clear the review is about making sure parents are properly informed about what their youngsters are playing and what they are accessing on the internet .
the video games industry is a very responsible industry and we are very tightly regulated .
we are keen to work with government in any way we can .
i think the video games industry is this year 's whipping boy paul jackson we are a successful industry .
the average age of gamers today is about 28 so we reserve the right to make content for all our consumers .
the key for us is to make sure parents understand age ratings .
there is no difference between an 18-rated film and an 18-rated game .
i think the video games industry is this year 's whipping boy. too often we are blamed for everything from obesity to youth violence it is just not true and it 's not appropriate .
we are a very important british industry and we are very responsible keen to ensure that our products are only played by those who they are designed for .

david braben , founder frontier games a review might be useful but the review should not just look at one media , especially when media are intersecting .
one of my concerns is that the application of ratings and consideration of ratings is largely spoken to by how people consider film .
unifying the two would be helpful .
creating a review that is just one narrow part of the entertainment industry is a mistake .
perhaps 18 certificate games should not be sold in retail that is available to children david braben historically there has always been in government a luddite sentiment - whatever the new industry trends to take the blame of the latest ailment of society .
this is an industry which often does not answer back .
occasionally game ratings are seen as aspirational - i 've seen games with 18 ratings that do not deserve it .
if you look at comparison with film , the industry is dealing with similar issues .
we need to deal with awkward , moral issues in games .
the lack of interactivity in a film is worse - in a game you are in control .
we do n't have real enforcement of ratings .
perhaps 18 certificate games should not be sold in retail that is available to children .
just like adult only games in the us .
it 's a disgrace that there are games designed for 18 year olds being played by eight year olds .
there is an expectation of " it 's only a game " .
it 's as much an education issue as anything else and it applies equally to films .

and that is a tragedy - because this industry is one of the most interesting media .
philip oliver , chief executive blitz games there are kids playing games that they should n't be .
and for that reason i welcome the review .
is the industry doing the right thing ?
i firmly believe we are .
everything is clearly labelled .
all the games have certificates on them .
i feel the breakdown in the games industry , as it is in every other media , is with parent 's understanding .
they are n't paying attention to the certificates .
that is partly because they do n't understand them and have a distorted image of games - that either they are harmless or totally evil .
the games industry makes titles for older gamers because that is where the market is .
they are not aimed at children philip oliver we need to educate parents - and if that is what this government review does , then i am very happy about that .
only a small percentage of games are rated 15 or over and the average age of a gamer is 28 years old .
the games industry makes titles for older gamers because that is where the market is .
they are not aimed at children .
if the movie industry did n't make titles for 18 audiences , you would n't have schindler 's list , saving private ryan and reservoir dogs .
there are games that do n't need to be made , such as manhunt 2 .
that title was banned , which shows the system is working .
margaret robertson , former editor of edge magazine the response to this review in the industry has been a deep sigh because we have been through this so many times .
there is need for a review but probably not for more legislation .
from within the games industry this problem is well mapped .
the games industry is holding itself to higher standards than the film industry .
this is a solved problem margaret robertson the uk games industry feels , quite justifiably , they are doing as much as they reasonably can so shop that games are for all and not just for children and therefore some of them have adult themes and are not suitable for younger players .
the combination of the bbfc and the pegi european ratings and the size of these ratings on boxes - typically larger than certificates on dvds - is an indication of that seriousness .

occasionally game ratings are seen as aspirational - i 've seen games with 18 ratings that do not deserve it .
if you look at comparison with film , the industry is dealing with similar issues .
we need to deal with awkward , moral issues in games .
the lack of interactivity in a film is worse - in a game you are in control .
we do n't have real enforcement of ratings .
perhaps 18 certificate games should not be sold in retail that is available to children .
just like adult only games in the us .
it 's a disgrace that there are games designed for 18 year olds being played by eight year olds .
there is an expectation of " it 's only a game " .
it 's as much an education issue as anything else and it applies equally to films .

and that is a tragedy - because this industry is one of the most interesting media .
philip oliver , chief executive blitz games there are kids playing games that they should n't be .
and for that reason i welcome the review .
is the industry doing the right thing ?
i firmly believe we are .
everything is clearly labelled .
all the games have certificates on them .
i feel the breakdown in the games industry , as it is in every other media , is with parent 's understanding .
they are n't paying attention to the certificates .
that is partly because they do n't understand them and have a distorted image of games - that either they are harmless or totally evil .
the games industry makes titles for older gamers because that is where the market is .
they are not aimed at children philip oliver we need to educate parents - and if that is what this government review does , then i am very happy about that .
only a small percentage of games are rated 15 or over and the average age of a gamer is 28 years old .
the games industry makes titles for older gamers because that is where the market is .
they are not aimed at children .
if the movie industry did n't make titles for 18 audiences , you would n't have schindler 's list , saving private ryan and reservoir dogs .
there are games that do n't need to be made , such as manhunt 2 .
that title was banned , which shows the system is working .
margaret robertson , former editor of edge magazine the response to this review in the industry has been a deep sigh because we have been through this so many times .
there is need for a review but probably not for more legislation .
from within the games industry this problem is well mapped .
the games industry is holding itself to higher standards than the film industry .
this is a solved problem margaret robertson the uk games industry feels , quite justifiably , they are doing as much as they reasonably can so shop that games are for all and not just for children and therefore some of them have adult themes and are not suitable for younger players .
the combination of the bbfc and the pegi european ratings and the size of these ratings on boxes - typically larger than certificates on dvds - is an indication of that seriousness .
staff at most game shops are trained but again and again what we hear is that there is still a problem of getting parents to understand that a game may not be suitable for their children .
it 's hard to see what more could be done .
the games industry is holding itself to higher standards than the film industry .
this is a solved problem .
allowing that , everyone is united in not wanting material for older gamers to get into the hands of children .
this report may start finding some wider ways to do that .
paul jackson , chairman of elspa we feel quite positively about this review .
it 's clear the review is about making sure parents are properly informed about what their youngsters are playing and what they are accessing on the internet .
the video games industry is a very responsible industry and we are very tightly regulated .
we are keen to work with government in any way we can .
i think the video games industry is this year 's whipping boy paul jackson we are a successful industry .
the average age of gamers today is about 28 so we reserve the right to make content for all our consumers .
the key for us is to make sure parents understand age ratings .
there is no difference between an 18-rated film and an 18-rated game .
i think the video games industry is this year 's whipping boy. too often we are blamed for everything from obesity to youth violence it is just not true and it 's not appropriate .
we are a very important british industry and we are very responsible keen to ensure that our products are only played by those who they are designed for .

when you 're in a queue to look around a secondary school where your child has almost no chance of getting a place , it does n't exactly feel like " school choice " .
it 's more like school rationing - or a sprint for the lifeboats rather than a relaxed , informed decision about the best possible education for your child .
in many parts of england , it 's almost time to send back the forms for next year 's secondary school places .
anyone with a child in the last year of primary school will know what i 'm talking about - because they wo n't have been talking about anything else for weeks .
you can see knots of these parents talking conspiratorially about the schools they 've visited - swapping details of prospectuses , head teachers ' presentations and catchment areas measured down to the last centimetre .
translation in the parental chats there 's a kind of sub-text .
" a really lively bunch of kids , but not quite right for my child , " is a sensitively liberal way of saying a sink school with a terrifying playground .
looking for hogwarts on the application form " lots of lovely music " is a politely conservative way of saying appalling gcse results , when you 're worried that the other person might already have a child there .
or there 's the patronising : " such a caring , unpushy environment " , which means woodwork - sorry , " resistant materials " - is the strongest subject .
it 's a good school ... for someone else 's children .
" if we do n't get a place in that school ... we 'll really have to think hard , " says the person who has already checked out the private school fees .
" we 're so lucky to be so accidentally near , " says the family which has expended money , arguments and tears in househunting in a quarter-mile radius .
or there 's the adeptly ambiguous : " the new head is really turning it around " , which means , most of the kids are starting to leave their guns at home these days .
three-legged race this is a decision which will have a huge significance for a child 's future .
but it can feel like some kind of unfunny version of the three-legged parents ' race at a school sports day .
your comments caring parents would rather be seen as pushy than dump their kids with lots of feral chavs .
jackie , tunbridge wells i am one of the bunch of feral chavs referred to in the previous e-mail ...
barry , liverpool read your comments every time you get near to thinking you 've found the right school , you 're tripped up .
right exam results , but wrong place .
right place , but wrong results .
if it 's so good that you want to send your child there , it 's going to be too oversubscribed to get a place .
it 's the catchment-22 .
open days , when hopeful parents are shepherded round schools , are a real eye-opener .
how can schools be so different in results when they are supposed to be serving the same local community ?
two non-selective schools , a few streets away from each other , have gcse results in which one school is literally twice as good as the other .
guess which one turns away nine out of 10 applicants ?
these tours , bringing pr to the 3rs , also show how different schools can look .
there are slickly modern places where the pupils keep their work on memory sticks rather than in bookbags - and places with house points and prefects in gowns .
there are banks of gleaming computers , music recording studios and school halls filled with latin and blazers .
fair , unfair but for parents , the biggest difference is between those where you can get a place and those where you ca n't .
an important step in the school admissions process so people get strategic .
being able to buy a house near a successful school , deploying those music lesson skills , belonging to a religion , being in the right ability band , the luck of the draw in a lottery , are all advantages in the " fair admissions " sweepstake .
living near the school is the most common admissions factor , but there 's nothing inherently fair about that kind of localism , particularly when it 's based on how much house you can afford .
if a public employer favoured job applicants living nearest the workplace , there would be outrage .
or if a successful surgeon always gave priority to those living in nearby streets , it would n't seem right .
but who can blame parents for wanting to grab the best chances for their children ?
guilt trip it 's a guilt trip either way - with all kinds of social divisions lurking just below the surface .
there are schools which use a lottery to allocate places if you use your sharp elbows to get a good school for your child - making all those calculations about music scholarships and catchment areas - you 're accused of being pushy .
if you let your child drift into the nearest school despite its quagmire reputation , you 're nagged by self-doubt about letting them down .
and it raises some awkward unspoken questions .
what are parents really looking for ?
a school where the other children are like their own ?
or are they actively avoiding schools with the " wrong " kind of kids ?
what kind of judgements are being made about accents , ambitions , class and race ?
when parents are trying to help their children get a head start in life , whose heads are they going to trample over to get there ?
because , whichever hoops are jumped through , someone 's children are going to end up in the worst and the best schools .
here is a selection of your comments : i am at this moment in time filling in the forms for secondary transfer .
i live in wd3 which is supposed to be the catchment area for my local school , i do n't think i have a hope in hell 's chance of my son actually getting into that school as they like to cream the best students on academic ability .
i still have no hope of him getting a place as we just do n't live near enough to the local school school gate .
measured in metres after the academic students have been allocated .
another anxious parent who is not sleeping well at night ! ! !
adele deanus , hertfordshire i live around the corner from the best secondary school in the area , one of the best schools in the country .
did n't move there because of the school , but because of the house and the area .
i get leaflets pushed through my door from people wanting to rent out my address in order to get their children into the school .
some kids are coming miles by train and bus to go there - it 's ridiculous that schools can be so very different in results that people have to do this for their kids .
hannah , potters bar , herts mine are currently in years 8 and 10 so i 've worn this t-shirt twice .
try to be open minded but have a back up plan .
ours unfortunately was remortgage plus loan to a private school , after 2 years of bullying .
home schooling was plan 3 if we could n't raise the money .
the comps are n't full of feral kids , but it only takes one disengaged individual to make a lot of children 's lives miserable and make the lessons so disruptive they are pointless .
andrea i used to think that parents who went to a lot of trouble to get their children into high performing and generally white and middle-class schools were snobs or covert racists .
then i sent my daughter to an inner city comprehensive .
although i 'm happy with the standard of teaching at her school , she has to put up with terrible bullying as one of the few middle-class children in the school , and she gets frustrated at the high levels of disruption during lessons .
now i 'm desperate to move her to one of those snobby middle-class schools , but i ca n't .
we live outside the catchment area of all of the schools with a reasonable reputation and as atheists , we are n't eligible to go to any of the faith schools which have wider catchment areas .
heather , london we have the rather bizarre situation where a small number of parents have hired a lawyer to get the admissions policy for our local secondary school changed .
it is the distance you live from the next alternative school that matters and not how close you are to the school in question .
we now expect children who could walk to the secondary school to be allocated a school further away such that they will need some form of transport !
unfortunately money talks , even in state education !
dave , bookham , surrey we are in this position having a child in year 6 .
our problem is that the local school , which has a really good reputation is closing and will merge with another school , with not so good results when he will be in year 10 .
this is so frustrating for us and him .
at present a group of parents are taking the sheffield council to court over this decision , we shall have to see what happens ...
emma , sheffield the article makes no mention of that most unpleasant tactic - renting a property in the catchment area for a few months .
i 've even seen a family ' break up ' - mother and eldest child pretend to live in a rented flat , but get back together with father and the other children once a place has been secured .
of course , the younger children also go to the school under the sibling rule .
for every child who gains a place that way , and each of its siblings , a family which should have got a place , does n't .
bill , bristol i 'm in this dilemma .
my son is very bright , and with his agreement , he 's just started at the local comp .
they do n't get the best results in their exams , but the school and the teachers seem caring enough .
his grandparents on the other hand think he should go to a private school , or out-of-area grammar .
well , i went to a very good comp myself and hate this stigmatisation of comp schools .
i 'd like to think we can make his school a better place too by getting involved .
sarah , sandhurst what really has annoyed me in the search for a decent school is that i have looked at seven different schools and the one that our son would do best at and his first choice he may not get in on distance , yet a parent who has outwardly expressed that she does n't care about her childs education is guaranteed a place in the same school .
aagh !
adele , hounslow if you have to jump through hoops to get in , at least the school will be full of children whose parents care about education .
the grammar schools here , selecting on ability , have a wider social and ethnic mix than they would have done if the intake was purely local .
other local schools , both faith schools and other specialist ones , also do very well .
caring parents would rather be seen as pushy than dump their kids with lots of feral chavs .
jackie , tunbridge wells , kent i am one of the bunch of feral chavs referred to in a previous email .
i went to a local comp with a poor reputation .
this has not been a bar to my progressing in life .
unfortunately , for a lot of children the stigmatism of going to a comp means they either become over-achievers if they are intelligent or they accept that they are never going to succeed , fade away and remain with their " class " of people .
simply put , the current system leads to the ghettoisation of educational standards into those who can afford to buy a house near the right school and those who ca n't and therefore end up suffering with a downward spiral of a school which can not attract good teachers and gets worse results .
barry , liverpool the last thing i want for my kid is to turn him into a well-qualified angst-ridden mess who crumbles every time he 's confronted by someone from a less fortunate background .
a bit of ' feral chav exposure ' is n't always a bad thing ... in small doses .
on the other hand , and as a counter-point to mr liddle 's point , consider this : are they feral chavs because they 're poor , or poor because they 're feral chavs ?
bit of both , probably - but money alone just ai n't the answer .
joel , beaconsfield , bucks the strange thing is , i 'm having trouble booking time off work to attend all of these open days .
my employers can not figure out why i have to look at so many schools when the old system of - you go where 's closest - was ditched .
secondly , how is this any fairer ?
we still have to list a minimum of six schools , and it 's still pot luck which one you get !
stupid .
mike , london i am having exactly the same problem , i am not in any catchment area for a secondary school as i fall just outside and have no hope of getting in anywhere .
shame really when we live right across the road to one of the best state girl 's schools in the country but because of their selectiveness and high achievement we wo n't get in there either .
it is no longer visit the school and choose which one you want to go to but a strategic plan of which school you are more likely to secure a place at , even then some children from our area end up with no school at all and parent 's re-mortgage their houses in order to pay private fees .
what is this country coming to when all we hear from the govenment is education , education , education - but for who ?
nichola , hampstead garden suburbs , london i know a local lettings agent who regularly rents out a flat in a block next door to an excellent local school for a short term let .
the price ? £ 3000 a month for 6 months .
that 's still only the equivalent of one year 's fees at a private school , so well worth it for many parents .
john , richmond , surrey i think we need to get away from the idea that school admissions can ever be " fair " - what does that really mean ?
the biggest determinant of school performance is not the building , the teachers , or even the catchment area - it 's the pupils which attend , and that means high performing schools will be always be selective .
people have no issue with this is higher education -lrb- oxford and cambridge are very selective -rrb- so why all the liberal handwringing about selection in secondary education ?
matt munro , bristol we have just made the decision to go down the private school route .
we are white - but not middle class , and definitely not well off .
we can not afford to move to a house near the better senior schools and our local state school has is so appalling that we worked out it was cheaper to do the school fees - or rather , we could space out the payments - than to move house .
we would have to spend £ 500,000 or more on a house near good schools in our borough , and we simply can not afford that .
school fees for the next 10 years come in at way under that cost - so for us there has been no choice .
to get a good education for our child we 've been forced out of the state system - which is kind of backwards to how it should be !
flora , london looking for a secondary school should n't be a big issue but it is because of the large number of schools with such poor results .
or to put it bluntly the number of schools that produce pupils which are failures .
john , london personally , i think choice has got out of hand .
our daughter goes to secondary school next year and we 're now finding that our choice of primary feeder school leaves us in a low-priority criteria for the school we 're living in the catchment area for !
as far as i 'm concerned , i do n't want to " choose " the best school for my child - this is a ridiculous situation that results in " good and bad " schools .
every school should be equally funded , regardless of their results or success and every child should be able to attend a good quality secondary school close to their friends , their home and within their community .
angela , bucks i am one of those parents who are indeed desprately trying to just get their son or daughter into a good school near their home .
unfortunately this good school falls under the surrey county councils unfair policy sweepstake .
which means my child is 4th on the priority selection list because he is n't in foster care or has special needs and he does n't have a sibling at the school already , infact it 's just down to where he lives right now !
this is ludicrous that we have to wait for places behind the families with siblings at the school already , especially as some of the children 's families have moved away and are no longer in the catchment area .
what happened to feeder school places ?
this is all so worrying and unnecessary pressure on the parent lisa , redhill , surrey with the lottery that is school places now , despite having gone to a comprehensive , i would not rely on sending my kids to a state school now .
in fact , in this country at the moment , there is a strong argument to say you have a moral obligation to ensure you have enough money for private education before siring a child .
even if that money is only there to be used if you ca n't get a grammar school place .
dave , london is n't this why we had tests for grammar schools all those years ago ?
then it was the kids who decided as it were rather than the parents .
phil thomas , wokingham some people are just too pushy for their children .
you have to remember that it is your kid and not you that has to spend seven years at the school five miles away .
school should be fun as well as an education , and turning into the most stressful time of a person 's life will do no good in the long run .
nick , london no choice here in rural pembrokeshire , you 've got one choice and that 's it .
it 's a comprehensive my twin daughters go to and as their abilities differ i 've watched the more academic one receive a completely different education to the less academic one .
but all you can do is stand up for your child 's rights and be firm and in my experience anything can be sorted .
my girls mix with all sorts and it 's done them no harm , if anything it 's made them aware how fortunate they are .
i do hate the idea that they go to the same school i did though , seems a failure on my part somehow .
liz , pembroke dock , wales this problem is endemic througout britain , not just england .
whilst the article mildly criticises the method used in placements ie catchment areas , there is always going to be some kind of selection process when you have demand exceeding supply .
sadly , there is no easy solution ; those areas where poverty is more rife will inevitably have schools that do not perform as well as those schools that are located in areas where poverty is less of an issue .
abolish povery and the problem wo n't exist .
easy , no ?
j gordon liddle , edinburgh , lothian what a hideous system we have produced !
where children 's expectation of a decent education appears to be on condition of their parent 's ability to move the right area , afford private education or tutoring to pass entrance exams or willingness to cheat and lie to get them into their favoured seat of education .
all children should be given the opportunity to a decent education regardless of their background !
this includes children who might not be highly academic but have a willingness to work hard and achieve .
if we all supported our local school and got involved in making our children feel good about where and how they learn our education system would be a much better place !

when you 're in a queue to look around a secondary school where your child has almost no chance of getting a place , it does n't exactly feel like " school choice " .
it 's more like school rationing - or a sprint for the lifeboats rather than a relaxed , informed decision about the best possible education for your child .
in many parts of england , it 's almost time to send back the forms for next year 's secondary school places .
anyone with a child in the last year of primary school will know what i 'm talking about - because they wo n't have been talking about anything else for weeks .
you can see knots of these parents talking conspiratorially about the schools they 've visited - swapping details of prospectuses , head teachers ' presentations and catchment areas measured down to the last centimetre .
translation in the parental chats there 's a kind of sub-text .
" a really lively bunch of kids , but not quite right for my child , " is a sensitively liberal way of saying a sink school with a terrifying playground .
looking for hogwarts on the application form " lots of lovely music " is a politely conservative way of saying appalling gcse results , when you 're worried that the other person might already have a child there .
or there 's the patronising : " such a caring , unpushy environment " , which means woodwork - sorry , " resistant materials " - is the strongest subject .
it 's a good school ... for someone else 's children .
" if we do n't get a place in that school ... we 'll really have to think hard , " says the person who has already checked out the private school fees .
" we 're so lucky to be so accidentally near , " says the family which has expended money , arguments and tears in househunting in a quarter-mile radius .
or there 's the adeptly ambiguous : " the new head is really turning it around " , which means , most of the kids are starting to leave their guns at home these days .
three-legged race this is a decision which will have a huge significance for a child 's future .
but it can feel like some kind of unfunny version of the three-legged parents ' race at a school sports day .
your comments caring parents would rather be seen as pushy than dump their kids with lots of feral chavs .
jackie , tunbridge wells i am one of the bunch of feral chavs referred to in the previous e-mail ...
barry , liverpool read your comments every time you get near to thinking you 've found the right school , you 're tripped up .
right exam results , but wrong place .
right place , but wrong results .
if it 's so good that you want to send your child there , it 's going to be too oversubscribed to get a place .
it 's the catchment-22 .
open days , when hopeful parents are shepherded round schools , are a real eye-opener .
how can schools be so different in results when they are supposed to be serving the same local community ?
two non-selective schools , a few streets away from each other , have gcse results in which one school is literally twice as good as the other .
guess which one turns away nine out of 10 applicants ?
these tours , bringing pr to the 3rs , also show how different schools can look .
there are slickly modern places where the pupils keep their work on memory sticks rather than in bookbags - and places with house points and prefects in gowns .
there are banks of gleaming computers , music recording studios and school halls filled with latin and blazers .
fair , unfair but for parents , the biggest difference is between those where you can get a place and those where you ca n't .
an important step in the school admissions process so people get strategic .
being able to buy a house near a successful school , deploying those music lesson skills , belonging to a religion , being in the right ability band , the luck of the draw in a lottery , are all advantages in the " fair admissions " sweepstake .
living near the school is the most common admissions factor , but there 's nothing inherently fair about that kind of localism , particularly when it 's based on how much house you can afford .
if a public employer favoured job applicants living nearest the workplace , there would be outrage .
or if a successful surgeon always gave priority to those living in nearby streets , it would n't seem right .
but who can blame parents for wanting to grab the best chances for their children ?
guilt trip it 's a guilt trip either way - with all kinds of social divisions lurking just below the surface .
there are schools which use a lottery to allocate places if you use your sharp elbows to get a good school for your child - making all those calculations about music scholarships and catchment areas - you 're accused of being pushy .
if you let your child drift into the nearest school despite its quagmire reputation , you 're nagged by self-doubt about letting them down .
and it raises some awkward unspoken questions .
what are parents really looking for ?
a school where the other children are like their own ?
or are they actively avoiding schools with the " wrong " kind of kids ?
what kind of judgements are being made about accents , ambitions , class and race ?
when parents are trying to help their children get a head start in life , whose heads are they going to trample over to get there ?
because , whichever hoops are jumped through , someone 's children are going to end up in the worst and the best schools .
here is a selection of your comments : i am at this moment in time filling in the forms for secondary transfer .
i live in wd3 which is supposed to be the catchment area for my local school , i do n't think i have a hope in hell 's chance of my son actually getting into that school as they like to cream the best students on academic ability .
i still have no hope of him getting a place as we just do n't live near enough to the local school school gate .
measured in metres after the academic students have been allocated .
another anxious parent who is not sleeping well at night ! ! !
adele deanus , hertfordshire i live around the corner from the best secondary school in the area , one of the best schools in the country .
did n't move there because of the school , but because of the house and the area .
i get leaflets pushed through my door from people wanting to rent out my address in order to get their children into the school .
some kids are coming miles by train and bus to go there - it 's ridiculous that schools can be so very different in results that people have to do this for their kids .
hannah , potters bar , herts mine are currently in years 8 and 10 so i 've worn this t-shirt twice .
try to be open minded but have a back up plan .
ours unfortunately was remortgage plus loan to a private school , after 2 years of bullying .
home schooling was plan 3 if we could n't raise the money .
the comps are n't full of feral kids , but it only takes one disengaged individual to make a lot of children 's lives miserable and make the lessons so disruptive they are pointless .
andrea i used to think that parents who went to a lot of trouble to get their children into high performing and generally white and middle-class schools were snobs or covert racists .
then i sent my daughter to an inner city comprehensive .
although i 'm happy with the standard of teaching at her school , she has to put up with terrible bullying as one of the few middle-class children in the school , and she gets frustrated at the high levels of disruption during lessons .
now i 'm desperate to move her to one of those snobby middle-class schools , but i ca n't .
we live outside the catchment area of all of the schools with a reasonable reputation and as atheists , we are n't eligible to go to any of the faith schools which have wider catchment areas .
heather , london we have the rather bizarre situation where a small number of parents have hired a lawyer to get the admissions policy for our local secondary school changed .
it is the distance you live from the next alternative school that matters and not how close you are to the school in question .
we now expect children who could walk to the secondary school to be allocated a school further away such that they will need some form of transport !
unfortunately money talks , even in state education !
dave , bookham , surrey we are in this position having a child in year 6 .
our problem is that the local school , which has a really good reputation is closing and will merge with another school , with not so good results when he will be in year 10 .
this is so frustrating for us and him .
at present a group of parents are taking the sheffield council to court over this decision , we shall have to see what happens ...
emma , sheffield the article makes no mention of that most unpleasant tactic - renting a property in the catchment area for a few months .
i 've even seen a family ' break up ' - mother and eldest child pretend to live in a rented flat , but get back together with father and the other children once a place has been secured .
of course , the younger children also go to the school under the sibling rule .
for every child who gains a place that way , and each of its siblings , a family which should have got a place , does n't .
bill , bristol i 'm in this dilemma .
my son is very bright , and with his agreement , he 's just started at the local comp .
they do n't get the best results in their exams , but the school and the teachers seem caring enough .
his grandparents on the other hand think he should go to a private school , or out-of-area grammar .
well , i went to a very good comp myself and hate this stigmatisation of comp schools .
i 'd like to think we can make his school a better place too by getting involved .
sarah , sandhurst what really has annoyed me in the search for a decent school is that i have looked at seven different schools and the one that our son would do best at and his first choice he may not get in on distance , yet a parent who has outwardly expressed that she does n't care about her childs education is guaranteed a place in the same school .
aagh !
adele , hounslow if you have to jump through hoops to get in , at least the school will be full of children whose parents care about education .
the grammar schools here , selecting on ability , have a wider social and ethnic mix than they would have done if the intake was purely local .
other local schools , both faith schools and other specialist ones , also do very well .
caring parents would rather be seen as pushy than dump their kids with lots of feral chavs .
jackie , tunbridge wells , kent i am one of the bunch of feral chavs referred to in a previous email .
i went to a local comp with a poor reputation .
this has not been a bar to my progressing in life .
unfortunately , for a lot of children the stigmatism of going to a comp means they either become over-achievers if they are intelligent or they accept that they are never going to succeed , fade away and remain with their " class " of people .
simply put , the current system leads to the ghettoisation of educational standards into those who can afford to buy a house near the right school and those who ca n't and therefore end up suffering with a downward spiral of a school which can not attract good teachers and gets worse results .
barry , liverpool the last thing i want for my kid is to turn him into a well-qualified angst-ridden mess who crumbles every time he 's confronted by someone from a less fortunate background .
a bit of ' feral chav exposure ' is n't always a bad thing ... in small doses .
on the other hand , and as a counter-point to mr liddle 's point , consider this : are they feral chavs because they 're poor , or poor because they 're feral chavs ?
bit of both , probably - but money alone just ai n't the answer .
joel , beaconsfield , bucks the strange thing is , i 'm having trouble booking time off work to attend all of these open days .
my employers can not figure out why i have to look at so many schools when the old system of - you go where 's closest - was ditched .
secondly , how is this any fairer ?
we still have to list a minimum of six schools , and it 's still pot luck which one you get !
stupid .
mike , london i am having exactly the same problem , i am not in any catchment area for a secondary school as i fall just outside and have no hope of getting in anywhere .
shame really when we live right across the road to one of the best state girl 's schools in the country but because of their selectiveness and high achievement we wo n't get in there either .
it is no longer visit the school and choose which one you want to go to but a strategic plan of which school you are more likely to secure a place at , even then some children from our area end up with no school at all and parent 's re-mortgage their houses in order to pay private fees .
what is this country coming to when all we hear from the govenment is education , education , education - but for who ?
nichola , hampstead garden suburbs , london i know a local lettings agent who regularly rents out a flat in a block next door to an excellent local school for a short term let .

there are banks of gleaming computers , music recording studios and school halls filled with latin and blazers .
fair , unfair but for parents , the biggest difference is between those where you can get a place and those where you ca n't .
an important step in the school admissions process so people get strategic .
being able to buy a house near a successful school , deploying those music lesson skills , belonging to a religion , being in the right ability band , the luck of the draw in a lottery , are all advantages in the " fair admissions " sweepstake .
living near the school is the most common admissions factor , but there 's nothing inherently fair about that kind of localism , particularly when it 's based on how much house you can afford .
if a public employer favoured job applicants living nearest the workplace , there would be outrage .
or if a successful surgeon always gave priority to those living in nearby streets , it would n't seem right .
but who can blame parents for wanting to grab the best chances for their children ?
guilt trip it 's a guilt trip either way - with all kinds of social divisions lurking just below the surface .
there are schools which use a lottery to allocate places if you use your sharp elbows to get a good school for your child - making all those calculations about music scholarships and catchment areas - you 're accused of being pushy .
if you let your child drift into the nearest school despite its quagmire reputation , you 're nagged by self-doubt about letting them down .
and it raises some awkward unspoken questions .
what are parents really looking for ?
a school where the other children are like their own ?
or are they actively avoiding schools with the " wrong " kind of kids ?
what kind of judgements are being made about accents , ambitions , class and race ?
when parents are trying to help their children get a head start in life , whose heads are they going to trample over to get there ?
because , whichever hoops are jumped through , someone 's children are going to end up in the worst and the best schools .
here is a selection of your comments : i am at this moment in time filling in the forms for secondary transfer .
i live in wd3 which is supposed to be the catchment area for my local school , i do n't think i have a hope in hell 's chance of my son actually getting into that school as they like to cream the best students on academic ability .
i still have no hope of him getting a place as we just do n't live near enough to the local school school gate .
measured in metres after the academic students have been allocated .
another anxious parent who is not sleeping well at night ! ! !
adele deanus , hertfordshire i live around the corner from the best secondary school in the area , one of the best schools in the country .
did n't move there because of the school , but because of the house and the area .
i get leaflets pushed through my door from people wanting to rent out my address in order to get their children into the school .
some kids are coming miles by train and bus to go there - it 's ridiculous that schools can be so very different in results that people have to do this for their kids .
hannah , potters bar , herts mine are currently in years 8 and 10 so i 've worn this t-shirt twice .
try to be open minded but have a back up plan .
ours unfortunately was remortgage plus loan to a private school , after 2 years of bullying .
home schooling was plan 3 if we could n't raise the money .
the comps are n't full of feral kids , but it only takes one disengaged individual to make a lot of children 's lives miserable and make the lessons so disruptive they are pointless .
andrea i used to think that parents who went to a lot of trouble to get their children into high performing and generally white and middle-class schools were snobs or covert racists .
then i sent my daughter to an inner city comprehensive .
although i 'm happy with the standard of teaching at her school , she has to put up with terrible bullying as one of the few middle-class children in the school , and she gets frustrated at the high levels of disruption during lessons .
now i 'm desperate to move her to one of those snobby middle-class schools , but i ca n't .
we live outside the catchment area of all of the schools with a reasonable reputation and as atheists , we are n't eligible to go to any of the faith schools which have wider catchment areas .
heather , london we have the rather bizarre situation where a small number of parents have hired a lawyer to get the admissions policy for our local secondary school changed .
it is the distance you live from the next alternative school that matters and not how close you are to the school in question .
we now expect children who could walk to the secondary school to be allocated a school further away such that they will need some form of transport !
unfortunately money talks , even in state education !
dave , bookham , surrey we are in this position having a child in year 6 .
our problem is that the local school , which has a really good reputation is closing and will merge with another school , with not so good results when he will be in year 10 .
this is so frustrating for us and him .
at present a group of parents are taking the sheffield council to court over this decision , we shall have to see what happens ...
emma , sheffield the article makes no mention of that most unpleasant tactic - renting a property in the catchment area for a few months .
i 've even seen a family ' break up ' - mother and eldest child pretend to live in a rented flat , but get back together with father and the other children once a place has been secured .
of course , the younger children also go to the school under the sibling rule .
for every child who gains a place that way , and each of its siblings , a family which should have got a place , does n't .
bill , bristol i 'm in this dilemma .
my son is very bright , and with his agreement , he 's just started at the local comp .
they do n't get the best results in their exams , but the school and the teachers seem caring enough .
his grandparents on the other hand think he should go to a private school , or out-of-area grammar .
well , i went to a very good comp myself and hate this stigmatisation of comp schools .
i 'd like to think we can make his school a better place too by getting involved .
sarah , sandhurst what really has annoyed me in the search for a decent school is that i have looked at seven different schools and the one that our son would do best at and his first choice he may not get in on distance , yet a parent who has outwardly expressed that she does n't care about her childs education is guaranteed a place in the same school .
aagh !
adele , hounslow if you have to jump through hoops to get in , at least the school will be full of children whose parents care about education .
the grammar schools here , selecting on ability , have a wider social and ethnic mix than they would have done if the intake was purely local .
other local schools , both faith schools and other specialist ones , also do very well .
caring parents would rather be seen as pushy than dump their kids with lots of feral chavs .
jackie , tunbridge wells , kent i am one of the bunch of feral chavs referred to in a previous email .
i went to a local comp with a poor reputation .
this has not been a bar to my progressing in life .
unfortunately , for a lot of children the stigmatism of going to a comp means they either become over-achievers if they are intelligent or they accept that they are never going to succeed , fade away and remain with their " class " of people .
simply put , the current system leads to the ghettoisation of educational standards into those who can afford to buy a house near the right school and those who ca n't and therefore end up suffering with a downward spiral of a school which can not attract good teachers and gets worse results .
barry , liverpool the last thing i want for my kid is to turn him into a well-qualified angst-ridden mess who crumbles every time he 's confronted by someone from a less fortunate background .
a bit of ' feral chav exposure ' is n't always a bad thing ... in small doses .
on the other hand , and as a counter-point to mr liddle 's point , consider this : are they feral chavs because they 're poor , or poor because they 're feral chavs ?
bit of both , probably - but money alone just ai n't the answer .
joel , beaconsfield , bucks the strange thing is , i 'm having trouble booking time off work to attend all of these open days .
my employers can not figure out why i have to look at so many schools when the old system of - you go where 's closest - was ditched .
secondly , how is this any fairer ?
we still have to list a minimum of six schools , and it 's still pot luck which one you get !
stupid .
mike , london i am having exactly the same problem , i am not in any catchment area for a secondary school as i fall just outside and have no hope of getting in anywhere .
shame really when we live right across the road to one of the best state girl 's schools in the country but because of their selectiveness and high achievement we wo n't get in there either .
it is no longer visit the school and choose which one you want to go to but a strategic plan of which school you are more likely to secure a place at , even then some children from our area end up with no school at all and parent 's re-mortgage their houses in order to pay private fees .
what is this country coming to when all we hear from the govenment is education , education , education - but for who ?
nichola , hampstead garden suburbs , london i know a local lettings agent who regularly rents out a flat in a block next door to an excellent local school for a short term let .
the price ? £ 3000 a month for 6 months .
that 's still only the equivalent of one year 's fees at a private school , so well worth it for many parents .
john , richmond , surrey i think we need to get away from the idea that school admissions can ever be " fair " - what does that really mean ?
the biggest determinant of school performance is not the building , the teachers , or even the catchment area - it 's the pupils which attend , and that means high performing schools will be always be selective .
people have no issue with this is higher education -lrb- oxford and cambridge are very selective -rrb- so why all the liberal handwringing about selection in secondary education ?
matt munro , bristol we have just made the decision to go down the private school route .
we are white - but not middle class , and definitely not well off .
we can not afford to move to a house near the better senior schools and our local state school has is so appalling that we worked out it was cheaper to do the school fees - or rather , we could space out the payments - than to move house .
we would have to spend £ 500,000 or more on a house near good schools in our borough , and we simply can not afford that .
school fees for the next 10 years come in at way under that cost - so for us there has been no choice .
to get a good education for our child we 've been forced out of the state system - which is kind of backwards to how it should be !
flora , london looking for a secondary school should n't be a big issue but it is because of the large number of schools with such poor results .
or to put it bluntly the number of schools that produce pupils which are failures .
john , london personally , i think choice has got out of hand .
our daughter goes to secondary school next year and we 're now finding that our choice of primary feeder school leaves us in a low-priority criteria for the school we 're living in the catchment area for !
as far as i 'm concerned , i do n't want to " choose " the best school for my child - this is a ridiculous situation that results in " good and bad " schools .
every school should be equally funded , regardless of their results or success and every child should be able to attend a good quality secondary school close to their friends , their home and within their community .
angela , bucks i am one of those parents who are indeed desprately trying to just get their son or daughter into a good school near their home .
unfortunately this good school falls under the surrey county councils unfair policy sweepstake .
which means my child is 4th on the priority selection list because he is n't in foster care or has special needs and he does n't have a sibling at the school already , infact it 's just down to where he lives right now !
this is ludicrous that we have to wait for places behind the families with siblings at the school already , especially as some of the children 's families have moved away and are no longer in the catchment area .
what happened to feeder school places ?
this is all so worrying and unnecessary pressure on the parent lisa , redhill , surrey with the lottery that is school places now , despite having gone to a comprehensive , i would not rely on sending my kids to a state school now .
in fact , in this country at the moment , there is a strong argument to say you have a moral obligation to ensure you have enough money for private education before siring a child .
even if that money is only there to be used if you ca n't get a grammar school place .
dave , london is n't this why we had tests for grammar schools all those years ago ?
then it was the kids who decided as it were rather than the parents .
phil thomas , wokingham some people are just too pushy for their children .
you have to remember that it is your kid and not you that has to spend seven years at the school five miles away .
school should be fun as well as an education , and turning into the most stressful time of a person 's life will do no good in the long run .
nick , london no choice here in rural pembrokeshire , you 've got one choice and that 's it .
it 's a comprehensive my twin daughters go to and as their abilities differ i 've watched the more academic one receive a completely different education to the less academic one .
but all you can do is stand up for your child 's rights and be firm and in my experience anything can be sorted .
my girls mix with all sorts and it 's done them no harm , if anything it 's made them aware how fortunate they are .
i do hate the idea that they go to the same school i did though , seems a failure on my part somehow .
liz , pembroke dock , wales this problem is endemic througout britain , not just england .
whilst the article mildly criticises the method used in placements ie catchment areas , there is always going to be some kind of selection process when you have demand exceeding supply .
sadly , there is no easy solution ; those areas where poverty is more rife will inevitably have schools that do not perform as well as those schools that are located in areas where poverty is less of an issue .
abolish povery and the problem wo n't exist .
easy , no ?
j gordon liddle , edinburgh , lothian what a hideous system we have produced !
where children 's expectation of a decent education appears to be on condition of their parent 's ability to move the right area , afford private education or tutoring to pass entrance exams or willingness to cheat and lie to get them into their favoured seat of education .
all children should be given the opportunity to a decent education regardless of their background !
this includes children who might not be highly academic but have a willingness to work hard and achieve .
if we all supported our local school and got involved in making our children feel good about where and how they learn our education system would be a much better place !

when you 're in a queue to look around a secondary school where your child has almost no chance of getting a place , it does n't exactly feel like " school choice " .
it 's more like school rationing - or a sprint for the lifeboats rather than a relaxed , informed decision about the best possible education for your child .
in many parts of england , it 's almost time to send back the forms for next year 's secondary school places .
anyone with a child in the last year of primary school will know what i 'm talking about - because they wo n't have been talking about anything else for weeks .
you can see knots of these parents talking conspiratorially about the schools they 've visited - swapping details of prospectuses , head teachers ' presentations and catchment areas measured down to the last centimetre .
translation in the parental chats there 's a kind of sub-text .
" a really lively bunch of kids , but not quite right for my child , " is a sensitively liberal way of saying a sink school with a terrifying playground .
looking for hogwarts on the application form " lots of lovely music " is a politely conservative way of saying appalling gcse results , when you 're worried that the other person might already have a child there .
or there 's the patronising : " such a caring , unpushy environment " , which means woodwork - sorry , " resistant materials " - is the strongest subject .
it 's a good school ... for someone else 's children .
" if we do n't get a place in that school ... we 'll really have to think hard , " says the person who has already checked out the private school fees .
" we 're so lucky to be so accidentally near , " says the family which has expended money , arguments and tears in househunting in a quarter-mile radius .
or there 's the adeptly ambiguous : " the new head is really turning it around " , which means , most of the kids are starting to leave their guns at home these days .
three-legged race this is a decision which will have a huge significance for a child 's future .
but it can feel like some kind of unfunny version of the three-legged parents ' race at a school sports day .
your comments caring parents would rather be seen as pushy than dump their kids with lots of feral chavs .
jackie , tunbridge wells i am one of the bunch of feral chavs referred to in the previous e-mail ...
barry , liverpool read your comments every time you get near to thinking you 've found the right school , you 're tripped up .
right exam results , but wrong place .
right place , but wrong results .
if it 's so good that you want to send your child there , it 's going to be too oversubscribed to get a place .
it 's the catchment-22 .
open days , when hopeful parents are shepherded round schools , are a real eye-opener .
how can schools be so different in results when they are supposed to be serving the same local community ?
two non-selective schools , a few streets away from each other , have gcse results in which one school is literally twice as good as the other .
guess which one turns away nine out of 10 applicants ?
these tours , bringing pr to the 3rs , also show how different schools can look .
there are slickly modern places where the pupils keep their work on memory sticks rather than in bookbags - and places with house points and prefects in gowns .
there are banks of gleaming computers , music recording studios and school halls filled with latin and blazers .

this is ludicrous that we have to wait for places behind the families with siblings at the school already , especially as some of the children 's families have moved away and are no longer in the catchment area .
what happened to feeder school places ?
this is all so worrying and unnecessary pressure on the parent lisa , redhill , surrey with the lottery that is school places now , despite having gone to a comprehensive , i would not rely on sending my kids to a state school now .
in fact , in this country at the moment , there is a strong argument to say you have a moral obligation to ensure you have enough money for private education before siring a child .
even if that money is only there to be used if you ca n't get a grammar school place .
dave , london is n't this why we had tests for grammar schools all those years ago ?
then it was the kids who decided as it were rather than the parents .
phil thomas , wokingham some people are just too pushy for their children .
you have to remember that it is your kid and not you that has to spend seven years at the school five miles away .
school should be fun as well as an education , and turning into the most stressful time of a person 's life will do no good in the long run .
nick , london no choice here in rural pembrokeshire , you 've got one choice and that 's it .
it 's a comprehensive my twin daughters go to and as their abilities differ i 've watched the more academic one receive a completely different education to the less academic one .
but all you can do is stand up for your child 's rights and be firm and in my experience anything can be sorted .
my girls mix with all sorts and it 's done them no harm , if anything it 's made them aware how fortunate they are .
i do hate the idea that they go to the same school i did though , seems a failure on my part somehow .
liz , pembroke dock , wales this problem is endemic througout britain , not just england .
whilst the article mildly criticises the method used in placements ie catchment areas , there is always going to be some kind of selection process when you have demand exceeding supply .
sadly , there is no easy solution ; those areas where poverty is more rife will inevitably have schools that do not perform as well as those schools that are located in areas where poverty is less of an issue .
abolish povery and the problem wo n't exist .
easy , no ?
j gordon liddle , edinburgh , lothian what a hideous system we have produced !
where children 's expectation of a decent education appears to be on condition of their parent 's ability to move the right area , afford private education or tutoring to pass entrance exams or willingness to cheat and lie to get them into their favoured seat of education .
all children should be given the opportunity to a decent education regardless of their background !
this includes children who might not be highly academic but have a willingness to work hard and achieve .
if we all supported our local school and got involved in making our children feel good about where and how they learn our education system would be a much better place !

when you 're in a queue to look around a secondary school where your child has almost no chance of getting a place , it does n't exactly feel like " school choice " .
it 's more like school rationing - or a sprint for the lifeboats rather than a relaxed , informed decision about the best possible education for your child .
in many parts of england , it 's almost time to send back the forms for next year 's secondary school places .
anyone with a child in the last year of primary school will know what i 'm talking about - because they wo n't have been talking about anything else for weeks .
you can see knots of these parents talking conspiratorially about the schools they 've visited - swapping details of prospectuses , head teachers ' presentations and catchment areas measured down to the last centimetre .
translation in the parental chats there 's a kind of sub-text .
" a really lively bunch of kids , but not quite right for my child , " is a sensitively liberal way of saying a sink school with a terrifying playground .
looking for hogwarts on the application form " lots of lovely music " is a politely conservative way of saying appalling gcse results , when you 're worried that the other person might already have a child there .
or there 's the patronising : " such a caring , unpushy environment " , which means woodwork - sorry , " resistant materials " - is the strongest subject .
it 's a good school ... for someone else 's children .
" if we do n't get a place in that school ... we 'll really have to think hard , " says the person who has already checked out the private school fees .
" we 're so lucky to be so accidentally near , " says the family which has expended money , arguments and tears in househunting in a quarter-mile radius .
or there 's the adeptly ambiguous : " the new head is really turning it around " , which means , most of the kids are starting to leave their guns at home these days .
three-legged race this is a decision which will have a huge significance for a child 's future .
but it can feel like some kind of unfunny version of the three-legged parents ' race at a school sports day .
your comments caring parents would rather be seen as pushy than dump their kids with lots of feral chavs .
jackie , tunbridge wells i am one of the bunch of feral chavs referred to in the previous e-mail ...
barry , liverpool read your comments every time you get near to thinking you 've found the right school , you 're tripped up .
right exam results , but wrong place .
right place , but wrong results .
if it 's so good that you want to send your child there , it 's going to be too oversubscribed to get a place .
it 's the catchment-22 .
open days , when hopeful parents are shepherded round schools , are a real eye-opener .
how can schools be so different in results when they are supposed to be serving the same local community ?
two non-selective schools , a few streets away from each other , have gcse results in which one school is literally twice as good as the other .
guess which one turns away nine out of 10 applicants ?
these tours , bringing pr to the 3rs , also show how different schools can look .
there are slickly modern places where the pupils keep their work on memory sticks rather than in bookbags - and places with house points and prefects in gowns .
there are banks of gleaming computers , music recording studios and school halls filled with latin and blazers .
fair , unfair but for parents , the biggest difference is between those where you can get a place and those where you ca n't .
an important step in the school admissions process so people get strategic .
being able to buy a house near a successful school , deploying those music lesson skills , belonging to a religion , being in the right ability band , the luck of the draw in a lottery , are all advantages in the " fair admissions " sweepstake .
living near the school is the most common admissions factor , but there 's nothing inherently fair about that kind of localism , particularly when it 's based on how much house you can afford .
if a public employer favoured job applicants living nearest the workplace , there would be outrage .
or if a successful surgeon always gave priority to those living in nearby streets , it would n't seem right .
but who can blame parents for wanting to grab the best chances for their children ?
guilt trip it 's a guilt trip either way - with all kinds of social divisions lurking just below the surface .
there are schools which use a lottery to allocate places if you use your sharp elbows to get a good school for your child - making all those calculations about music scholarships and catchment areas - you 're accused of being pushy .
if you let your child drift into the nearest school despite its quagmire reputation , you 're nagged by self-doubt about letting them down .
and it raises some awkward unspoken questions .
what are parents really looking for ?
a school where the other children are like their own ?
or are they actively avoiding schools with the " wrong " kind of kids ?
what kind of judgements are being made about accents , ambitions , class and race ?
when parents are trying to help their children get a head start in life , whose heads are they going to trample over to get there ?
because , whichever hoops are jumped through , someone 's children are going to end up in the worst and the best schools .
here is a selection of your comments : i am at this moment in time filling in the forms for secondary transfer .
i live in wd3 which is supposed to be the catchment area for my local school , i do n't think i have a hope in hell 's chance of my son actually getting into that school as they like to cream the best students on academic ability .
i still have no hope of him getting a place as we just do n't live near enough to the local school school gate .
measured in metres after the academic students have been allocated .
another anxious parent who is not sleeping well at night ! ! !
adele deanus , hertfordshire i live around the corner from the best secondary school in the area , one of the best schools in the country .
did n't move there because of the school , but because of the house and the area .
i get leaflets pushed through my door from people wanting to rent out my address in order to get their children into the school .
some kids are coming miles by train and bus to go there - it 's ridiculous that schools can be so very different in results that people have to do this for their kids .
hannah , potters bar , herts mine are currently in years 8 and 10 so i 've worn this t-shirt twice .
try to be open minded but have a back up plan .
ours unfortunately was remortgage plus loan to a private school , after 2 years of bullying .
home schooling was plan 3 if we could n't raise the money .
the comps are n't full of feral kids , but it only takes one disengaged individual to make a lot of children 's lives miserable and make the lessons so disruptive they are pointless .
andrea i used to think that parents who went to a lot of trouble to get their children into high performing and generally white and middle-class schools were snobs or covert racists .
then i sent my daughter to an inner city comprehensive .
although i 'm happy with the standard of teaching at her school , she has to put up with terrible bullying as one of the few middle-class children in the school , and she gets frustrated at the high levels of disruption during lessons .
now i 'm desperate to move her to one of those snobby middle-class schools , but i ca n't .
we live outside the catchment area of all of the schools with a reasonable reputation and as atheists , we are n't eligible to go to any of the faith schools which have wider catchment areas .
heather , london we have the rather bizarre situation where a small number of parents have hired a lawyer to get the admissions policy for our local secondary school changed .
it is the distance you live from the next alternative school that matters and not how close you are to the school in question .
we now expect children who could walk to the secondary school to be allocated a school further away such that they will need some form of transport !
unfortunately money talks , even in state education !
dave , bookham , surrey we are in this position having a child in year 6 .
our problem is that the local school , which has a really good reputation is closing and will merge with another school , with not so good results when he will be in year 10 .
this is so frustrating for us and him .
at present a group of parents are taking the sheffield council to court over this decision , we shall have to see what happens ...
emma , sheffield the article makes no mention of that most unpleasant tactic - renting a property in the catchment area for a few months .
i 've even seen a family ' break up ' - mother and eldest child pretend to live in a rented flat , but get back together with father and the other children once a place has been secured .
of course , the younger children also go to the school under the sibling rule .
for every child who gains a place that way , and each of its siblings , a family which should have got a place , does n't .
bill , bristol i 'm in this dilemma .
my son is very bright , and with his agreement , he 's just started at the local comp .
they do n't get the best results in their exams , but the school and the teachers seem caring enough .
his grandparents on the other hand think he should go to a private school , or out-of-area grammar .
well , i went to a very good comp myself and hate this stigmatisation of comp schools .
i 'd like to think we can make his school a better place too by getting involved .
sarah , sandhurst what really has annoyed me in the search for a decent school is that i have looked at seven different schools and the one that our son would do best at and his first choice he may not get in on distance , yet a parent who has outwardly expressed that she does n't care about her childs education is guaranteed a place in the same school .
aagh !
adele , hounslow if you have to jump through hoops to get in , at least the school will be full of children whose parents care about education .
the grammar schools here , selecting on ability , have a wider social and ethnic mix than they would have done if the intake was purely local .
other local schools , both faith schools and other specialist ones , also do very well .
caring parents would rather be seen as pushy than dump their kids with lots of feral chavs .
jackie , tunbridge wells , kent i am one of the bunch of feral chavs referred to in a previous email .
i went to a local comp with a poor reputation .
this has not been a bar to my progressing in life .
unfortunately , for a lot of children the stigmatism of going to a comp means they either become over-achievers if they are intelligent or they accept that they are never going to succeed , fade away and remain with their " class " of people .
simply put , the current system leads to the ghettoisation of educational standards into those who can afford to buy a house near the right school and those who ca n't and therefore end up suffering with a downward spiral of a school which can not attract good teachers and gets worse results .
barry , liverpool the last thing i want for my kid is to turn him into a well-qualified angst-ridden mess who crumbles every time he 's confronted by someone from a less fortunate background .
a bit of ' feral chav exposure ' is n't always a bad thing ... in small doses .
on the other hand , and as a counter-point to mr liddle 's point , consider this : are they feral chavs because they 're poor , or poor because they 're feral chavs ?
bit of both , probably - but money alone just ai n't the answer .
joel , beaconsfield , bucks the strange thing is , i 'm having trouble booking time off work to attend all of these open days .
my employers can not figure out why i have to look at so many schools when the old system of - you go where 's closest - was ditched .
secondly , how is this any fairer ?
we still have to list a minimum of six schools , and it 's still pot luck which one you get !
stupid .
mike , london i am having exactly the same problem , i am not in any catchment area for a secondary school as i fall just outside and have no hope of getting in anywhere .
shame really when we live right across the road to one of the best state girl 's schools in the country but because of their selectiveness and high achievement we wo n't get in there either .
it is no longer visit the school and choose which one you want to go to but a strategic plan of which school you are more likely to secure a place at , even then some children from our area end up with no school at all and parent 's re-mortgage their houses in order to pay private fees .
what is this country coming to when all we hear from the govenment is education , education , education - but for who ?
nichola , hampstead garden suburbs , london i know a local lettings agent who regularly rents out a flat in a block next door to an excellent local school for a short term let .
the price ? £ 3000 a month for 6 months .
that 's still only the equivalent of one year 's fees at a private school , so well worth it for many parents .
john , richmond , surrey i think we need to get away from the idea that school admissions can ever be " fair " - what does that really mean ?
the biggest determinant of school performance is not the building , the teachers , or even the catchment area - it 's the pupils which attend , and that means high performing schools will be always be selective .
people have no issue with this is higher education -lrb- oxford and cambridge are very selective -rrb- so why all the liberal handwringing about selection in secondary education ?
matt munro , bristol we have just made the decision to go down the private school route .
we are white - but not middle class , and definitely not well off .
we can not afford to move to a house near the better senior schools and our local state school has is so appalling that we worked out it was cheaper to do the school fees - or rather , we could space out the payments - than to move house .
we would have to spend £ 500,000 or more on a house near good schools in our borough , and we simply can not afford that .
school fees for the next 10 years come in at way under that cost - so for us there has been no choice .
to get a good education for our child we 've been forced out of the state system - which is kind of backwards to how it should be !
flora , london looking for a secondary school should n't be a big issue but it is because of the large number of schools with such poor results .
or to put it bluntly the number of schools that produce pupils which are failures .
john , london personally , i think choice has got out of hand .
our daughter goes to secondary school next year and we 're now finding that our choice of primary feeder school leaves us in a low-priority criteria for the school we 're living in the catchment area for !
as far as i 'm concerned , i do n't want to " choose " the best school for my child - this is a ridiculous situation that results in " good and bad " schools .
every school should be equally funded , regardless of their results or success and every child should be able to attend a good quality secondary school close to their friends , their home and within their community .
angela , bucks i am one of those parents who are indeed desprately trying to just get their son or daughter into a good school near their home .
unfortunately this good school falls under the surrey county councils unfair policy sweepstake .
which means my child is 4th on the priority selection list because he is n't in foster care or has special needs and he does n't have a sibling at the school already , infact it 's just down to where he lives right now !
this is ludicrous that we have to wait for places behind the families with siblings at the school already , especially as some of the children 's families have moved away and are no longer in the catchment area .

did n't move there because of the school , but because of the house and the area .
i get leaflets pushed through my door from people wanting to rent out my address in order to get their children into the school .
some kids are coming miles by train and bus to go there - it 's ridiculous that schools can be so very different in results that people have to do this for their kids .
hannah , potters bar , herts mine are currently in years 8 and 10 so i 've worn this t-shirt twice .
try to be open minded but have a back up plan .
ours unfortunately was remortgage plus loan to a private school , after 2 years of bullying .
home schooling was plan 3 if we could n't raise the money .
the comps are n't full of feral kids , but it only takes one disengaged individual to make a lot of children 's lives miserable and make the lessons so disruptive they are pointless .
andrea i used to think that parents who went to a lot of trouble to get their children into high performing and generally white and middle-class schools were snobs or covert racists .
then i sent my daughter to an inner city comprehensive .
although i 'm happy with the standard of teaching at her school , she has to put up with terrible bullying as one of the few middle-class children in the school , and she gets frustrated at the high levels of disruption during lessons .
now i 'm desperate to move her to one of those snobby middle-class schools , but i ca n't .
we live outside the catchment area of all of the schools with a reasonable reputation and as atheists , we are n't eligible to go to any of the faith schools which have wider catchment areas .
heather , london we have the rather bizarre situation where a small number of parents have hired a lawyer to get the admissions policy for our local secondary school changed .
it is the distance you live from the next alternative school that matters and not how close you are to the school in question .
we now expect children who could walk to the secondary school to be allocated a school further away such that they will need some form of transport !
unfortunately money talks , even in state education !
dave , bookham , surrey we are in this position having a child in year 6 .
our problem is that the local school , which has a really good reputation is closing and will merge with another school , with not so good results when he will be in year 10 .
this is so frustrating for us and him .
at present a group of parents are taking the sheffield council to court over this decision , we shall have to see what happens ...
emma , sheffield the article makes no mention of that most unpleasant tactic - renting a property in the catchment area for a few months .
i 've even seen a family ' break up ' - mother and eldest child pretend to live in a rented flat , but get back together with father and the other children once a place has been secured .
of course , the younger children also go to the school under the sibling rule .
for every child who gains a place that way , and each of its siblings , a family which should have got a place , does n't .
bill , bristol i 'm in this dilemma .
my son is very bright , and with his agreement , he 's just started at the local comp .
they do n't get the best results in their exams , but the school and the teachers seem caring enough .
his grandparents on the other hand think he should go to a private school , or out-of-area grammar .
well , i went to a very good comp myself and hate this stigmatisation of comp schools .
i 'd like to think we can make his school a better place too by getting involved .
sarah , sandhurst what really has annoyed me in the search for a decent school is that i have looked at seven different schools and the one that our son would do best at and his first choice he may not get in on distance , yet a parent who has outwardly expressed that she does n't care about her childs education is guaranteed a place in the same school .
aagh !
adele , hounslow if you have to jump through hoops to get in , at least the school will be full of children whose parents care about education .
the grammar schools here , selecting on ability , have a wider social and ethnic mix than they would have done if the intake was purely local .
other local schools , both faith schools and other specialist ones , also do very well .
caring parents would rather be seen as pushy than dump their kids with lots of feral chavs .
jackie , tunbridge wells , kent i am one of the bunch of feral chavs referred to in a previous email .
i went to a local comp with a poor reputation .
this has not been a bar to my progressing in life .
unfortunately , for a lot of children the stigmatism of going to a comp means they either become over-achievers if they are intelligent or they accept that they are never going to succeed , fade away and remain with their " class " of people .
simply put , the current system leads to the ghettoisation of educational standards into those who can afford to buy a house near the right school and those who ca n't and therefore end up suffering with a downward spiral of a school which can not attract good teachers and gets worse results .
barry , liverpool the last thing i want for my kid is to turn him into a well-qualified angst-ridden mess who crumbles every time he 's confronted by someone from a less fortunate background .
a bit of ' feral chav exposure ' is n't always a bad thing ... in small doses .
on the other hand , and as a counter-point to mr liddle 's point , consider this : are they feral chavs because they 're poor , or poor because they 're feral chavs ?
bit of both , probably - but money alone just ai n't the answer .
joel , beaconsfield , bucks the strange thing is , i 'm having trouble booking time off work to attend all of these open days .
my employers can not figure out why i have to look at so many schools when the old system of - you go where 's closest - was ditched .
secondly , how is this any fairer ?
we still have to list a minimum of six schools , and it 's still pot luck which one you get !
stupid .
mike , london i am having exactly the same problem , i am not in any catchment area for a secondary school as i fall just outside and have no hope of getting in anywhere .
shame really when we live right across the road to one of the best state girl 's schools in the country but because of their selectiveness and high achievement we wo n't get in there either .
it is no longer visit the school and choose which one you want to go to but a strategic plan of which school you are more likely to secure a place at , even then some children from our area end up with no school at all and parent 's re-mortgage their houses in order to pay private fees .
what is this country coming to when all we hear from the govenment is education , education , education - but for who ?
nichola , hampstead garden suburbs , london i know a local lettings agent who regularly rents out a flat in a block next door to an excellent local school for a short term let .
the price ? £ 3000 a month for 6 months .
that 's still only the equivalent of one year 's fees at a private school , so well worth it for many parents .
john , richmond , surrey i think we need to get away from the idea that school admissions can ever be " fair " - what does that really mean ?
the biggest determinant of school performance is not the building , the teachers , or even the catchment area - it 's the pupils which attend , and that means high performing schools will be always be selective .
people have no issue with this is higher education -lrb- oxford and cambridge are very selective -rrb- so why all the liberal handwringing about selection in secondary education ?
matt munro , bristol we have just made the decision to go down the private school route .
we are white - but not middle class , and definitely not well off .
we can not afford to move to a house near the better senior schools and our local state school has is so appalling that we worked out it was cheaper to do the school fees - or rather , we could space out the payments - than to move house .
we would have to spend £ 500,000 or more on a house near good schools in our borough , and we simply can not afford that .
school fees for the next 10 years come in at way under that cost - so for us there has been no choice .
to get a good education for our child we 've been forced out of the state system - which is kind of backwards to how it should be !
flora , london looking for a secondary school should n't be a big issue but it is because of the large number of schools with such poor results .
or to put it bluntly the number of schools that produce pupils which are failures .
john , london personally , i think choice has got out of hand .
our daughter goes to secondary school next year and we 're now finding that our choice of primary feeder school leaves us in a low-priority criteria for the school we 're living in the catchment area for !
as far as i 'm concerned , i do n't want to " choose " the best school for my child - this is a ridiculous situation that results in " good and bad " schools .
every school should be equally funded , regardless of their results or success and every child should be able to attend a good quality secondary school close to their friends , their home and within their community .
angela , bucks i am one of those parents who are indeed desprately trying to just get their son or daughter into a good school near their home .
unfortunately this good school falls under the surrey county councils unfair policy sweepstake .
which means my child is 4th on the priority selection list because he is n't in foster care or has special needs and he does n't have a sibling at the school already , infact it 's just down to where he lives right now !
this is ludicrous that we have to wait for places behind the families with siblings at the school already , especially as some of the children 's families have moved away and are no longer in the catchment area .
what happened to feeder school places ?
this is all so worrying and unnecessary pressure on the parent lisa , redhill , surrey with the lottery that is school places now , despite having gone to a comprehensive , i would not rely on sending my kids to a state school now .
in fact , in this country at the moment , there is a strong argument to say you have a moral obligation to ensure you have enough money for private education before siring a child .
even if that money is only there to be used if you ca n't get a grammar school place .
dave , london is n't this why we had tests for grammar schools all those years ago ?
then it was the kids who decided as it were rather than the parents .
phil thomas , wokingham some people are just too pushy for their children .
you have to remember that it is your kid and not you that has to spend seven years at the school five miles away .
school should be fun as well as an education , and turning into the most stressful time of a person 's life will do no good in the long run .
nick , london no choice here in rural pembrokeshire , you 've got one choice and that 's it .
it 's a comprehensive my twin daughters go to and as their abilities differ i 've watched the more academic one receive a completely different education to the less academic one .
but all you can do is stand up for your child 's rights and be firm and in my experience anything can be sorted .
my girls mix with all sorts and it 's done them no harm , if anything it 's made them aware how fortunate they are .
i do hate the idea that they go to the same school i did though , seems a failure on my part somehow .
liz , pembroke dock , wales this problem is endemic througout britain , not just england .
whilst the article mildly criticises the method used in placements ie catchment areas , there is always going to be some kind of selection process when you have demand exceeding supply .
sadly , there is no easy solution ; those areas where poverty is more rife will inevitably have schools that do not perform as well as those schools that are located in areas where poverty is less of an issue .
abolish povery and the problem wo n't exist .
easy , no ?
j gordon liddle , edinburgh , lothian what a hideous system we have produced !
where children 's expectation of a decent education appears to be on condition of their parent 's ability to move the right area , afford private education or tutoring to pass entrance exams or willingness to cheat and lie to get them into their favoured seat of education .
all children should be given the opportunity to a decent education regardless of their background !
this includes children who might not be highly academic but have a willingness to work hard and achieve .
if we all supported our local school and got involved in making our children feel good about where and how they learn our education system would be a much better place !

when you 're in a queue to look around a secondary school where your child has almost no chance of getting a place , it does n't exactly feel like " school choice " .
it 's more like school rationing - or a sprint for the lifeboats rather than a relaxed , informed decision about the best possible education for your child .
in many parts of england , it 's almost time to send back the forms for next year 's secondary school places .
anyone with a child in the last year of primary school will know what i 'm talking about - because they wo n't have been talking about anything else for weeks .
you can see knots of these parents talking conspiratorially about the schools they 've visited - swapping details of prospectuses , head teachers ' presentations and catchment areas measured down to the last centimetre .
translation in the parental chats there 's a kind of sub-text .
" a really lively bunch of kids , but not quite right for my child , " is a sensitively liberal way of saying a sink school with a terrifying playground .
looking for hogwarts on the application form " lots of lovely music " is a politely conservative way of saying appalling gcse results , when you 're worried that the other person might already have a child there .
or there 's the patronising : " such a caring , unpushy environment " , which means woodwork - sorry , " resistant materials " - is the strongest subject .
it 's a good school ... for someone else 's children .
" if we do n't get a place in that school ... we 'll really have to think hard , " says the person who has already checked out the private school fees .
" we 're so lucky to be so accidentally near , " says the family which has expended money , arguments and tears in househunting in a quarter-mile radius .
or there 's the adeptly ambiguous : " the new head is really turning it around " , which means , most of the kids are starting to leave their guns at home these days .
three-legged race this is a decision which will have a huge significance for a child 's future .
but it can feel like some kind of unfunny version of the three-legged parents ' race at a school sports day .
your comments caring parents would rather be seen as pushy than dump their kids with lots of feral chavs .
jackie , tunbridge wells i am one of the bunch of feral chavs referred to in the previous e-mail ...
barry , liverpool read your comments every time you get near to thinking you 've found the right school , you 're tripped up .
right exam results , but wrong place .
right place , but wrong results .
if it 's so good that you want to send your child there , it 's going to be too oversubscribed to get a place .
it 's the catchment-22 .
open days , when hopeful parents are shepherded round schools , are a real eye-opener .
how can schools be so different in results when they are supposed to be serving the same local community ?
two non-selective schools , a few streets away from each other , have gcse results in which one school is literally twice as good as the other .
guess which one turns away nine out of 10 applicants ?
these tours , bringing pr to the 3rs , also show how different schools can look .
there are slickly modern places where the pupils keep their work on memory sticks rather than in bookbags - and places with house points and prefects in gowns .
there are banks of gleaming computers , music recording studios and school halls filled with latin and blazers .
fair , unfair but for parents , the biggest difference is between those where you can get a place and those where you ca n't .
an important step in the school admissions process so people get strategic .
being able to buy a house near a successful school , deploying those music lesson skills , belonging to a religion , being in the right ability band , the luck of the draw in a lottery , are all advantages in the " fair admissions " sweepstake .
living near the school is the most common admissions factor , but there 's nothing inherently fair about that kind of localism , particularly when it 's based on how much house you can afford .
if a public employer favoured job applicants living nearest the workplace , there would be outrage .
or if a successful surgeon always gave priority to those living in nearby streets , it would n't seem right .
but who can blame parents for wanting to grab the best chances for their children ?
guilt trip it 's a guilt trip either way - with all kinds of social divisions lurking just below the surface .
there are schools which use a lottery to allocate places if you use your sharp elbows to get a good school for your child - making all those calculations about music scholarships and catchment areas - you 're accused of being pushy .
if you let your child drift into the nearest school despite its quagmire reputation , you 're nagged by self-doubt about letting them down .
and it raises some awkward unspoken questions .
what are parents really looking for ?
a school where the other children are like their own ?
or are they actively avoiding schools with the " wrong " kind of kids ?
what kind of judgements are being made about accents , ambitions , class and race ?
when parents are trying to help their children get a head start in life , whose heads are they going to trample over to get there ?
because , whichever hoops are jumped through , someone 's children are going to end up in the worst and the best schools .
here is a selection of your comments : i am at this moment in time filling in the forms for secondary transfer .
i live in wd3 which is supposed to be the catchment area for my local school , i do n't think i have a hope in hell 's chance of my son actually getting into that school as they like to cream the best students on academic ability .
i still have no hope of him getting a place as we just do n't live near enough to the local school school gate .
measured in metres after the academic students have been allocated .

this includes children who might not be highly academic but have a willingness to work hard and achieve .
if we all supported our local school and got involved in making our children feel good about where and how they learn our education system would be a much better place !

when you 're in a queue to look around a secondary school where your child has almost no chance of getting a place , it does n't exactly feel like " school choice " .
it 's more like school rationing - or a sprint for the lifeboats rather than a relaxed , informed decision about the best possible education for your child .
in many parts of england , it 's almost time to send back the forms for next year 's secondary school places .
anyone with a child in the last year of primary school will know what i 'm talking about - because they wo n't have been talking about anything else for weeks .
you can see knots of these parents talking conspiratorially about the schools they 've visited - swapping details of prospectuses , head teachers ' presentations and catchment areas measured down to the last centimetre .
translation in the parental chats there 's a kind of sub-text .
" a really lively bunch of kids , but not quite right for my child , " is a sensitively liberal way of saying a sink school with a terrifying playground .

three-legged race this is a decision which will have a huge significance for a child 's future .
but it can feel like some kind of unfunny version of the three-legged parents ' race at a school sports day .
your comments caring parents would rather be seen as pushy than dump their kids with lots of feral chavs .
jackie , tunbridge wells i am one of the bunch of feral chavs referred to in the previous e-mail ...
barry , liverpool read your comments every time you get near to thinking you 've found the right school , you 're tripped up .
right exam results , but wrong place .
right place , but wrong results .
if it 's so good that you want to send your child there , it 's going to be too oversubscribed to get a place .
it 's the catchment-22 .
open days , when hopeful parents are shepherded round schools , are a real eye-opener .
how can schools be so different in results when they are supposed to be serving the same local community ?
two non-selective schools , a few streets away from each other , have gcse results in which one school is literally twice as good as the other .
guess which one turns away nine out of 10 applicants ?
these tours , bringing pr to the 3rs , also show how different schools can look .
there are slickly modern places where the pupils keep their work on memory sticks rather than in bookbags - and places with house points and prefects in gowns .
there are banks of gleaming computers , music recording studios and school halls filled with latin and blazers .
fair , unfair but for parents , the biggest difference is between those where you can get a place and those where you ca n't .
an important step in the school admissions process so people get strategic .
being able to buy a house near a successful school , deploying those music lesson skills , belonging to a religion , being in the right ability band , the luck of the draw in a lottery , are all advantages in the " fair admissions " sweepstake .
living near the school is the most common admissions factor , but there 's nothing inherently fair about that kind of localism , particularly when it 's based on how much house you can afford .
if a public employer favoured job applicants living nearest the workplace , there would be outrage .
or if a successful surgeon always gave priority to those living in nearby streets , it would n't seem right .
but who can blame parents for wanting to grab the best chances for their children ?
guilt trip it 's a guilt trip either way - with all kinds of social divisions lurking just below the surface .
there are schools which use a lottery to allocate places if you use your sharp elbows to get a good school for your child - making all those calculations about music scholarships and catchment areas - you 're accused of being pushy .
if you let your child drift into the nearest school despite its quagmire reputation , you 're nagged by self-doubt about letting them down .
and it raises some awkward unspoken questions .
what are parents really looking for ?
a school where the other children are like their own ?
or are they actively avoiding schools with the " wrong " kind of kids ?
what kind of judgements are being made about accents , ambitions , class and race ?
when parents are trying to help their children get a head start in life , whose heads are they going to trample over to get there ?
because , whichever hoops are jumped through , someone 's children are going to end up in the worst and the best schools .
here is a selection of your comments : i am at this moment in time filling in the forms for secondary transfer .
i live in wd3 which is supposed to be the catchment area for my local school , i do n't think i have a hope in hell 's chance of my son actually getting into that school as they like to cream the best students on academic ability .
i still have no hope of him getting a place as we just do n't live near enough to the local school school gate .
measured in metres after the academic students have been allocated .
another anxious parent who is not sleeping well at night ! ! !
adele deanus , hertfordshire i live around the corner from the best secondary school in the area , one of the best schools in the country .
did n't move there because of the school , but because of the house and the area .
i get leaflets pushed through my door from people wanting to rent out my address in order to get their children into the school .
some kids are coming miles by train and bus to go there - it 's ridiculous that schools can be so very different in results that people have to do this for their kids .
hannah , potters bar , herts mine are currently in years 8 and 10 so i 've worn this t-shirt twice .
try to be open minded but have a back up plan .
ours unfortunately was remortgage plus loan to a private school , after 2 years of bullying .
home schooling was plan 3 if we could n't raise the money .
the comps are n't full of feral kids , but it only takes one disengaged individual to make a lot of children 's lives miserable and make the lessons so disruptive they are pointless .
andrea i used to think that parents who went to a lot of trouble to get their children into high performing and generally white and middle-class schools were snobs or covert racists .
then i sent my daughter to an inner city comprehensive .
although i 'm happy with the standard of teaching at her school , she has to put up with terrible bullying as one of the few middle-class children in the school , and she gets frustrated at the high levels of disruption during lessons .
now i 'm desperate to move her to one of those snobby middle-class schools , but i ca n't .
we live outside the catchment area of all of the schools with a reasonable reputation and as atheists , we are n't eligible to go to any of the faith schools which have wider catchment areas .
heather , london we have the rather bizarre situation where a small number of parents have hired a lawyer to get the admissions policy for our local secondary school changed .
it is the distance you live from the next alternative school that matters and not how close you are to the school in question .
we now expect children who could walk to the secondary school to be allocated a school further away such that they will need some form of transport !
unfortunately money talks , even in state education !
dave , bookham , surrey we are in this position having a child in year 6 .
our problem is that the local school , which has a really good reputation is closing and will merge with another school , with not so good results when he will be in year 10 .
this is so frustrating for us and him .
at present a group of parents are taking the sheffield council to court over this decision , we shall have to see what happens ...
emma , sheffield the article makes no mention of that most unpleasant tactic - renting a property in the catchment area for a few months .
i 've even seen a family ' break up ' - mother and eldest child pretend to live in a rented flat , but get back together with father and the other children once a place has been secured .
of course , the younger children also go to the school under the sibling rule .
for every child who gains a place that way , and each of its siblings , a family which should have got a place , does n't .
bill , bristol i 'm in this dilemma .
my son is very bright , and with his agreement , he 's just started at the local comp .
they do n't get the best results in their exams , but the school and the teachers seem caring enough .
his grandparents on the other hand think he should go to a private school , or out-of-area grammar .
well , i went to a very good comp myself and hate this stigmatisation of comp schools .
i 'd like to think we can make his school a better place too by getting involved .
sarah , sandhurst what really has annoyed me in the search for a decent school is that i have looked at seven different schools and the one that our son would do best at and his first choice he may not get in on distance , yet a parent who has outwardly expressed that she does n't care about her childs education is guaranteed a place in the same school .
aagh !
adele , hounslow if you have to jump through hoops to get in , at least the school will be full of children whose parents care about education .
the grammar schools here , selecting on ability , have a wider social and ethnic mix than they would have done if the intake was purely local .
other local schools , both faith schools and other specialist ones , also do very well .
caring parents would rather be seen as pushy than dump their kids with lots of feral chavs .
jackie , tunbridge wells , kent i am one of the bunch of feral chavs referred to in a previous email .
i went to a local comp with a poor reputation .
this has not been a bar to my progressing in life .
unfortunately , for a lot of children the stigmatism of going to a comp means they either become over-achievers if they are intelligent or they accept that they are never going to succeed , fade away and remain with their " class " of people .
simply put , the current system leads to the ghettoisation of educational standards into those who can afford to buy a house near the right school and those who ca n't and therefore end up suffering with a downward spiral of a school which can not attract good teachers and gets worse results .
barry , liverpool the last thing i want for my kid is to turn him into a well-qualified angst-ridden mess who crumbles every time he 's confronted by someone from a less fortunate background .
a bit of ' feral chav exposure ' is n't always a bad thing ... in small doses .
on the other hand , and as a counter-point to mr liddle 's point , consider this : are they feral chavs because they 're poor , or poor because they 're feral chavs ?
bit of both , probably - but money alone just ai n't the answer .
joel , beaconsfield , bucks the strange thing is , i 'm having trouble booking time off work to attend all of these open days .
my employers can not figure out why i have to look at so many schools when the old system of - you go where 's closest - was ditched .
secondly , how is this any fairer ?
we still have to list a minimum of six schools , and it 's still pot luck which one you get !
stupid .
mike , london i am having exactly the same problem , i am not in any catchment area for a secondary school as i fall just outside and have no hope of getting in anywhere .
shame really when we live right across the road to one of the best state girl 's schools in the country but because of their selectiveness and high achievement we wo n't get in there either .
it is no longer visit the school and choose which one you want to go to but a strategic plan of which school you are more likely to secure a place at , even then some children from our area end up with no school at all and parent 's re-mortgage their houses in order to pay private fees .
what is this country coming to when all we hear from the govenment is education , education , education - but for who ?
nichola , hampstead garden suburbs , london i know a local lettings agent who regularly rents out a flat in a block next door to an excellent local school for a short term let .
the price ? £ 3000 a month for 6 months .
that 's still only the equivalent of one year 's fees at a private school , so well worth it for many parents .
john , richmond , surrey i think we need to get away from the idea that school admissions can ever be " fair " - what does that really mean ?
the biggest determinant of school performance is not the building , the teachers , or even the catchment area - it 's the pupils which attend , and that means high performing schools will be always be selective .
people have no issue with this is higher education -lrb- oxford and cambridge are very selective -rrb- so why all the liberal handwringing about selection in secondary education ?
matt munro , bristol we have just made the decision to go down the private school route .
we are white - but not middle class , and definitely not well off .
we can not afford to move to a house near the better senior schools and our local state school has is so appalling that we worked out it was cheaper to do the school fees - or rather , we could space out the payments - than to move house .
we would have to spend £ 500,000 or more on a house near good schools in our borough , and we simply can not afford that .
school fees for the next 10 years come in at way under that cost - so for us there has been no choice .
to get a good education for our child we 've been forced out of the state system - which is kind of backwards to how it should be !
flora , london looking for a secondary school should n't be a big issue but it is because of the large number of schools with such poor results .
or to put it bluntly the number of schools that produce pupils which are failures .
john , london personally , i think choice has got out of hand .
our daughter goes to secondary school next year and we 're now finding that our choice of primary feeder school leaves us in a low-priority criteria for the school we 're living in the catchment area for !
as far as i 'm concerned , i do n't want to " choose " the best school for my child - this is a ridiculous situation that results in " good and bad " schools .
every school should be equally funded , regardless of their results or success and every child should be able to attend a good quality secondary school close to their friends , their home and within their community .
angela , bucks i am one of those parents who are indeed desprately trying to just get their son or daughter into a good school near their home .
unfortunately this good school falls under the surrey county councils unfair policy sweepstake .
which means my child is 4th on the priority selection list because he is n't in foster care or has special needs and he does n't have a sibling at the school already , infact it 's just down to where he lives right now !
this is ludicrous that we have to wait for places behind the families with siblings at the school already , especially as some of the children 's families have moved away and are no longer in the catchment area .
what happened to feeder school places ?
this is all so worrying and unnecessary pressure on the parent lisa , redhill , surrey with the lottery that is school places now , despite having gone to a comprehensive , i would not rely on sending my kids to a state school now .
in fact , in this country at the moment , there is a strong argument to say you have a moral obligation to ensure you have enough money for private education before siring a child .
even if that money is only there to be used if you ca n't get a grammar school place .
dave , london is n't this why we had tests for grammar schools all those years ago ?
then it was the kids who decided as it were rather than the parents .
phil thomas , wokingham some people are just too pushy for their children .
you have to remember that it is your kid and not you that has to spend seven years at the school five miles away .
school should be fun as well as an education , and turning into the most stressful time of a person 's life will do no good in the long run .
nick , london no choice here in rural pembrokeshire , you 've got one choice and that 's it .
it 's a comprehensive my twin daughters go to and as their abilities differ i 've watched the more academic one receive a completely different education to the less academic one .
but all you can do is stand up for your child 's rights and be firm and in my experience anything can be sorted .
my girls mix with all sorts and it 's done them no harm , if anything it 's made them aware how fortunate they are .
i do hate the idea that they go to the same school i did though , seems a failure on my part somehow .
liz , pembroke dock , wales this problem is endemic througout britain , not just england .
whilst the article mildly criticises the method used in placements ie catchment areas , there is always going to be some kind of selection process when you have demand exceeding supply .
sadly , there is no easy solution ; those areas where poverty is more rife will inevitably have schools that do not perform as well as those schools that are located in areas where poverty is less of an issue .
abolish povery and the problem wo n't exist .
easy , no ?
j gordon liddle , edinburgh , lothian what a hideous system we have produced !
where children 's expectation of a decent education appears to be on condition of their parent 's ability to move the right area , afford private education or tutoring to pass entrance exams or willingness to cheat and lie to get them into their favoured seat of education .
all children should be given the opportunity to a decent education regardless of their background !
this includes children who might not be highly academic but have a willingness to work hard and achieve .
if we all supported our local school and got involved in making our children feel good about where and how they learn our education system would be a much better place !

of course , the younger children also go to the school under the sibling rule .
for every child who gains a place that way , and each of its siblings , a family which should have got a place , does n't .
bill , bristol i 'm in this dilemma .
my son is very bright , and with his agreement , he 's just started at the local comp .
they do n't get the best results in their exams , but the school and the teachers seem caring enough .
his grandparents on the other hand think he should go to a private school , or out-of-area grammar .
well , i went to a very good comp myself and hate this stigmatisation of comp schools .
i 'd like to think we can make his school a better place too by getting involved .
sarah , sandhurst what really has annoyed me in the search for a decent school is that i have looked at seven different schools and the one that our son would do best at and his first choice he may not get in on distance , yet a parent who has outwardly expressed that she does n't care about her childs education is guaranteed a place in the same school .
aagh !
adele , hounslow if you have to jump through hoops to get in , at least the school will be full of children whose parents care about education .
the grammar schools here , selecting on ability , have a wider social and ethnic mix than they would have done if the intake was purely local .
other local schools , both faith schools and other specialist ones , also do very well .
caring parents would rather be seen as pushy than dump their kids with lots of feral chavs .
jackie , tunbridge wells , kent i am one of the bunch of feral chavs referred to in a previous email .
i went to a local comp with a poor reputation .
this has not been a bar to my progressing in life .
unfortunately , for a lot of children the stigmatism of going to a comp means they either become over-achievers if they are intelligent or they accept that they are never going to succeed , fade away and remain with their " class " of people .
simply put , the current system leads to the ghettoisation of educational standards into those who can afford to buy a house near the right school and those who ca n't and therefore end up suffering with a downward spiral of a school which can not attract good teachers and gets worse results .
barry , liverpool the last thing i want for my kid is to turn him into a well-qualified angst-ridden mess who crumbles every time he 's confronted by someone from a less fortunate background .
a bit of ' feral chav exposure ' is n't always a bad thing ... in small doses .
on the other hand , and as a counter-point to mr liddle 's point , consider this : are they feral chavs because they 're poor , or poor because they 're feral chavs ?
bit of both , probably - but money alone just ai n't the answer .
joel , beaconsfield , bucks the strange thing is , i 'm having trouble booking time off work to attend all of these open days .
my employers can not figure out why i have to look at so many schools when the old system of - you go where 's closest - was ditched .
secondly , how is this any fairer ?
we still have to list a minimum of six schools , and it 's still pot luck which one you get !
stupid .
mike , london i am having exactly the same problem , i am not in any catchment area for a secondary school as i fall just outside and have no hope of getting in anywhere .
shame really when we live right across the road to one of the best state girl 's schools in the country but because of their selectiveness and high achievement we wo n't get in there either .
it is no longer visit the school and choose which one you want to go to but a strategic plan of which school you are more likely to secure a place at , even then some children from our area end up with no school at all and parent 's re-mortgage their houses in order to pay private fees .
what is this country coming to when all we hear from the govenment is education , education , education - but for who ?
nichola , hampstead garden suburbs , london i know a local lettings agent who regularly rents out a flat in a block next door to an excellent local school for a short term let .
the price ? £ 3000 a month for 6 months .
that 's still only the equivalent of one year 's fees at a private school , so well worth it for many parents .
john , richmond , surrey i think we need to get away from the idea that school admissions can ever be " fair " - what does that really mean ?
the biggest determinant of school performance is not the building , the teachers , or even the catchment area - it 's the pupils which attend , and that means high performing schools will be always be selective .
people have no issue with this is higher education -lrb- oxford and cambridge are very selective -rrb- so why all the liberal handwringing about selection in secondary education ?
matt munro , bristol we have just made the decision to go down the private school route .
we are white - but not middle class , and definitely not well off .
we can not afford to move to a house near the better senior schools and our local state school has is so appalling that we worked out it was cheaper to do the school fees - or rather , we could space out the payments - than to move house .
we would have to spend £ 500,000 or more on a house near good schools in our borough , and we simply can not afford that .
school fees for the next 10 years come in at way under that cost - so for us there has been no choice .
to get a good education for our child we 've been forced out of the state system - which is kind of backwards to how it should be !
flora , london looking for a secondary school should n't be a big issue but it is because of the large number of schools with such poor results .
or to put it bluntly the number of schools that produce pupils which are failures .
john , london personally , i think choice has got out of hand .
our daughter goes to secondary school next year and we 're now finding that our choice of primary feeder school leaves us in a low-priority criteria for the school we 're living in the catchment area for !
as far as i 'm concerned , i do n't want to " choose " the best school for my child - this is a ridiculous situation that results in " good and bad " schools .
every school should be equally funded , regardless of their results or success and every child should be able to attend a good quality secondary school close to their friends , their home and within their community .
angela , bucks i am one of those parents who are indeed desprately trying to just get their son or daughter into a good school near their home .
unfortunately this good school falls under the surrey county councils unfair policy sweepstake .
which means my child is 4th on the priority selection list because he is n't in foster care or has special needs and he does n't have a sibling at the school already , infact it 's just down to where he lives right now !
this is ludicrous that we have to wait for places behind the families with siblings at the school already , especially as some of the children 's families have moved away and are no longer in the catchment area .
what happened to feeder school places ?
this is all so worrying and unnecessary pressure on the parent lisa , redhill , surrey with the lottery that is school places now , despite having gone to a comprehensive , i would not rely on sending my kids to a state school now .
in fact , in this country at the moment , there is a strong argument to say you have a moral obligation to ensure you have enough money for private education before siring a child .
even if that money is only there to be used if you ca n't get a grammar school place .
dave , london is n't this why we had tests for grammar schools all those years ago ?
then it was the kids who decided as it were rather than the parents .
phil thomas , wokingham some people are just too pushy for their children .
you have to remember that it is your kid and not you that has to spend seven years at the school five miles away .
school should be fun as well as an education , and turning into the most stressful time of a person 's life will do no good in the long run .
nick , london no choice here in rural pembrokeshire , you 've got one choice and that 's it .
it 's a comprehensive my twin daughters go to and as their abilities differ i 've watched the more academic one receive a completely different education to the less academic one .
but all you can do is stand up for your child 's rights and be firm and in my experience anything can be sorted .
my girls mix with all sorts and it 's done them no harm , if anything it 's made them aware how fortunate they are .
i do hate the idea that they go to the same school i did though , seems a failure on my part somehow .
liz , pembroke dock , wales this problem is endemic througout britain , not just england .
whilst the article mildly criticises the method used in placements ie catchment areas , there is always going to be some kind of selection process when you have demand exceeding supply .
sadly , there is no easy solution ; those areas where poverty is more rife will inevitably have schools that do not perform as well as those schools that are located in areas where poverty is less of an issue .
abolish povery and the problem wo n't exist .
easy , no ?
j gordon liddle , edinburgh , lothian what a hideous system we have produced !
where children 's expectation of a decent education appears to be on condition of their parent 's ability to move the right area , afford private education or tutoring to pass entrance exams or willingness to cheat and lie to get them into their favoured seat of education .
all children should be given the opportunity to a decent education regardless of their background !
this includes children who might not be highly academic but have a willingness to work hard and achieve .
if we all supported our local school and got involved in making our children feel good about where and how they learn our education system would be a much better place !

when you 're in a queue to look around a secondary school where your child has almost no chance of getting a place , it does n't exactly feel like " school choice " .
it 's more like school rationing - or a sprint for the lifeboats rather than a relaxed , informed decision about the best possible education for your child .
in many parts of england , it 's almost time to send back the forms for next year 's secondary school places .
anyone with a child in the last year of primary school will know what i 'm talking about - because they wo n't have been talking about anything else for weeks .
you can see knots of these parents talking conspiratorially about the schools they 've visited - swapping details of prospectuses , head teachers ' presentations and catchment areas measured down to the last centimetre .
translation in the parental chats there 's a kind of sub-text .
" a really lively bunch of kids , but not quite right for my child , " is a sensitively liberal way of saying a sink school with a terrifying playground .
looking for hogwarts on the application form " lots of lovely music " is a politely conservative way of saying appalling gcse results , when you 're worried that the other person might already have a child there .
or there 's the patronising : " such a caring , unpushy environment " , which means woodwork - sorry , " resistant materials " - is the strongest subject .
it 's a good school ... for someone else 's children .
" if we do n't get a place in that school ... we 'll really have to think hard , " says the person who has already checked out the private school fees .
" we 're so lucky to be so accidentally near , " says the family which has expended money , arguments and tears in househunting in a quarter-mile radius .
or there 's the adeptly ambiguous : " the new head is really turning it around " , which means , most of the kids are starting to leave their guns at home these days .
three-legged race this is a decision which will have a huge significance for a child 's future .
but it can feel like some kind of unfunny version of the three-legged parents ' race at a school sports day .
your comments caring parents would rather be seen as pushy than dump their kids with lots of feral chavs .
jackie , tunbridge wells i am one of the bunch of feral chavs referred to in the previous e-mail ...
barry , liverpool read your comments every time you get near to thinking you 've found the right school , you 're tripped up .
right exam results , but wrong place .
right place , but wrong results .
if it 's so good that you want to send your child there , it 's going to be too oversubscribed to get a place .
it 's the catchment-22 .
open days , when hopeful parents are shepherded round schools , are a real eye-opener .
how can schools be so different in results when they are supposed to be serving the same local community ?
two non-selective schools , a few streets away from each other , have gcse results in which one school is literally twice as good as the other .
guess which one turns away nine out of 10 applicants ?
these tours , bringing pr to the 3rs , also show how different schools can look .
there are slickly modern places where the pupils keep their work on memory sticks rather than in bookbags - and places with house points and prefects in gowns .
there are banks of gleaming computers , music recording studios and school halls filled with latin and blazers .
fair , unfair but for parents , the biggest difference is between those where you can get a place and those where you ca n't .
an important step in the school admissions process so people get strategic .
being able to buy a house near a successful school , deploying those music lesson skills , belonging to a religion , being in the right ability band , the luck of the draw in a lottery , are all advantages in the " fair admissions " sweepstake .
living near the school is the most common admissions factor , but there 's nothing inherently fair about that kind of localism , particularly when it 's based on how much house you can afford .
if a public employer favoured job applicants living nearest the workplace , there would be outrage .
or if a successful surgeon always gave priority to those living in nearby streets , it would n't seem right .
but who can blame parents for wanting to grab the best chances for their children ?
guilt trip it 's a guilt trip either way - with all kinds of social divisions lurking just below the surface .
there are schools which use a lottery to allocate places if you use your sharp elbows to get a good school for your child - making all those calculations about music scholarships and catchment areas - you 're accused of being pushy .
if you let your child drift into the nearest school despite its quagmire reputation , you 're nagged by self-doubt about letting them down .
and it raises some awkward unspoken questions .
what are parents really looking for ?
a school where the other children are like their own ?
or are they actively avoiding schools with the " wrong " kind of kids ?
what kind of judgements are being made about accents , ambitions , class and race ?
when parents are trying to help their children get a head start in life , whose heads are they going to trample over to get there ?
because , whichever hoops are jumped through , someone 's children are going to end up in the worst and the best schools .
here is a selection of your comments : i am at this moment in time filling in the forms for secondary transfer .
i live in wd3 which is supposed to be the catchment area for my local school , i do n't think i have a hope in hell 's chance of my son actually getting into that school as they like to cream the best students on academic ability .
i still have no hope of him getting a place as we just do n't live near enough to the local school school gate .
measured in metres after the academic students have been allocated .
another anxious parent who is not sleeping well at night ! ! !
adele deanus , hertfordshire i live around the corner from the best secondary school in the area , one of the best schools in the country .
did n't move there because of the school , but because of the house and the area .
i get leaflets pushed through my door from people wanting to rent out my address in order to get their children into the school .
some kids are coming miles by train and bus to go there - it 's ridiculous that schools can be so very different in results that people have to do this for their kids .
hannah , potters bar , herts mine are currently in years 8 and 10 so i 've worn this t-shirt twice .
try to be open minded but have a back up plan .
ours unfortunately was remortgage plus loan to a private school , after 2 years of bullying .
home schooling was plan 3 if we could n't raise the money .
the comps are n't full of feral kids , but it only takes one disengaged individual to make a lot of children 's lives miserable and make the lessons so disruptive they are pointless .
andrea i used to think that parents who went to a lot of trouble to get their children into high performing and generally white and middle-class schools were snobs or covert racists .
then i sent my daughter to an inner city comprehensive .
although i 'm happy with the standard of teaching at her school , she has to put up with terrible bullying as one of the few middle-class children in the school , and she gets frustrated at the high levels of disruption during lessons .
now i 'm desperate to move her to one of those snobby middle-class schools , but i ca n't .
we live outside the catchment area of all of the schools with a reasonable reputation and as atheists , we are n't eligible to go to any of the faith schools which have wider catchment areas .
heather , london we have the rather bizarre situation where a small number of parents have hired a lawyer to get the admissions policy for our local secondary school changed .
it is the distance you live from the next alternative school that matters and not how close you are to the school in question .
we now expect children who could walk to the secondary school to be allocated a school further away such that they will need some form of transport !
unfortunately money talks , even in state education !
dave , bookham , surrey we are in this position having a child in year 6 .
our problem is that the local school , which has a really good reputation is closing and will merge with another school , with not so good results when he will be in year 10 .
this is so frustrating for us and him .
at present a group of parents are taking the sheffield council to court over this decision , we shall have to see what happens ...
emma , sheffield the article makes no mention of that most unpleasant tactic - renting a property in the catchment area for a few months .
i 've even seen a family ' break up ' - mother and eldest child pretend to live in a rented flat , but get back together with father and the other children once a place has been secured .

when you 're in a queue to look around a secondary school where your child has almost no chance of getting a place , it does n't exactly feel like " school choice " .
it 's more like school rationing - or a sprint for the lifeboats rather than a relaxed , informed decision about the best possible education for your child .
in many parts of england , it 's almost time to send back the forms for next year 's secondary school places .
anyone with a child in the last year of primary school will know what i 'm talking about - because they wo n't have been talking about anything else for weeks .
you can see knots of these parents talking conspiratorially about the schools they 've visited - swapping details of prospectuses , head teachers ' presentations and catchment areas measured down to the last centimetre .
translation in the parental chats there 's a kind of sub-text .
" a really lively bunch of kids , but not quite right for my child , " is a sensitively liberal way of saying a sink school with a terrifying playground .
looking for hogwarts on the application form " lots of lovely music " is a politely conservative way of saying appalling gcse results , when you 're worried that the other person might already have a child there .
or there 's the patronising : " such a caring , unpushy environment " , which means woodwork - sorry , " resistant materials " - is the strongest subject .
it 's a good school ... for someone else 's children .
" if we do n't get a place in that school ... we 'll really have to think hard , " says the person who has already checked out the private school fees .
" we 're so lucky to be so accidentally near , " says the family which has expended money , arguments and tears in househunting in a quarter-mile radius .
or there 's the adeptly ambiguous : " the new head is really turning it around " , which means , most of the kids are starting to leave their guns at home these days .
three-legged race this is a decision which will have a huge significance for a child 's future .
but it can feel like some kind of unfunny version of the three-legged parents ' race at a school sports day .
your comments caring parents would rather be seen as pushy than dump their kids with lots of feral chavs .
jackie , tunbridge wells i am one of the bunch of feral chavs referred to in the previous e-mail ...
barry , liverpool read your comments every time you get near to thinking you 've found the right school , you 're tripped up .
right exam results , but wrong place .
right place , but wrong results .
if it 's so good that you want to send your child there , it 's going to be too oversubscribed to get a place .
it 's the catchment-22 .
open days , when hopeful parents are shepherded round schools , are a real eye-opener .
how can schools be so different in results when they are supposed to be serving the same local community ?
two non-selective schools , a few streets away from each other , have gcse results in which one school is literally twice as good as the other .
guess which one turns away nine out of 10 applicants ?
these tours , bringing pr to the 3rs , also show how different schools can look .
there are slickly modern places where the pupils keep their work on memory sticks rather than in bookbags - and places with house points and prefects in gowns .
there are banks of gleaming computers , music recording studios and school halls filled with latin and blazers .
fair , unfair but for parents , the biggest difference is between those where you can get a place and those where you ca n't .
an important step in the school admissions process so people get strategic .
being able to buy a house near a successful school , deploying those music lesson skills , belonging to a religion , being in the right ability band , the luck of the draw in a lottery , are all advantages in the " fair admissions " sweepstake .
living near the school is the most common admissions factor , but there 's nothing inherently fair about that kind of localism , particularly when it 's based on how much house you can afford .
if a public employer favoured job applicants living nearest the workplace , there would be outrage .
or if a successful surgeon always gave priority to those living in nearby streets , it would n't seem right .
but who can blame parents for wanting to grab the best chances for their children ?
guilt trip it 's a guilt trip either way - with all kinds of social divisions lurking just below the surface .
there are schools which use a lottery to allocate places if you use your sharp elbows to get a good school for your child - making all those calculations about music scholarships and catchment areas - you 're accused of being pushy .
if you let your child drift into the nearest school despite its quagmire reputation , you 're nagged by self-doubt about letting them down .
and it raises some awkward unspoken questions .
what are parents really looking for ?
a school where the other children are like their own ?
or are they actively avoiding schools with the " wrong " kind of kids ?
what kind of judgements are being made about accents , ambitions , class and race ?
when parents are trying to help their children get a head start in life , whose heads are they going to trample over to get there ?
because , whichever hoops are jumped through , someone 's children are going to end up in the worst and the best schools .
here is a selection of your comments : i am at this moment in time filling in the forms for secondary transfer .
i live in wd3 which is supposed to be the catchment area for my local school , i do n't think i have a hope in hell 's chance of my son actually getting into that school as they like to cream the best students on academic ability .
i still have no hope of him getting a place as we just do n't live near enough to the local school school gate .
measured in metres after the academic students have been allocated .
another anxious parent who is not sleeping well at night ! ! !
adele deanus , hertfordshire i live around the corner from the best secondary school in the area , one of the best schools in the country .
did n't move there because of the school , but because of the house and the area .
i get leaflets pushed through my door from people wanting to rent out my address in order to get their children into the school .
some kids are coming miles by train and bus to go there - it 's ridiculous that schools can be so very different in results that people have to do this for their kids .
hannah , potters bar , herts mine are currently in years 8 and 10 so i 've worn this t-shirt twice .
try to be open minded but have a back up plan .
ours unfortunately was remortgage plus loan to a private school , after 2 years of bullying .
home schooling was plan 3 if we could n't raise the money .
the comps are n't full of feral kids , but it only takes one disengaged individual to make a lot of children 's lives miserable and make the lessons so disruptive they are pointless .
andrea i used to think that parents who went to a lot of trouble to get their children into high performing and generally white and middle-class schools were snobs or covert racists .
then i sent my daughter to an inner city comprehensive .
although i 'm happy with the standard of teaching at her school , she has to put up with terrible bullying as one of the few middle-class children in the school , and she gets frustrated at the high levels of disruption during lessons .
now i 'm desperate to move her to one of those snobby middle-class schools , but i ca n't .
we live outside the catchment area of all of the schools with a reasonable reputation and as atheists , we are n't eligible to go to any of the faith schools which have wider catchment areas .
heather , london we have the rather bizarre situation where a small number of parents have hired a lawyer to get the admissions policy for our local secondary school changed .
it is the distance you live from the next alternative school that matters and not how close you are to the school in question .
we now expect children who could walk to the secondary school to be allocated a school further away such that they will need some form of transport !
unfortunately money talks , even in state education !
dave , bookham , surrey we are in this position having a child in year 6 .
our problem is that the local school , which has a really good reputation is closing and will merge with another school , with not so good results when he will be in year 10 .
this is so frustrating for us and him .
at present a group of parents are taking the sheffield council to court over this decision , we shall have to see what happens ...
emma , sheffield the article makes no mention of that most unpleasant tactic - renting a property in the catchment area for a few months .
i 've even seen a family ' break up ' - mother and eldest child pretend to live in a rented flat , but get back together with father and the other children once a place has been secured .
of course , the younger children also go to the school under the sibling rule .
for every child who gains a place that way , and each of its siblings , a family which should have got a place , does n't .
bill , bristol i 'm in this dilemma .
my son is very bright , and with his agreement , he 's just started at the local comp .
they do n't get the best results in their exams , but the school and the teachers seem caring enough .
his grandparents on the other hand think he should go to a private school , or out-of-area grammar .
well , i went to a very good comp myself and hate this stigmatisation of comp schools .
i 'd like to think we can make his school a better place too by getting involved .
sarah , sandhurst what really has annoyed me in the search for a decent school is that i have looked at seven different schools and the one that our son would do best at and his first choice he may not get in on distance , yet a parent who has outwardly expressed that she does n't care about her childs education is guaranteed a place in the same school .
aagh !
adele , hounslow if you have to jump through hoops to get in , at least the school will be full of children whose parents care about education .
the grammar schools here , selecting on ability , have a wider social and ethnic mix than they would have done if the intake was purely local .
other local schools , both faith schools and other specialist ones , also do very well .
caring parents would rather be seen as pushy than dump their kids with lots of feral chavs .
jackie , tunbridge wells , kent i am one of the bunch of feral chavs referred to in a previous email .
i went to a local comp with a poor reputation .
this has not been a bar to my progressing in life .
unfortunately , for a lot of children the stigmatism of going to a comp means they either become over-achievers if they are intelligent or they accept that they are never going to succeed , fade away and remain with their " class " of people .
simply put , the current system leads to the ghettoisation of educational standards into those who can afford to buy a house near the right school and those who ca n't and therefore end up suffering with a downward spiral of a school which can not attract good teachers and gets worse results .
barry , liverpool the last thing i want for my kid is to turn him into a well-qualified angst-ridden mess who crumbles every time he 's confronted by someone from a less fortunate background .
a bit of ' feral chav exposure ' is n't always a bad thing ... in small doses .
on the other hand , and as a counter-point to mr liddle 's point , consider this : are they feral chavs because they 're poor , or poor because they 're feral chavs ?
bit of both , probably - but money alone just ai n't the answer .
joel , beaconsfield , bucks the strange thing is , i 'm having trouble booking time off work to attend all of these open days .
my employers can not figure out why i have to look at so many schools when the old system of - you go where 's closest - was ditched .
secondly , how is this any fairer ?
we still have to list a minimum of six schools , and it 's still pot luck which one you get !
stupid .
mike , london i am having exactly the same problem , i am not in any catchment area for a secondary school as i fall just outside and have no hope of getting in anywhere .
shame really when we live right across the road to one of the best state girl 's schools in the country but because of their selectiveness and high achievement we wo n't get in there either .
it is no longer visit the school and choose which one you want to go to but a strategic plan of which school you are more likely to secure a place at , even then some children from our area end up with no school at all and parent 's re-mortgage their houses in order to pay private fees .
what is this country coming to when all we hear from the govenment is education , education , education - but for who ?
nichola , hampstead garden suburbs , london i know a local lettings agent who regularly rents out a flat in a block next door to an excellent local school for a short term let .
the price ? £ 3000 a month for 6 months .
that 's still only the equivalent of one year 's fees at a private school , so well worth it for many parents .
john , richmond , surrey i think we need to get away from the idea that school admissions can ever be " fair " - what does that really mean ?
the biggest determinant of school performance is not the building , the teachers , or even the catchment area - it 's the pupils which attend , and that means high performing schools will be always be selective .
people have no issue with this is higher education -lrb- oxford and cambridge are very selective -rrb- so why all the liberal handwringing about selection in secondary education ?
matt munro , bristol we have just made the decision to go down the private school route .
we are white - but not middle class , and definitely not well off .
we can not afford to move to a house near the better senior schools and our local state school has is so appalling that we worked out it was cheaper to do the school fees - or rather , we could space out the payments - than to move house .
we would have to spend £ 500,000 or more on a house near good schools in our borough , and we simply can not afford that .
school fees for the next 10 years come in at way under that cost - so for us there has been no choice .
to get a good education for our child we 've been forced out of the state system - which is kind of backwards to how it should be !
flora , london looking for a secondary school should n't be a big issue but it is because of the large number of schools with such poor results .
or to put it bluntly the number of schools that produce pupils which are failures .
john , london personally , i think choice has got out of hand .
our daughter goes to secondary school next year and we 're now finding that our choice of primary feeder school leaves us in a low-priority criteria for the school we 're living in the catchment area for !
as far as i 'm concerned , i do n't want to " choose " the best school for my child - this is a ridiculous situation that results in " good and bad " schools .
every school should be equally funded , regardless of their results or success and every child should be able to attend a good quality secondary school close to their friends , their home and within their community .
angela , bucks i am one of those parents who are indeed desprately trying to just get their son or daughter into a good school near their home .
unfortunately this good school falls under the surrey county councils unfair policy sweepstake .
which means my child is 4th on the priority selection list because he is n't in foster care or has special needs and he does n't have a sibling at the school already , infact it 's just down to where he lives right now !
this is ludicrous that we have to wait for places behind the families with siblings at the school already , especially as some of the children 's families have moved away and are no longer in the catchment area .
what happened to feeder school places ?
this is all so worrying and unnecessary pressure on the parent lisa , redhill , surrey with the lottery that is school places now , despite having gone to a comprehensive , i would not rely on sending my kids to a state school now .
in fact , in this country at the moment , there is a strong argument to say you have a moral obligation to ensure you have enough money for private education before siring a child .
even if that money is only there to be used if you ca n't get a grammar school place .
dave , london is n't this why we had tests for grammar schools all those years ago ?
then it was the kids who decided as it were rather than the parents .
phil thomas , wokingham some people are just too pushy for their children .
you have to remember that it is your kid and not you that has to spend seven years at the school five miles away .
school should be fun as well as an education , and turning into the most stressful time of a person 's life will do no good in the long run .
nick , london no choice here in rural pembrokeshire , you 've got one choice and that 's it .
it 's a comprehensive my twin daughters go to and as their abilities differ i 've watched the more academic one receive a completely different education to the less academic one .
but all you can do is stand up for your child 's rights and be firm and in my experience anything can be sorted .
my girls mix with all sorts and it 's done them no harm , if anything it 's made them aware how fortunate they are .
i do hate the idea that they go to the same school i did though , seems a failure on my part somehow .
liz , pembroke dock , wales this problem is endemic througout britain , not just england .
whilst the article mildly criticises the method used in placements ie catchment areas , there is always going to be some kind of selection process when you have demand exceeding supply .
sadly , there is no easy solution ; those areas where poverty is more rife will inevitably have schools that do not perform as well as those schools that are located in areas where poverty is less of an issue .
abolish povery and the problem wo n't exist .
easy , no ?
j gordon liddle , edinburgh , lothian what a hideous system we have produced !
where children 's expectation of a decent education appears to be on condition of their parent 's ability to move the right area , afford private education or tutoring to pass entrance exams or willingness to cheat and lie to get them into their favoured seat of education .
all children should be given the opportunity to a decent education regardless of their background !
this includes children who might not be highly academic but have a willingness to work hard and achieve .
if we all supported our local school and got involved in making our children feel good about where and how they learn our education system would be a much better place !

joel , beaconsfield , bucks the strange thing is , i 'm having trouble booking time off work to attend all of these open days .
my employers can not figure out why i have to look at so many schools when the old system of - you go where 's closest - was ditched .
secondly , how is this any fairer ?
we still have to list a minimum of six schools , and it 's still pot luck which one you get !
stupid .
mike , london i am having exactly the same problem , i am not in any catchment area for a secondary school as i fall just outside and have no hope of getting in anywhere .
shame really when we live right across the road to one of the best state girl 's schools in the country but because of their selectiveness and high achievement we wo n't get in there either .
it is no longer visit the school and choose which one you want to go to but a strategic plan of which school you are more likely to secure a place at , even then some children from our area end up with no school at all and parent 's re-mortgage their houses in order to pay private fees .
what is this country coming to when all we hear from the govenment is education , education , education - but for who ?
nichola , hampstead garden suburbs , london i know a local lettings agent who regularly rents out a flat in a block next door to an excellent local school for a short term let .
the price ? £ 3000 a month for 6 months .
that 's still only the equivalent of one year 's fees at a private school , so well worth it for many parents .
john , richmond , surrey i think we need to get away from the idea that school admissions can ever be " fair " - what does that really mean ?
the biggest determinant of school performance is not the building , the teachers , or even the catchment area - it 's the pupils which attend , and that means high performing schools will be always be selective .
people have no issue with this is higher education -lrb- oxford and cambridge are very selective -rrb- so why all the liberal handwringing about selection in secondary education ?
matt munro , bristol we have just made the decision to go down the private school route .
we are white - but not middle class , and definitely not well off .
we can not afford to move to a house near the better senior schools and our local state school has is so appalling that we worked out it was cheaper to do the school fees - or rather , we could space out the payments - than to move house .
we would have to spend £ 500,000 or more on a house near good schools in our borough , and we simply can not afford that .
school fees for the next 10 years come in at way under that cost - so for us there has been no choice .
to get a good education for our child we 've been forced out of the state system - which is kind of backwards to how it should be !
flora , london looking for a secondary school should n't be a big issue but it is because of the large number of schools with such poor results .
or to put it bluntly the number of schools that produce pupils which are failures .
john , london personally , i think choice has got out of hand .
our daughter goes to secondary school next year and we 're now finding that our choice of primary feeder school leaves us in a low-priority criteria for the school we 're living in the catchment area for !
as far as i 'm concerned , i do n't want to " choose " the best school for my child - this is a ridiculous situation that results in " good and bad " schools .
every school should be equally funded , regardless of their results or success and every child should be able to attend a good quality secondary school close to their friends , their home and within their community .
angela , bucks i am one of those parents who are indeed desprately trying to just get their son or daughter into a good school near their home .
unfortunately this good school falls under the surrey county councils unfair policy sweepstake .
which means my child is 4th on the priority selection list because he is n't in foster care or has special needs and he does n't have a sibling at the school already , infact it 's just down to where he lives right now !
this is ludicrous that we have to wait for places behind the families with siblings at the school already , especially as some of the children 's families have moved away and are no longer in the catchment area .
what happened to feeder school places ?
this is all so worrying and unnecessary pressure on the parent lisa , redhill , surrey with the lottery that is school places now , despite having gone to a comprehensive , i would not rely on sending my kids to a state school now .
in fact , in this country at the moment , there is a strong argument to say you have a moral obligation to ensure you have enough money for private education before siring a child .
even if that money is only there to be used if you ca n't get a grammar school place .
dave , london is n't this why we had tests for grammar schools all those years ago ?
then it was the kids who decided as it were rather than the parents .
phil thomas , wokingham some people are just too pushy for their children .
you have to remember that it is your kid and not you that has to spend seven years at the school five miles away .
school should be fun as well as an education , and turning into the most stressful time of a person 's life will do no good in the long run .
nick , london no choice here in rural pembrokeshire , you 've got one choice and that 's it .
it 's a comprehensive my twin daughters go to and as their abilities differ i 've watched the more academic one receive a completely different education to the less academic one .
but all you can do is stand up for your child 's rights and be firm and in my experience anything can be sorted .
my girls mix with all sorts and it 's done them no harm , if anything it 's made them aware how fortunate they are .
i do hate the idea that they go to the same school i did though , seems a failure on my part somehow .
liz , pembroke dock , wales this problem is endemic througout britain , not just england .
whilst the article mildly criticises the method used in placements ie catchment areas , there is always going to be some kind of selection process when you have demand exceeding supply .
sadly , there is no easy solution ; those areas where poverty is more rife will inevitably have schools that do not perform as well as those schools that are located in areas where poverty is less of an issue .
abolish povery and the problem wo n't exist .
easy , no ?
j gordon liddle , edinburgh , lothian what a hideous system we have produced !
where children 's expectation of a decent education appears to be on condition of their parent 's ability to move the right area , afford private education or tutoring to pass entrance exams or willingness to cheat and lie to get them into their favoured seat of education .
all children should be given the opportunity to a decent education regardless of their background !
this includes children who might not be highly academic but have a willingness to work hard and achieve .
if we all supported our local school and got involved in making our children feel good about where and how they learn our education system would be a much better place !

when you 're in a queue to look around a secondary school where your child has almost no chance of getting a place , it does n't exactly feel like " school choice " .
it 's more like school rationing - or a sprint for the lifeboats rather than a relaxed , informed decision about the best possible education for your child .
in many parts of england , it 's almost time to send back the forms for next year 's secondary school places .
anyone with a child in the last year of primary school will know what i 'm talking about - because they wo n't have been talking about anything else for weeks .
you can see knots of these parents talking conspiratorially about the schools they 've visited - swapping details of prospectuses , head teachers ' presentations and catchment areas measured down to the last centimetre .
translation in the parental chats there 's a kind of sub-text .
" a really lively bunch of kids , but not quite right for my child , " is a sensitively liberal way of saying a sink school with a terrifying playground .
looking for hogwarts on the application form " lots of lovely music " is a politely conservative way of saying appalling gcse results , when you 're worried that the other person might already have a child there .
or there 's the patronising : " such a caring , unpushy environment " , which means woodwork - sorry , " resistant materials " - is the strongest subject .
it 's a good school ... for someone else 's children .
" if we do n't get a place in that school ... we 'll really have to think hard , " says the person who has already checked out the private school fees .
" we 're so lucky to be so accidentally near , " says the family which has expended money , arguments and tears in househunting in a quarter-mile radius .
or there 's the adeptly ambiguous : " the new head is really turning it around " , which means , most of the kids are starting to leave their guns at home these days .
three-legged race this is a decision which will have a huge significance for a child 's future .
but it can feel like some kind of unfunny version of the three-legged parents ' race at a school sports day .
your comments caring parents would rather be seen as pushy than dump their kids with lots of feral chavs .
jackie , tunbridge wells i am one of the bunch of feral chavs referred to in the previous e-mail ...
barry , liverpool read your comments every time you get near to thinking you 've found the right school , you 're tripped up .
right exam results , but wrong place .
right place , but wrong results .
if it 's so good that you want to send your child there , it 's going to be too oversubscribed to get a place .
it 's the catchment-22 .
open days , when hopeful parents are shepherded round schools , are a real eye-opener .
how can schools be so different in results when they are supposed to be serving the same local community ?
two non-selective schools , a few streets away from each other , have gcse results in which one school is literally twice as good as the other .
guess which one turns away nine out of 10 applicants ?
these tours , bringing pr to the 3rs , also show how different schools can look .
there are slickly modern places where the pupils keep their work on memory sticks rather than in bookbags - and places with house points and prefects in gowns .
there are banks of gleaming computers , music recording studios and school halls filled with latin and blazers .
fair , unfair but for parents , the biggest difference is between those where you can get a place and those where you ca n't .
an important step in the school admissions process so people get strategic .
being able to buy a house near a successful school , deploying those music lesson skills , belonging to a religion , being in the right ability band , the luck of the draw in a lottery , are all advantages in the " fair admissions " sweepstake .
living near the school is the most common admissions factor , but there 's nothing inherently fair about that kind of localism , particularly when it 's based on how much house you can afford .
if a public employer favoured job applicants living nearest the workplace , there would be outrage .
or if a successful surgeon always gave priority to those living in nearby streets , it would n't seem right .
but who can blame parents for wanting to grab the best chances for their children ?
guilt trip it 's a guilt trip either way - with all kinds of social divisions lurking just below the surface .
there are schools which use a lottery to allocate places if you use your sharp elbows to get a good school for your child - making all those calculations about music scholarships and catchment areas - you 're accused of being pushy .
if you let your child drift into the nearest school despite its quagmire reputation , you 're nagged by self-doubt about letting them down .
and it raises some awkward unspoken questions .
what are parents really looking for ?
a school where the other children are like their own ?
or are they actively avoiding schools with the " wrong " kind of kids ?
what kind of judgements are being made about accents , ambitions , class and race ?
when parents are trying to help their children get a head start in life , whose heads are they going to trample over to get there ?
because , whichever hoops are jumped through , someone 's children are going to end up in the worst and the best schools .
here is a selection of your comments : i am at this moment in time filling in the forms for secondary transfer .
i live in wd3 which is supposed to be the catchment area for my local school , i do n't think i have a hope in hell 's chance of my son actually getting into that school as they like to cream the best students on academic ability .
i still have no hope of him getting a place as we just do n't live near enough to the local school school gate .
measured in metres after the academic students have been allocated .
another anxious parent who is not sleeping well at night ! ! !
adele deanus , hertfordshire i live around the corner from the best secondary school in the area , one of the best schools in the country .
did n't move there because of the school , but because of the house and the area .
i get leaflets pushed through my door from people wanting to rent out my address in order to get their children into the school .
some kids are coming miles by train and bus to go there - it 's ridiculous that schools can be so very different in results that people have to do this for their kids .
hannah , potters bar , herts mine are currently in years 8 and 10 so i 've worn this t-shirt twice .
try to be open minded but have a back up plan .
ours unfortunately was remortgage plus loan to a private school , after 2 years of bullying .
home schooling was plan 3 if we could n't raise the money .
the comps are n't full of feral kids , but it only takes one disengaged individual to make a lot of children 's lives miserable and make the lessons so disruptive they are pointless .
andrea i used to think that parents who went to a lot of trouble to get their children into high performing and generally white and middle-class schools were snobs or covert racists .
then i sent my daughter to an inner city comprehensive .
although i 'm happy with the standard of teaching at her school , she has to put up with terrible bullying as one of the few middle-class children in the school , and she gets frustrated at the high levels of disruption during lessons .
now i 'm desperate to move her to one of those snobby middle-class schools , but i ca n't .
we live outside the catchment area of all of the schools with a reasonable reputation and as atheists , we are n't eligible to go to any of the faith schools which have wider catchment areas .
heather , london we have the rather bizarre situation where a small number of parents have hired a lawyer to get the admissions policy for our local secondary school changed .
it is the distance you live from the next alternative school that matters and not how close you are to the school in question .
we now expect children who could walk to the secondary school to be allocated a school further away such that they will need some form of transport !
unfortunately money talks , even in state education !
dave , bookham , surrey we are in this position having a child in year 6 .
our problem is that the local school , which has a really good reputation is closing and will merge with another school , with not so good results when he will be in year 10 .
this is so frustrating for us and him .
at present a group of parents are taking the sheffield council to court over this decision , we shall have to see what happens ...
emma , sheffield the article makes no mention of that most unpleasant tactic - renting a property in the catchment area for a few months .
i 've even seen a family ' break up ' - mother and eldest child pretend to live in a rented flat , but get back together with father and the other children once a place has been secured .
of course , the younger children also go to the school under the sibling rule .
for every child who gains a place that way , and each of its siblings , a family which should have got a place , does n't .
bill , bristol i 'm in this dilemma .
my son is very bright , and with his agreement , he 's just started at the local comp .
they do n't get the best results in their exams , but the school and the teachers seem caring enough .
his grandparents on the other hand think he should go to a private school , or out-of-area grammar .
well , i went to a very good comp myself and hate this stigmatisation of comp schools .
i 'd like to think we can make his school a better place too by getting involved .
sarah , sandhurst what really has annoyed me in the search for a decent school is that i have looked at seven different schools and the one that our son would do best at and his first choice he may not get in on distance , yet a parent who has outwardly expressed that she does n't care about her childs education is guaranteed a place in the same school .
aagh !
adele , hounslow if you have to jump through hoops to get in , at least the school will be full of children whose parents care about education .
the grammar schools here , selecting on ability , have a wider social and ethnic mix than they would have done if the intake was purely local .
other local schools , both faith schools and other specialist ones , also do very well .
caring parents would rather be seen as pushy than dump their kids with lots of feral chavs .
jackie , tunbridge wells , kent i am one of the bunch of feral chavs referred to in a previous email .
i went to a local comp with a poor reputation .
this has not been a bar to my progressing in life .
unfortunately , for a lot of children the stigmatism of going to a comp means they either become over-achievers if they are intelligent or they accept that they are never going to succeed , fade away and remain with their " class " of people .
simply put , the current system leads to the ghettoisation of educational standards into those who can afford to buy a house near the right school and those who ca n't and therefore end up suffering with a downward spiral of a school which can not attract good teachers and gets worse results .
barry , liverpool the last thing i want for my kid is to turn him into a well-qualified angst-ridden mess who crumbles every time he 's confronted by someone from a less fortunate background .
a bit of ' feral chav exposure ' is n't always a bad thing ... in small doses .
on the other hand , and as a counter-point to mr liddle 's point , consider this : are they feral chavs because they 're poor , or poor because they 're feral chavs ?
bit of both , probably - but money alone just ai n't the answer .
joel , beaconsfield , bucks the strange thing is , i 'm having trouble booking time off work to attend all of these open days .

your comments " caring parents would rather be seen as pushy than dump their kids with lots of feral chavs . "
jackie , tunbridge wells " i am one of the bunch of feral chavs referred to in the previous e-mail ... "
barry , liverpool read your comments every time you get near to thinking you 've found the right school , you 're tripped up .
right exam results , but wrong place .
right place , but wrong results .
if it 's so good that you want to send your child there , it 's going to be too oversubscribed to get a place .
it 's the catchment-22 .
open days , when hopeful parents are shepherded round schools , are a real eye-opener .
how can schools be so different in results when they are supposed to be serving the same local community ?
two non-selective schools , a few streets away from each other , have gcse results in which one school is literally twice as good as the other .
guess which one turns away nine out of 10 applicants ?
these tours , bringing pr to the 3rs , also show how different schools can look .
there are slickly modern places where the pupils keep their work on memory sticks rather than in bookbags - and places with house points and prefects in gowns .
there are banks of gleaming computers , music recording studios and school halls filled with latin and blazers .
fair , unfair but for parents , the biggest difference is between those where you can get a place and those where you ca n't .
so people get strategic .
being able to buy a house near a successful school , deploying those music lesson skills , belonging to a religion , being in the right ability band , the luck of the draw in a lottery , are all advantages in the " fair admissions " sweepstake .
living near the school is the most common admissions factor , but there 's nothing inherently fair about that kind of localism , particularly when it 's based on how much house you can afford .
if a public employer favoured job applicants living nearest the workplace , there would be outrage .
or if a successful surgeon always gave priority to those living in nearby streets , it would n't seem right .
but who can blame parents for wanting to grab the best chances for their children ?
guilt trip it 's a guilt trip either way - with all kinds of social divisions lurking just below the surface .
if you use your sharp elbows to get a good school for your child - making all those calculations about music scholarships and catchment areas - you 're accused of being pushy .
if you let your child drift into the nearest school despite its quagmire reputation , you 're nagged by self-doubt about letting them down .
and it raises some awkward unspoken questions .
what are parents really looking for ?
a school where the other children are like their own ?
or are they actively avoiding schools with the " wrong " kind of kids ?
what kind of judgements are being made about accents , ambitions , class and race ?
when parents are trying to help their children get a head start in life , whose heads are they going to trample over to get there ?
because , whichever hoops are jumped through , someone 's children are going to end up in the worst and the best schools .
here is a selection of your comments : i am at this moment in time filling in the forms for secondary transfer .
i live in wd3 which is supposed to be the catchment area for my local school , i do n't think i have a hope in hell 's chance of my son actually getting into that school as they like to cream the best students on academic ability .
i still have no hope of him getting a place as we just do n't live near enough to the local school school gate .
measured in metres after the academic students have been allocated .
another anxious parent who is not sleeping well at night ! ! !
adele deanus , hertfordshire i live around the corner from the best secondary school in the area , one of the best schools in the country .
did n't move there because of the school , but because of the house and the area .
i get leaflets pushed through my door from people wanting to rent out my address in order to get their children into the school .
some kids are coming miles by train and bus to go there - it 's ridiculous that schools can be so very different in results that people have to do this for their kids .
hannah , potters bar , herts mine are currently in years 8 and 10 so i 've worn this t-shirt twice .
try to be open minded but have a back up plan .
ours unfortunately was remortgage plus loan to a private school , after 2 years of bullying .
home schooling was plan 3 if we could n't raise the money .
the comps are n't full of feral kids , but it only takes one disengaged individual to make a lot of children 's lives miserable and make the lessons so disruptive they are pointless .
andrea i used to think that parents who went to a lot of trouble to get their children into high performing and generally white and middle-class schools were snobs or covert racists .
then i sent my daughter to an inner city comprehensive .
although i 'm happy with the standard of teaching at her school , she has to put up with terrible bullying as one of the few middle-class children in the school , and she gets frustrated at the high levels of disruption during lessons .
now i 'm desperate to move her to one of those snobby middle-class schools , but i ca n't .
we live outside the catchment area of all of the schools with a reasonable reputation and as atheists , we are n't eligible to go to any of the faith schools which have wider catchment areas .
heather , london we have the rather bizarre situation where a small number of parents have hired a lawyer to get the admissions policy for our local secondary school changed .
it is the distance you live from the next alternative school that matters and not how close you are to the school in question .
we now expect children who could walk to the secondary school to be allocated a school further away such that they will need some form of transport !
unfortunately money talks , even in state education !
dave , bookham , surrey we are in this position having a child in year 6 .
our problem is that the local school , which has a really good reputation is closing and will merge with another school , with not so good results when he will be in year 10 .
this is so frustrating for us and him .
at present a group of parents are taking the sheffield council to court over this decision , we shall have to see what happens ...
emma , sheffield the article makes no mention of that most unpleasant tactic - renting a property in the catchment area for a few months .
i 've even seen a family ' break up ' - mother and eldest child pretend to live in a rented flat , but get back together with father and the other children once a place has been secured .
of course , the younger children also go to the school under the sibling rule .
for every child who gains a place that way , and each of its siblings , a family which should have got a place , does n't .
bill , bristol i 'm in this dilemma .
my son is very bright , and with his agreement , he 's just started at the local comp .
they do n't get the best results in their exams , but the school and the teachers seem caring enough .
his grandparents on the other hand think he should go to a private school , or out-of-area grammar .
well , i went to a very good comp myself and hate this stigmatisation of comp schools .
i 'd like to think we can make his school a better place too by getting involved .
sarah , sandhurst what really has annoyed me in the search for a decent school is that i have looked at seven different schools and the one that our son would do best at and his first choice he may not get in on distance , yet a parent who has outwardly expressed that she does n't care about her childs education is guaranteed a place in the same school .
aagh !
adele , hounslow if you have to jump through hoops to get in , at least the school will be full of children whose parents care about education .
the grammar schools here , selecting on ability , have a wider social and ethnic mix than they would have done if the intake was purely local .
other local schools , both faith schools and other specialist ones , also do very well .
caring parents would rather be seen as pushy than dump their kids with lots of feral chavs .
jackie , tunbridge wells , kent i am one of the bunch of feral chavs referred to in a previous email .
i went to a local comp with a poor reputation .
this has not been a bar to my progressing in life .
unfortunately , for a lot of children the stigmatism of going to a comp means they either become over-achievers if they are intelligent or they accept that they are never going to succeed , fade away and remain with their " class " of people .
simply put , the current system leads to the ghettoisation of educational standards into those who can afford to buy a house near the right school and those who ca n't and therefore end up suffering with a downward spiral of a school which can not attract good teachers and gets worse results .
barry , liverpool the last thing i want for my kid is to turn him into a well-qualified angst-ridden mess who crumbles every time he 's confronted by someone from a less fortunate background .
a bit of ' feral chav exposure ' is n't always a bad thing ... in small doses .
on the other hand , and as a counter-point to mr liddle 's point , consider this : are they feral chavs because they 're poor , or poor because they 're feral chavs ?
bit of both , probably - but money alone just ai n't the answer .
joel , beaconsfield , bucks the strange thing is , i 'm having trouble booking time off work to attend all of these open days .
my employers can not figure out why i have to look at so many schools when the old system of - you go where 's closest - was ditched .
secondly , how is this any fairer ?
we still have to list a minimum of six schools , and it 's still pot luck which one you get !
stupid .
mike , london i am having exactly the same problem , i am not in any catchment area for a secondary school as i fall just outside and have no hope of getting in anywhere .
shame really when we live right across the road to one of the best state girl 's schools in the country but because of their selectiveness and high achievement we wo n't get in there either .
it is no longer visit the school and choose which one you want to go to but a strategic plan of which school you are more likely to secure a place at , even then some children from our area end up with no school at all and parent 's re-mortgage their houses in order to pay private fees .
what is this country coming to when all we hear from the govenment is education , education , education - but for who ?
nichola , hampstead garden suburbs , london i know a local lettings agent who regularly rents out a flat in a block next door to an excellent local school for a short term let .
the price ? £ 3000 a month for 6 months .
that 's still only the equivalent of one year 's fees at a private school , so well worth it for many parents .
john , richmond , surrey i think we need to get away from the idea that school admissions can ever be " fair " - what does that really mean ?
the biggest determinant of school performance is not the building , the teachers , or even the catchment area - it 's the pupils which attend , and that means high performing schools will be always be selective .
people have no issue with this is higher education -lrb- oxford and cambridge are very selective -rrb- so why all the liberal handwringing about selection in secondary education ?
matt munro , bristol we have just made the decision to go down the private school route .
we are white - but not middle class , and definitely not well off .
we can not afford to move to a house near the better senior schools and our local state school has is so appalling that we worked out it was cheaper to do the school fees - or rather , we could space out the payments - than to move house .
we would have to spend £ 500,000 or more on a house near good schools in our borough , and we simply can not afford that .
school fees for the next 10 years come in at way under that cost - so for us there has been no choice .
to get a good education for our child we 've been forced out of the state system - which is kind of backwards to how it should be !
flora , london looking for a secondary school should n't be a big issue but it is because of the large number of schools with such poor results .
or to put it bluntly the number of schools that produce pupils which are failures .
john , london personally , i think choice has got out of hand .
our daughter goes to secondary school next year and we 're now finding that our choice of primary feeder school leaves us in a low-priority criteria for the school we 're living in the catchment area for !
as far as i 'm concerned , i do n't want to " choose " the best school for my child - this is a ridiculous situation that results in " good and bad " schools .
every school should be equally funded , regardless of their results or success and every child should be able to attend a good quality secondary school close to their friends , their home and within their community .
angela , bucks i am one of those parents who are indeed desprately trying to just get their son or daughter into a good school near their home .
unfortunately this good school falls under the surrey county councils unfair policy sweepstake .
which means my child is 4th on the priority selection list because he is n't in foster care or has special needs and he does n't have a sibling at the school already , infact it 's just down to where he lives right now !
this is ludicrous that we have to wait for places behind the families with siblings at the school already , especially as some of the children 's families have moved away and are no longer in the catchment area .
what happened to feeder school places ?
this is all so worrying and unnecessary pressure on the parent lisa , redhill , surrey with the lottery that is school places now , despite having gone to a comprehensive , i would not rely on sending my kids to a state school now .
in fact , in this country at the moment , there is a strong argument to say you have a moral obligation to ensure you have enough money for private education before siring a child .
even if that money is only there to be used if you ca n't get a grammar school place .
dave , london is n't this why we had tests for grammar schools all those years ago ?
then it was the kids who decided as it were rather than the parents .
phil thomas , wokingham some people are just too pushy for their children .
you have to remember that it is your kid and not you that has to spend seven years at the school five miles away .
school should be fun as well as an education , and turning into the most stressful time of a person 's life will do no good in the long run .
nick , london no choice here in rural pembrokeshire , you 've got one choice and that 's it .
it 's a comprehensive my twin daughters go to and as their abilities differ i 've watched the more academic one receive a completely different education to the less academic one .
but all you can do is stand up for your child 's rights and be firm and in my experience anything can be sorted .
my girls mix with all sorts and it 's done them no harm , if anything it 's made them aware how fortunate they are .
i do hate the idea that they go to the same school i did though , seems a failure on my part somehow .
liz , pembroke dock , wales this problem is endemic througout britain , not just england .
whilst the article mildly criticises the method used in placements ie catchment areas , there is always going to be some kind of selection process when you have demand exceeding supply .
sadly , there is no easy solution ; those areas where poverty is more rife will inevitably have schools that do not perform as well as those schools that are located in areas where poverty is less of an issue .
abolish povery and the problem wo n't exist .
easy , no ?
j gordon liddle , edinburgh , lothian what a hideous system we have produced !
where children 's expectation of a decent education appears to be on condition of their parent 's ability to move the right area , afford private education or tutoring to pass entrance exams or willingness to cheat and lie to get them into their favoured seat of education .
all children should be given the opportunity to a decent education regardless of their background !
this includes children who might not be highly academic but have a willingness to work hard and achieve .
if we all supported our local school and got involved in making our children feel good about where and how they learn our education system would be a much better place !

armed and with overt political agendas , they have a habit of surfacing when general elections are around the corner .
and two such groups have been a particular security headache of late .
one is a somewhat mysterious group from around mount elgon in western kenya calling itself the sabaot land defence force -lrb- sldf -rrb- .
the other , called mungiki , is considered more ominous because it has been drawing disaffected and poor youth from the dominant kikuyu ethnic group .
paramilitaries they are not , but they have been a security nightmare nonetheless .
the two gangs are quite different , but each has been targeting to kill government agents in their areas of operation .
senseless killings the sldf operates as a conventional militia , with an estimated strength of several hundred fighters .
its leaders are unknown , though there have been strong indicators that local politicians in the opposition-dominated area have been giving support to the militia .
mungiki emerged in the 1980s outlawed in 2002 recruits mainly from kikuyu tribe strongest in nairobi 's slums where it runs extortion rackets poses as a traditional religious sect accused of trying to destabilise government its style is quick-strike attacks at police patrols or government outposts .
meanwhile mungiki 's mission of destabilisation of what is essentially a kikuyu-led government is more perplexing , as it is itself exclusively kikuyu outfit .
mungiki likes to pose as a traditionalist religious sect , but at other times it comes across as a pure political gang for hire - until its descended into outright criminality through an orgy of seemingly senseless killings that drew the full wrath of the state .
mungiki is especially feared because of the macabre and secret oaths to which it subjects its initiates yet its quasi-religious posturing has since been exposed as a false cover for its true agenda : extortion .
the gang 's main target is the matatu minibuses which dominate public transport in the capital nairobi .
it has extended its extortion and protection rackets into the slum areas , where police and other law enforcers stayed away .
small shopkeepers and especially brewers of illicit slum liquor had to make daily protection pay-offs to mungiki to remain in business .
like so much else in kenya , the sldf 's grievances revolve around land .
they say their ancestral land has been dispossessed as other groups have settled into the fertile mount elgon region .
to some extent , the government 's war on the sldf has been less effective than it has been with mungiki because of political factors .
what sparked the mungiki-government war was when , earlier this year , some brave matatu operators grouped together to oppose a sudden hike in the daily levies mungiki members were demanding .
candidate clash the reaction of the gang struck terror everywhere .
scores of matatu operators who had stood their ground were murdered in especially gruesome circumstances .
sabaot land defence force emerged this year as a conventional militia based in western kenya recruits from the sabaot , part of the kalenjin tribe demanding return of ancestral land attacks police patrols this forced the police to intervene with full force , but it only widened the war as mungiki turned its attention to the government 's own agents .
a full-scale crackdown in the slums and other mungiki hideouts left the police with a clear victory , though sporadic killings by the gang are still intermittently being reported .
yet more perceptive observers , noting the rapid success in recruitment mungiki had been making among poor kikuyu youths , have sounded a warning that the real time bomb is the runaway unemployment , economic despair and social alienation the government has left to fester in the urban slums and the over-crowded villages of central province .
over time , mungiki 's top honchos have gone through the motions of embracing born-again christianity , hence ostensibly eschewing their questionable past .
a man who was described as the sect 's " spiritual leader " announced his transformation from nairobi 's kamiti prison , where he is serving time .
and another who used to be the public face of the gang , ndura waruinge , is now a nairobi-based christian preacher .
but what is causing much more interest is the fact that he has declared that he will run for the langata parliamentary seat of raila odinga , the current government 's chief nemesis .
after his announcement he swung through the nairobi constituency and violent clashes broke out between the supporters of the two candidates .
for security personnel , the prospects are ominous .
a face-off of mungiki and odinga 's die-hard supporters who populate the huge kibera slum in langata is a recipe for real trouble .
gitau warigi is a columnist for the sunday nation newspaper in nairobi .

armed and with overt political agendas , they have a habit of surfacing when general elections are around the corner .
and two such groups have been a particular security headache of late .
one is a somewhat mysterious group from around mount elgon in western kenya calling itself the sabaot land defence force -lrb- sldf -rrb- .
the other , called mungiki , is considered more ominous because it has been drawing disaffected and poor youth from the dominant kikuyu ethnic group .
paramilitaries they are not , but they have been a security nightmare nonetheless .
the two gangs are quite different , but each has been targeting to kill government agents in their areas of operation .
senseless killings the sldf operates as a conventional militia , with an estimated strength of several hundred fighters .
its leaders are unknown , though there have been strong indicators that local politicians in the opposition-dominated area have been giving support to the militia .
mungiki emerged in the 1980s outlawed in 2002 recruits mainly from kikuyu tribe strongest in nairobi 's slums where it runs extortion rackets poses as a traditional religious sect accused of trying to destabilise government its style is quick-strike attacks at police patrols or government outposts .
meanwhile mungiki 's mission of destabilisation of what is essentially a kikuyu-led government is more perplexing , as it is itself exclusively kikuyu outfit .
mungiki likes to pose as a traditionalist religious sect , but at other times it comes across as a pure political gang for hire - until its descended into outright criminality through an orgy of seemingly senseless killings that drew the full wrath of the state .
mungiki is especially feared because of the macabre and secret oaths to which it subjects its initiates yet its quasi-religious posturing has since been exposed as a false cover for its true agenda : extortion .
the gang 's main target is the matatu minibuses which dominate public transport in the capital nairobi .
it has extended its extortion and protection rackets into the slum areas , where police and other law enforcers stayed away .
small shopkeepers and especially brewers of illicit slum liquor had to make daily protection pay-offs to mungiki to remain in business .
like so much else in kenya , the sldf 's grievances revolve around land .
they say their ancestral land has been dispossessed as other groups have settled into the fertile mount elgon region .
to some extent , the government 's war on the sldf has been less effective than it has been with mungiki because of political factors .
what sparked the mungiki-government war was when , earlier this year , some brave matatu operators grouped together to oppose a sudden hike in the daily levies mungiki members were demanding .
candidate clash the reaction of the gang struck terror everywhere .
scores of matatu operators who had stood their ground were murdered in especially gruesome circumstances .
sabaot land defence force emerged this year as a conventional militia based in western kenya recruits from the sabaot , part of the kalenjin tribe demanding return of ancestral land attacks police patrols this forced the police to intervene with full force , but it only widened the war as mungiki turned its attention to the government 's own agents .
a full-scale crackdown in the slums and other mungiki hideouts left the police with a clear victory , though sporadic killings by the gang are still intermittently being reported .
yet more perceptive observers , noting the rapid success in recruitment mungiki had been making among poor kikuyu youths , have sounded a warning that the real time bomb is the runaway unemployment , economic despair and social alienation the government has left to fester in the urban slums and the over-crowded villages of central province .

the new details of iraq 's demands were outlined in an official report issued on monday in arabic and subsequently translated by international news agencies .
blackwater denies its men acted improperly , while washington , which depends on the company to protect its embassy staff in baghdad , has declined to comment on the iraqi report .
possible trial the report says in the time since blackwater took over security for us diplomats in 2003 , its guards have killed 38 iraqi civilians and wounded about 50 in shootings .
