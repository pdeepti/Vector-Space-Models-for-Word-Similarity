dw-world.de 's readers wrote in this week with their opinions on the pros and cons of globalization and their expectations for this week 's g8 summit . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i am from africa , looking at the g8 summit from a tiny window and with an empty stomach .
in a sense , i am saying that we in africa believe strongly that we are not part of the equation .
authorities are busy looting the scarce resources meant for the provision of shelter , water , and education for the masses .
many african leaders maintain bank accounts in the so-called advanced or first world countries .
the g8 countries over-subsidies food items to africa so that african peasant farmers can not break even by tilling the soil .
they also turn africa into a dumping ground for their inferior products and phased-out consumer items .
while africa remains poor , depending on hand-outs to prevent hiv / aids , bird flu , family control , but not much is being done in areas of malaria control , infant mortality , education , and job creation .
g8 or no g8 , africa - and , indeed , black africa - will remain poor . - alhassan jaoji , nigeria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa will stay poor , wrote one reader i am all for globalization bringing the far-flung countries closer to talk to each other about the economy , world debts for poor countries , trade talks , and climate change .
opposition to globalization is not only selfish , but is short-sighted and harmful to maintaining harmony with one another and harmony with the planet earth . - bernard , australia it is my fervent hope that europe will assume a greater leadership role at the g8 meeting rather than falling prey to arguments of and between the us and russia .
may the force be with europe ! - peter peters , thailand a global economy only works if we have global rules .
the agricultural sector is a good example where developed countries pay high subsidies and then they export their goods to underdeveloped ones , who of course can not compete . - heinz schwabe , germany globalization and the g8 have been rendered totally pointless because they do not serve to rein in a madman like george bush .
good grief , if the other seven members of this group of eight ca n't tell that this man does n't play with a full deck , they must be blind in one eye and not see out of the other .
while germany should n't even have invited bush , it even removes demonstrators who recognize a madman when they see one - unlike merkel , blair , and sarkozy . - an mongere , usa germans need to realize that rioting is becoming a national sport in germany , just as football hooliganism is to the british .
germans ' love of practicing politics " en masse " has evolved into an excuse for violence .
when the police are the ones who are getting hurt , this sad imbalance only encourages the more violent elements of society the next time around .
and what difference does it make if some clown hands a policemen a flower , if others with black masks on their face go on a violent rampage ?
even in a violent and somewhat hazardous country like america , neither the public nor the law enforcement community would tolerate this kind of nonsense . - paul falk , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioting has become a national sport in germany , opined a reader criminals who use protests as an excuse to commit violence should be locked up and made to repair the damage they cause .
as a public safety officer , my sympathies go out to all police and firemen who are under attack by the criminal element there .
my heart goes out to all the law-abiding citizens who have their peaceful lives disrupted in this manner . - john langenford , usa i would have never expected such numbers and such violence .
i am for freedom of speech but not for organized violence .
yesterday i saw on the internet how young people prepared for the demonstration .
picking up cobblestones to be thrown at the police is creating chaos , not change ; it backfires and does not help the poor .
service , generosity , respect , are means for a better world .
seeing what happens in organized germany makes me have a little understanding for putin , who forbids some such demonstrations . - elisabeth heptner , usa why are they talking about africa ?
you ca n't solve any problems there .
africa is n't in the g8 .
it should only be about g8 countries .
immigration should be first .
if the g8 encouraged high birth rates we would n't need immigrants .
the g8 creates more problems for itself and then wonders how it can solve them all . - john , usa no one can stop globalization , but we must take care to protect the poor who are suffering more in global competition .
there are good as well as bad effects of globalization .
we must reduce the bad effects and increase the good effects and for that purpose there must be watch dog - wise people who constantly the behavior of multinational corporations in balance . - ramesh raghuvanshi , india the leaders of the g8 will not hear nor do they care to hear from protestors or dissenters of any kind from anywhere . - william sarpas , usa please consider the sentiments of the protestors . - philip lau , singapore we can use taxation as a way to help people who are affected in a negative way .
we could take from energy taxes to retain displaced workers , or fund tax credits to the poor with the increased cost of bio-fuels or other forms of clean energy .
this is being talked about in the us . - lee davis , oregon , usa the major issue is environment . - karuna kanta pal , india the g8 nations must not be scared of nations like india and china and start to cut all power generation supplies from fossil fuel generation .
oil and gas reserves need to be used at a slower rate to sustain what we have left and bio-fuels need to be encouraged by the g8 nations .
and third world agricultural nations need to start growing the sugar cane , olives , canola , corn and harvest timber with the aid money supplied to them and not buy weapons or line their greedy pockets with the money .
if they want aid money they must have an administrator from the g8 nations managing the money being used for the production of renewable energy resources .

as if to emphasize that whatever had gone before had just been a dry run for the main event , the police made their own statement to that effect .
the day started with what could only be described as widespread lockdown of infrastructure and ended with a heavy-handed clampdown on the opposition .
the arrival of the g8 heads had been a red letter day in the protestors ' diary from the very beginning .
even though their main target , us president george bush , had attempted to avoid the predicted mass picketing of laage airport by arriving a day earlier , there were still seven other leaders to vent anger against .
for the past few days , the issues had been the motivation to protest .
now the people responsible for those issues were coming and a predicted 8,000 to 10,000 demonstrators were ready to give them a welcome they would never forget .
police outnumber protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators on their way to the airport the police had other plans .
from the early morning , it was evident that the " two police officers for every protestor " rumor was no longer in dispute .
the massed ranks of heavily armored officers stationed on roads , bridges and railway tracks were sending out a visible message : you shall not pass .
the 16,000 regular police and 2,000 special officers drafted in for the summit were being used to full effect .
with the first arrival due to land at laage at 10 a.m. , hundreds of protestors streamed out of the rostock fischereihafen camp towards their own private vehicles and the specially organized buses waiting to take them the few kilometers to the airport while the morning was still in its infancy .
some of them did n't even make it out of the camp car park .
preventing protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police made it clear that demonstrators would not get past them the first full bus was ready to depart when it was surrounded by police wagons .
officers ordered the passengers out of the bus and the vehicle was slowly searched while bags and pockets were emptied on demand .
another bus arrived and was immediately impounded , its human cargo forced to get comfortable on the grass verge .
for how long , it is hard to say .
many never made it out of rostock .
there were alternative routes , however .
but security had not been the only reason why laage had been chosen as the arrival point .
it is horrendously difficult to get to by public transport and even more so when the roads and train tracks are closed down .
buses carrying protestors were stopped kilometers from the airport , unloaded and the passengers allowed to continue to a specified containment point away from laage on foot .
and these were the lucky ones .
mysteriously coincidental train malfunctions paralyzed the rail system just after rush hour leaving many protestors stranded and angry .
this would later contribute to frustration and violence .
few get through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers redirected protestors those who had set out just in time to avoid the main lockdown of the transport system around laage were met at the containment points by rows of riot police .
the plan had been to picket the airport at four main sites around its perimeter .
with numbers expected in the region of 8,000 demonstrators , it had been planned that around 2,000 would go to each .
the road blocks and train cancellations had contributed to a massive decimation of those numbers .
the few hundred which had gathered at the mouth of the airport 's service road milled around in front of the police , some muttering nervously about the prevalence of unit 23 , the hardest and most uncompromising officers bandied together from various forces to create an elite division .
various attempts to begin the demonstration were stopped by senior police officers .
there would be protests allowed , but only 50 people at a time would be let through the cordons to demonstrate at the airport 's gates .
from an expected crowd of 2,000 , as few as 37 protestors eventually made it to the gate .
once there , over 70 police officers blocked the entrance and forced the small group of protestors onto a grass verge opposite and held them there for an hour .
deflated demonstrators meanwhile , reports were phoned in to the group leader from an associate at bad doberan about a major incident involving over a thousand protestors who had been denied the chance to travel to laage and a large contingent of riot police .
according to the source in bad doberan , clashes had escalated quickly and tear gas and water cannons were being used to quell the unrest .
there was even an unsubstantiated report that a badly injured protestor had been denied medical assistance by police officers .
the mood of those at laage was already deflated before hearing this .
the planned blockade and show of strength had been turned into a pathetic joke by a well-coordinated and ruthless police operation .
by denying access to thousands and controlling to the footstep the movements of those which did make it to the boundaries of the airport , the police effectively removed all opposition at the point of entry for the g8 leaders .
and in bad doberan , they showed that they had learned the mistakes of the weekend where sheer numbers could not make up for the lack of preparation in dealing with a rioting mob .
on wednesday , the police struck hard and fast to end the unrest .
they more than made up for their shortcomings on previous unruly days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.06.2007 european central bank raises rate to block inflation risks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank in frankfurt the european central bank raised its key interest rate by a quarter point to 4.0 percent wednesday and hinted that further hikes could come to tame inflation in a dynamic euro-zone economy . in the eighth increase in 18 months matching the vigor euro-zone growth , the european central bank lifted its benchmark refinancing rate by a quarter of a point to 4 percent , the highest reading for five and a half years .
ecb president jean-claude trichet said the bank 's monetary policy remained on " the accommodative side , " adding that wednesday 's move was to counter inflationary risks expected to ease in the near term before rising significantly later in the year .
wages were rising faster than the bank had expected , he said .
the bank revised upwards its 2007 inflation forecast in the 13-nation euro zone to 2 percent from 1.8 percent previously but held its prediction for next year at 2 percent , roughly consistent with its preferred level .
the bank has set itself an upper target limit for inflation of 2 percent because experience has shown that beyond this level , people anticipate price rises , thereby adding to inflationary pressures .
" still accommodative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euros on the move " after today 's increase , given the positive economic environment in the euro area , our monetary policy is still on the accommodative side , with overall financing conditions favorable , money and credit growth vigorous , and liquidity in the euro area ample , " trichet told a news conference .
a reference to an " accommodative " stance is seen as a signal that more rate rises could be approved in coming months but not necessarily at the next meeting of the bank 's policy-making body .
trichet said the bank was making no pre-commitment on future rate moves but also stressed that it would do whatever was needed to control inflation .
" the -lrb- ecb 's -rrb- governing council will monitor closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialize , " he said .
raised euro zone growth forecast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president trichet the bank also wednesday raised its euro-zone growth forecast for this year to 2.6 percent from 2.5 percent and lowered its prediction for 2008 to 2.3 percent from 2.4 percent .
in london , the euro which had firmed before the decision , weakened on trichet 's comments on future rate policy that were seen as vague by traders .
the single european currency was changing hands at $ 1.3501 against $ 1.3519 late tuesday in new york .
prior to the announcement many market analysts were predicting a further tightening to 4.25 percent when the bank policymakers convene in september .
" a growing number of investors are even speculating about an increase to 4.5 percent , " said commerzbank treasurer ryohei muramatsu in tokyo .
the head of the german central bank , axel weber , who sits on the ecb 's governing council , left no doubt in a recent interview that further rate rises were likely .
" the current cycle of interest rate hikes has not reached its end , " he told the financial times .
" what is pretty clear is that we are in a stronger than previously expected recovery , " he said .
" if necessary we will also have to move into a territory that is portrayed as being restrictive , if that is needed to control inflation . "
perhaps unsettling for some although widely expected , the latest increase by the ecb was likely to unsettle political figures in several euro-zone members , notably france , who contend that the bank 's monetary policies are driving up the euro and dampening growth .
while interest rates in the 13-nation euro zone have been on the rise for the past year and a half , they have stagnated in the united states , where the benchmark federal funds rate has been at 5.25 percent since last june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the eigth interest rate increase in 18 months that differential has made the euro more attractive to investors , increasing its value and thereby - in principle - threatening the competitiveness of euro-zone exports and ultimately growth .
the differential reflects sharply different growth trends in europe and the united states .
" the euro area economy is moving from recovery to upswing , " the international monetary fund said in a report on tuesday , which foresaw euro-zone growth of 2.5 percent this year as well as sustained momentum in 2008 .
the european union 's executive commission predicts a pace of 2.6 percent this year , while the oecd in paris sees euro-zone expansion of 2.7 percent .
could eclipse us at those rates the euro zone would eclipse both the united states , where the imf is forecasting momentum of just 2.2 percent , and japan , 2.3 percent .
taking note of euro-zone growth and inflation prospects , the imf said on tuesday that higher interest ecb rates would be warranted .
meanwhile , in the united states , investors have reduced their expectations that the federal reserve , the central bank , will need to cut rates in response to a slowdown in the world 's largest economy .
the fed is also focused on fighting potential inflationary pressures amid surging fuel prices .
and on tuesday , fed chairman ben bernanke , who foresaw an improvement in the us economy in the coming months , said that " although core inflation seems likely to moderate gradually over time , the risks to this forecast remain to the upside .

ecb president jean-claude trichet said the bank 's monetary policy remained on " the accommodative side , " adding that wednesday 's move was to counter inflationary risks expected to ease in the near term before rising significantly later in the year .
wages were rising faster than the bank had expected , he said .
the bank revised upwards its 2007 inflation forecast in the 13-nation euro zone to 2 percent from 1.8 percent previously but held its prediction for next year at 2 percent , roughly consistent with its preferred level .
the bank has set itself an upper target limit for inflation of 2 percent because experience has shown that beyond this level , people anticipate price rises , thereby adding to inflationary pressures .
" still accommodative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euros on the move " after today 's increase , given the positive economic environment in the euro area , our monetary policy is still on the accommodative side , with overall financing conditions favorable , money and credit growth vigorous , and liquidity in the euro area ample , " trichet told a news conference .
a reference to an " accommodative " stance is seen as a signal that more rate rises could be approved in coming months but not necessarily at the next meeting of the bank 's policy-making body .
trichet said the bank was making no pre-commitment on future rate moves but also stressed that it would do whatever was needed to control inflation .
" the -lrb- ecb 's -rrb- governing council will monitor closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialize , " he said .
raised euro zone growth forecast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president trichet the bank also wednesday raised its euro-zone growth forecast for this year to 2.6 percent from 2.5 percent and lowered its prediction for 2008 to 2.3 percent from 2.4 percent .
in london , the euro which had firmed before the decision , weakened on trichet 's comments on future rate policy that were seen as vague by traders .
the single european currency was changing hands at $ 1.3501 against $ 1.3519 late tuesday in new york .
prior to the announcement many market analysts were predicting a further tightening to 4.25 percent when the bank policymakers convene in september .
" a growing number of investors are even speculating about an increase to 4.5 percent , " said commerzbank treasurer ryohei muramatsu in tokyo .
the head of the german central bank , axel weber , who sits on the ecb 's governing council , left no doubt in a recent interview that further rate rises were likely .
" the current cycle of interest rate hikes has not reached its end , " he told the financial times .
" what is pretty clear is that we are in a stronger than previously expected recovery , " he said .
" if necessary we will also have to move into a territory that is portrayed as being restrictive , if that is needed to control inflation . "
perhaps unsettling for some although widely expected , the latest increase by the ecb was likely to unsettle political figures in several euro-zone members , notably france , who contend that the bank 's monetary policies are driving up the euro and dampening growth .
while interest rates in the 13-nation euro zone have been on the rise for the past year and a half , they have stagnated in the united states , where the benchmark federal funds rate has been at 5.25 percent since last june .

the differential reflects sharply different growth trends in europe and the united states .
" the euro area economy is moving from recovery to upswing , " the international monetary fund said in a report on tuesday , which foresaw euro-zone growth of 2.5 percent this year as well as sustained momentum in 2008 .
the european union 's executive commission predicts a pace of 2.6 percent this year , while the oecd in paris sees euro-zone expansion of 2.7 percent .

meanwhile , in the united states , investors have reduced their expectations that the federal reserve , the central bank , will need to cut rates in response to a slowdown in the world 's largest economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 06.06.2007 readers weigh in on g8 and globalization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is globalization good or bad - or both ?
dw-world.de 's readers wrote in this week with their opinions on the pros and cons of globalization and their expectations for this week 's g8 summit . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i am from africa , looking at the g8 summit from a tiny window and with an empty stomach .
in a sense , i am saying that we in africa believe strongly that we are not part of the equation .
authorities are busy looting the scarce resources meant for the provision of shelter , water , and education for the masses .
many african leaders maintain bank accounts in the so-called advanced or first world countries .
the g8 countries over-subsidies food items to africa so that african peasant farmers can not break even by tilling the soil .
they also turn africa into a dumping ground for their inferior products and phased-out consumer items .
while africa remains poor , depending on hand-outs to prevent hiv / aids , bird flu , family control , but not much is being done in areas of malaria control , infant mortality , education , and job creation .
g8 or no g8 , africa - and , indeed , black africa - will remain poor . - alhassan jaoji , nigeria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa will stay poor , wrote one reader i am all for globalization bringing the far-flung countries closer to talk to each other about the economy , world debts for poor countries , trade talks , and climate change .
opposition to globalization is not only selfish , but is short-sighted and harmful to maintaining harmony with one another and harmony with the planet earth . - bernard , australia it is my fervent hope that europe will assume a greater leadership role at the g8 meeting rather than falling prey to arguments of and between the us and russia .
may the force be with europe ! - peter peters , thailand a global economy only works if we have global rules .
the agricultural sector is a good example where developed countries pay high subsidies and then they export their goods to underdeveloped ones , who of course can not compete . - heinz schwabe , germany globalization and the g8 have been rendered totally pointless because they do not serve to rein in a madman like george bush .
good grief , if the other seven members of this group of eight ca n't tell that this man does n't play with a full deck , they must be blind in one eye and not see out of the other .
while germany should n't even have invited bush , it even removes demonstrators who recognize a madman when they see one - unlike merkel , blair , and sarkozy . - an mongere , usa germans need to realize that rioting is becoming a national sport in germany , just as football hooliganism is to the british .
germans ' love of practicing politics " en masse " has evolved into an excuse for violence .
when the police are the ones who are getting hurt , this sad imbalance only encourages the more violent elements of society the next time around .
and what difference does it make if some clown hands a policemen a flower , if others with black masks on their face go on a violent rampage ?
even in a violent and somewhat hazardous country like america , neither the public nor the law enforcement community would tolerate this kind of nonsense . - paul falk , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioting has become a national sport in germany , opined a reader criminals who use protests as an excuse to commit violence should be locked up and made to repair the damage they cause .
as a public safety officer , my sympathies go out to all police and firemen who are under attack by the criminal element there .
my heart goes out to all the law-abiding citizens who have their peaceful lives disrupted in this manner . - john langenford , usa i would have never expected such numbers and such violence .
i am for freedom of speech but not for organized violence .
yesterday i saw on the internet how young people prepared for the demonstration .
picking up cobblestones to be thrown at the police is creating chaos , not change ; it backfires and does not help the poor .
service , generosity , respect , are means for a better world .
seeing what happens in organized germany makes me have a little understanding for putin , who forbids some such demonstrations . - elisabeth heptner , usa why are they talking about africa ?
you ca n't solve any problems there .
africa is n't in the g8 .
it should only be about g8 countries .
immigration should be first .
if the g8 encouraged high birth rates we would n't need immigrants .
the g8 creates more problems for itself and then wonders how it can solve them all . - john , usa no one can stop globalization , but we must take care to protect the poor who are suffering more in global competition .
there are good as well as bad effects of globalization .
we must reduce the bad effects and increase the good effects and for that purpose there must be watch dog - wise people who constantly the behavior of multinational corporations in balance . - ramesh raghuvanshi , india the leaders of the g8 will not hear nor do they care to hear from protestors or dissenters of any kind from anywhere . - william sarpas , usa please consider the sentiments of the protestors . - philip lau , singapore we can use taxation as a way to help people who are affected in a negative way .
we could take from energy taxes to retain displaced workers , or fund tax credits to the poor with the increased cost of bio-fuels or other forms of clean energy .
this is being talked about in the us . - lee davis , oregon , usa the major issue is environment . - karuna kanta pal , india the g8 nations must not be scared of nations like india and china and start to cut all power generation supplies from fossil fuel generation .
oil and gas reserves need to be used at a slower rate to sustain what we have left and bio-fuels need to be encouraged by the g8 nations .

dw-world.de 's readers wrote in this week with their opinions on the pros and cons of globalization and their expectations for this week 's g8 summit . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i am from africa , looking at the g8 summit from a tiny window and with an empty stomach .
in a sense , i am saying that we in africa believe strongly that we are not part of the equation .
authorities are busy looting the scarce resources meant for the provision of shelter , water , and education for the masses .
many african leaders maintain bank accounts in the so-called advanced or first world countries .
the g8 countries over-subsidies food items to africa so that african peasant farmers can not break even by tilling the soil .
they also turn africa into a dumping ground for their inferior products and phased-out consumer items .
while africa remains poor , depending on hand-outs to prevent hiv / aids , bird flu , family control , but not much is being done in areas of malaria control , infant mortality , education , and job creation .
g8 or no g8 , africa - and , indeed , black africa - will remain poor . - alhassan jaoji , nigeria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa will stay poor , wrote one reader i am all for globalization bringing the far-flung countries closer to talk to each other about the economy , world debts for poor countries , trade talks , and climate change .
opposition to globalization is not only selfish , but is short-sighted and harmful to maintaining harmony with one another and harmony with the planet earth . - bernard , australia it is my fervent hope that europe will assume a greater leadership role at the g8 meeting rather than falling prey to arguments of and between the us and russia .
may the force be with europe ! - peter peters , thailand a global economy only works if we have global rules .
the agricultural sector is a good example where developed countries pay high subsidies and then they export their goods to underdeveloped ones , who of course can not compete . - heinz schwabe , germany globalization and the g8 have been rendered totally pointless because they do not serve to rein in a madman like george bush .
good grief , if the other seven members of this group of eight ca n't tell that this man does n't play with a full deck , they must be blind in one eye and not see out of the other .
while germany should n't even have invited bush , it even removes demonstrators who recognize a madman when they see one - unlike merkel , blair , and sarkozy . - an mongere , usa germans need to realize that rioting is becoming a national sport in germany , just as football hooliganism is to the british .
germans ' love of practicing politics " en masse " has evolved into an excuse for violence .
when the police are the ones who are getting hurt , this sad imbalance only encourages the more violent elements of society the next time around .
and what difference does it make if some clown hands a policemen a flower , if others with black masks on their face go on a violent rampage ?
even in a violent and somewhat hazardous country like america , neither the public nor the law enforcement community would tolerate this kind of nonsense . - paul falk , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioting has become a national sport in germany , opined a reader criminals who use protests as an excuse to commit violence should be locked up and made to repair the damage they cause .

i am for freedom of speech but not for organized violence .
yesterday i saw on the internet how young people prepared for the demonstration .
picking up cobblestones to be thrown at the police is creating chaos , not change ; it backfires and does not help the poor .
service , generosity , respect , are means for a better world .
seeing what happens in organized germany makes me have a little understanding for putin , who forbids some such demonstrations . - elisabeth heptner , usa why are they talking about africa ?
you ca n't solve any problems there .
africa is n't in the g8 .
it should only be about g8 countries .
immigration should be first .
if the g8 encouraged high birth rates we would n't need immigrants .
the g8 creates more problems for itself and then wonders how it can solve them all . - john , usa no one can stop globalization , but we must take care to protect the poor who are suffering more in global competition .
there are good as well as bad effects of globalization .
we must reduce the bad effects and increase the good effects and for that purpose there must be watch dog - wise people who constantly the behavior of multinational corporations in balance . - ramesh raghuvanshi , india the leaders of the g8 will not hear nor do they care to hear from protestors or dissenters of any kind from anywhere . - william sarpas , usa please consider the sentiments of the protestors . - philip lau , singapore we can use taxation as a way to help people who are affected in a negative way .

dw-world.de 's readers wrote in this week with their opinions on the pros and cons of globalization and their expectations for this week 's g8 summit . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i am from africa , looking at the g8 summit from a tiny window and with an empty stomach .
in a sense , i am saying that we in africa believe strongly that we are not part of the equation .
authorities are busy looting the scarce resources meant for the provision of shelter , water , and education for the masses .
many african leaders maintain bank accounts in the so-called advanced or first world countries .
the g8 countries over-subsidies food items to africa so that african peasant farmers can not break even by tilling the soil .
they also turn africa into a dumping ground for their inferior products and phased-out consumer items .
while africa remains poor , depending on hand-outs to prevent hiv / aids , bird flu , family control , but not much is being done in areas of malaria control , infant mortality , education , and job creation .
g8 or no g8 , africa - and , indeed , black africa - will remain poor . - alhassan jaoji , nigeria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa will stay poor , wrote one reader i am all for globalization bringing the far-flung countries closer to talk to each other about the economy , world debts for poor countries , trade talks , and climate change .
opposition to globalization is not only selfish , but is short-sighted and harmful to maintaining harmony with one another and harmony with the planet earth . - bernard , australia it is my fervent hope that europe will assume a greater leadership role at the g8 meeting rather than falling prey to arguments of and between the us and russia .
may the force be with europe ! - peter peters , thailand a global economy only works if we have global rules .
the agricultural sector is a good example where developed countries pay high subsidies and then they export their goods to underdeveloped ones , who of course can not compete . - heinz schwabe , germany globalization and the g8 have been rendered totally pointless because they do not serve to rein in a madman like george bush .
good grief , if the other seven members of this group of eight ca n't tell that this man does n't play with a full deck , they must be blind in one eye and not see out of the other .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 06.06.2007 emerging nations visit the " rich country club " - the g8 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the five g8 guest countries met in march in preparation for this year 's summit brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa will join the leading industrial nations at the g8 summit .
according to a recent study , it 's doubtful that membership in the " club " will help the poor in these countries . without the five emerging guest nations , the g8 summit 's motto " growth and responsibility " couldn ’ t be implemented , said german chancellor angela merkel recently .
indeed , all five of them exhibited healthy growth in their gross domestic products in 2006 : china and india topped the group with 10.7 and 9.2 percent respectively , while south africa -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- , brazil -lrb- 4.4 percent -rrb- and mexico -lrb- 3.5 percent -rrb- came in strong .
according to the german office for foreign trade -lrb- bfai -rrb- in cologne , the upward trend is expected to continue in 2007 and 2008 .
economic growth encourages confidence on the international political playing field .
they have already become key players in the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and in climate debates , for example .
their businesses are expanding worldwide and representatives from these emerging nations are already questioning the legitimacy of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
in addition , brazil , india and south africa are aspiring to obtain a permanent seat in the united nations security council .
g20 represents world majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of emerging countries in political bodies wo n't affect poverty , say some experts in the wto , the " big five " belong to the so-called g20 , a group of emerging and developing nations that was founded in cancun , mexico in 2003 and represents two-thirds of the world 's population .
however , in international economic negotiations , the big five sometimes give the impression that they are already playing in a league of their own .
" the economic upturn of china , india , brazil and south africa does n't necessarily lead to a poverty-oriented global economic policy , " concluded a study by the aid organizations bread for the world and südwind institute , which is to be presented wednesday at the alternative summit in rostock .
" economic growth alone does n't help the poorest of the poor . "
the gap between rich and poor is growing even wider , particularly in brazil , mexico , india and south africa .
in the run-up to this year 's summit , there was talk of expanding the g8 - which currently represents only 13 percent of the world population - to the g13 .
however , this could weaken the position of the world 's poor , say experts .
the poor still lose out " the dominance of the wealthy industrialized countries in the world trade organization and the international monetary fund would be reduced , but the interests of poor people in emerging nations and the least-developed nations would still be pushed onto the back burner in the world trade system , " said reinhard koppe , development policy expert at bread for the world .
furthermore , the study reveals how power relationships have shifted over the past few years through the offensive economic policies of four of the largest emerging nations - china , india , brazil and south africa .
" all four states have become world powers in many sectors , not just in their regions but worldwide , " said koppe .
the study 's author friedel hütz-adams said that " established industrialized nations are no longer in a position to assert their own interests without making major compromises - both in the wto and in bilateral and regional treaties . "
strategies on the political front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 represents two thirds of the world 's population according to the study , brazil 's discourse within the wto focuses on close cooperation with the g20 countries and the nama 11 group -lrb- argentina , brazil , egypt , india , indonesia , namibia , philippines , south africa , tunisia and venezuela -rrb- , while making deals of its own behind the scenes . " the government in brazil is getting involved in the non-transparent structures of the wto by agreeing , together with india , to talks with the us , the eu and japan , " said the study .
china , which like brazil has only signed a handful of bilateral open-trade treaties , continues to focus on the wto negotiations and is prepared to support the positions of other emerging and developing countries .
conflict of interest is standing in the way , however , said hütz-adams .
in addition , china 's engagement in africa is now being seen as a threat by governments and companies from industrialized countries , added the author .
india sees itself as a spokesperson for developing countries on the international playing field , which could soon change .
hütz-adams sees the willingness of the indian government to join brazil in informal trade talks with the us , the eu and japan as a warning sign .
" no on knows whether india will stay connected with the goals of the g20 and g33 in the world trade organization negotiations , " he said .
the country has increasingly been distinguishing itself as an economic power and seems to be going its own way .
mexico continues to be an emerging country but , at the same time , is a member of oecd .
of the five " guest " nations at the g8 summit , its economy has opened up the most since the 1990s .
it maintains 13 free trade agreements with 42 other countries , including one with nafta since 1994 and with the eu since 2000 .
last year , the mexican government reduced customs duties on merchandise with 148 wto member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment has been a sticky issue with some major emerging nations like china after mexico joined nafta , cheap corn from the us flooded the mexican market and led to protests by farmers .
since mexico had increased the use of corn in ethanol production , it became scarce .
" that 's why there were tortilla rebellions and the country was noncommittal during the wto agricultural negotiations , " said hütz-adams .
what 's more , economic expansion in china and india is putting competitive pressure on mexico and brazil .
more influence for smaller countries the study named other differences between the major emerging countries as well .
brazil and south africa support a fundamental voting reform in the international monetary fund and the world bank that would give small countries more say .
india and china , on the other hand , want to enhance their own positions in both institutions .
it remains to be seen whether india and china will agree to the united states ' new climate initiative .
" that would require a parallel structure to the un where the small states would n't have any say anymore , " said hütz-adams .

according to a recent study , it 's doubtful that membership in the " club " will help the poor in these countries . without the five emerging guest nations , the g8 summit 's motto " growth and responsibility " couldn ’ t be implemented , said german chancellor angela merkel recently .
indeed , all five of them exhibited healthy growth in their gross domestic products in 2006 : china and india topped the group with 10.7 and 9.2 percent respectively , while south africa -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- , brazil -lrb- 4.4 percent -rrb- and mexico -lrb- 3.5 percent -rrb- came in strong .
according to the german office for foreign trade -lrb- bfai -rrb- in cologne , the upward trend is expected to continue in 2007 and 2008 .
economic growth encourages confidence on the international political playing field .
they have already become key players in the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and in climate debates , for example .
their businesses are expanding worldwide and representatives from these emerging nations are already questioning the legitimacy of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
in addition , brazil , india and south africa are aspiring to obtain a permanent seat in the united nations security council .
g20 represents world majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of emerging countries in political bodies wo n't affect poverty , say some experts in the wto , the " big five " belong to the so-called g20 , a group of emerging and developing nations that was founded in cancun , mexico in 2003 and represents two-thirds of the world 's population .
however , in international economic negotiations , the big five sometimes give the impression that they are already playing in a league of their own .
" the economic upturn of china , india , brazil and south africa does n't necessarily lead to a poverty-oriented global economic policy , " concluded a study by the aid organizations bread for the world and südwind institute , which is to be presented wednesday at the alternative summit in rostock .
" economic growth alone does n't help the poorest of the poor . "
the gap between rich and poor is growing even wider , particularly in brazil , mexico , india and south africa .
in the run-up to this year 's summit , there was talk of expanding the g8 - which currently represents only 13 percent of the world population - to the g13 .
however , this could weaken the position of the world 's poor , say experts .
the poor still lose out " the dominance of the wealthy industrialized countries in the world trade organization and the international monetary fund would be reduced , but the interests of poor people in emerging nations and the least-developed nations would still be pushed onto the back burner in the world trade system , " said reinhard koppe , development policy expert at bread for the world .
furthermore , the study reveals how power relationships have shifted over the past few years through the offensive economic policies of four of the largest emerging nations - china , india , brazil and south africa .
" all four states have become world powers in many sectors , not just in their regions but worldwide , " said koppe .
the study 's author friedel hütz-adams said that " established industrialized nations are no longer in a position to assert their own interests without making major compromises - both in the wto and in bilateral and regional treaties . "
strategies on the political front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 represents two thirds of the world 's population according to the study , brazil 's discourse within the wto focuses on close cooperation with the g20 countries and the nama 11 group -lrb- argentina , brazil , egypt , india , indonesia , namibia , philippines , south africa , tunisia and venezuela -rrb- , while making deals of its own behind the scenes . " the government in brazil is getting involved in the non-transparent structures of the wto by agreeing , together with india , to talks with the us , the eu and japan , " said the study .
china , which like brazil has only signed a handful of bilateral open-trade treaties , continues to focus on the wto negotiations and is prepared to support the positions of other emerging and developing countries .
conflict of interest is standing in the way , however , said hütz-adams .
in addition , china 's engagement in africa is now being seen as a threat by governments and companies from industrialized countries , added the author .
india sees itself as a spokesperson for developing countries on the international playing field , which could soon change .
hütz-adams sees the willingness of the indian government to join brazil in informal trade talks with the us , the eu and japan as a warning sign .
" no on knows whether india will stay connected with the goals of the g20 and g33 in the world trade organization negotiations , " he said .
the country has increasingly been distinguishing itself as an economic power and seems to be going its own way .
mexico continues to be an emerging country but , at the same time , is a member of oecd .
of the five " guest " nations at the g8 summit , its economy has opened up the most since the 1990s .
it maintains 13 free trade agreements with 42 other countries , including one with nafta since 1994 and with the eu since 2000 .
last year , the mexican government reduced customs duties on merchandise with 148 wto member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment has been a sticky issue with some major emerging nations like china after mexico joined nafta , cheap corn from the us flooded the mexican market and led to protests by farmers .
since mexico had increased the use of corn in ethanol production , it became scarce .
" that 's why there were tortilla rebellions and the country was noncommittal during the wto agricultural negotiations , " said hütz-adams .
what 's more , economic expansion in china and india is putting competitive pressure on mexico and brazil .
more influence for smaller countries the study named other differences between the major emerging countries as well .
brazil and south africa support a fundamental voting reform in the international monetary fund and the world bank that would give small countries more say .
india and china , on the other hand , want to enhance their own positions in both institutions .
it remains to be seen whether india and china will agree to the united states ' new climate initiative .
" that would require a parallel structure to the un where the small states would n't have any say anymore , " said hütz-adams .

according to a recent study , it 's doubtful that membership in the " club " will help the poor in these countries . without the five emerging guest nations , the g8 summit 's motto " growth and responsibility " couldn ’ t be implemented , said german chancellor angela merkel recently .
indeed , all five of them exhibited healthy growth in their gross domestic products in 2006 : china and india topped the group with 10.7 and 9.2 percent respectively , while south africa -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- , brazil -lrb- 4.4 percent -rrb- and mexico -lrb- 3.5 percent -rrb- came in strong .
according to the german office for foreign trade -lrb- bfai -rrb- in cologne , the upward trend is expected to continue in 2007 and 2008 .
economic growth encourages confidence on the international political playing field .
they have already become key players in the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and in climate debates , for example .
their businesses are expanding worldwide and representatives from these emerging nations are already questioning the legitimacy of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
in addition , brazil , india and south africa are aspiring to obtain a permanent seat in the united nations security council .
g20 represents world majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of emerging countries in political bodies wo n't affect poverty , say some experts in the wto , the " big five " belong to the so-called g20 , a group of emerging and developing nations that was founded in cancun , mexico in 2003 and represents two-thirds of the world 's population .
however , in international economic negotiations , the big five sometimes give the impression that they are already playing in a league of their own .
" the economic upturn of china , india , brazil and south africa does n't necessarily lead to a poverty-oriented global economic policy , " concluded a study by the aid organizations bread for the world and südwind institute , which is to be presented wednesday at the alternative summit in rostock .
" economic growth alone does n't help the poorest of the poor . "
the gap between rich and poor is growing even wider , particularly in brazil , mexico , india and south africa .
in the run-up to this year 's summit , there was talk of expanding the g8 - which currently represents only 13 percent of the world population - to the g13 .
however , this could weaken the position of the world 's poor , say experts .
the poor still lose out " the dominance of the wealthy industrialized countries in the world trade organization and the international monetary fund would be reduced , but the interests of poor people in emerging nations and the least-developed nations would still be pushed onto the back burner in the world trade system , " said reinhard koppe , development policy expert at bread for the world .
furthermore , the study reveals how power relationships have shifted over the past few years through the offensive economic policies of four of the largest emerging nations - china , india , brazil and south africa .
" all four states have become world powers in many sectors , not just in their regions but worldwide , " said koppe .
the study 's author friedel hütz-adams said that " established industrialized nations are no longer in a position to assert their own interests without making major compromises - both in the wto and in bilateral and regional treaties . "
strategies on the political front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 represents two thirds of the world 's population according to the study , brazil 's discourse within the wto focuses on close cooperation with the g20 countries and the nama 11 group -lrb- argentina , brazil , egypt , india , indonesia , namibia , philippines , south africa , tunisia and venezuela -rrb- , while making deals of its own behind the scenes . " the government in brazil is getting involved in the non-transparent structures of the wto by agreeing , together with india , to talks with the us , the eu and japan , " said the study .
china , which like brazil has only signed a handful of bilateral open-trade treaties , continues to focus on the wto negotiations and is prepared to support the positions of other emerging and developing countries .
conflict of interest is standing in the way , however , said hütz-adams .
in addition , china 's engagement in africa is now being seen as a threat by governments and companies from industrialized countries , added the author .
india sees itself as a spokesperson for developing countries on the international playing field , which could soon change .
hütz-adams sees the willingness of the indian government to join brazil in informal trade talks with the us , the eu and japan as a warning sign .
" no on knows whether india will stay connected with the goals of the g20 and g33 in the world trade organization negotiations , " he said .
the country has increasingly been distinguishing itself as an economic power and seems to be going its own way .
mexico continues to be an emerging country but , at the same time , is a member of oecd .
of the five " guest " nations at the g8 summit , its economy has opened up the most since the 1990s .
it maintains 13 free trade agreements with 42 other countries , including one with nafta since 1994 and with the eu since 2000 .
last year , the mexican government reduced customs duties on merchandise with 148 wto member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment has been a sticky issue with some major emerging nations like china after mexico joined nafta , cheap corn from the us flooded the mexican market and led to protests by farmers .
since mexico had increased the use of corn in ethanol production , it became scarce .
" that 's why there were tortilla rebellions and the country was noncommittal during the wto agricultural negotiations , " said hütz-adams .
what 's more , economic expansion in china and india is putting competitive pressure on mexico and brazil .
more influence for smaller countries the study named other differences between the major emerging countries as well .
brazil and south africa support a fundamental voting reform in the international monetary fund and the world bank that would give small countries more say .
india and china , on the other hand , want to enhance their own positions in both institutions .
it remains to be seen whether india and china will agree to the united states ' new climate initiative .
" that would require a parallel structure to the un where the small states would n't have any say anymore , " said hütz-adams .

as if to emphasize that whatever had gone before had just been a dry run for the main event , the police made their own statement to that effect .
the day started with what could only be described as widespread lockdown of infrastructure and ended with a heavy-handed clampdown on the opposition .
the arrival of the g8 heads had been a red letter day in the protestors ' diary from the very beginning .
even though their main target , us president george bush , had attempted to avoid the predicted mass picketing of laage airport by arriving a day earlier , there were still seven other leaders to vent anger against .
for the past few days , the issues had been the motivation to protest .
now the people responsible for those issues were coming and a predicted 8,000 to 10,000 demonstrators were ready to give them a welcome they would never forget .
police outnumber protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators on their way to the airport the police had other plans .
from the early morning , it was evident that the " two police officers for every protestor " rumor was no longer in dispute .
the massed ranks of heavily armored officers stationed on roads , bridges and railway tracks were sending out a visible message : you shall not pass .
the 16,000 regular police and 2,000 special officers drafted in for the summit were being used to full effect .
with the first arrival due to land at laage at 10 a.m. , hundreds of protestors streamed out of the rostock fischereihafen camp towards their own private vehicles and the specially organized buses waiting to take them the few kilometers to the airport while the morning was still in its infancy .
some of them did n't even make it out of the camp car park .
preventing protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police made it clear that demonstrators would not get past them the first full bus was ready to depart when it was surrounded by police wagons .
officers ordered the passengers out of the bus and the vehicle was slowly searched while bags and pockets were emptied on demand .
another bus arrived and was immediately impounded , its human cargo forced to get comfortable on the grass verge .
for how long , it is hard to say .
many never made it out of rostock .
there were alternative routes , however .
but security had not been the only reason why laage had been chosen as the arrival point .
it is horrendously difficult to get to by public transport and even more so when the roads and train tracks are closed down .
buses carrying protestors were stopped kilometers from the airport , unloaded and the passengers allowed to continue to a specified containment point away from laage on foot .
and these were the lucky ones .
mysteriously coincidental train malfunctions paralyzed the rail system just after rush hour leaving many protestors stranded and angry .
this would later contribute to frustration and violence .
few get through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers redirected protestors those who had set out just in time to avoid the main lockdown of the transport system around laage were met at the containment points by rows of riot police .
the plan had been to picket the airport at four main sites around its perimeter .
with numbers expected in the region of 8,000 demonstrators , it had been planned that around 2,000 would go to each .
the road blocks and train cancellations had contributed to a massive decimation of those numbers .
the few hundred which had gathered at the mouth of the airport 's service road milled around in front of the police , some muttering nervously about the prevalence of unit 23 , the hardest and most uncompromising officers bandied together from various forces to create an elite division .
various attempts to begin the demonstration were stopped by senior police officers .
there would be protests allowed , but only 50 people at a time would be let through the cordons to demonstrate at the airport 's gates .
from an expected crowd of 2,000 , as few as 37 protestors eventually made it to the gate .
once there , over 70 police officers blocked the entrance and forced the small group of protestors onto a grass verge opposite and held them there for an hour .
deflated demonstrators meanwhile , reports were phoned in to the group leader from an associate at bad doberan about a major incident involving over a thousand protestors who had been denied the chance to travel to laage and a large contingent of riot police .
according to the source in bad doberan , clashes had escalated quickly and tear gas and water cannons were being used to quell the unrest .
there was even an unsubstantiated report that a badly injured protestor had been denied medical assistance by police officers .
the mood of those at laage was already deflated before hearing this .
the planned blockade and show of strength had been turned into a pathetic joke by a well-coordinated and ruthless police operation .
by denying access to thousands and controlling to the footstep the movements of those which did make it to the boundaries of the airport , the police effectively removed all opposition at the point of entry for the g8 leaders .
and in bad doberan , they showed that they had learned the mistakes of the weekend where sheer numbers could not make up for the lack of preparation in dealing with a rioting mob .
on wednesday , the police struck hard and fast to end the unrest .
they more than made up for their shortcomings on previous unruly days .
on wednesday , they could claim a victory .

sabina meller , an assistant in a local bakery in the seaside resort of heiligendamm , where the summit is being held , expected more of an impact .

" it 's the ones in black you have to watch out for . "
her son christian stands protectively beside her .

many shops were open over the weekend even though there was a marked reduction in the number of customers , perhaps a reflection of residents ' unwillingness to put themselves at potential risk .
rostock 's lively hub , the kröpeliner-tor-vorstadt -lrb- ktv -rrb- area of the city , was like a ghost town on sunday with bar and café staff twiddling their thumbs .
some even took the decision to close on monday , much to the satisfaction of those who were open for business .
" it was dead around here at the weekend , " says timo kastnic , a bar worker in the ktv .
" i 'd never seen it like that … ever .
but we still opened up monday and because the others were shut , we did a lot of business . "

according to the local ostsee zeitung newspaper , a number of parents are keeping their children at home during the summit .
one high school had a third of its 768 students stay home monday , although many returned on tuesday for classes .
will it spread ?
such disruption can be expected to spread beyond rostock as the summit proper gets underway on wednesday .
one of the seaside sanctuaries , warnemünde , has already had a taste of the slow creep of protests as around 10,000 demonstrators marched through the quaint port resort to the nearby military harbor on tuesday .
as the slow , winding carnival of the anti-militarization demonstration passed through the city , the pavements either side of the crowded street were full of curious bystanders .
a few , as if heeding a silent call of conscience , stepped off the curb and joined the flow , moved by the commitment of those involved or just by the current of the event itself .
" we all live in this world , " said an elderly gentleman who , along with his wife , made a spontaneous decision to protest .
" you ca n't leave it to others to save it , " he added .

this latest diplomatic exchange will do little to ease the strain .
" we can not agree on his declaration about the derailing of democratic reforms , " kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters ahead of a meeting of group of eight leaders in germany .
" russia is a democratic country that shares common world and common european values . "
earlier bush said during a speech in prague : " in russia , reforms that once promised to empower citizens have been derailed , with troubling implications for democratic development . "

" we have not received an explanation on the point of this shield or an explanation about whom it targets , " peskov said .
the united states says the shield would guard against hypothetical future attacks from iran or north korea , neither of which are believed currently to possess missiles of a sufficient range to reach europe .
moscow describes the planned missile shield as an aggressive step closer to russia 's borders .
addressed at summit peskov said that " these painful questions " would be raised during the g8 summit starting wednesday , including during a meeting scheduled for thursday between putin and bush .
russia will openly talk of its concerns and will wait for a corresponding explanation and , of course , the president as always will be ready to give detailed explanations on questions of concern to our partners , " peskov said .

but western hopes for progress were met with intransigence by iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier met with iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani , in surprise talks in berlin on the eve of the g8 summit . but no progress was made towards resolving the ongoing row over tehran 's nuclear program . steinmeier told reporters the aim of the talks had been to create more " suppleness " on the part of iran and to persuade the islamic republic to rethink its stance . iran has defied international pressure to halt uranium enrichment , saying it wants only to generate energy for a growing population when fossil fuels eventually run out . the western powers believe that iran is conducting a nuclear enrichment program with the aim of making a bomb , a charge which tehran has repeatedly denied . " it 's too late to push us back " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has met with larijani in the past ; here , in 2006 talks back in tehran , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that it was too late to stop his nation 's nuclear program , telling reporters tuesday , " we have broken through to a new stage and it is too late to push us back . " at a typically defiant news conference , ahmadinejad also warned the un security council of the dangers of seeking to pressure iran , telling the world body not to risk playing with a " lion 's tail . " " we advise them not to indulge in child 's play ...
they say that iran is a lion sat down in a corner .
and we tell them : do not play with the lion 's tail .

" solana and larijani have met twice in recent weeks but failed to defuse the standoff over iran 's refusal to stop enrichment work .
solana tried to coax tehran to halt enrichment in exchange for a package of political , economic and trade incentives . but instead , tehran 's intransigence has led the west to threaten more sanctions against the islamic republic .
the un security council has already agreed to two sets of sanctions against iran for ignoring its calls to suspend enrichment , and western powers are now openly talking of a new resolution after iran missed the latest deadline . a un report released last month stated that tehran could be three to eight years away from developing nuclear arms .

" we are dealing with psychological warfare , " said livni , whose country is considered the sole , undeclared nuclear power in the middle east . meanwhile , ahmadinejad predicted that washington would never be able to hurt the islamic republic even though the us has never ruled out military action to bring iran to heel over its nuclear drive . us secretary of state condoleezza rice , in the northeastern german resort of heiligendamm for the g8 talks said that ahmadinejad , who has repeatedly called for the destruction of the jewish state , was " digging a deeper and deeper hole for his country .

but western hopes for progress were met with intransigence by iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier met with iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani , in surprise talks in berlin on the eve of the g8 summit . but no progress was made towards resolving the ongoing row over tehran 's nuclear program . steinmeier told reporters the aim of the talks had been to create more " suppleness " on the part of iran and to persuade the islamic republic to rethink its stance . iran has defied international pressure to halt uranium enrichment , saying it wants only to generate energy for a growing population when fossil fuels eventually run out . the western powers believe that iran is conducting a nuclear enrichment program with the aim of making a bomb , a charge which tehran has repeatedly denied . " it 's too late to push us back " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has met with larijani in the past ; here , in 2006 talks back in tehran , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that it was too late to stop his nation 's nuclear program , telling reporters tuesday , " we have broken through to a new stage and it is too late to push us back . " at a typically defiant news conference , ahmadinejad also warned the un security council of the dangers of seeking to pressure iran , telling the world body not to risk playing with a " lion 's tail . " " we advise them not to indulge in child 's play ...
they say that iran is a lion sat down in a corner .
and we tell them : do not play with the lion 's tail . " diplomatic sources in berlin said germany was making " efforts to map the way forward on the iranian nuclear dossier in close consultation with the eu foreign policy coordinator javier solana . " solana and larijani have met twice in recent weeks but failed to defuse the standoff over iran 's refusal to stop enrichment work .
solana tried to coax tehran to halt enrichment in exchange for a package of political , economic and trade incentives . but instead , tehran 's intransigence has led the west to threaten more sanctions against the islamic republic .
the un security council has already agreed to two sets of sanctions against iran for ignoring its calls to suspend enrichment , and western powers are now openly talking of a new resolution after iran missed the latest deadline . a un report released last month stated that tehran could be three to eight years away from developing nuclear arms . " we are dealing with psychological warfare " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian leader has defied un sanctions in jerusalem on tuesday , israeli foreign minister tzipi livni urged the international community not to succumb to iran 's position .

but it is the climate that is getting the most heat . german chancellor angela merkel has made climate change and the challenges to combat it a key issue at the group of eight summit she is hosting at the baltic coastal resort of heiligendamm in germany .
observers are saying a substantial outcome is unlikely , however .
and in recent statements , merkel has tried to put the stress on at least getting the g8 countries to agree to keep at least agreeing to keep talks on climate change within a united nations framework .
" in heiligendamm we want to give impetus to the negotiations on global climate protection , " the chancellor said .
" i hope there will be a signal from heiligendamm that the countries represented there clearly recognize their collective responsibility , " she said .
with the world leaders from industrialized nations attending the meeting , some consensus about how to tackle the climate change problem could be possible .
no fixed targets likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has set climate high on the agenda but german press agency dpa reported wednesday morning that the united states and germany had apparently failed to agree on fixed targets in the fight against global warming in talks ahead of the summit .
and us president george w. bush 's chief environment adviser , james connaughton , has said the summit would end without an agreement on fixed targets .
connaughton said each country had to set its own targets .
this was not only washington 's view but also that of , for instance , japan and canada , he said .
it would take more time until all leading industrialized nations could agree on a joint vision .
however , british prime minister tony blair said wednesday he believes he can persuade bush to agree for the first time to a global target for a " substantial cut " in greenhouse gas emissions .
in an interview with the guardian newspaper wednesday , blair said that america was " on the move " in its position on climate change .
last-ditch effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has not endorsed the kyoto protocol to limit emissions chancellor merkel was to hold a pre-summit lunch meeting with bush on wednesday in a bid to find common ground on climate change .
the summit officially begins with a formal dinner later in the evening . last week , the chancellor had welcomed bush 's call for a new strategy on tackling global warming through joint action by the world 's top polluters - including china and india - as a " positive " step .
but merkel has also made clear that she will still press g8 leaders to commit to cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- .
support from other nations germany 's plan for a binding pact has won qualified support from some nations , but bush last week unveiled his own proposals and said a long-term goal for reducing greenhouses gases could be set by the end of 2008 .
merkel wants the g8 to guide other nations towards negotiations due to take place in december to find a successor to the kyoto protocol .
the 1997 kyoto protocol , named after japan 's ancient capital , where it was signed , is the world 's first treaty mandating emission cuts and will expire in 2012 .
on tuesday , the european union - represented by merkel as the current eu president - and japan agreed to take the lead in forging a successor to kyoto . they jointly proposed to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
bildunterschrift : police and protestors clashed before the summit " the eu and japan are committed to take strong leadership towards the development of a fair , flexible , effective and comprehensive un post-2012 framework that ensures the participation of all major emitting countries , " a joint statement said after the tuesday meeting .
developing countries ' role while the eu and japan insisted that developed countries should play a vital role in fighting global warming , they also called for a " fair contribution " by developing countries .
" we have to take action under a un framework so that all members of the international community can participate bindingly , " merkel said after talks with japanese prime minister shinzo abe in berlin tuesday .
merkel has also repeatedly said that talks on climate change must be within a united nations framework .
earlier in the week , merkel made a statment to that effect , together with canadian prime minister stephen harper .
president bush will also meet japan 's prime minister shinzo abe before the summit begins .
russia also in limelight g8 members include germany , france , britain , italy , japan , the united states , canada and russia .
the european commission is also represented at all meetings .

other non-g8 members at the meeting include the leaders of algeria , egypt , ghana , nigeria and senegal .
another issue likely to take center-stage at the summit is the west 's relations with russia , with russian president vladimir putin attending the meeting .
both chancellor merkel and us president bush are set to hold bilateral talks with putin in a bid to defuse rising east-west tensions .

but it is the climate that is getting the most heat . german chancellor angela merkel has made climate change and the challenges to combat it a key issue at the group of eight summit she is hosting at the baltic coastal resort of heiligendamm in germany .
observers are saying a substantial outcome is unlikely , however .
and in recent statements , merkel has tried to put the stress on at least getting the g8 countries to agree to keep at least agreeing to keep talks on climate change within a united nations framework .
" in heiligendamm we want to give impetus to the negotiations on global climate protection , " the chancellor said .
" i hope there will be a signal from heiligendamm that the countries represented there clearly recognize their collective responsibility , " she said .
with the world leaders from industrialized nations attending the meeting , some consensus about how to tackle the climate change problem could be possible .
no fixed targets likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has set climate high on the agenda but german press agency dpa reported wednesday morning that the united states and germany had apparently failed to agree on fixed targets in the fight against global warming in talks ahead of the summit .
and us president george w. bush 's chief environment adviser , james connaughton , has said the summit would end without an agreement on fixed targets .
connaughton said each country had to set its own targets .
this was not only washington 's view but also that of , for instance , japan and canada , he said .
it would take more time until all leading industrialized nations could agree on a joint vision .
however , british prime minister tony blair said wednesday he believes he can persuade bush to agree for the first time to a global target for a " substantial cut " in greenhouse gas emissions .
in an interview with the guardian newspaper wednesday , blair said that america was " on the move " in its position on climate change .
last-ditch effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has not endorsed the kyoto protocol to limit emissions chancellor merkel was to hold a pre-summit lunch meeting with bush on wednesday in a bid to find common ground on climate change .
the summit officially begins with a formal dinner later in the evening . last week , the chancellor had welcomed bush 's call for a new strategy on tackling global warming through joint action by the world 's top polluters - including china and india - as a " positive " step .
but merkel has also made clear that she will still press g8 leaders to commit to cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- .
support from other nations germany 's plan for a binding pact has won qualified support from some nations , but bush last week unveiled his own proposals and said a long-term goal for reducing greenhouses gases could be set by the end of 2008 .
merkel wants the g8 to guide other nations towards negotiations due to take place in december to find a successor to the kyoto protocol .
the 1997 kyoto protocol , named after japan 's ancient capital , where it was signed , is the world 's first treaty mandating emission cuts and will expire in 2012 .

as if to emphasize that whatever had gone before had just been a dry run for the main event , the police made their own statement to that effect .
the day started with what could only be described as widespread lockdown of infrastructure and ended with a heavy-handed clampdown on the opposition .
the arrival of the g8 heads had been a red letter day in the protestors ' diary from the very beginning .
even though their main target , us president george bush , had attempted to avoid the predicted mass picketing of laage airport by arriving a day earlier , there were still seven other leaders to vent anger against .
for the past few days , the issues had been the motivation to protest .
now the people responsible for those issues were coming and a predicted 8,000 to 10,000 demonstrators were ready to give them a welcome they would never forget .
police outnumber protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators on their way to the airport the police had other plans .
from the early morning , it was evident that the " two police officers for every protestor " rumor was no longer in dispute .
the massed ranks of heavily armored officers stationed on roads , bridges and railway tracks were sending out a visible message : you shall not pass .
the 16,000 regular police and 2,000 special officers drafted in for the summit were being used to full effect .
with the first arrival due to land at laage at 10 a.m. , hundreds of protestors streamed out of the rostock fischereihafen camp towards their own private vehicles and the specially organized buses waiting to take them the few kilometers to the airport while the morning was still in its infancy .
some of them did n't even make it out of the camp car park .
preventing protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police made it clear that demonstrators would not get past them the first full bus was ready to depart when it was surrounded by police wagons .
officers ordered the passengers out of the bus and the vehicle was slowly searched while bags and pockets were emptied on demand .
another bus arrived and was immediately impounded , its human cargo forced to get comfortable on the grass verge .
for how long , it is hard to say .
many never made it out of rostock .
there were alternative routes , however .
but security had not been the only reason why laage had been chosen as the arrival point .
it is horrendously difficult to get to by public transport and even more so when the roads and train tracks are closed down .
buses carrying protestors were stopped kilometers from the airport , unloaded and the passengers allowed to continue to a specified containment point away from laage on foot .
and these were the lucky ones .
mysteriously coincidental train malfunctions paralyzed the rail system just after rush hour leaving many protestors stranded and angry .
this would later contribute to frustration and violence .
few get through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers redirected protestors those who had set out just in time to avoid the main lockdown of the transport system around laage were met at the containment points by rows of riot police .
the plan had been to picket the airport at four main sites around its perimeter .
with numbers expected in the region of 8,000 demonstrators , it had been planned that around 2,000 would go to each .
the road blocks and train cancellations had contributed to a massive decimation of those numbers .
the few hundred which had gathered at the mouth of the airport 's service road milled around in front of the police , some muttering nervously about the prevalence of unit 23 , the hardest and most uncompromising officers bandied together from various forces to create an elite division .
various attempts to begin the demonstration were stopped by senior police officers .
there would be protests allowed , but only 50 people at a time would be let through the cordons to demonstrate at the airport 's gates .
from an expected crowd of 2,000 , as few as 37 protestors eventually made it to the gate .
once there , over 70 police officers blocked the entrance and forced the small group of protestors onto a grass verge opposite and held them there for an hour .
deflated demonstrators meanwhile , reports were phoned in to the group leader from an associate at bad doberan about a major incident involving over a thousand protestors who had been denied the chance to travel to laage and a large contingent of riot police .
according to the source in bad doberan , clashes had escalated quickly and tear gas and water cannons were being used to quell the unrest .
there was even an unsubstantiated report that a badly injured protestor had been denied medical assistance by police officers .
the mood of those at laage was already deflated before hearing this .
the planned blockade and show of strength had been turned into a pathetic joke by a well-coordinated and ruthless police operation .
by denying access to thousands and controlling to the footstep the movements of those which did make it to the boundaries of the airport , the police effectively removed all opposition at the point of entry for the g8 leaders .
and in bad doberan , they showed that they had learned the mistakes of the weekend where sheer numbers could not make up for the lack of preparation in dealing with a rioting mob .
on wednesday , the police struck hard and fast to end the unrest .
they more than made up for their shortcomings on previous unruly days .
on wednesday , they could claim a victory .

by denying access to thousands and controlling to the footstep the movements of those which did make it to the boundaries of the airport , the police effectively removed all opposition at the point of entry for the g8 leaders .
and in bad doberan , they showed that they had learned the mistakes of the weekend where sheer numbers could not make up for the lack of preparation in dealing with a rioting mob .
on wednesday , the police struck hard and fast to end the unrest .
they more than made up for their shortcomings on previous unruly days .
on wednesday , they could claim a victory .

but western hopes for progress were met with intransigence by iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier met with iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani , in surprise talks in berlin on the eve of the g8 summit . but no progress was made towards resolving the ongoing row over tehran 's nuclear program . steinmeier told reporters the aim of the talks had been to create more " suppleness " on the part of iran and to persuade the islamic republic to rethink its stance . iran has defied international pressure to halt uranium enrichment , saying it wants only to generate energy for a growing population when fossil fuels eventually run out . the western powers believe that iran is conducting a nuclear enrichment program with the aim of making a bomb , a charge which tehran has repeatedly denied .

" solana and larijani have met twice in recent weeks but failed to defuse the standoff over iran 's refusal to stop enrichment work .
solana tried to coax tehran to halt enrichment in exchange for a package of political , economic and trade incentives . but instead , tehran 's intransigence has led the west to threaten more sanctions against the islamic republic .
the un security council has already agreed to two sets of sanctions against iran for ignoring its calls to suspend enrichment , and western powers are now openly talking of a new resolution after iran missed the latest deadline . a un report released last month stated that tehran could be three to eight years away from developing nuclear arms .

" we are dealing with psychological warfare , " said livni , whose country is considered the sole , undeclared nuclear power in the middle east . meanwhile , ahmadinejad predicted that washington would never be able to hurt the islamic republic even though the us has never ruled out military action to bring iran to heel over its nuclear drive . us secretary of state condoleezza rice , in the northeastern german resort of heiligendamm for the g8 talks said that ahmadinejad , who has repeatedly called for the destruction of the jewish state , was " digging a deeper and deeper hole for his country .

but western hopes for progress were met with intransigence by iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier met with iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani , in surprise talks in berlin on the eve of the g8 summit . but no progress was made towards resolving the ongoing row over tehran 's nuclear program . steinmeier told reporters the aim of the talks had been to create more " suppleness " on the part of iran and to persuade the islamic republic to rethink its stance . iran has defied international pressure to halt uranium enrichment , saying it wants only to generate energy for a growing population when fossil fuels eventually run out . the western powers believe that iran is conducting a nuclear enrichment program with the aim of making a bomb , a charge which tehran has repeatedly denied . " it 's too late to push us back " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has met with larijani in the past ; here , in 2006 talks back in tehran , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that it was too late to stop his nation 's nuclear program , telling reporters tuesday , " we have broken through to a new stage and it is too late to push us back . " at a typically defiant news conference , ahmadinejad also warned the un security council of the dangers of seeking to pressure iran , telling the world body not to risk playing with a " lion 's tail . " " we advise them not to indulge in child 's play ...
they say that iran is a lion sat down in a corner .
and we tell them : do not play with the lion 's tail . " diplomatic sources in berlin said germany was making " efforts to map the way forward on the iranian nuclear dossier in close consultation with the eu foreign policy coordinator javier solana . " solana and larijani have met twice in recent weeks but failed to defuse the standoff over iran 's refusal to stop enrichment work .
solana tried to coax tehran to halt enrichment in exchange for a package of political , economic and trade incentives . but instead , tehran 's intransigence has led the west to threaten more sanctions against the islamic republic .
the un security council has already agreed to two sets of sanctions against iran for ignoring its calls to suspend enrichment , and western powers are now openly talking of a new resolution after iran missed the latest deadline . a un report released last month stated that tehran could be three to eight years away from developing nuclear arms . " we are dealing with psychological warfare " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian leader has defied un sanctions in jerusalem on tuesday , israeli foreign minister tzipi livni urged the international community not to succumb to iran 's position . " iran is trying to convince the world that it has crossed the point of no return in order to weaken the international community 's efforts to stop iran , " her office quoted her as saying . " we are dealing with psychological warfare , " said livni , whose country is considered the sole , undeclared nuclear power in the middle east . meanwhile , ahmadinejad predicted that washington would never be able to hurt the islamic republic even though the us has never ruled out military action to bring iran to heel over its nuclear drive . us secretary of state condoleezza rice , in the northeastern german resort of heiligendamm for the g8 talks said that ahmadinejad , who has repeatedly called for the destruction of the jewish state , was " digging a deeper and deeper hole for his country . " the g8 grouping of the us , britain , germany , france , italy , canada , japan and russia have threatened tougher sanctions if iran fails to meet un demands to halt enrichment . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it is the climate that is getting the most heat . german chancellor angela merkel has made climate change and the challenges to combat it a key issue at the group of eight summit she is hosting at the baltic coastal resort of heiligendamm in germany .
observers are saying a substantial outcome is unlikely , however .
and in recent statements , merkel has tried to put the stress on at least getting the g8 countries to agree to keep at least agreeing to keep talks on climate change within a united nations framework .
" in heiligendamm we want to give impetus to the negotiations on global climate protection , " the chancellor said .
" i hope there will be a signal from heiligendamm that the countries represented there clearly recognize their collective responsibility , " she said .
with the world leaders from industrialized nations attending the meeting , some consensus about how to tackle the climate change problem could be possible .
no fixed targets likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has set climate high on the agenda but german press agency dpa reported wednesday morning that the united states and germany had apparently failed to agree on fixed targets in the fight against global warming in talks ahead of the summit .
and us president george w. bush 's chief environment adviser , james connaughton , has said the summit would end without an agreement on fixed targets .
connaughton said each country had to set its own targets .
this was not only washington 's view but also that of , for instance , japan and canada , he said .
it would take more time until all leading industrialized nations could agree on a joint vision .
however , british prime minister tony blair said wednesday he believes he can persuade bush to agree for the first time to a global target for a " substantial cut " in greenhouse gas emissions .
in an interview with the guardian newspaper wednesday , blair said that america was " on the move " in its position on climate change .
last-ditch effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has not endorsed the kyoto protocol to limit emissions chancellor merkel was to hold a pre-summit lunch meeting with bush on wednesday in a bid to find common ground on climate change .
the summit officially begins with a formal dinner later in the evening . last week , the chancellor had welcomed bush 's call for a new strategy on tackling global warming through joint action by the world 's top polluters - including china and india - as a " positive " step .
but merkel has also made clear that she will still press g8 leaders to commit to cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- .
support from other nations germany 's plan for a binding pact has won qualified support from some nations , but bush last week unveiled his own proposals and said a long-term goal for reducing greenhouses gases could be set by the end of 2008 .
merkel wants the g8 to guide other nations towards negotiations due to take place in december to find a successor to the kyoto protocol .
the 1997 kyoto protocol , named after japan 's ancient capital , where it was signed , is the world 's first treaty mandating emission cuts and will expire in 2012 .
on tuesday , the european union - represented by merkel as the current eu president - and japan agreed to take the lead in forging a successor to kyoto . they jointly proposed to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
bildunterschrift : police and protestors clashed before the summit " the eu and japan are committed to take strong leadership towards the development of a fair , flexible , effective and comprehensive un post-2012 framework that ensures the participation of all major emitting countries , " a joint statement said after the tuesday meeting .
developing countries ' role while the eu and japan insisted that developed countries should play a vital role in fighting global warming , they also called for a " fair contribution " by developing countries .
" we have to take action under a un framework so that all members of the international community can participate bindingly , " merkel said after talks with japanese prime minister shinzo abe in berlin tuesday .
merkel has also repeatedly said that talks on climate change must be within a united nations framework .
earlier in the week , merkel made a statment to that effect , together with canadian prime minister stephen harper .
president bush will also meet japan 's prime minister shinzo abe before the summit begins .

other non-g8 members at the meeting include the leaders of algeria , egypt , ghana , nigeria and senegal .
another issue likely to take center-stage at the summit is the west 's relations with russia , with russian president vladimir putin attending the meeting .
both chancellor merkel and us president bush are set to hold bilateral talks with putin in a bid to defuse rising east-west tensions .

but it is the climate that is getting the most heat . german chancellor angela merkel has made climate change and the challenges to combat it a key issue at the group of eight summit she is hosting at the baltic coastal resort of heiligendamm in germany .
observers are saying a substantial outcome is unlikely , however .
and in recent statements , merkel has tried to put the stress on at least getting the g8 countries to agree to keep at least agreeing to keep talks on climate change within a united nations framework .
" in heiligendamm we want to give impetus to the negotiations on global climate protection , " the chancellor said .
" i hope there will be a signal from heiligendamm that the countries represented there clearly recognize their collective responsibility , " she said .
with the world leaders from industrialized nations attending the meeting , some consensus about how to tackle the climate change problem could be possible .
no fixed targets likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has set climate high on the agenda but german press agency dpa reported wednesday morning that the united states and germany had apparently failed to agree on fixed targets in the fight against global warming in talks ahead of the summit .
and us president george w. bush 's chief environment adviser , james connaughton , has said the summit would end without an agreement on fixed targets .
connaughton said each country had to set its own targets .
this was not only washington 's view but also that of , for instance , japan and canada , he said .
it would take more time until all leading industrialized nations could agree on a joint vision .
however , british prime minister tony blair said wednesday he believes he can persuade bush to agree for the first time to a global target for a " substantial cut " in greenhouse gas emissions .
in an interview with the guardian newspaper wednesday , blair said that america was " on the move " in its position on climate change .
last-ditch effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has not endorsed the kyoto protocol to limit emissions chancellor merkel was to hold a pre-summit lunch meeting with bush on wednesday in a bid to find common ground on climate change .
the summit officially begins with a formal dinner later in the evening . last week , the chancellor had welcomed bush 's call for a new strategy on tackling global warming through joint action by the world 's top polluters - including china and india - as a " positive " step .
but merkel has also made clear that she will still press g8 leaders to commit to cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- .
support from other nations germany 's plan for a binding pact has won qualified support from some nations , but bush last week unveiled his own proposals and said a long-term goal for reducing greenhouses gases could be set by the end of 2008 .
merkel wants the g8 to guide other nations towards negotiations due to take place in december to find a successor to the kyoto protocol .
the 1997 kyoto protocol , named after japan 's ancient capital , where it was signed , is the world 's first treaty mandating emission cuts and will expire in 2012 .
on tuesday , the european union - represented by merkel as the current eu president - and japan agreed to take the lead in forging a successor to kyoto . they jointly proposed to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
bildunterschrift : police and protestors clashed before the summit " the eu and japan are committed to take strong leadership towards the development of a fair , flexible , effective and comprehensive un post-2012 framework that ensures the participation of all major emitting countries , " a joint statement said after the tuesday meeting .
developing countries ' role while the eu and japan insisted that developed countries should play a vital role in fighting global warming , they also called for a " fair contribution " by developing countries .
" we have to take action under a un framework so that all members of the international community can participate bindingly , " merkel said after talks with japanese prime minister shinzo abe in berlin tuesday .
merkel has also repeatedly said that talks on climate change must be within a united nations framework .
earlier in the week , merkel made a statment to that effect , together with canadian prime minister stephen harper .

as if to emphasize that whatever had gone before had just been a dry run for the main event , the police made their own statement to that effect .
the day started with what could only be described as widespread lockdown of infrastructure and ended with a heavy-handed clampdown on the opposition .
the arrival of the g8 heads had been a red letter day in the protestors ' diary from the very beginning .
even though their main target , us president george bush , had attempted to avoid the predicted mass picketing of laage airport by arriving a day earlier , there were still seven other leaders to vent anger against .
for the past few days , the issues had been the motivation to protest .
now the people responsible for those issues were coming and a predicted 8,000 to 10,000 demonstrators were ready to give them a welcome they would never forget .
police outnumber protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators on their way to the airport the police had other plans .
from the early morning , it was evident that the " two police officers for every protestor " rumor was no longer in dispute .
the massed ranks of heavily armored officers stationed on roads , bridges and railway tracks were sending out a visible message : you shall not pass .
the 16,000 regular police and 2,000 special officers drafted in for the summit were being used to full effect .
with the first arrival due to land at laage at 10 a.m. , hundreds of protestors streamed out of the rostock fischereihafen camp towards their own private vehicles and the specially organized buses waiting to take them the few kilometers to the airport while the morning was still in its infancy .
some of them did n't even make it out of the camp car park .
preventing protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police made it clear that demonstrators would not get past them the first full bus was ready to depart when it was surrounded by police wagons .
officers ordered the passengers out of the bus and the vehicle was slowly searched while bags and pockets were emptied on demand .
another bus arrived and was immediately impounded , its human cargo forced to get comfortable on the grass verge .
for how long , it is hard to say .
many never made it out of rostock .
there were alternative routes , however .
but security had not been the only reason why laage had been chosen as the arrival point .
it is horrendously difficult to get to by public transport and even more so when the roads and train tracks are closed down .
buses carrying protestors were stopped kilometers from the airport , unloaded and the passengers allowed to continue to a specified containment point away from laage on foot .
and these were the lucky ones .
mysteriously coincidental train malfunctions paralyzed the rail system just after rush hour leaving many protestors stranded and angry .
this would later contribute to frustration and violence .
few get through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers redirected protestors those who had set out just in time to avoid the main lockdown of the transport system around laage were met at the containment points by rows of riot police .
the plan had been to picket the airport at four main sites around its perimeter .
with numbers expected in the region of 8,000 demonstrators , it had been planned that around 2,000 would go to each .
the road blocks and train cancellations had contributed to a massive decimation of those numbers .
the few hundred which had gathered at the mouth of the airport 's service road milled around in front of the police , some muttering nervously about the prevalence of unit 23 , the hardest and most uncompromising officers bandied together from various forces to create an elite division .
various attempts to begin the demonstration were stopped by senior police officers .
there would be protests allowed , but only 50 people at a time would be let through the cordons to demonstrate at the airport 's gates .
from an expected crowd of 2,000 , as few as 37 protestors eventually made it to the gate .
once there , over 70 police officers blocked the entrance and forced the small group of protestors onto a grass verge opposite and held them there for an hour .
deflated demonstrators meanwhile , reports were phoned in to the group leader from an associate at bad doberan about a major incident involving over a thousand protestors who had been denied the chance to travel to laage and a large contingent of riot police .
according to the source in bad doberan , clashes had escalated quickly and tear gas and water cannons were being used to quell the unrest .
there was even an unsubstantiated report that a badly injured protestor had been denied medical assistance by police officers .
the mood of those at laage was already deflated before hearing this .
the planned blockade and show of strength had been turned into a pathetic joke by a well-coordinated and ruthless police operation .
by denying access to thousands and controlling to the footstep the movements of those which did make it to the boundaries of the airport , the police effectively removed all opposition at the point of entry for the g8 leaders .
and in bad doberan , they showed that they had learned the mistakes of the weekend where sheer numbers could not make up for the lack of preparation in dealing with a rioting mob .
on wednesday , the police struck hard and fast to end the unrest .

even though their main target , us president george bush , had attempted to avoid the predicted mass picketing of laage airport by arriving a day earlier , there were still seven other leaders to vent anger against .
for the past few days , the issues had been the motivation to protest .
now the people responsible for those issues were coming and a predicted 8,000 to 10,000 demonstrators were ready to give them a welcome they would never forget .
police outnumber protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators on their way to the airport the police had other plans .
from the early morning , it was evident that the " two police officers for every protestor " rumor was no longer in dispute .
the massed ranks of heavily armored officers stationed on roads , bridges and railway tracks were sending out a visible message : you shall not pass .
the 16,000 regular police and 2,000 special officers drafted in for the summit were being used to full effect .
with the first arrival due to land at laage at 10 a.m. , hundreds of protestors streamed out of the rostock fischereihafen camp towards their own private vehicles and the specially organized buses waiting to take them the few kilometers to the airport while the morning was still in its infancy .
some of them did n't even make it out of the camp car park .

officers ordered the passengers out of the bus and the vehicle was slowly searched while bags and pockets were emptied on demand .
another bus arrived and was immediately impounded , its human cargo forced to get comfortable on the grass verge .
for how long , it is hard to say .
many never made it out of rostock .
there were alternative routes , however .
but security had not been the only reason why laage had been chosen as the arrival point .
it is horrendously difficult to get to by public transport and even more so when the roads and train tracks are closed down .
buses carrying protestors were stopped kilometers from the airport , unloaded and the passengers allowed to continue to a specified containment point away from laage on foot .
and these were the lucky ones .
mysteriously coincidental train malfunctions paralyzed the rail system just after rush hour leaving many protestors stranded and angry .
this would later contribute to frustration and violence .
few get through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers redirected protestors those who had set out just in time to avoid the main lockdown of the transport system around laage were met at the containment points by rows of riot police .
the plan had been to picket the airport at four main sites around its perimeter .
with numbers expected in the region of 8,000 demonstrators , it had been planned that around 2,000 would go to each .
the road blocks and train cancellations had contributed to a massive decimation of those numbers .
the few hundred which had gathered at the mouth of the airport 's service road milled around in front of the police , some muttering nervously about the prevalence of unit 23 , the hardest and most uncompromising officers bandied together from various forces to create an elite division .
various attempts to begin the demonstration were stopped by senior police officers .
there would be protests allowed , but only 50 people at a time would be let through the cordons to demonstrate at the airport 's gates .
from an expected crowd of 2,000 , as few as 37 protestors eventually made it to the gate .
once there , over 70 police officers blocked the entrance and forced the small group of protestors onto a grass verge opposite and held them there for an hour .
deflated demonstrators meanwhile , reports were phoned in to the group leader from an associate at bad doberan about a major incident involving over a thousand protestors who had been denied the chance to travel to laage and a large contingent of riot police .
according to the source in bad doberan , clashes had escalated quickly and tear gas and water cannons were being used to quell the unrest .
there was even an unsubstantiated report that a badly injured protestor had been denied medical assistance by police officers .
the mood of those at laage was already deflated before hearing this .
the planned blockade and show of strength had been turned into a pathetic joke by a well-coordinated and ruthless police operation .
by denying access to thousands and controlling to the footstep the movements of those which did make it to the boundaries of the airport , the police effectively removed all opposition at the point of entry for the g8 leaders .
and in bad doberan , they showed that they had learned the mistakes of the weekend where sheer numbers could not make up for the lack of preparation in dealing with a rioting mob .
on wednesday , the police struck hard and fast to end the unrest .
they more than made up for their shortcomings on previous unruly days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.06.2007 european central bank raises rate to block inflation risks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank in frankfurt the european central bank raised its key interest rate by a quarter point to 4.0 percent wednesday and hinted that further hikes could come to tame inflation in a dynamic euro-zone economy . in the eighth increase in 18 months matching the vigor euro-zone growth , the european central bank lifted its benchmark refinancing rate by a quarter of a point to 4 percent , the highest reading for five and a half years .
ecb president jean-claude trichet said the bank 's monetary policy remained on " the accommodative side , " adding that wednesday 's move was to counter inflationary risks expected to ease in the near term before rising significantly later in the year .
wages were rising faster than the bank had expected , he said .
the bank revised upwards its 2007 inflation forecast in the 13-nation euro zone to 2 percent from 1.8 percent previously but held its prediction for next year at 2 percent , roughly consistent with its preferred level .
the bank has set itself an upper target limit for inflation of 2 percent because experience has shown that beyond this level , people anticipate price rises , thereby adding to inflationary pressures .
" still accommodative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euros on the move " after today 's increase , given the positive economic environment in the euro area , our monetary policy is still on the accommodative side , with overall financing conditions favorable , money and credit growth vigorous , and liquidity in the euro area ample , " trichet told a news conference .
a reference to an " accommodative " stance is seen as a signal that more rate rises could be approved in coming months but not necessarily at the next meeting of the bank 's policy-making body .

the bank revised upwards its 2007 inflation forecast in the 13-nation euro zone to 2 percent from 1.8 percent previously but held its prediction for next year at 2 percent , roughly consistent with its preferred level .
the bank has set itself an upper target limit for inflation of 2 percent because experience has shown that beyond this level , people anticipate price rises , thereby adding to inflationary pressures .
" still accommodative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euros on the move " after today 's increase , given the positive economic environment in the euro area , our monetary policy is still on the accommodative side , with overall financing conditions favorable , money and credit growth vigorous , and liquidity in the euro area ample , " trichet told a news conference .
a reference to an " accommodative " stance is seen as a signal that more rate rises could be approved in coming months but not necessarily at the next meeting of the bank 's policy-making body .
trichet said the bank was making no pre-commitment on future rate moves but also stressed that it would do whatever was needed to control inflation .
" the -lrb- ecb 's -rrb- governing council will monitor closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialize , " he said .
raised euro zone growth forecast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president trichet the bank also wednesday raised its euro-zone growth forecast for this year to 2.6 percent from 2.5 percent and lowered its prediction for 2008 to 2.3 percent from 2.4 percent .
in london , the euro which had firmed before the decision , weakened on trichet 's comments on future rate policy that were seen as vague by traders .
the single european currency was changing hands at $ 1.3501 against $ 1.3519 late tuesday in new york .
prior to the announcement many market analysts were predicting a further tightening to 4.25 percent when the bank policymakers convene in september .
" a growing number of investors are even speculating about an increase to 4.5 percent , " said commerzbank treasurer ryohei muramatsu in tokyo .
the head of the german central bank , axel weber , who sits on the ecb 's governing council , left no doubt in a recent interview that further rate rises were likely .
" the current cycle of interest rate hikes has not reached its end , " he told the financial times .
" what is pretty clear is that we are in a stronger than previously expected recovery , " he said .
" if necessary we will also have to move into a territory that is portrayed as being restrictive , if that is needed to control inflation . "
perhaps unsettling for some although widely expected , the latest increase by the ecb was likely to unsettle political figures in several euro-zone members , notably france , who contend that the bank 's monetary policies are driving up the euro and dampening growth .
while interest rates in the 13-nation euro zone have been on the rise for the past year and a half , they have stagnated in the united states , where the benchmark federal funds rate has been at 5.25 percent since last june .

" the euro area economy is moving from recovery to upswing , " the international monetary fund said in a report on tuesday , which foresaw euro-zone growth of 2.5 percent this year as well as sustained momentum in 2008 .

ever since their four-year-old daughter went missing from a holiday resort in portugal 's algarve region on may 3 , gerry and kate mccann have launched a high profile campaign to find madeleine , who was allegedly abducted from the bedroom of the villa where they stayed . the british couple , who are doctors , had left her and her two-year-old twin siblings , who were unharmed , in the apartment , while they went to a restaurant on the premises . they have already met pope benedict xvi in rome and traveled to madrid , which was the start of their tour of european capitals to raise awareness for their daughter 's disappearance . now they have publicized their appeal in germany since german and dutch tourists make up the majority of foreign tourists in algarve . publicizing appeal in germany " we are here to ask the german public for help in searching for our little daughter , " gerry mccann announced at a press conference in berlin with his wife kate at his side . the couple asked german tourists to look through holiday photographs taken in portugal last month to see whether the little girl , and perhaps also her abductor , might be in the background .
when a journalist suggested that they could in some way be involved in the abduction of their child , gerry mccann retorted : " i have never heard before that anyone considers us suspects in this and the portuguese police certainly do n't . " the case has captured considerable attention from the german media .
bild , the mass circulation tabloid , published an open letter to the mccanns from brigitta sirny , the mother of the austrian girl natascha kampusch , who had been kidnapped as a 10-year-old on her way to school and held in captivity for more than eight years .
last summer , kampusch made a dramatic escape from her abductor , who then killed himself before he could be arrested . parallels with abduction of austrian girl last year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha kampusch was held in captivity for 3,096 days " my daughter natascha was also kidnapped , " sirny wrote .
" she was held for 3,096 days at the mercy of a demented criminal .
i have suffered countless hours of despair .
hours in which i kept asking myself : why ?
why my child ?
who has done this ?
who would kidnap a defenseless child ?
could i have stopped it ?
did a lapse of a few minutes cost years of my child 's life ? " the newspaper also quoted sirny as saying that publicizing the case , which became a sensation in germany , was the right thing to do , " because the worst that could happen for a kidnapped child is to be forgotten . " there is still hope in an interview with german newspaper berliner morgenpost on sunday , gerry mccann said that there was still hope . " as long as there is hope , we are not giving up , " he said .
kate mccann said she hoped madeleine was safe and was being cared for . " we know there are evil people out there , but there are also confused people , " she said .
" we do not know who this person is .
we hope the latter . " the couple also met with the mayor of berlin , klaus wowereit .

ever since their four-year-old daughter went missing from a holiday resort in portugal 's algarve region on may 3 , gerry and kate mccann have launched a high profile campaign to find madeleine , who was allegedly abducted from the bedroom of the villa where they stayed . the british couple , who are doctors , had left her and her two-year-old twin siblings , who were unharmed , in the apartment , while they went to a restaurant on the premises . they have already met pope benedict xvi in rome and traveled to madrid , which was the start of their tour of european capitals to raise awareness for their daughter 's disappearance . now they have publicized their appeal in germany since german and dutch tourists make up the majority of foreign tourists in algarve . publicizing appeal in germany " we are here to ask the german public for help in searching for our little daughter , " gerry mccann announced at a press conference in berlin with his wife kate at his side . the couple asked german tourists to look through holiday photographs taken in portugal last month to see whether the little girl , and perhaps also her abductor , might be in the background .
when a journalist suggested that they could in some way be involved in the abduction of their child , gerry mccann retorted : " i have never heard before that anyone considers us suspects in this and the portuguese police certainly do n't . " the case has captured considerable attention from the german media .
bild , the mass circulation tabloid , published an open letter to the mccanns from brigitta sirny , the mother of the austrian girl natascha kampusch , who had been kidnapped as a 10-year-old on her way to school and held in captivity for more than eight years .
last summer , kampusch made a dramatic escape from her abductor , who then killed himself before he could be arrested . parallels with abduction of austrian girl last year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha kampusch was held in captivity for 3,096 days " my daughter natascha was also kidnapped , " sirny wrote .
" she was held for 3,096 days at the mercy of a demented criminal .
i have suffered countless hours of despair .
hours in which i kept asking myself : why ?
why my child ?
who has done this ?
who would kidnap a defenseless child ?
could i have stopped it ?
did a lapse of a few minutes cost years of my child 's life ? " the newspaper also quoted sirny as saying that publicizing the case , which became a sensation in germany , was the right thing to do , " because the worst that could happen for a kidnapped child is to be forgotten . " there is still hope in an interview with german newspaper berliner morgenpost on sunday , gerry mccann said that there was still hope . " as long as there is hope , we are not giving up , " he said .
kate mccann said she hoped madeleine was safe and was being cared for . " we know there are evil people out there , but there are also confused people , " she said .
" we do not know who this person is .
we hope the latter . " the couple also met with the mayor of berlin , klaus wowereit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 06.06.2007 emerging nations visit the " rich country club " - the g8 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the five g8 guest countries met in march in preparation for this year 's summit brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa will join the leading industrial nations at the g8 summit .
according to a recent study , it 's doubtful that membership in the " club " will help the poor in these countries . without the five emerging guest nations , the g8 summit 's motto " growth and responsibility " couldn ’ t be implemented , said german chancellor angela merkel recently .
indeed , all five of them exhibited healthy growth in their gross domestic products in 2006 : china and india topped the group with 10.7 and 9.2 percent respectively , while south africa -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- , brazil -lrb- 4.4 percent -rrb- and mexico -lrb- 3.5 percent -rrb- came in strong .
according to the german office for foreign trade -lrb- bfai -rrb- in cologne , the upward trend is expected to continue in 2007 and 2008 .
economic growth encourages confidence on the international political playing field .
they have already become key players in the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and in climate debates , for example .
their businesses are expanding worldwide and representatives from these emerging nations are already questioning the legitimacy of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
in addition , brazil , india and south africa are aspiring to obtain a permanent seat in the united nations security council .
g20 represents world majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of emerging countries in political bodies wo n't affect poverty , say some experts in the wto , the " big five " belong to the so-called g20 , a group of emerging and developing nations that was founded in cancun , mexico in 2003 and represents two-thirds of the world 's population .
however , in international economic negotiations , the big five sometimes give the impression that they are already playing in a league of their own .
" the economic upturn of china , india , brazil and south africa does n't necessarily lead to a poverty-oriented global economic policy , " concluded a study by the aid organizations bread for the world and südwind institute , which is to be presented wednesday at the alternative summit in rostock .
" economic growth alone does n't help the poorest of the poor . "
the gap between rich and poor is growing even wider , particularly in brazil , mexico , india and south africa .
in the run-up to this year 's summit , there was talk of expanding the g8 - which currently represents only 13 percent of the world population - to the g13 .
however , this could weaken the position of the world 's poor , say experts .
the poor still lose out " the dominance of the wealthy industrialized countries in the world trade organization and the international monetary fund would be reduced , but the interests of poor people in emerging nations and the least-developed nations would still be pushed onto the back burner in the world trade system , " said reinhard koppe , development policy expert at bread for the world .
furthermore , the study reveals how power relationships have shifted over the past few years through the offensive economic policies of four of the largest emerging nations - china , india , brazil and south africa .
" all four states have become world powers in many sectors , not just in their regions but worldwide , " said koppe .
the study 's author friedel hütz-adams said that " established industrialized nations are no longer in a position to assert their own interests without making major compromises - both in the wto and in bilateral and regional treaties . "
strategies on the political front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 represents two thirds of the world 's population according to the study , brazil 's discourse within the wto focuses on close cooperation with the g20 countries and the nama 11 group -lrb- argentina , brazil , egypt , india , indonesia , namibia , philippines , south africa , tunisia and venezuela -rrb- , while making deals of its own behind the scenes . " the government in brazil is getting involved in the non-transparent structures of the wto by agreeing , together with india , to talks with the us , the eu and japan , " said the study .
china , which like brazil has only signed a handful of bilateral open-trade treaties , continues to focus on the wto negotiations and is prepared to support the positions of other emerging and developing countries .
conflict of interest is standing in the way , however , said hütz-adams .
in addition , china 's engagement in africa is now being seen as a threat by governments and companies from industrialized countries , added the author .
india sees itself as a spokesperson for developing countries on the international playing field , which could soon change .
hütz-adams sees the willingness of the indian government to join brazil in informal trade talks with the us , the eu and japan as a warning sign .
" no on knows whether india will stay connected with the goals of the g20 and g33 in the world trade organization negotiations , " he said .
the country has increasingly been distinguishing itself as an economic power and seems to be going its own way .
mexico continues to be an emerging country but , at the same time , is a member of oecd .
of the five " guest " nations at the g8 summit , its economy has opened up the most since the 1990s .
it maintains 13 free trade agreements with 42 other countries , including one with nafta since 1994 and with the eu since 2000 .
last year , the mexican government reduced customs duties on merchandise with 148 wto member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment has been a sticky issue with some major emerging nations like china after mexico joined nafta , cheap corn from the us flooded the mexican market and led to protests by farmers .
since mexico had increased the use of corn in ethanol production , it became scarce .
" that 's why there were tortilla rebellions and the country was noncommittal during the wto agricultural negotiations , " said hütz-adams .
what 's more , economic expansion in china and india is putting competitive pressure on mexico and brazil .
more influence for smaller countries the study named other differences between the major emerging countries as well .
brazil and south africa support a fundamental voting reform in the international monetary fund and the world bank that would give small countries more say .
india and china , on the other hand , want to enhance their own positions in both institutions .
it remains to be seen whether india and china will agree to the united states ' new climate initiative .
" that would require a parallel structure to the un where the small states would n't have any say anymore , " said hütz-adams .

according to a recent study , it 's doubtful that membership in the " club " will help the poor in these countries . without the five emerging guest nations , the g8 summit 's motto " growth and responsibility " couldn ’ t be implemented , said german chancellor angela merkel recently .
indeed , all five of them exhibited healthy growth in their gross domestic products in 2006 : china and india topped the group with 10.7 and 9.2 percent respectively , while south africa -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- , brazil -lrb- 4.4 percent -rrb- and mexico -lrb- 3.5 percent -rrb- came in strong .
according to the german office for foreign trade -lrb- bfai -rrb- in cologne , the upward trend is expected to continue in 2007 and 2008 .
economic growth encourages confidence on the international political playing field .
they have already become key players in the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and in climate debates , for example .
their businesses are expanding worldwide and representatives from these emerging nations are already questioning the legitimacy of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
in addition , brazil , india and south africa are aspiring to obtain a permanent seat in the united nations security council .
g20 represents world majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of emerging countries in political bodies wo n't affect poverty , say some experts in the wto , the " big five " belong to the so-called g20 , a group of emerging and developing nations that was founded in cancun , mexico in 2003 and represents two-thirds of the world 's population .
however , in international economic negotiations , the big five sometimes give the impression that they are already playing in a league of their own .
" the economic upturn of china , india , brazil and south africa does n't necessarily lead to a poverty-oriented global economic policy , " concluded a study by the aid organizations bread for the world and südwind institute , which is to be presented wednesday at the alternative summit in rostock .
" economic growth alone does n't help the poorest of the poor . "
the gap between rich and poor is growing even wider , particularly in brazil , mexico , india and south africa .
in the run-up to this year 's summit , there was talk of expanding the g8 - which currently represents only 13 percent of the world population - to the g13 .
however , this could weaken the position of the world 's poor , say experts .
the poor still lose out " the dominance of the wealthy industrialized countries in the world trade organization and the international monetary fund would be reduced , but the interests of poor people in emerging nations and the least-developed nations would still be pushed onto the back burner in the world trade system , " said reinhard koppe , development policy expert at bread for the world .
furthermore , the study reveals how power relationships have shifted over the past few years through the offensive economic policies of four of the largest emerging nations - china , india , brazil and south africa .
" all four states have become world powers in many sectors , not just in their regions but worldwide , " said koppe .
the study 's author friedel hütz-adams said that " established industrialized nations are no longer in a position to assert their own interests without making major compromises - both in the wto and in bilateral and regional treaties . "
strategies on the political front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 represents two thirds of the world 's population according to the study , brazil 's discourse within the wto focuses on close cooperation with the g20 countries and the nama 11 group -lrb- argentina , brazil , egypt , india , indonesia , namibia , philippines , south africa , tunisia and venezuela -rrb- , while making deals of its own behind the scenes . " the government in brazil is getting involved in the non-transparent structures of the wto by agreeing , together with india , to talks with the us , the eu and japan , " said the study .
china , which like brazil has only signed a handful of bilateral open-trade treaties , continues to focus on the wto negotiations and is prepared to support the positions of other emerging and developing countries .
conflict of interest is standing in the way , however , said hütz-adams .
in addition , china 's engagement in africa is now being seen as a threat by governments and companies from industrialized countries , added the author .
india sees itself as a spokesperson for developing countries on the international playing field , which could soon change .
hütz-adams sees the willingness of the indian government to join brazil in informal trade talks with the us , the eu and japan as a warning sign .
" no on knows whether india will stay connected with the goals of the g20 and g33 in the world trade organization negotiations , " he said .
the country has increasingly been distinguishing itself as an economic power and seems to be going its own way .
mexico continues to be an emerging country but , at the same time , is a member of oecd .
of the five " guest " nations at the g8 summit , its economy has opened up the most since the 1990s .
it maintains 13 free trade agreements with 42 other countries , including one with nafta since 1994 and with the eu since 2000 .
last year , the mexican government reduced customs duties on merchandise with 148 wto member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment has been a sticky issue with some major emerging nations like china after mexico joined nafta , cheap corn from the us flooded the mexican market and led to protests by farmers .
since mexico had increased the use of corn in ethanol production , it became scarce .
" that 's why there were tortilla rebellions and the country was noncommittal during the wto agricultural negotiations , " said hütz-adams .
what 's more , economic expansion in china and india is putting competitive pressure on mexico and brazil .
more influence for smaller countries the study named other differences between the major emerging countries as well .
brazil and south africa support a fundamental voting reform in the international monetary fund and the world bank that would give small countries more say .
india and china , on the other hand , want to enhance their own positions in both institutions .
it remains to be seen whether india and china will agree to the united states ' new climate initiative .
" that would require a parallel structure to the un where the small states would n't have any say anymore , " said hütz-adams .

they have already become key players in the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and in climate debates , for example .

in addition , brazil , india and south africa are aspiring to obtain a permanent seat in the united nations security council .
g20 represents world majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of emerging countries in political bodies wo n't affect poverty , say some experts in the wto , the " big five " belong to the so-called g20 , a group of emerging and developing nations that was founded in cancun , mexico in 2003 and represents two-thirds of the world 's population .
however , in international economic negotiations , the big five sometimes give the impression that they are already playing in a league of their own .
" the economic upturn of china , india , brazil and south africa does n't necessarily lead to a poverty-oriented global economic policy , " concluded a study by the aid organizations bread for the world and südwind institute , which is to be presented wednesday at the alternative summit in rostock .
" economic growth alone does n't help the poorest of the poor . "
the gap between rich and poor is growing even wider , particularly in brazil , mexico , india and south africa .
in the run-up to this year 's summit , there was talk of expanding the g8 - which currently represents only 13 percent of the world population - to the g13 .
however , this could weaken the position of the world 's poor , say experts .
the poor still lose out " the dominance of the wealthy industrialized countries in the world trade organization and the international monetary fund would be reduced , but the interests of poor people in emerging nations and the least-developed nations would still be pushed onto the back burner in the world trade system , " said reinhard koppe , development policy expert at bread for the world .
furthermore , the study reveals how power relationships have shifted over the past few years through the offensive economic policies of four of the largest emerging nations - china , india , brazil and south africa .
" all four states have become world powers in many sectors , not just in their regions but worldwide , " said koppe .
the study 's author friedel hütz-adams said that " established industrialized nations are no longer in a position to assert their own interests without making major compromises - both in the wto and in bilateral and regional treaties . "
strategies on the political front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 represents two thirds of the world 's population according to the study , brazil 's discourse within the wto focuses on close cooperation with the g20 countries and the nama 11 group -lrb- argentina , brazil , egypt , india , indonesia , namibia , philippines , south africa , tunisia and venezuela -rrb- , while making deals of its own behind the scenes . " the government in brazil is getting involved in the non-transparent structures of the wto by agreeing , together with india , to talks with the us , the eu and japan , " said the study .
china , which like brazil has only signed a handful of bilateral open-trade treaties , continues to focus on the wto negotiations and is prepared to support the positions of other emerging and developing countries .
conflict of interest is standing in the way , however , said hütz-adams .
in addition , china 's engagement in africa is now being seen as a threat by governments and companies from industrialized countries , added the author .
india sees itself as a spokesperson for developing countries on the international playing field , which could soon change .
hütz-adams sees the willingness of the indian government to join brazil in informal trade talks with the us , the eu and japan as a warning sign .
" no on knows whether india will stay connected with the goals of the g20 and g33 in the world trade organization negotiations , " he said .
the country has increasingly been distinguishing itself as an economic power and seems to be going its own way .
mexico continues to be an emerging country but , at the same time , is a member of oecd .
of the five " guest " nations at the g8 summit , its economy has opened up the most since the 1990s .
it maintains 13 free trade agreements with 42 other countries , including one with nafta since 1994 and with the eu since 2000 .
last year , the mexican government reduced customs duties on merchandise with 148 wto member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment has been a sticky issue with some major emerging nations like china after mexico joined nafta , cheap corn from the us flooded the mexican market and led to protests by farmers .
since mexico had increased the use of corn in ethanol production , it became scarce .
" that 's why there were tortilla rebellions and the country was noncommittal during the wto agricultural negotiations , " said hütz-adams .
what 's more , economic expansion in china and india is putting competitive pressure on mexico and brazil .
more influence for smaller countries the study named other differences between the major emerging countries as well .
brazil and south africa support a fundamental voting reform in the international monetary fund and the world bank that would give small countries more say .
india and china , on the other hand , want to enhance their own positions in both institutions .
it remains to be seen whether india and china will agree to the united states ' new climate initiative .
" that would require a parallel structure to the un where the small states would n't have any say anymore , " said hütz-adams .

but western hopes for progress were met with intransigence by iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier met with iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani , in surprise talks in berlin on the eve of the g8 summit . but no progress was made towards resolving the ongoing row over tehran 's nuclear program . steinmeier told reporters the aim of the talks had been to create more " suppleness " on the part of iran and to persuade the islamic republic to rethink its stance . iran has defied international pressure to halt uranium enrichment , saying it wants only to generate energy for a growing population when fossil fuels eventually run out . the western powers believe that iran is conducting a nuclear enrichment program with the aim of making a bomb , a charge which tehran has repeatedly denied . " it 's too late to push us back " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has met with larijani in the past ; here , in 2006 talks back in tehran , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that it was too late to stop his nation 's nuclear program , telling reporters tuesday , " we have broken through to a new stage and it is too late to push us back . " at a typically defiant news conference , ahmadinejad also warned the un security council of the dangers of seeking to pressure iran , telling the world body not to risk playing with a " lion 's tail . " " we advise them not to indulge in child 's play ...
they say that iran is a lion sat down in a corner .
and we tell them : do not play with the lion 's tail . " diplomatic sources in berlin said germany was making " efforts to map the way forward on the iranian nuclear dossier in close consultation with the eu foreign policy coordinator javier solana . " solana and larijani have met twice in recent weeks but failed to defuse the standoff over iran 's refusal to stop enrichment work .
solana tried to coax tehran to halt enrichment in exchange for a package of political , economic and trade incentives . but instead , tehran 's intransigence has led the west to threaten more sanctions against the islamic republic .
the un security council has already agreed to two sets of sanctions against iran for ignoring its calls to suspend enrichment , and western powers are now openly talking of a new resolution after iran missed the latest deadline . a un report released last month stated that tehran could be three to eight years away from developing nuclear arms . " we are dealing with psychological warfare " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian leader has defied un sanctions in jerusalem on tuesday , israeli foreign minister tzipi livni urged the international community not to succumb to iran 's position . " iran is trying to convince the world that it has crossed the point of no return in order to weaken the international community 's efforts to stop iran , " her office quoted her as saying . " we are dealing with psychological warfare , " said livni , whose country is considered the sole , undeclared nuclear power in the middle east . meanwhile , ahmadinejad predicted that washington would never be able to hurt the islamic republic even though the us has never ruled out military action to bring iran to heel over its nuclear drive . us secretary of state condoleezza rice , in the northeastern german resort of heiligendamm for the g8 talks said that ahmadinejad , who has repeatedly called for the destruction of the jewish state , was " digging a deeper and deeper hole for his country . " the g8 grouping of the us , britain , germany , france , italy , canada , japan and russia have threatened tougher sanctions if iran fails to meet un demands to halt enrichment . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

life here is usually sedate , which is why it is an oasis of calm for retirees and young families .
one gets the impression that nothing much happens here and that 's the way the locals like it .
even when there 's a major international summit happening nearby , there are very few indicators which suggest anything other than idyllic normality is , as usual , in abundance .
from time to time the cry of seagulls is interrupted by the dull thud of distant rotor blades as a military chopper circles overhead .
occasionally when traveling the undulating roads the picturesque view is disturbed by random crews of armor-clad cops guarding lonely crossroads .
but even then , their green overalls attempt to minimize the disruption to the surroundings by blending into the fields around them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if if were n't for the police vehicles , one local resident would n't have noticed a difference for the residents of heilingendamm and kühlungsborn , the arrival of the g8 leaders and the thousands of protestors has so far barely even registered .
" if it was n't for the police vehicles parked around town , i would n't even have noticed anything different , " said jörg kessling , a retired resident of kühlungsborn , the location of the summit 's media center and a staging post for many journalists and delegates .
" there seems to be more people here than usual but no more than in a busy month during the summer . "
sabina meller , an assistant in a local bakery in the seaside resort of heiligendamm , where the summit is being held , expected more of an impact .
" there have been a few more strangers around , more young people , but the streets are just as quiet as ever , " she said .
" anyway , the kempinski hotel is quite a way from the town center .
when the protestors come , they 'll probably miss us completely .
i do n't expect the same thing to happen here as in rostock … maybe at the fence but not here . "
protest town to feel the full effects of the g8 , one has to travel to rostock .
the residents of the ancient hanseatic city have already felt the impact of the protestors after a weekend of mass demonstrations laced with violence and chaos .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business has been slow in the rostock area the past few days jana beger stands in the doorway of her newsagent 's shop and watches with a concerned look as a group of colorful and boisterous protestors march past on their way to the main train station .
jana has lived every one of her 62 years in rostock and says that she has never witnessed anything to compare to the events of the weekend when thousands took to the streets and a minority fought the police .
" these ones do n't look so bad , " she says , her eyes narrowing behind thick glasses as she scans each passing face .
" it 's the ones in black you have to watch out for . "
her son christian stands protectively beside her .
while there have been no reports yet of willful damage to shops , the cobbled streets of the city have already been violated and some businesses have already boarded up their windows just to be sure .
christian guards his mother and the shop 's large glass façade just in case .
" i went for my usual run early on sunday morning and the city maintenance crews were still replacing the stones , " he says , in reference to the cobbles prized from the road to be used in saturday 's violence .
" when there are people like that out there , who will go to such lengths , you ca n't help to be on your guard , even if you are n't their principle target . "
staying home others are not concerned about the violent " black block " extremists laying the city to waste .
many shops were open over the weekend even though there was a marked reduction in the number of customers , perhaps a reflection of residents ' unwillingness to put themselves at potential risk .
rostock 's lively hub , the kröpeliner-tor-vorstadt -lrb- ktv -rrb- area of the city , was like a ghost town on sunday with bar and café staff twiddling their thumbs .
some even took the decision to close on monday , much to the satisfaction of those who were open for business .
" it was dead around here at the weekend , " says timo kastnic , a bar worker in the ktv .
" i 'd never seen it like that … ever .
but we still opened up monday and because the others were shut , we did a lot of business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : missing cobblestones were one side-effect of the nearby demonstrations drinkers and those wanting to eat out were not the only rostock residents safely behind closed doors at home .
according to the local ostsee zeitung newspaper , a number of parents are keeping their children at home during the summit .
one high school had a third of its 768 students stay home monday , although many returned on tuesday for classes .
will it spread ?
such disruption can be expected to spread beyond rostock as the summit proper gets underway on wednesday .
one of the seaside sanctuaries , warnemünde , has already had a taste of the slow creep of protests as around 10,000 demonstrators marched through the quaint port resort to the nearby military harbor on tuesday .
as the slow , winding carnival of the anti-militarization demonstration passed through the city , the pavements either side of the crowded street were full of curious bystanders .
a few , as if heeding a silent call of conscience , stepped off the curb and joined the flow , moved by the commitment of those involved or just by the current of the event itself .
" we all live in this world , " said an elderly gentleman who , along with his wife , made a spontaneous decision to protest .
" you ca n't leave it to others to save it , " he added .

this latest diplomatic exchange will do little to ease the strain .
" we can not agree on his declaration about the derailing of democratic reforms , " kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters ahead of a meeting of group of eight leaders in germany .
" russia is a democratic country that shares common world and common european values . "
earlier bush said during a speech in prague : " in russia , reforms that once promised to empower citizens have been derailed , with troubling implications for democratic development . "

the united states says the shield would guard against hypothetical future attacks from iran or north korea , neither of which are believed currently to possess missiles of a sufficient range to reach europe .

addressed at summit peskov said that " these painful questions " would be raised during the g8 summit starting wednesday , including during a meeting scheduled for thursday between putin and bush .
russia will openly talk of its concerns and will wait for a corresponding explanation and , of course , the president as always will be ready to give detailed explanations on questions of concern to our partners , " peskov said .

dw-world.de 's readers wrote in this week with their opinions on the pros and cons of globalization and their expectations for this week 's g8 summit . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i am from africa , looking at the g8 summit from a tiny window and with an empty stomach .
in a sense , i am saying that we in africa believe strongly that we are not part of the equation .
authorities are busy looting the scarce resources meant for the provision of shelter , water , and education for the masses .
many african leaders maintain bank accounts in the so-called advanced or first world countries .
the g8 countries over-subsidies food items to africa so that african peasant farmers can not break even by tilling the soil .
they also turn africa into a dumping ground for their inferior products and phased-out consumer items .
while africa remains poor , depending on hand-outs to prevent hiv / aids , bird flu , family control , but not much is being done in areas of malaria control , infant mortality , education , and job creation .
g8 or no g8 , africa - and , indeed , black africa - will remain poor . - alhassan jaoji , nigeria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa will stay poor , wrote one reader i am all for globalization bringing the far-flung countries closer to talk to each other about the economy , world debts for poor countries , trade talks , and climate change .
opposition to globalization is not only selfish , but is short-sighted and harmful to maintaining harmony with one another and harmony with the planet earth . - bernard , australia it is my fervent hope that europe will assume a greater leadership role at the g8 meeting rather than falling prey to arguments of and between the us and russia .
may the force be with europe ! - peter peters , thailand a global economy only works if we have global rules .
the agricultural sector is a good example where developed countries pay high subsidies and then they export their goods to underdeveloped ones , who of course can not compete . - heinz schwabe , germany globalization and the g8 have been rendered totally pointless because they do not serve to rein in a madman like george bush .
good grief , if the other seven members of this group of eight ca n't tell that this man does n't play with a full deck , they must be blind in one eye and not see out of the other .
while germany should n't even have invited bush , it even removes demonstrators who recognize a madman when they see one - unlike merkel , blair , and sarkozy . - an mongere , usa germans need to realize that rioting is becoming a national sport in germany , just as football hooliganism is to the british .
germans ' love of practicing politics " en masse " has evolved into an excuse for violence .
when the police are the ones who are getting hurt , this sad imbalance only encourages the more violent elements of society the next time around .
and what difference does it make if some clown hands a policemen a flower , if others with black masks on their face go on a violent rampage ?
even in a violent and somewhat hazardous country like america , neither the public nor the law enforcement community would tolerate this kind of nonsense . - paul falk , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioting has become a national sport in germany , opined a reader criminals who use protests as an excuse to commit violence should be locked up and made to repair the damage they cause .
as a public safety officer , my sympathies go out to all police and firemen who are under attack by the criminal element there .
my heart goes out to all the law-abiding citizens who have their peaceful lives disrupted in this manner . - john langenford , usa i would have never expected such numbers and such violence .
i am for freedom of speech but not for organized violence .
yesterday i saw on the internet how young people prepared for the demonstration .
picking up cobblestones to be thrown at the police is creating chaos , not change ; it backfires and does not help the poor .
service , generosity , respect , are means for a better world .
seeing what happens in organized germany makes me have a little understanding for putin , who forbids some such demonstrations . - elisabeth heptner , usa why are they talking about africa ?
you ca n't solve any problems there .
africa is n't in the g8 .
it should only be about g8 countries .
immigration should be first .
if the g8 encouraged high birth rates we would n't need immigrants .
the g8 creates more problems for itself and then wonders how it can solve them all . - john , usa no one can stop globalization , but we must take care to protect the poor who are suffering more in global competition .
there are good as well as bad effects of globalization .
we must reduce the bad effects and increase the good effects and for that purpose there must be watch dog - wise people who constantly the behavior of multinational corporations in balance . - ramesh raghuvanshi , india the leaders of the g8 will not hear nor do they care to hear from protestors or dissenters of any kind from anywhere . - william sarpas , usa please consider the sentiments of the protestors . - philip lau , singapore we can use taxation as a way to help people who are affected in a negative way .
we could take from energy taxes to retain displaced workers , or fund tax credits to the poor with the increased cost of bio-fuels or other forms of clean energy .
this is being talked about in the us . - lee davis , oregon , usa the major issue is environment . - karuna kanta pal , india the g8 nations must not be scared of nations like india and china and start to cut all power generation supplies from fossil fuel generation .
oil and gas reserves need to be used at a slower rate to sustain what we have left and bio-fuels need to be encouraged by the g8 nations .
and third world agricultural nations need to start growing the sugar cane , olives , canola , corn and harvest timber with the aid money supplied to them and not buy weapons or line their greedy pockets with the money .
if they want aid money they must have an administrator from the g8 nations managing the money being used for the production of renewable energy resources .
that will benefit the world supply . - paul , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : globalization improves , does n't worsen peoples ' lives proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now .
-lrb- 04.06.2007 -rrb- " a new day is dawning for globalization critics " around 100,000 demonstrators are expected at the g8 summit in june .

dw-world.de 's readers wrote in this week with their opinions on the pros and cons of globalization and their expectations for this week 's g8 summit . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i am from africa , looking at the g8 summit from a tiny window and with an empty stomach .
in a sense , i am saying that we in africa believe strongly that we are not part of the equation .
authorities are busy looting the scarce resources meant for the provision of shelter , water , and education for the masses .
many african leaders maintain bank accounts in the so-called advanced or first world countries .
the g8 countries over-subsidies food items to africa so that african peasant farmers can not break even by tilling the soil .
they also turn africa into a dumping ground for their inferior products and phased-out consumer items .
while africa remains poor , depending on hand-outs to prevent hiv / aids , bird flu , family control , but not much is being done in areas of malaria control , infant mortality , education , and job creation .
g8 or no g8 , africa - and , indeed , black africa - will remain poor . - alhassan jaoji , nigeria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa will stay poor , wrote one reader i am all for globalization bringing the far-flung countries closer to talk to each other about the economy , world debts for poor countries , trade talks , and climate change .
opposition to globalization is not only selfish , but is short-sighted and harmful to maintaining harmony with one another and harmony with the planet earth . - bernard , australia it is my fervent hope that europe will assume a greater leadership role at the g8 meeting rather than falling prey to arguments of and between the us and russia .
may the force be with europe ! - peter peters , thailand a global economy only works if we have global rules .
the agricultural sector is a good example where developed countries pay high subsidies and then they export their goods to underdeveloped ones , who of course can not compete . - heinz schwabe , germany globalization and the g8 have been rendered totally pointless because they do not serve to rein in a madman like george bush .
good grief , if the other seven members of this group of eight ca n't tell that this man does n't play with a full deck , they must be blind in one eye and not see out of the other .
while germany should n't even have invited bush , it even removes demonstrators who recognize a madman when they see one - unlike merkel , blair , and sarkozy . - an mongere , usa germans need to realize that rioting is becoming a national sport in germany , just as football hooliganism is to the british .
germans ' love of practicing politics " en masse " has evolved into an excuse for violence .
when the police are the ones who are getting hurt , this sad imbalance only encourages the more violent elements of society the next time around .
and what difference does it make if some clown hands a policemen a flower , if others with black masks on their face go on a violent rampage ?
even in a violent and somewhat hazardous country like america , neither the public nor the law enforcement community would tolerate this kind of nonsense . - paul falk , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioting has become a national sport in germany , opined a reader criminals who use protests as an excuse to commit violence should be locked up and made to repair the damage they cause .
as a public safety officer , my sympathies go out to all police and firemen who are under attack by the criminal element there .
my heart goes out to all the law-abiding citizens who have their peaceful lives disrupted in this manner . - john langenford , usa i would have never expected such numbers and such violence .
i am for freedom of speech but not for organized violence .
yesterday i saw on the internet how young people prepared for the demonstration .
picking up cobblestones to be thrown at the police is creating chaos , not change ; it backfires and does not help the poor .
service , generosity , respect , are means for a better world .
seeing what happens in organized germany makes me have a little understanding for putin , who forbids some such demonstrations . - elisabeth heptner , usa why are they talking about africa ?
you ca n't solve any problems there .
africa is n't in the g8 .
it should only be about g8 countries .
immigration should be first .
if the g8 encouraged high birth rates we would n't need immigrants .
the g8 creates more problems for itself and then wonders how it can solve them all . - john , usa no one can stop globalization , but we must take care to protect the poor who are suffering more in global competition .
there are good as well as bad effects of globalization .
we must reduce the bad effects and increase the good effects and for that purpose there must be watch dog - wise people who constantly the behavior of multinational corporations in balance . - ramesh raghuvanshi , india the leaders of the g8 will not hear nor do they care to hear from protestors or dissenters of any kind from anywhere . - william sarpas , usa please consider the sentiments of the protestors . - philip lau , singapore we can use taxation as a way to help people who are affected in a negative way .
we could take from energy taxes to retain displaced workers , or fund tax credits to the poor with the increased cost of bio-fuels or other forms of clean energy .
this is being talked about in the us . - lee davis , oregon , usa the major issue is environment . - karuna kanta pal , india the g8 nations must not be scared of nations like india and china and start to cut all power generation supplies from fossil fuel generation .
oil and gas reserves need to be used at a slower rate to sustain what we have left and bio-fuels need to be encouraged by the g8 nations .
and third world agricultural nations need to start growing the sugar cane , olives , canola , corn and harvest timber with the aid money supplied to them and not buy weapons or line their greedy pockets with the money .
if they want aid money they must have an administrator from the g8 nations managing the money being used for the production of renewable energy resources .
that will benefit the world supply . - paul , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : globalization improves , does n't worsen peoples ' lives proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now .
-lrb- 04.06.2007 -rrb- " a new day is dawning for globalization critics " around 100,000 demonstrators are expected at the g8 summit in june .
dw-world.de spoke with sven giegold , one of the founders of attac , a group which describes itself as a skeptical of globalization , about the protests .
-lrb- 22.05.2007 -rrb- turning globalization on its head globalization is not just about outsourcing jobs in the west to asia : indian companies are now creating jobs in europe .
-lrb- 25.03.2007 -rrb- feedback what are your thoughts on the g8 summit and globalization in general ?

dw-world.de 's readers wrote in this week with their opinions on the pros and cons of globalization and their expectations for this week 's g8 summit . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i am from africa , looking at the g8 summit from a tiny window and with an empty stomach .
in a sense , i am saying that we in africa believe strongly that we are not part of the equation .
authorities are busy looting the scarce resources meant for the provision of shelter , water , and education for the masses .
many african leaders maintain bank accounts in the so-called advanced or first world countries .
the g8 countries over-subsidies food items to africa so that african peasant farmers can not break even by tilling the soil .
they also turn africa into a dumping ground for their inferior products and phased-out consumer items .
while africa remains poor , depending on hand-outs to prevent hiv / aids , bird flu , family control , but not much is being done in areas of malaria control , infant mortality , education , and job creation .
g8 or no g8 , africa - and , indeed , black africa - will remain poor . - alhassan jaoji , nigeria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa will stay poor , wrote one reader i am all for globalization bringing the far-flung countries closer to talk to each other about the economy , world debts for poor countries , trade talks , and climate change .
opposition to globalization is not only selfish , but is short-sighted and harmful to maintaining harmony with one another and harmony with the planet earth . - bernard , australia it is my fervent hope that europe will assume a greater leadership role at the g8 meeting rather than falling prey to arguments of and between the us and russia .
may the force be with europe ! - peter peters , thailand a global economy only works if we have global rules .
the agricultural sector is a good example where developed countries pay high subsidies and then they export their goods to underdeveloped ones , who of course can not compete . - heinz schwabe , germany globalization and the g8 have been rendered totally pointless because they do not serve to rein in a madman like george bush .
good grief , if the other seven members of this group of eight ca n't tell that this man does n't play with a full deck , they must be blind in one eye and not see out of the other .
while germany should n't even have invited bush , it even removes demonstrators who recognize a madman when they see one - unlike merkel , blair , and sarkozy . - an mongere , usa germans need to realize that rioting is becoming a national sport in germany , just as football hooliganism is to the british .
germans ' love of practicing politics " en masse " has evolved into an excuse for violence .
when the police are the ones who are getting hurt , this sad imbalance only encourages the more violent elements of society the next time around .
and what difference does it make if some clown hands a policemen a flower , if others with black masks on their face go on a violent rampage ?
even in a violent and somewhat hazardous country like america , neither the public nor the law enforcement community would tolerate this kind of nonsense . - paul falk , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioting has become a national sport in germany , opined a reader criminals who use protests as an excuse to commit violence should be locked up and made to repair the damage they cause .
as a public safety officer , my sympathies go out to all police and firemen who are under attack by the criminal element there .
my heart goes out to all the law-abiding citizens who have their peaceful lives disrupted in this manner . - john langenford , usa i would have never expected such numbers and such violence .
i am for freedom of speech but not for organized violence .
yesterday i saw on the internet how young people prepared for the demonstration .
picking up cobblestones to be thrown at the police is creating chaos , not change ; it backfires and does not help the poor .
service , generosity , respect , are means for a better world .
seeing what happens in organized germany makes me have a little understanding for putin , who forbids some such demonstrations . - elisabeth heptner , usa why are they talking about africa ?
you ca n't solve any problems there .
africa is n't in the g8 .
it should only be about g8 countries .
immigration should be first .
if the g8 encouraged high birth rates we would n't need immigrants .
the g8 creates more problems for itself and then wonders how it can solve them all . - john , usa no one can stop globalization , but we must take care to protect the poor who are suffering more in global competition .
there are good as well as bad effects of globalization .
we must reduce the bad effects and increase the good effects and for that purpose there must be watch dog - wise people who constantly the behavior of multinational corporations in balance . - ramesh raghuvanshi , india the leaders of the g8 will not hear nor do they care to hear from protestors or dissenters of any kind from anywhere . - william sarpas , usa please consider the sentiments of the protestors . - philip lau , singapore we can use taxation as a way to help people who are affected in a negative way .
we could take from energy taxes to retain displaced workers , or fund tax credits to the poor with the increased cost of bio-fuels or other forms of clean energy .
this is being talked about in the us . - lee davis , oregon , usa the major issue is environment . - karuna kanta pal , india the g8 nations must not be scared of nations like india and china and start to cut all power generation supplies from fossil fuel generation .
oil and gas reserves need to be used at a slower rate to sustain what we have left and bio-fuels need to be encouraged by the g8 nations .
and third world agricultural nations need to start growing the sugar cane , olives , canola , corn and harvest timber with the aid money supplied to them and not buy weapons or line their greedy pockets with the money .
if they want aid money they must have an administrator from the g8 nations managing the money being used for the production of renewable energy resources .
that will benefit the world supply . - paul , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : globalization improves , does n't worsen peoples ' lives proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now .
-lrb- 04.06.2007 -rrb- " a new day is dawning for globalization critics " around 100,000 demonstrators are expected at the g8 summit in june .
dw-world.de spoke with sven giegold , one of the founders of attac , a group which describes itself as a skeptical of globalization , about the protests .
-lrb- 22.05.2007 -rrb- turning globalization on its head globalization is not just about outsourcing jobs in the west to asia : indian companies are now creating jobs in europe .
-lrb- 25.03.2007 -rrb- feedback what are your thoughts on the g8 summit and globalization in general ?

he voiced a " strong desire " to work with g8 nations on a new agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce dependence on foreign oil supplies . " some areas need discussion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush in heiligendamm on wednesday but the us president made no reference to merkel 's push for the developed countries of the g8 to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 percent of 1990 levels by 2050 , and to commit themselves to a global temperature rise of no more than two celsius degrees this century . merkel , who has said she will in no case back off the two-degree limit , diplomatically noted that there were " areas here and there " which needed further discussion . european commission president jose manuel barroso said he expected no definite agreement to emerge from the summit and repeated his criticism of the us approach . " i do n't expect this summit to establish targets , but i expect there will be recognition of the need to have targets , " said barroso , attending the summit as the head of the eu 's executive body . barros rues lack of leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso , with wife , called for leadership on the climate issue he added that the problem was not so much competition between different approaches , " but what is missing is leadership from some of our partners . " like merkel , barroso nevertheless welcomed the initiative on climate change put forward by bush last month , saying it marked an " evolution " in the us position . senior japanese foreign ministry official koji tsuruoka said definite goals would not be agreed but that the summit was rather " a golden opportunity to make clear at the level of heads of state and government that this is a problem of the highest priority . " japan 's goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan acknowledged it had not met kyoto standards he acknowledged that japan had failed to measure up to its commitments under the kyoto protocol .
japan 's greenhouse gas emissions had risen 8 percent , he said , and now the ambitious target was to cut emissions by 14 percent by 2012 . japanese prime minister shinzo abe would present a new action plan on climate change soon , tsuruoka said , adding that abe 's stated aim of cutting emissions by 50 percent by 2050 should be seen rather as a statement of vision rather than as a concrete goal . tsuruoka said japan 's aim was to draw all countries into a post-kyoto agreement , but that defined targets should be avoided as this could scare off some countries . setback for merkel merkel 's looming failure to secure clear targets at the summit were being seen in germany as the first major international setback the chancellor has suffered . in interviews published by the german media during the week leading up to the summit , merkel firmly committed herself to fixed targets on reducing carbon dioxide emissions and to restricting global warming to two degrees . the chancellor made clear she would not enter into " murky compromises " and added , " i can not negotiate on the two degrees . " in the new us initiative , put forward by bush last month , the emphasis is rather on achieving agreement on curbing greenhouse gas emissions among the world 's 15 main polluters , including the rapidly growing emerging economies of india and china . bush-putin conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel checked out putin 's g8 badge over the course of the afternoon , merkel had met with newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy , italian prime minister romano prodi , and russian president vladimir putin . putin 's conflict with the us over stationing portions of a missile shield in central europe had caused an uproar in the day or two just before the summit . on wednesday , us president bush toned down his criticism of putin , saying " russia is not an enemy . " protesters , police clash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as close as it gets : demonstrators with helicopters carrying g8 guests in the background meanwhile , the expected clashes between protesters and police continued to mark the event .
around 10,000 anti-capitalist protesters clashed with police and at one stage blocked all roads to the baltic resort . police turned water cannons on some 2,500 protesters in order to clear one of the roads to heiligendamm .
police detained some 160 protesters in the skirmishes . delegates from several g8 countries , including host germany , said the protests were limiting their ability to move around at the summit venue . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" some areas need discussion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush in heiligendamm on wednesday but the us president made no reference to merkel 's push for the developed countries of the g8 to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 percent of 1990 levels by 2050 , and to commit themselves to a global temperature rise of no more than two celsius degrees this century . merkel , who has said she will in no case back off the two-degree limit , diplomatically noted that there were " areas here and there " which needed further discussion . european commission president jose manuel barroso said he expected no definite agreement to emerge from the summit and repeated his criticism of the us approach . " i do n't expect this summit to establish targets , but i expect there will be recognition of the need to have targets , " said barroso , attending the summit as the head of the eu 's executive body . barros rues lack of leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso , with wife , called for leadership on the climate issue he added that the problem was not so much competition between different approaches , " but what is missing is leadership from some of our partners . " like merkel , barroso nevertheless welcomed the initiative on climate change put forward by bush last month , saying it marked an " evolution " in the us position . senior japanese foreign ministry official koji tsuruoka said definite goals would not be agreed but that the summit was rather " a golden opportunity to make clear at the level of heads of state and government that this is a problem of the highest priority . " japan 's goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan acknowledged it had not met kyoto standards he acknowledged that japan had failed to measure up to its commitments under the kyoto protocol .
japan 's greenhouse gas emissions had risen 8 percent , he said , and now the ambitious target was to cut emissions by 14 percent by 2012 . japanese prime minister shinzo abe would present a new action plan on climate change soon , tsuruoka said , adding that abe 's stated aim of cutting emissions by 50 percent by 2050 should be seen rather as a statement of vision rather than as a concrete goal . tsuruoka said japan 's aim was to draw all countries into a post-kyoto agreement , but that defined targets should be avoided as this could scare off some countries . setback for merkel merkel 's looming failure to secure clear targets at the summit were being seen in germany as the first major international setback the chancellor has suffered . in interviews published by the german media during the week leading up to the summit , merkel firmly committed herself to fixed targets on reducing carbon dioxide emissions and to restricting global warming to two degrees . the chancellor made clear she would not enter into " murky compromises " and added , " i can not negotiate on the two degrees . " in the new us initiative , put forward by bush last month , the emphasis is rather on achieving agreement on curbing greenhouse gas emissions among the world 's 15 main polluters , including the rapidly growing emerging economies of india and china . bush-putin conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel checked out putin 's g8 badge over the course of the afternoon , merkel had met with newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy , italian prime minister romano prodi , and russian president vladimir putin . putin 's conflict with the us over stationing portions of a missile shield in central europe had caused an uproar in the day or two just before the summit . on wednesday , us president bush toned down his criticism of putin , saying " russia is not an enemy . " protesters , police clash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as close as it gets : demonstrators with helicopters carrying g8 guests in the background meanwhile , the expected clashes between protesters and police continued to mark the event .
around 10,000 anti-capitalist protesters clashed with police and at one stage blocked all roads to the baltic resort . police turned water cannons on some 2,500 protesters in order to clear one of the roads to heiligendamm .
police detained some 160 protesters in the skirmishes . delegates from several g8 countries , including host germany , said the protests were limiting their ability to move around at the summit venue . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 06.06.2007 emerging nations visit the " rich country club " - the g8 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the five g8 guest countries met in march in preparation for this year 's summit brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa will join the leading industrial nations at the g8 summit .
according to a recent study , it 's doubtful that membership in the " club " will help the poor in these countries . without the five emerging guest nations , the g8 summit 's motto " growth and responsibility " couldn ’ t be implemented , said german chancellor angela merkel recently .
indeed , all five of them exhibited healthy growth in their gross domestic products in 2006 : china and india topped the group with 10.7 and 9.2 percent respectively , while south africa -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- , brazil -lrb- 4.4 percent -rrb- and mexico -lrb- 3.5 percent -rrb- came in strong .
according to the german office for foreign trade -lrb- bfai -rrb- in cologne , the upward trend is expected to continue in 2007 and 2008 .
economic growth encourages confidence on the international political playing field .
they have already become key players in the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and in climate debates , for example .
their businesses are expanding worldwide and representatives from these emerging nations are already questioning the legitimacy of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
in addition , brazil , india and south africa are aspiring to obtain a permanent seat in the united nations security council .
g20 represents world majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of emerging countries in political bodies wo n't affect poverty , say some experts in the wto , the " big five " belong to the so-called g20 , a group of emerging and developing nations that was founded in cancun , mexico in 2003 and represents two-thirds of the world 's population .
however , in international economic negotiations , the big five sometimes give the impression that they are already playing in a league of their own .
" the economic upturn of china , india , brazil and south africa does n't necessarily lead to a poverty-oriented global economic policy , " concluded a study by the aid organizations bread for the world and südwind institute , which is to be presented wednesday at the alternative summit in rostock .
" economic growth alone does n't help the poorest of the poor . "
the gap between rich and poor is growing even wider , particularly in brazil , mexico , india and south africa .
in the run-up to this year 's summit , there was talk of expanding the g8 - which currently represents only 13 percent of the world population - to the g13 .
however , this could weaken the position of the world 's poor , say experts .
the poor still lose out " the dominance of the wealthy industrialized countries in the world trade organization and the international monetary fund would be reduced , but the interests of poor people in emerging nations and the least-developed nations would still be pushed onto the back burner in the world trade system , " said reinhard koppe , development policy expert at bread for the world .
furthermore , the study reveals how power relationships have shifted over the past few years through the offensive economic policies of four of the largest emerging nations - china , india , brazil and south africa .
" all four states have become world powers in many sectors , not just in their regions but worldwide , " said koppe .
the study 's author friedel hütz-adams said that " established industrialized nations are no longer in a position to assert their own interests without making major compromises - both in the wto and in bilateral and regional treaties . "
strategies on the political front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 represents two thirds of the world 's population according to the study , brazil 's discourse within the wto focuses on close cooperation with the g20 countries and the nama 11 group -lrb- argentina , brazil , egypt , india , indonesia , namibia , philippines , south africa , tunisia and venezuela -rrb- , while making deals of its own behind the scenes . " the government in brazil is getting involved in the non-transparent structures of the wto by agreeing , together with india , to talks with the us , the eu and japan , " said the study .
china , which like brazil has only signed a handful of bilateral open-trade treaties , continues to focus on the wto negotiations and is prepared to support the positions of other emerging and developing countries .
conflict of interest is standing in the way , however , said hütz-adams .
in addition , china 's engagement in africa is now being seen as a threat by governments and companies from industrialized countries , added the author .
india sees itself as a spokesperson for developing countries on the international playing field , which could soon change .
hütz-adams sees the willingness of the indian government to join brazil in informal trade talks with the us , the eu and japan as a warning sign .
" no on knows whether india will stay connected with the goals of the g20 and g33 in the world trade organization negotiations , " he said .
the country has increasingly been distinguishing itself as an economic power and seems to be going its own way .
mexico continues to be an emerging country but , at the same time , is a member of oecd .
of the five " guest " nations at the g8 summit , its economy has opened up the most since the 1990s .
it maintains 13 free trade agreements with 42 other countries , including one with nafta since 1994 and with the eu since 2000 .
last year , the mexican government reduced customs duties on merchandise with 148 wto member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment has been a sticky issue with some major emerging nations like china after mexico joined nafta , cheap corn from the us flooded the mexican market and led to protests by farmers .
since mexico had increased the use of corn in ethanol production , it became scarce .
" that 's why there were tortilla rebellions and the country was noncommittal during the wto agricultural negotiations , " said hütz-adams .
what 's more , economic expansion in china and india is putting competitive pressure on mexico and brazil .
more influence for smaller countries the study named other differences between the major emerging countries as well .
brazil and south africa support a fundamental voting reform in the international monetary fund and the world bank that would give small countries more say .
india and china , on the other hand , want to enhance their own positions in both institutions .
it remains to be seen whether india and china will agree to the united states ' new climate initiative .
" that would require a parallel structure to the un where the small states would n't have any say anymore , " said hütz-adams .

strategies on the political front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 represents two thirds of the world 's population according to the study , brazil 's discourse within the wto focuses on close cooperation with the g20 countries and the nama 11 group -lrb- argentina , brazil , egypt , india , indonesia , namibia , philippines , south africa , tunisia and venezuela -rrb- , while making deals of its own behind the scenes . " the government in brazil is getting involved in the non-transparent structures of the wto by agreeing , together with india , to talks with the us , the eu and japan , " said the study .
china , which like brazil has only signed a handful of bilateral open-trade treaties , continues to focus on the wto negotiations and is prepared to support the positions of other emerging and developing countries .
conflict of interest is standing in the way , however , said hütz-adams .
in addition , china 's engagement in africa is now being seen as a threat by governments and companies from industrialized countries , added the author .
india sees itself as a spokesperson for developing countries on the international playing field , which could soon change .
hütz-adams sees the willingness of the indian government to join brazil in informal trade talks with the us , the eu and japan as a warning sign .
" no on knows whether india will stay connected with the goals of the g20 and g33 in the world trade organization negotiations , " he said .
the country has increasingly been distinguishing itself as an economic power and seems to be going its own way .
mexico continues to be an emerging country but , at the same time , is a member of oecd .
of the five " guest " nations at the g8 summit , its economy has opened up the most since the 1990s .
it maintains 13 free trade agreements with 42 other countries , including one with nafta since 1994 and with the eu since 2000 .
last year , the mexican government reduced customs duties on merchandise with 148 wto member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment has been a sticky issue with some major emerging nations like china after mexico joined nafta , cheap corn from the us flooded the mexican market and led to protests by farmers .
since mexico had increased the use of corn in ethanol production , it became scarce .
" that 's why there were tortilla rebellions and the country was noncommittal during the wto agricultural negotiations , " said hütz-adams .
what 's more , economic expansion in china and india is putting competitive pressure on mexico and brazil .
more influence for smaller countries the study named other differences between the major emerging countries as well .
brazil and south africa support a fundamental voting reform in the international monetary fund and the world bank that would give small countries more say .
india and china , on the other hand , want to enhance their own positions in both institutions .
it remains to be seen whether india and china will agree to the united states ' new climate initiative .
" that would require a parallel structure to the un where the small states would n't have any say anymore , " said hütz-adams .

moscow describes the planned missile shield as an aggressive step closer to russia 's borders .
addressed at summit peskov said that " these painful questions " would be raised during the g8 summit starting wednesday , including during a meeting scheduled for thursday between putin and bush .
russia will openly talk of its concerns and will wait for a corresponding explanation and , of course , the president as always will be ready to give detailed explanations on questions of concern to our partners , " peskov said .

this latest diplomatic exchange will do little to ease the strain .
" we can not agree on his declaration about the derailing of democratic reforms , " kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters ahead of a meeting of group of eight leaders in germany .
" russia is a democratic country that shares common world and common european values . "
earlier bush said during a speech in prague : " in russia , reforms that once promised to empower citizens have been derailed , with troubling implications for democratic development . "
on the attack peskov reiterated russia 's frequent complaint about us unilateralism , saying " one-sided decisions and double standards are inacceptable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the words coming out of the kremlin are sharp he also renewed moscow 's attack on the us plan to deploy an anti-missile system in the czech republic and poland , both former warsaw pact countries that are now members of nato and the european union .
" we have not received an explanation on the point of this shield or an explanation about whom it targets , " peskov said .
the united states says the shield would guard against hypothetical future attacks from iran or north korea , neither of which are believed currently to possess missiles of a sufficient range to reach europe .
moscow describes the planned missile shield as an aggressive step closer to russia 's borders .
addressed at summit peskov said that " these painful questions " would be raised during the g8 summit starting wednesday , including during a meeting scheduled for thursday between putin and bush .
russia will openly talk of its concerns and will wait for a corresponding explanation and , of course , the president as always will be ready to give detailed explanations on questions of concern to our partners , " peskov said .
however , he said he hoped the worsening rhetoric between moscow and washington will not " create any tension , much less confrontation . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 06.06.2007 emerging nations visit the " rich country club " - the g8 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the five g8 guest countries met in march in preparation for this year 's summit brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa will join the leading industrial nations at the g8 summit .
according to a recent study , it 's doubtful that membership in the " club " will help the poor in these countries . without the five emerging guest nations , the g8 summit 's motto " growth and responsibility " couldn ’ t be implemented , said german chancellor angela merkel recently .
indeed , all five of them exhibited healthy growth in their gross domestic products in 2006 : china and india topped the group with 10.7 and 9.2 percent respectively , while south africa -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- , brazil -lrb- 4.4 percent -rrb- and mexico -lrb- 3.5 percent -rrb- came in strong .
according to the german office for foreign trade -lrb- bfai -rrb- in cologne , the upward trend is expected to continue in 2007 and 2008 .
economic growth encourages confidence on the international political playing field .
they have already become key players in the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and in climate debates , for example .
their businesses are expanding worldwide and representatives from these emerging nations are already questioning the legitimacy of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
in addition , brazil , india and south africa are aspiring to obtain a permanent seat in the united nations security council .
g20 represents world majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of emerging countries in political bodies wo n't affect poverty , say some experts in the wto , the " big five " belong to the so-called g20 , a group of emerging and developing nations that was founded in cancun , mexico in 2003 and represents two-thirds of the world 's population .
however , in international economic negotiations , the big five sometimes give the impression that they are already playing in a league of their own .
" the economic upturn of china , india , brazil and south africa does n't necessarily lead to a poverty-oriented global economic policy , " concluded a study by the aid organizations bread for the world and südwind institute , which is to be presented wednesday at the alternative summit in rostock .
" economic growth alone does n't help the poorest of the poor . "
the gap between rich and poor is growing even wider , particularly in brazil , mexico , india and south africa .
in the run-up to this year 's summit , there was talk of expanding the g8 - which currently represents only 13 percent of the world population - to the g13 .
however , this could weaken the position of the world 's poor , say experts .
the poor still lose out " the dominance of the wealthy industrialized countries in the world trade organization and the international monetary fund would be reduced , but the interests of poor people in emerging nations and the least-developed nations would still be pushed onto the back burner in the world trade system , " said reinhard koppe , development policy expert at bread for the world .
furthermore , the study reveals how power relationships have shifted over the past few years through the offensive economic policies of four of the largest emerging nations - china , india , brazil and south africa .
" all four states have become world powers in many sectors , not just in their regions but worldwide , " said koppe .
the study 's author friedel hütz-adams said that " established industrialized nations are no longer in a position to assert their own interests without making major compromises - both in the wto and in bilateral and regional treaties . "
strategies on the political front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 represents two thirds of the world 's population according to the study , brazil 's discourse within the wto focuses on close cooperation with the g20 countries and the nama 11 group -lrb- argentina , brazil , egypt , india , indonesia , namibia , philippines , south africa , tunisia and venezuela -rrb- , while making deals of its own behind the scenes . " the government in brazil is getting involved in the non-transparent structures of the wto by agreeing , together with india , to talks with the us , the eu and japan , " said the study .
china , which like brazil has only signed a handful of bilateral open-trade treaties , continues to focus on the wto negotiations and is prepared to support the positions of other emerging and developing countries .
conflict of interest is standing in the way , however , said hütz-adams .
in addition , china 's engagement in africa is now being seen as a threat by governments and companies from industrialized countries , added the author .
india sees itself as a spokesperson for developing countries on the international playing field , which could soon change .
hütz-adams sees the willingness of the indian government to join brazil in informal trade talks with the us , the eu and japan as a warning sign .
" no on knows whether india will stay connected with the goals of the g20 and g33 in the world trade organization negotiations , " he said .
the country has increasingly been distinguishing itself as an economic power and seems to be going its own way .
mexico continues to be an emerging country but , at the same time , is a member of oecd .
of the five " guest " nations at the g8 summit , its economy has opened up the most since the 1990s .
it maintains 13 free trade agreements with 42 other countries , including one with nafta since 1994 and with the eu since 2000 .
last year , the mexican government reduced customs duties on merchandise with 148 wto member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment has been a sticky issue with some major emerging nations like china after mexico joined nafta , cheap corn from the us flooded the mexican market and led to protests by farmers .
since mexico had increased the use of corn in ethanol production , it became scarce .
" that 's why there were tortilla rebellions and the country was noncommittal during the wto agricultural negotiations , " said hütz-adams .
what 's more , economic expansion in china and india is putting competitive pressure on mexico and brazil .
more influence for smaller countries the study named other differences between the major emerging countries as well .
brazil and south africa support a fundamental voting reform in the international monetary fund and the world bank that would give small countries more say .
india and china , on the other hand , want to enhance their own positions in both institutions .
it remains to be seen whether india and china will agree to the united states ' new climate initiative .
" that would require a parallel structure to the un where the small states would n't have any say anymore , " said hütz-adams .

according to a recent study , it 's doubtful that membership in the " club " will help the poor in these countries . without the five emerging guest nations , the g8 summit 's motto " growth and responsibility " couldn ’ t be implemented , said german chancellor angela merkel recently .
indeed , all five of them exhibited healthy growth in their gross domestic products in 2006 : china and india topped the group with 10.7 and 9.2 percent respectively , while south africa -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- , brazil -lrb- 4.4 percent -rrb- and mexico -lrb- 3.5 percent -rrb- came in strong .
according to the german office for foreign trade -lrb- bfai -rrb- in cologne , the upward trend is expected to continue in 2007 and 2008 .
economic growth encourages confidence on the international political playing field .
they have already become key players in the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and in climate debates , for example .
their businesses are expanding worldwide and representatives from these emerging nations are already questioning the legitimacy of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
in addition , brazil , india and south africa are aspiring to obtain a permanent seat in the united nations security council .
g20 represents world majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of emerging countries in political bodies wo n't affect poverty , say some experts in the wto , the " big five " belong to the so-called g20 , a group of emerging and developing nations that was founded in cancun , mexico in 2003 and represents two-thirds of the world 's population .
however , in international economic negotiations , the big five sometimes give the impression that they are already playing in a league of their own .
" the economic upturn of china , india , brazil and south africa does n't necessarily lead to a poverty-oriented global economic policy , " concluded a study by the aid organizations bread for the world and südwind institute , which is to be presented wednesday at the alternative summit in rostock .
" economic growth alone does n't help the poorest of the poor . "
the gap between rich and poor is growing even wider , particularly in brazil , mexico , india and south africa .
in the run-up to this year 's summit , there was talk of expanding the g8 - which currently represents only 13 percent of the world population - to the g13 .
however , this could weaken the position of the world 's poor , say experts .
the poor still lose out " the dominance of the wealthy industrialized countries in the world trade organization and the international monetary fund would be reduced , but the interests of poor people in emerging nations and the least-developed nations would still be pushed onto the back burner in the world trade system , " said reinhard koppe , development policy expert at bread for the world .
furthermore , the study reveals how power relationships have shifted over the past few years through the offensive economic policies of four of the largest emerging nations - china , india , brazil and south africa .
" all four states have become world powers in many sectors , not just in their regions but worldwide , " said koppe .
the study 's author friedel hütz-adams said that " established industrialized nations are no longer in a position to assert their own interests without making major compromises - both in the wto and in bilateral and regional treaties . "
strategies on the political front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 represents two thirds of the world 's population according to the study , brazil 's discourse within the wto focuses on close cooperation with the g20 countries and the nama 11 group -lrb- argentina , brazil , egypt , india , indonesia , namibia , philippines , south africa , tunisia and venezuela -rrb- , while making deals of its own behind the scenes . " the government in brazil is getting involved in the non-transparent structures of the wto by agreeing , together with india , to talks with the us , the eu and japan , " said the study .
china , which like brazil has only signed a handful of bilateral open-trade treaties , continues to focus on the wto negotiations and is prepared to support the positions of other emerging and developing countries .
conflict of interest is standing in the way , however , said hütz-adams .
in addition , china 's engagement in africa is now being seen as a threat by governments and companies from industrialized countries , added the author .
india sees itself as a spokesperson for developing countries on the international playing field , which could soon change .
hütz-adams sees the willingness of the indian government to join brazil in informal trade talks with the us , the eu and japan as a warning sign .
" no on knows whether india will stay connected with the goals of the g20 and g33 in the world trade organization negotiations , " he said .
the country has increasingly been distinguishing itself as an economic power and seems to be going its own way .
mexico continues to be an emerging country but , at the same time , is a member of oecd .
of the five " guest " nations at the g8 summit , its economy has opened up the most since the 1990s .
it maintains 13 free trade agreements with 42 other countries , including one with nafta since 1994 and with the eu since 2000 .
last year , the mexican government reduced customs duties on merchandise with 148 wto member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment has been a sticky issue with some major emerging nations like china after mexico joined nafta , cheap corn from the us flooded the mexican market and led to protests by farmers .
since mexico had increased the use of corn in ethanol production , it became scarce .
" that 's why there were tortilla rebellions and the country was noncommittal during the wto agricultural negotiations , " said hütz-adams .
what 's more , economic expansion in china and india is putting competitive pressure on mexico and brazil .
more influence for smaller countries the study named other differences between the major emerging countries as well .
brazil and south africa support a fundamental voting reform in the international monetary fund and the world bank that would give small countries more say .
india and china , on the other hand , want to enhance their own positions in both institutions .
it remains to be seen whether india and china will agree to the united states ' new climate initiative .
" that would require a parallel structure to the un where the small states would n't have any say anymore , " said hütz-adams .

life here is usually sedate , which is why it is an oasis of calm for retirees and young families .
one gets the impression that nothing much happens here and that 's the way the locals like it .
even when there 's a major international summit happening nearby , there are very few indicators which suggest anything other than idyllic normality is , as usual , in abundance .
from time to time the cry of seagulls is interrupted by the dull thud of distant rotor blades as a military chopper circles overhead .
occasionally when traveling the undulating roads the picturesque view is disturbed by random crews of armor-clad cops guarding lonely crossroads .
but even then , their green overalls attempt to minimize the disruption to the surroundings by blending into the fields around them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if if were n't for the police vehicles , one local resident would n't have noticed a difference for the residents of heilingendamm and kühlungsborn , the arrival of the g8 leaders and the thousands of protestors has so far barely even registered .
" if it was n't for the police vehicles parked around town , i would n't even have noticed anything different , " said jörg kessling , a retired resident of kühlungsborn , the location of the summit 's media center and a staging post for many journalists and delegates .
" there seems to be more people here than usual but no more than in a busy month during the summer . "
sabina meller , an assistant in a local bakery in the seaside resort of heiligendamm , where the summit is being held , expected more of an impact .
" there have been a few more strangers around , more young people , but the streets are just as quiet as ever , " she said .
" anyway , the kempinski hotel is quite a way from the town center .
when the protestors come , they 'll probably miss us completely .
i do n't expect the same thing to happen here as in rostock … maybe at the fence but not here . "
protest town to feel the full effects of the g8 , one has to travel to rostock .
the residents of the ancient hanseatic city have already felt the impact of the protestors after a weekend of mass demonstrations laced with violence and chaos .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business has been slow in the rostock area the past few days jana beger stands in the doorway of her newsagent 's shop and watches with a concerned look as a group of colorful and boisterous protestors march past on their way to the main train station .
jana has lived every one of her 62 years in rostock and says that she has never witnessed anything to compare to the events of the weekend when thousands took to the streets and a minority fought the police .
" these ones do n't look so bad , " she says , her eyes narrowing behind thick glasses as she scans each passing face .
" it 's the ones in black you have to watch out for . "
her son christian stands protectively beside her .
while there have been no reports yet of willful damage to shops , the cobbled streets of the city have already been violated and some businesses have already boarded up their windows just to be sure .
christian guards his mother and the shop 's large glass façade just in case .
" i went for my usual run early on sunday morning and the city maintenance crews were still replacing the stones , " he says , in reference to the cobbles prized from the road to be used in saturday 's violence .
" when there are people like that out there , who will go to such lengths , you ca n't help to be on your guard , even if you are n't their principle target . "
staying home others are not concerned about the violent " black block " extremists laying the city to waste .
many shops were open over the weekend even though there was a marked reduction in the number of customers , perhaps a reflection of residents ' unwillingness to put themselves at potential risk .
rostock 's lively hub , the kröpeliner-tor-vorstadt -lrb- ktv -rrb- area of the city , was like a ghost town on sunday with bar and café staff twiddling their thumbs .
some even took the decision to close on monday , much to the satisfaction of those who were open for business .
" it was dead around here at the weekend , " says timo kastnic , a bar worker in the ktv .
" i 'd never seen it like that … ever .
but we still opened up monday and because the others were shut , we did a lot of business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : missing cobblestones were one side-effect of the nearby demonstrations drinkers and those wanting to eat out were not the only rostock residents safely behind closed doors at home .
according to the local ostsee zeitung newspaper , a number of parents are keeping their children at home during the summit .
one high school had a third of its 768 students stay home monday , although many returned on tuesday for classes .
will it spread ?
such disruption can be expected to spread beyond rostock as the summit proper gets underway on wednesday .
one of the seaside sanctuaries , warnemünde , has already had a taste of the slow creep of protests as around 10,000 demonstrators marched through the quaint port resort to the nearby military harbor on tuesday .
as the slow , winding carnival of the anti-militarization demonstration passed through the city , the pavements either side of the crowded street were full of curious bystanders .
a few , as if heeding a silent call of conscience , stepped off the curb and joined the flow , moved by the commitment of those involved or just by the current of the event itself .
" we all live in this world , " said an elderly gentleman who , along with his wife , made a spontaneous decision to protest .
" you ca n't leave it to others to save it , " he added .
" i would never travel to one of these things , i 'm too old for that , but while it 's here in my home town i can make my voice heard . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

life here is usually sedate , which is why it is an oasis of calm for retirees and young families .
one gets the impression that nothing much happens here and that 's the way the locals like it .
even when there 's a major international summit happening nearby , there are very few indicators which suggest anything other than idyllic normality is , as usual , in abundance .
from time to time the cry of seagulls is interrupted by the dull thud of distant rotor blades as a military chopper circles overhead .
occasionally when traveling the undulating roads the picturesque view is disturbed by random crews of armor-clad cops guarding lonely crossroads .
but even then , their green overalls attempt to minimize the disruption to the surroundings by blending into the fields around them .

" if it was n't for the police vehicles parked around town , i would n't even have noticed anything different , " said jörg kessling , a retired resident of kühlungsborn , the location of the summit 's media center and a staging post for many journalists and delegates .
" there seems to be more people here than usual but no more than in a busy month during the summer . "
sabina meller , an assistant in a local bakery in the seaside resort of heiligendamm , where the summit is being held , expected more of an impact .
" there have been a few more strangers around , more young people , but the streets are just as quiet as ever , " she said .
" anyway , the kempinski hotel is quite a way from the town center .
when the protestors come , they 'll probably miss us completely .
i do n't expect the same thing to happen here as in rostock … maybe at the fence but not here . "
protest town to feel the full effects of the g8 , one has to travel to rostock .
the residents of the ancient hanseatic city have already felt the impact of the protestors after a weekend of mass demonstrations laced with violence and chaos .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business has been slow in the rostock area the past few days jana beger stands in the doorway of her newsagent 's shop and watches with a concerned look as a group of colorful and boisterous protestors march past on their way to the main train station .
jana has lived every one of her 62 years in rostock and says that she has never witnessed anything to compare to the events of the weekend when thousands took to the streets and a minority fought the police .
" these ones do n't look so bad , " she says , her eyes narrowing behind thick glasses as she scans each passing face .
" it 's the ones in black you have to watch out for . "
her son christian stands protectively beside her .
while there have been no reports yet of willful damage to shops , the cobbled streets of the city have already been violated and some businesses have already boarded up their windows just to be sure .
christian guards his mother and the shop 's large glass façade just in case .
" i went for my usual run early on sunday morning and the city maintenance crews were still replacing the stones , " he says , in reference to the cobbles prized from the road to be used in saturday 's violence .
" when there are people like that out there , who will go to such lengths , you ca n't help to be on your guard , even if you are n't their principle target . "
staying home others are not concerned about the violent " black block " extremists laying the city to waste .
many shops were open over the weekend even though there was a marked reduction in the number of customers , perhaps a reflection of residents ' unwillingness to put themselves at potential risk .
rostock 's lively hub , the kröpeliner-tor-vorstadt -lrb- ktv -rrb- area of the city , was like a ghost town on sunday with bar and café staff twiddling their thumbs .
some even took the decision to close on monday , much to the satisfaction of those who were open for business .
" it was dead around here at the weekend , " says timo kastnic , a bar worker in the ktv .
" i 'd never seen it like that … ever .
but we still opened up monday and because the others were shut , we did a lot of business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : missing cobblestones were one side-effect of the nearby demonstrations drinkers and those wanting to eat out were not the only rostock residents safely behind closed doors at home .
according to the local ostsee zeitung newspaper , a number of parents are keeping their children at home during the summit .
one high school had a third of its 768 students stay home monday , although many returned on tuesday for classes .
will it spread ?
such disruption can be expected to spread beyond rostock as the summit proper gets underway on wednesday .
one of the seaside sanctuaries , warnemünde , has already had a taste of the slow creep of protests as around 10,000 demonstrators marched through the quaint port resort to the nearby military harbor on tuesday .
as the slow , winding carnival of the anti-militarization demonstration passed through the city , the pavements either side of the crowded street were full of curious bystanders .
a few , as if heeding a silent call of conscience , stepped off the curb and joined the flow , moved by the commitment of those involved or just by the current of the event itself .

as if to emphasize that whatever had gone before had just been a dry run for the main event , the police made their own statement to that effect .
the day started with what could only be described as widespread lockdown of infrastructure and ended with a heavy-handed clampdown on the opposition .
the arrival of the g8 heads had been a red letter day in the protestors ' diary from the very beginning .
even though their main target , us president george bush , had attempted to avoid the predicted mass picketing of laage airport by arriving a day earlier , there were still seven other leaders to vent anger against .
for the past few days , the issues had been the motivation to protest .
now the people responsible for those issues were coming and a predicted 8,000 to 10,000 demonstrators were ready to give them a welcome they would never forget .
police outnumber protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators on their way to the airport the police had other plans .
from the early morning , it was evident that the " two police officers for every protestor " rumor was no longer in dispute .
the massed ranks of heavily armored officers stationed on roads , bridges and railway tracks were sending out a visible message : you shall not pass .
the 16,000 regular police and 2,000 special officers drafted in for the summit were being used to full effect .
with the first arrival due to land at laage at 10 a.m. , hundreds of protestors streamed out of the rostock fischereihafen camp towards their own private vehicles and the specially organized buses waiting to take them the few kilometers to the airport while the morning was still in its infancy .
some of them did n't even make it out of the camp car park .
preventing protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police made it clear that demonstrators would not get past them the first full bus was ready to depart when it was surrounded by police wagons .
officers ordered the passengers out of the bus and the vehicle was slowly searched while bags and pockets were emptied on demand .
another bus arrived and was immediately impounded , its human cargo forced to get comfortable on the grass verge .
for how long , it is hard to say .
many never made it out of rostock .
there were alternative routes , however .
but security had not been the only reason why laage had been chosen as the arrival point .
it is horrendously difficult to get to by public transport and even more so when the roads and train tracks are closed down .
buses carrying protestors were stopped kilometers from the airport , unloaded and the passengers allowed to continue to a specified containment point away from laage on foot .
and these were the lucky ones .
mysteriously coincidental train malfunctions paralyzed the rail system just after rush hour leaving many protestors stranded and angry .
this would later contribute to frustration and violence .
few get through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers redirected protestors those who had set out just in time to avoid the main lockdown of the transport system around laage were met at the containment points by rows of riot police .
the plan had been to picket the airport at four main sites around its perimeter .
with numbers expected in the region of 8,000 demonstrators , it had been planned that around 2,000 would go to each .
the road blocks and train cancellations had contributed to a massive decimation of those numbers .
the few hundred which had gathered at the mouth of the airport 's service road milled around in front of the police , some muttering nervously about the prevalence of unit 23 , the hardest and most uncompromising officers bandied together from various forces to create an elite division .
various attempts to begin the demonstration were stopped by senior police officers .
there would be protests allowed , but only 50 people at a time would be let through the cordons to demonstrate at the airport 's gates .
from an expected crowd of 2,000 , as few as 37 protestors eventually made it to the gate .
once there , over 70 police officers blocked the entrance and forced the small group of protestors onto a grass verge opposite and held them there for an hour .
deflated demonstrators meanwhile , reports were phoned in to the group leader from an associate at bad doberan about a major incident involving over a thousand protestors who had been denied the chance to travel to laage and a large contingent of riot police .
according to the source in bad doberan , clashes had escalated quickly and tear gas and water cannons were being used to quell the unrest .
there was even an unsubstantiated report that a badly injured protestor had been denied medical assistance by police officers .
the mood of those at laage was already deflated before hearing this .
the planned blockade and show of strength had been turned into a pathetic joke by a well-coordinated and ruthless police operation .
by denying access to thousands and controlling to the footstep the movements of those which did make it to the boundaries of the airport , the police effectively removed all opposition at the point of entry for the g8 leaders .
and in bad doberan , they showed that they had learned the mistakes of the weekend where sheer numbers could not make up for the lack of preparation in dealing with a rioting mob .
on wednesday , the police struck hard and fast to end the unrest .
they more than made up for their shortcomings on previous unruly days .
on wednesday , they could claim a victory .
only in the future will it really be clear what was lost . nick amies , reporting from rostock send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 summit : it 's foolish to oppose it the demonstrators at the g8 summit in heiligendamm blame that group of nations for many of the world 's inequities .

ecb president jean-claude trichet said the bank 's monetary policy remained on " the accommodative side , " adding that wednesday 's move was to counter inflationary risks expected to ease in the near term before rising significantly later in the year .
wages were rising faster than the bank had expected , he said .
the bank revised upwards its 2007 inflation forecast in the 13-nation euro zone to 2 percent from 1.8 percent previously but held its prediction for next year at 2 percent , roughly consistent with its preferred level .
the bank has set itself an upper target limit for inflation of 2 percent because experience has shown that beyond this level , people anticipate price rises , thereby adding to inflationary pressures .
" still accommodative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euros on the move " after today 's increase , given the positive economic environment in the euro area , our monetary policy is still on the accommodative side , with overall financing conditions favorable , money and credit growth vigorous , and liquidity in the euro area ample , " trichet told a news conference .
a reference to an " accommodative " stance is seen as a signal that more rate rises could be approved in coming months but not necessarily at the next meeting of the bank 's policy-making body .
trichet said the bank was making no pre-commitment on future rate moves but also stressed that it would do whatever was needed to control inflation .
" the -lrb- ecb 's -rrb- governing council will monitor closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialize , " he said .

in london , the euro which had firmed before the decision , weakened on trichet 's comments on future rate policy that were seen as vague by traders .
the single european currency was changing hands at $ 1.3501 against $ 1.3519 late tuesday in new york .
prior to the announcement many market analysts were predicting a further tightening to 4.25 percent when the bank policymakers convene in september .
" a growing number of investors are even speculating about an increase to 4.5 percent , " said commerzbank treasurer ryohei muramatsu in tokyo .
the head of the german central bank , axel weber , who sits on the ecb 's governing council , left no doubt in a recent interview that further rate rises were likely .
" the current cycle of interest rate hikes has not reached its end , " he told the financial times .
" what is pretty clear is that we are in a stronger than previously expected recovery , " he said .
" if necessary we will also have to move into a territory that is portrayed as being restrictive , if that is needed to control inflation . "
perhaps unsettling for some although widely expected , the latest increase by the ecb was likely to unsettle political figures in several euro-zone members , notably france , who contend that the bank 's monetary policies are driving up the euro and dampening growth .
while interest rates in the 13-nation euro zone have been on the rise for the past year and a half , they have stagnated in the united states , where the benchmark federal funds rate has been at 5.25 percent since last june .

ecb president jean-claude trichet said the bank 's monetary policy remained on " the accommodative side , " adding that wednesday 's move was to counter inflationary risks expected to ease in the near term before rising significantly later in the year .
wages were rising faster than the bank had expected , he said .
the bank revised upwards its 2007 inflation forecast in the 13-nation euro zone to 2 percent from 1.8 percent previously but held its prediction for next year at 2 percent , roughly consistent with its preferred level .
the bank has set itself an upper target limit for inflation of 2 percent because experience has shown that beyond this level , people anticipate price rises , thereby adding to inflationary pressures .
" still accommodative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euros on the move " after today 's increase , given the positive economic environment in the euro area , our monetary policy is still on the accommodative side , with overall financing conditions favorable , money and credit growth vigorous , and liquidity in the euro area ample , " trichet told a news conference .
a reference to an " accommodative " stance is seen as a signal that more rate rises could be approved in coming months but not necessarily at the next meeting of the bank 's policy-making body .
trichet said the bank was making no pre-commitment on future rate moves but also stressed that it would do whatever was needed to control inflation .
" the -lrb- ecb 's -rrb- governing council will monitor closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialize , " he said .
raised euro zone growth forecast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president trichet the bank also wednesday raised its euro-zone growth forecast for this year to 2.6 percent from 2.5 percent and lowered its prediction for 2008 to 2.3 percent from 2.4 percent .
in london , the euro which had firmed before the decision , weakened on trichet 's comments on future rate policy that were seen as vague by traders .
the single european currency was changing hands at $ 1.3501 against $ 1.3519 late tuesday in new york .
prior to the announcement many market analysts were predicting a further tightening to 4.25 percent when the bank policymakers convene in september .
" a growing number of investors are even speculating about an increase to 4.5 percent , " said commerzbank treasurer ryohei muramatsu in tokyo .
the head of the german central bank , axel weber , who sits on the ecb 's governing council , left no doubt in a recent interview that further rate rises were likely .
" the current cycle of interest rate hikes has not reached its end , " he told the financial times .
" what is pretty clear is that we are in a stronger than previously expected recovery , " he said .
" if necessary we will also have to move into a territory that is portrayed as being restrictive , if that is needed to control inflation . "
perhaps unsettling for some although widely expected , the latest increase by the ecb was likely to unsettle political figures in several euro-zone members , notably france , who contend that the bank 's monetary policies are driving up the euro and dampening growth .
while interest rates in the 13-nation euro zone have been on the rise for the past year and a half , they have stagnated in the united states , where the benchmark federal funds rate has been at 5.25 percent since last june .

the differential reflects sharply different growth trends in europe and the united states .
" the euro area economy is moving from recovery to upswing , " the international monetary fund said in a report on tuesday , which foresaw euro-zone growth of 2.5 percent this year as well as sustained momentum in 2008 .
the european union 's executive commission predicts a pace of 2.6 percent this year , while the oecd in paris sees euro-zone expansion of 2.7 percent .
could eclipse us at those rates the euro zone would eclipse both the united states , where the imf is forecasting momentum of just 2.2 percent , and japan , 2.3 percent .
taking note of euro-zone growth and inflation prospects , the imf said on tuesday that higher interest ecb rates would be warranted .
meanwhile , in the united states , investors have reduced their expectations that the federal reserve , the central bank , will need to cut rates in response to a slowdown in the world 's largest economy .
the fed is also focused on fighting potential inflationary pressures amid surging fuel prices .
and on tuesday , fed chairman ben bernanke , who foresaw an improvement in the us economy in the coming months , said that " although core inflation seems likely to moderate gradually over time , the risks to this forecast remain to the upside .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.06.2007 european central bank raises rate to block inflation risks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank in frankfurt the european central bank raised its key interest rate by a quarter point to 4.0 percent wednesday and hinted that further hikes could come to tame inflation in a dynamic euro-zone economy . in the eighth increase in 18 months matching the vigor euro-zone growth , the european central bank lifted its benchmark refinancing rate by a quarter of a point to 4 percent , the highest reading for five and a half years .
ecb president jean-claude trichet said the bank 's monetary policy remained on " the accommodative side , " adding that wednesday 's move was to counter inflationary risks expected to ease in the near term before rising significantly later in the year .
wages were rising faster than the bank had expected , he said .
the bank revised upwards its 2007 inflation forecast in the 13-nation euro zone to 2 percent from 1.8 percent previously but held its prediction for next year at 2 percent , roughly consistent with its preferred level .
the bank has set itself an upper target limit for inflation of 2 percent because experience has shown that beyond this level , people anticipate price rises , thereby adding to inflationary pressures .
" still accommodative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euros on the move " after today 's increase , given the positive economic environment in the euro area , our monetary policy is still on the accommodative side , with overall financing conditions favorable , money and credit growth vigorous , and liquidity in the euro area ample , " trichet told a news conference .
a reference to an " accommodative " stance is seen as a signal that more rate rises could be approved in coming months but not necessarily at the next meeting of the bank 's policy-making body .
trichet said the bank was making no pre-commitment on future rate moves but also stressed that it would do whatever was needed to control inflation .
" the -lrb- ecb 's -rrb- governing council will monitor closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialize , " he said .
raised euro zone growth forecast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president trichet the bank also wednesday raised its euro-zone growth forecast for this year to 2.6 percent from 2.5 percent and lowered its prediction for 2008 to 2.3 percent from 2.4 percent .
in london , the euro which had firmed before the decision , weakened on trichet 's comments on future rate policy that were seen as vague by traders .
the single european currency was changing hands at $ 1.3501 against $ 1.3519 late tuesday in new york .
prior to the announcement many market analysts were predicting a further tightening to 4.25 percent when the bank policymakers convene in september .
" a growing number of investors are even speculating about an increase to 4.5 percent , " said commerzbank treasurer ryohei muramatsu in tokyo .
the head of the german central bank , axel weber , who sits on the ecb 's governing council , left no doubt in a recent interview that further rate rises were likely .
" the current cycle of interest rate hikes has not reached its end , " he told the financial times .
" what is pretty clear is that we are in a stronger than previously expected recovery , " he said .
" if necessary we will also have to move into a territory that is portrayed as being restrictive , if that is needed to control inflation . "
perhaps unsettling for some although widely expected , the latest increase by the ecb was likely to unsettle political figures in several euro-zone members , notably france , who contend that the bank 's monetary policies are driving up the euro and dampening growth .
while interest rates in the 13-nation euro zone have been on the rise for the past year and a half , they have stagnated in the united states , where the benchmark federal funds rate has been at 5.25 percent since last june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the eigth interest rate increase in 18 months that differential has made the euro more attractive to investors , increasing its value and thereby - in principle - threatening the competitiveness of euro-zone exports and ultimately growth .
the differential reflects sharply different growth trends in europe and the united states .
" the euro area economy is moving from recovery to upswing , " the international monetary fund said in a report on tuesday , which foresaw euro-zone growth of 2.5 percent this year as well as sustained momentum in 2008 .
the european union 's executive commission predicts a pace of 2.6 percent this year , while the oecd in paris sees euro-zone expansion of 2.7 percent .
could eclipse us at those rates the euro zone would eclipse both the united states , where the imf is forecasting momentum of just 2.2 percent , and japan , 2.3 percent .
taking note of euro-zone growth and inflation prospects , the imf said on tuesday that higher interest ecb rates would be warranted .
meanwhile , in the united states , investors have reduced their expectations that the federal reserve , the central bank , will need to cut rates in response to a slowdown in the world 's largest economy .
the fed is also focused on fighting potential inflationary pressures amid surging fuel prices .
and on tuesday , fed chairman ben bernanke , who foresaw an improvement in the us economy in the coming months , said that " although core inflation seems likely to moderate gradually over time , the risks to this forecast remain to the upside .

ever since their four-year-old daughter went missing from a holiday resort in portugal 's algarve region on may 3 , gerry and kate mccann have launched a high profile campaign to find madeleine , who was allegedly abducted from the bedroom of the villa where they stayed . the british couple , who are doctors , had left her and her two-year-old twin siblings , who were unharmed , in the apartment , while they went to a restaurant on the premises . they have already met pope benedict xvi in rome and traveled to madrid , which was the start of their tour of european capitals to raise awareness for their daughter 's disappearance . now they have publicized their appeal in germany since german and dutch tourists make up the majority of foreign tourists in algarve . publicizing appeal in germany " we are here to ask the german public for help in searching for our little daughter , " gerry mccann announced at a press conference in berlin with his wife kate at his side . the couple asked german tourists to look through holiday photographs taken in portugal last month to see whether the little girl , and perhaps also her abductor , might be in the background .
when a journalist suggested that they could in some way be involved in the abduction of their child , gerry mccann retorted : " i have never heard before that anyone considers us suspects in this and the portuguese police certainly do n't . " the case has captured considerable attention from the german media .
bild , the mass circulation tabloid , published an open letter to the mccanns from brigitta sirny , the mother of the austrian girl natascha kampusch , who had been kidnapped as a 10-year-old on her way to school and held in captivity for more than eight years .

i have suffered countless hours of despair .
hours in which i kept asking myself : why ?
why my child ?
who has done this ?
who would kidnap a defenseless child ?
could i have stopped it ?
did a lapse of a few minutes cost years of my child 's life ? " the newspaper also quoted sirny as saying that publicizing the case , which became a sensation in germany , was the right thing to do , " because the worst that could happen for a kidnapped child is to be forgotten . " there is still hope in an interview with german newspaper berliner morgenpost on sunday , gerry mccann said that there was still hope . " as long as there is hope , we are not giving up , " he said .
kate mccann said she hoped madeleine was safe and was being cared for . " we know there are evil people out there , but there are also confused people , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 06.06.2007 g8 summit : it 's foolish to oppose it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demonstrators at the g8 summit in heiligendamm blame that group of nations for many of the world 's inequities .
but dw 's henrik böhme says their view is one-sided , myopic and unfair . if a group of nations is responsible for more than two-thirds of world trade and pays more than three-quarters of the world 's financial aid , why should n't those countries meet to talk to one another ?
what 's the problem with analyzing the world economic situation to identify potential problems and come up with solutions ?
is it wrong to invite representatives from africa , china and india and start a dialogue ? admittedly the g8 needs to bridge the gap between world leaders and ordinary people .
the last time , germany hosted a g8 summit , in cologne in 1999 , then-us president bill clinton was able to walk outside his hotel and visit a brew-pub . but in the wake of the riots in genoa in 2001 , not to mention the terrorist attacks of september 11th , the world has changed and the barriers have gotten much higher .
but that 's no reason for world leaders not to talk about initiatives to relieve poverty or to fight aids and other deadly diseases . there 's no way to solve all the world 's problems in three days .
but the summit is the first step in a process that will be continued on various levels around the world . moreover , globalization is not a g8 invention .
arguably , globalization began in 1620 when the first shipment of tea arrived from japan in the port of amsterdam .
globalization is not some outside phenomenon afflicting the world , but something that we , as world citizens , can influence and direct . that 's a fact many of the demonstrators choose to ignore .
blaming the g8 for everything that 's wrong in the world is what 's wrong .
heiligendamm is just a symbol for a collection of problems that have no one address . for that 's reason , it 's foolish to oppose the g8 summit in knee-jerk fashion .
we no longer live in a world of clearly defined good and evil . or to pose the question the other way around : would the world be any better a place , if there were no g8 summits ? henrik böhme is a business editor at dw radio -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

outlook is bleak for big strides on climate issues germany 's agenda for the g8 summit ranges from africa and trade to hedge funds , relations with russia , the middle east and kosovo .
but it is the climate that is getting the most heat .
-lrb- 06.06.2007 -rrb- emerging nations visit the " rich country club " - the g8 brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa will join the leading industrial nations at the g8 summit .
according to a recent study , it 's doubtful that membership in the " club " will help the poor in these countries .

but it is the climate that is getting the most heat . german chancellor angela merkel has made climate change and the challenges to combat it a key issue at the group of eight summit she is hosting at the baltic coastal resort of heiligendamm in germany .
observers are saying a substantial outcome is unlikely , however .
and in recent statements , merkel has tried to put the stress on at least getting the g8 countries to agree to keep at least agreeing to keep talks on climate change within a united nations framework .
" in heiligendamm we want to give impetus to the negotiations on global climate protection , " the chancellor said .
" i hope there will be a signal from heiligendamm that the countries represented there clearly recognize their collective responsibility , " she said .
with the world leaders from industrialized nations attending the meeting , some consensus about how to tackle the climate change problem could be possible .
no fixed targets likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has set climate high on the agenda but german press agency dpa reported wednesday morning that the united states and germany had apparently failed to agree on fixed targets in the fight against global warming in talks ahead of the summit .
and us president george w. bush 's chief environment adviser , james connaughton , has said the summit would end without an agreement on fixed targets .
connaughton said each country had to set its own targets .
this was not only washington 's view but also that of , for instance , japan and canada , he said .
it would take more time until all leading industrialized nations could agree on a joint vision .
however , british prime minister tony blair said wednesday he believes he can persuade bush to agree for the first time to a global target for a " substantial cut " in greenhouse gas emissions .
in an interview with the guardian newspaper wednesday , blair said that america was " on the move " in its position on climate change .
last-ditch effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has not endorsed the kyoto protocol to limit emissions chancellor merkel was to hold a pre-summit lunch meeting with bush on wednesday in a bid to find common ground on climate change .
the summit officially begins with a formal dinner later in the evening . last week , the chancellor had welcomed bush 's call for a new strategy on tackling global warming through joint action by the world 's top polluters - including china and india - as a " positive " step .
but merkel has also made clear that she will still press g8 leaders to commit to cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- .
support from other nations germany 's plan for a binding pact has won qualified support from some nations , but bush last week unveiled his own proposals and said a long-term goal for reducing greenhouses gases could be set by the end of 2008 .
merkel wants the g8 to guide other nations towards negotiations due to take place in december to find a successor to the kyoto protocol .

but it is the climate that is getting the most heat . german chancellor angela merkel has made climate change and the challenges to combat it a key issue at the group of eight summit she is hosting at the baltic coastal resort of heiligendamm in germany .
observers are saying a substantial outcome is unlikely , however .
and in recent statements , merkel has tried to put the stress on at least getting the g8 countries to agree to keep at least agreeing to keep talks on climate change within a united nations framework .
" in heiligendamm we want to give impetus to the negotiations on global climate protection , " the chancellor said .
" i hope there will be a signal from heiligendamm that the countries represented there clearly recognize their collective responsibility , " she said .
with the world leaders from industrialized nations attending the meeting , some consensus about how to tackle the climate change problem could be possible .
no fixed targets likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has set climate high on the agenda but german press agency dpa reported wednesday morning that the united states and germany had apparently failed to agree on fixed targets in the fight against global warming in talks ahead of the summit .
and us president george w. bush 's chief environment adviser , james connaughton , has said the summit would end without an agreement on fixed targets .
connaughton said each country had to set its own targets .
this was not only washington 's view but also that of , for instance , japan and canada , he said .
it would take more time until all leading industrialized nations could agree on a joint vision .
however , british prime minister tony blair said wednesday he believes he can persuade bush to agree for the first time to a global target for a " substantial cut " in greenhouse gas emissions .
in an interview with the guardian newspaper wednesday , blair said that america was " on the move " in its position on climate change .
last-ditch effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has not endorsed the kyoto protocol to limit emissions chancellor merkel was to hold a pre-summit lunch meeting with bush on wednesday in a bid to find common ground on climate change .
the summit officially begins with a formal dinner later in the evening . last week , the chancellor had welcomed bush 's call for a new strategy on tackling global warming through joint action by the world 's top polluters - including china and india - as a " positive " step .
but merkel has also made clear that she will still press g8 leaders to commit to cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- .
support from other nations germany 's plan for a binding pact has won qualified support from some nations , but bush last week unveiled his own proposals and said a long-term goal for reducing greenhouses gases could be set by the end of 2008 .
merkel wants the g8 to guide other nations towards negotiations due to take place in december to find a successor to the kyoto protocol .
the 1997 kyoto protocol , named after japan 's ancient capital , where it was signed , is the world 's first treaty mandating emission cuts and will expire in 2012 .

no fixed targets likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has set climate high on the agenda but german press agency dpa reported wednesday morning that the united states and germany had apparently failed to agree on fixed targets in the fight against global warming in talks ahead of the summit .
and us president george w. bush 's chief environment adviser , james connaughton , has said the summit would end without an agreement on fixed targets .
connaughton said each country had to set its own targets .
this was not only washington 's view but also that of , for instance , japan and canada , he said .
it would take more time until all leading industrialized nations could agree on a joint vision .
however , british prime minister tony blair said wednesday he believes he can persuade bush to agree for the first time to a global target for a " substantial cut " in greenhouse gas emissions .
in an interview with the guardian newspaper wednesday , blair said that america was " on the move " in its position on climate change .
last-ditch effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has not endorsed the kyoto protocol to limit emissions chancellor merkel was to hold a pre-summit lunch meeting with bush on wednesday in a bid to find common ground on climate change .
the summit officially begins with a formal dinner later in the evening . last week , the chancellor had welcomed bush 's call for a new strategy on tackling global warming through joint action by the world 's top polluters - including china and india - as a " positive " step .
but merkel has also made clear that she will still press g8 leaders to commit to cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- .
support from other nations germany 's plan for a binding pact has won qualified support from some nations , but bush last week unveiled his own proposals and said a long-term goal for reducing greenhouses gases could be set by the end of 2008 .
merkel wants the g8 to guide other nations towards negotiations due to take place in december to find a successor to the kyoto protocol .
the 1997 kyoto protocol , named after japan 's ancient capital , where it was signed , is the world 's first treaty mandating emission cuts and will expire in 2012 .
on tuesday , the european union - represented by merkel as the current eu president - and japan agreed to take the lead in forging a successor to kyoto . they jointly proposed to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
bildunterschrift : police and protestors clashed before the summit " the eu and japan are committed to take strong leadership towards the development of a fair , flexible , effective and comprehensive un post-2012 framework that ensures the participation of all major emitting countries , " a joint statement said after the tuesday meeting .
developing countries ' role while the eu and japan insisted that developed countries should play a vital role in fighting global warming , they also called for a " fair contribution " by developing countries .
" we have to take action under a un framework so that all members of the international community can participate bindingly , " merkel said after talks with japanese prime minister shinzo abe in berlin tuesday .
merkel has also repeatedly said that talks on climate change must be within a united nations framework .
earlier in the week , merkel made a statment to that effect , together with canadian prime minister stephen harper .
president bush will also meet japan 's prime minister shinzo abe before the summit begins .
russia also in limelight g8 members include germany , france , britain , italy , japan , the united states , canada and russia .
the european commission is also represented at all meetings .

other non-g8 members at the meeting include the leaders of algeria , egypt , ghana , nigeria and senegal .
another issue likely to take center-stage at the summit is the west 's relations with russia , with russian president vladimir putin attending the meeting .
both chancellor merkel and us president bush are set to hold bilateral talks with putin in a bid to defuse rising east-west tensions .

but it is the climate that is getting the most heat . german chancellor angela merkel has made climate change and the challenges to combat it a key issue at the group of eight summit she is hosting at the baltic coastal resort of heiligendamm in germany .
observers are saying a substantial outcome is unlikely , however .
and in recent statements , merkel has tried to put the stress on at least getting the g8 countries to agree to keep at least agreeing to keep talks on climate change within a united nations framework .
" in heiligendamm we want to give impetus to the negotiations on global climate protection , " the chancellor said .
" i hope there will be a signal from heiligendamm that the countries represented there clearly recognize their collective responsibility , " she said .

as if to emphasize that whatever had gone before had just been a dry run for the main event , the police made their own statement to that effect .
the day started with what could only be described as widespread lockdown of infrastructure and ended with a heavy-handed clampdown on the opposition .
the arrival of the g8 heads had been a red letter day in the protestors ' diary from the very beginning .
even though their main target , us president george bush , had attempted to avoid the predicted mass picketing of laage airport by arriving a day earlier , there were still seven other leaders to vent anger against .
for the past few days , the issues had been the motivation to protest .
now the people responsible for those issues were coming and a predicted 8,000 to 10,000 demonstrators were ready to give them a welcome they would never forget .
police outnumber protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators on their way to the airport the police had other plans .
from the early morning , it was evident that the " two police officers for every protestor " rumor was no longer in dispute .
the massed ranks of heavily armored officers stationed on roads , bridges and railway tracks were sending out a visible message : you shall not pass .
the 16,000 regular police and 2,000 special officers drafted in for the summit were being used to full effect .
with the first arrival due to land at laage at 10 a.m. , hundreds of protestors streamed out of the rostock fischereihafen camp towards their own private vehicles and the specially organized buses waiting to take them the few kilometers to the airport while the morning was still in its infancy .

another bus arrived and was immediately impounded , its human cargo forced to get comfortable on the grass verge .
for how long , it is hard to say .
many never made it out of rostock .
there were alternative routes , however .
but security had not been the only reason why laage had been chosen as the arrival point .
it is horrendously difficult to get to by public transport and even more so when the roads and train tracks are closed down .
buses carrying protestors were stopped kilometers from the airport , unloaded and the passengers allowed to continue to a specified containment point away from laage on foot .
and these were the lucky ones .
mysteriously coincidental train malfunctions paralyzed the rail system just after rush hour leaving many protestors stranded and angry .

the plan had been to picket the airport at four main sites around its perimeter .
with numbers expected in the region of 8,000 demonstrators , it had been planned that around 2,000 would go to each .
the road blocks and train cancellations had contributed to a massive decimation of those numbers .
the few hundred which had gathered at the mouth of the airport 's service road milled around in front of the police , some muttering nervously about the prevalence of unit 23 , the hardest and most uncompromising officers bandied together from various forces to create an elite division .
various attempts to begin the demonstration were stopped by senior police officers .
there would be protests allowed , but only 50 people at a time would be let through the cordons to demonstrate at the airport 's gates .
from an expected crowd of 2,000 , as few as 37 protestors eventually made it to the gate .
once there , over 70 police officers blocked the entrance and forced the small group of protestors onto a grass verge opposite and held them there for an hour .
deflated demonstrators meanwhile , reports were phoned in to the group leader from an associate at bad doberan about a major incident involving over a thousand protestors who had been denied the chance to travel to laage and a large contingent of riot police .
according to the source in bad doberan , clashes had escalated quickly and tear gas and water cannons were being used to quell the unrest .
there was even an unsubstantiated report that a badly injured protestor had been denied medical assistance by police officers .
the mood of those at laage was already deflated before hearing this .
the planned blockade and show of strength had been turned into a pathetic joke by a well-coordinated and ruthless police operation .
by denying access to thousands and controlling to the footstep the movements of those which did make it to the boundaries of the airport , the police effectively removed all opposition at the point of entry for the g8 leaders .
and in bad doberan , they showed that they had learned the mistakes of the weekend where sheer numbers could not make up for the lack of preparation in dealing with a rioting mob .
on wednesday , the police struck hard and fast to end the unrest .
they more than made up for their shortcomings on previous unruly days .

as if to emphasize that whatever had gone before had just been a dry run for the main event , the police made their own statement to that effect .
the day started with what could only be described as widespread lockdown of infrastructure and ended with a heavy-handed clampdown on the opposition .
the arrival of the g8 heads had been a red letter day in the protestors ' diary from the very beginning .
even though their main target , us president george bush , had attempted to avoid the predicted mass picketing of laage airport by arriving a day earlier , there were still seven other leaders to vent anger against .
for the past few days , the issues had been the motivation to protest .
now the people responsible for those issues were coming and a predicted 8,000 to 10,000 demonstrators were ready to give them a welcome they would never forget .
police outnumber protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators on their way to the airport the police had other plans .
from the early morning , it was evident that the " two police officers for every protestor " rumor was no longer in dispute .
the massed ranks of heavily armored officers stationed on roads , bridges and railway tracks were sending out a visible message : you shall not pass .
the 16,000 regular police and 2,000 special officers drafted in for the summit were being used to full effect .
with the first arrival due to land at laage at 10 a.m. , hundreds of protestors streamed out of the rostock fischereihafen camp towards their own private vehicles and the specially organized buses waiting to take them the few kilometers to the airport while the morning was still in its infancy .
some of them did n't even make it out of the camp car park .
preventing protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police made it clear that demonstrators would not get past them the first full bus was ready to depart when it was surrounded by police wagons .
officers ordered the passengers out of the bus and the vehicle was slowly searched while bags and pockets were emptied on demand .
another bus arrived and was immediately impounded , its human cargo forced to get comfortable on the grass verge .
for how long , it is hard to say .
many never made it out of rostock .
there were alternative routes , however .
but security had not been the only reason why laage had been chosen as the arrival point .
it is horrendously difficult to get to by public transport and even more so when the roads and train tracks are closed down .
buses carrying protestors were stopped kilometers from the airport , unloaded and the passengers allowed to continue to a specified containment point away from laage on foot .
and these were the lucky ones .
mysteriously coincidental train malfunctions paralyzed the rail system just after rush hour leaving many protestors stranded and angry .
this would later contribute to frustration and violence .
few get through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers redirected protestors those who had set out just in time to avoid the main lockdown of the transport system around laage were met at the containment points by rows of riot police .
the plan had been to picket the airport at four main sites around its perimeter .
with numbers expected in the region of 8,000 demonstrators , it had been planned that around 2,000 would go to each .
the road blocks and train cancellations had contributed to a massive decimation of those numbers .
the few hundred which had gathered at the mouth of the airport 's service road milled around in front of the police , some muttering nervously about the prevalence of unit 23 , the hardest and most uncompromising officers bandied together from various forces to create an elite division .

dw-world.de 's readers wrote in this week with their opinions on the pros and cons of globalization and their expectations for this week 's g8 summit . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i am from africa , looking at the g8 summit from a tiny window and with an empty stomach .
in a sense , i am saying that we in africa believe strongly that we are not part of the equation .
authorities are busy looting the scarce resources meant for the provision of shelter , water , and education for the masses .
many african leaders maintain bank accounts in the so-called advanced or first world countries .
the g8 countries over-subsidies food items to africa so that african peasant farmers can not break even by tilling the soil .
they also turn africa into a dumping ground for their inferior products and phased-out consumer items .
while africa remains poor , depending on hand-outs to prevent hiv / aids , bird flu , family control , but not much is being done in areas of malaria control , infant mortality , education , and job creation .
g8 or no g8 , africa - and , indeed , black africa - will remain poor . - alhassan jaoji , nigeria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa will stay poor , wrote one reader i am all for globalization bringing the far-flung countries closer to talk to each other about the economy , world debts for poor countries , trade talks , and climate change .
opposition to globalization is not only selfish , but is short-sighted and harmful to maintaining harmony with one another and harmony with the planet earth . - bernard , australia it is my fervent hope that europe will assume a greater leadership role at the g8 meeting rather than falling prey to arguments of and between the us and russia .
may the force be with europe ! - peter peters , thailand a global economy only works if we have global rules .
the agricultural sector is a good example where developed countries pay high subsidies and then they export their goods to underdeveloped ones , who of course can not compete . - heinz schwabe , germany globalization and the g8 have been rendered totally pointless because they do not serve to rein in a madman like george bush .
good grief , if the other seven members of this group of eight ca n't tell that this man does n't play with a full deck , they must be blind in one eye and not see out of the other .
while germany should n't even have invited bush , it even removes demonstrators who recognize a madman when they see one - unlike merkel , blair , and sarkozy . - an mongere , usa germans need to realize that rioting is becoming a national sport in germany , just as football hooliganism is to the british .
germans ' love of practicing politics " en masse " has evolved into an excuse for violence .
when the police are the ones who are getting hurt , this sad imbalance only encourages the more violent elements of society the next time around .
and what difference does it make if some clown hands a policemen a flower , if others with black masks on their face go on a violent rampage ?
even in a violent and somewhat hazardous country like america , neither the public nor the law enforcement community would tolerate this kind of nonsense . - paul falk , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioting has become a national sport in germany , opined a reader criminals who use protests as an excuse to commit violence should be locked up and made to repair the damage they cause .
as a public safety officer , my sympathies go out to all police and firemen who are under attack by the criminal element there .
my heart goes out to all the law-abiding citizens who have their peaceful lives disrupted in this manner . - john langenford , usa i would have never expected such numbers and such violence .
i am for freedom of speech but not for organized violence .
yesterday i saw on the internet how young people prepared for the demonstration .
picking up cobblestones to be thrown at the police is creating chaos , not change ; it backfires and does not help the poor .
service , generosity , respect , are means for a better world .
seeing what happens in organized germany makes me have a little understanding for putin , who forbids some such demonstrations . - elisabeth heptner , usa why are they talking about africa ?
you ca n't solve any problems there .
africa is n't in the g8 .
it should only be about g8 countries .
immigration should be first .
if the g8 encouraged high birth rates we would n't need immigrants .
the g8 creates more problems for itself and then wonders how it can solve them all . - john , usa no one can stop globalization , but we must take care to protect the poor who are suffering more in global competition .
there are good as well as bad effects of globalization .
we must reduce the bad effects and increase the good effects and for that purpose there must be watch dog - wise people who constantly the behavior of multinational corporations in balance . - ramesh raghuvanshi , india the leaders of the g8 will not hear nor do they care to hear from protestors or dissenters of any kind from anywhere . - william sarpas , usa please consider the sentiments of the protestors . - philip lau , singapore we can use taxation as a way to help people who are affected in a negative way .
we could take from energy taxes to retain displaced workers , or fund tax credits to the poor with the increased cost of bio-fuels or other forms of clean energy .
this is being talked about in the us . - lee davis , oregon , usa the major issue is environment . - karuna kanta pal , india the g8 nations must not be scared of nations like india and china and start to cut all power generation supplies from fossil fuel generation .
oil and gas reserves need to be used at a slower rate to sustain what we have left and bio-fuels need to be encouraged by the g8 nations .
and third world agricultural nations need to start growing the sugar cane , olives , canola , corn and harvest timber with the aid money supplied to them and not buy weapons or line their greedy pockets with the money .
if they want aid money they must have an administrator from the g8 nations managing the money being used for the production of renewable energy resources .
that will benefit the world supply . - paul , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : globalization improves , does n't worsen peoples ' lives proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now .
-lrb- 04.06.2007 -rrb- " a new day is dawning for globalization critics " around 100,000 demonstrators are expected at the g8 summit in june .
dw-world.de spoke with sven giegold , one of the founders of attac , a group which describes itself as a skeptical of globalization , about the protests .
-lrb- 22.05.2007 -rrb- turning globalization on its head globalization is not just about outsourcing jobs in the west to asia : indian companies are now creating jobs in europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 06.06.2007 g8 summit : it 's foolish to oppose it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demonstrators at the g8 summit in heiligendamm blame that group of nations for many of the world 's inequities .
but dw 's henrik böhme says their view is one-sided , myopic and unfair . if a group of nations is responsible for more than two-thirds of world trade and pays more than three-quarters of the world 's financial aid , why should n't those countries meet to talk to one another ?
what 's the problem with analyzing the world economic situation to identify potential problems and come up with solutions ?
is it wrong to invite representatives from africa , china and india and start a dialogue ? admittedly the g8 needs to bridge the gap between world leaders and ordinary people .
the last time , germany hosted a g8 summit , in cologne in 1999 , then-us president bill clinton was able to walk outside his hotel and visit a brew-pub . but in the wake of the riots in genoa in 2001 , not to mention the terrorist attacks of september 11th , the world has changed and the barriers have gotten much higher .
but that 's no reason for world leaders not to talk about initiatives to relieve poverty or to fight aids and other deadly diseases . there 's no way to solve all the world 's problems in three days .
but the summit is the first step in a process that will be continued on various levels around the world . moreover , globalization is not a g8 invention .
arguably , globalization began in 1620 when the first shipment of tea arrived from japan in the port of amsterdam .
globalization is not some outside phenomenon afflicting the world , but something that we , as world citizens , can influence and direct . that 's a fact many of the demonstrators choose to ignore .

but western hopes for progress were met with intransigence by iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier met with iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani , in surprise talks in berlin on the eve of the g8 summit . but no progress was made towards resolving the ongoing row over tehran 's nuclear program . steinmeier told reporters the aim of the talks had been to create more " suppleness " on the part of iran and to persuade the islamic republic to rethink its stance . iran has defied international pressure to halt uranium enrichment , saying it wants only to generate energy for a growing population when fossil fuels eventually run out . the western powers believe that iran is conducting a nuclear enrichment program with the aim of making a bomb , a charge which tehran has repeatedly denied . " it 's too late to push us back " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has met with larijani in the past ; here , in 2006 talks back in tehran , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that it was too late to stop his nation 's nuclear program , telling reporters tuesday , " we have broken through to a new stage and it is too late to push us back . " at a typically defiant news conference , ahmadinejad also warned the un security council of the dangers of seeking to pressure iran , telling the world body not to risk playing with a " lion 's tail . " " we advise them not to indulge in child 's play ...
they say that iran is a lion sat down in a corner .
and we tell them : do not play with the lion 's tail . " diplomatic sources in berlin said germany was making " efforts to map the way forward on the iranian nuclear dossier in close consultation with the eu foreign policy coordinator javier solana . " solana and larijani have met twice in recent weeks but failed to defuse the standoff over iran 's refusal to stop enrichment work .
solana tried to coax tehran to halt enrichment in exchange for a package of political , economic and trade incentives . but instead , tehran 's intransigence has led the west to threaten more sanctions against the islamic republic .
the un security council has already agreed to two sets of sanctions against iran for ignoring its calls to suspend enrichment , and western powers are now openly talking of a new resolution after iran missed the latest deadline . a un report released last month stated that tehran could be three to eight years away from developing nuclear arms . " we are dealing with psychological warfare " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian leader has defied un sanctions in jerusalem on tuesday , israeli foreign minister tzipi livni urged the international community not to succumb to iran 's position . " iran is trying to convince the world that it has crossed the point of no return in order to weaken the international community 's efforts to stop iran , " her office quoted her as saying . " we are dealing with psychological warfare , " said livni , whose country is considered the sole , undeclared nuclear power in the middle east . meanwhile , ahmadinejad predicted that washington would never be able to hurt the islamic republic even though the us has never ruled out military action to bring iran to heel over its nuclear drive . us secretary of state condoleezza rice , in the northeastern german resort of heiligendamm for the g8 talks said that ahmadinejad , who has repeatedly called for the destruction of the jewish state , was " digging a deeper and deeper hole for his country . " the g8 grouping of the us , britain , germany , france , italy , canada , japan and russia have threatened tougher sanctions if iran fails to meet un demands to halt enrichment . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it is the climate that is getting the most heat . german chancellor angela merkel has made climate change and the challenges to combat it a key issue at the group of eight summit she is hosting at the baltic coastal resort of heiligendamm in germany .
observers are saying a substantial outcome is unlikely , however .
and in recent statements , merkel has tried to put the stress on at least getting the g8 countries to agree to keep at least agreeing to keep talks on climate change within a united nations framework .
" in heiligendamm we want to give impetus to the negotiations on global climate protection , " the chancellor said .
" i hope there will be a signal from heiligendamm that the countries represented there clearly recognize their collective responsibility , " she said .
with the world leaders from industrialized nations attending the meeting , some consensus about how to tackle the climate change problem could be possible .
no fixed targets likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has set climate high on the agenda but german press agency dpa reported wednesday morning that the united states and germany had apparently failed to agree on fixed targets in the fight against global warming in talks ahead of the summit .
and us president george w. bush 's chief environment adviser , james connaughton , has said the summit would end without an agreement on fixed targets .
connaughton said each country had to set its own targets .
this was not only washington 's view but also that of , for instance , japan and canada , he said .
it would take more time until all leading industrialized nations could agree on a joint vision .
however , british prime minister tony blair said wednesday he believes he can persuade bush to agree for the first time to a global target for a " substantial cut " in greenhouse gas emissions .
in an interview with the guardian newspaper wednesday , blair said that america was " on the move " in its position on climate change .
last-ditch effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has not endorsed the kyoto protocol to limit emissions chancellor merkel was to hold a pre-summit lunch meeting with bush on wednesday in a bid to find common ground on climate change .
the summit officially begins with a formal dinner later in the evening . last week , the chancellor had welcomed bush 's call for a new strategy on tackling global warming through joint action by the world 's top polluters - including china and india - as a " positive " step .
but merkel has also made clear that she will still press g8 leaders to commit to cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- .
support from other nations germany 's plan for a binding pact has won qualified support from some nations , but bush last week unveiled his own proposals and said a long-term goal for reducing greenhouses gases could be set by the end of 2008 .
merkel wants the g8 to guide other nations towards negotiations due to take place in december to find a successor to the kyoto protocol .
the 1997 kyoto protocol , named after japan 's ancient capital , where it was signed , is the world 's first treaty mandating emission cuts and will expire in 2012 .
on tuesday , the european union - represented by merkel as the current eu president - and japan agreed to take the lead in forging a successor to kyoto . they jointly proposed to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
bildunterschrift : police and protestors clashed before the summit " the eu and japan are committed to take strong leadership towards the development of a fair , flexible , effective and comprehensive un post-2012 framework that ensures the participation of all major emitting countries , " a joint statement said after the tuesday meeting .
developing countries ' role while the eu and japan insisted that developed countries should play a vital role in fighting global warming , they also called for a " fair contribution " by developing countries .
" we have to take action under a un framework so that all members of the international community can participate bindingly , " merkel said after talks with japanese prime minister shinzo abe in berlin tuesday .
merkel has also repeatedly said that talks on climate change must be within a united nations framework .
earlier in the week , merkel made a statment to that effect , together with canadian prime minister stephen harper .
president bush will also meet japan 's prime minister shinzo abe before the summit begins .
russia also in limelight g8 members include germany , france , britain , italy , japan , the united states , canada and russia .
the european commission is also represented at all meetings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive security fence around the summit location chinese president hu jintao and counterparts from five emerging economies - brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa - will participate in the summit , highlighting their growing weight in international affairs .
other non-g8 members at the meeting include the leaders of algeria , egypt , ghana , nigeria and senegal .
another issue likely to take center-stage at the summit is the west 's relations with russia , with russian president vladimir putin attending the meeting .
both chancellor merkel and us president bush are set to hold bilateral talks with putin in a bid to defuse rising east-west tensions .
the leaders are striving to strike a conciliatory tone in relations with russia despite putin 's most recent angry attack against us plans to station elements of an anti-missile defence system in poland and the czech republic . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de climate change : the world 's greatest challenge climate change and global warming have steadily risen to the top of the world 's agenda as reports and predictions have made it clear that time is running out .

he also urged the 1997 tour de france winner to come clean . the allegations about doping during team telekom 's glory years in the mid-1990s were n't new .
but they did increase the pressure on ullrich as the only major rider from the team at that time not to have admitted using banned substances . " with one hundred percent certainty , jan took epo and human growth hormones , " d 'hont told the tv news show " tagesthemen , " one of the most-watched programs of its kind in germany .
" like bjarne riis , rolf aldag and the other members of the team , jan has to admit how it was . " d 'hont , who worked for team telekom from 1992 to 1996 , first made his accusations when he published a book this spring .
since then a number of former telekom stars , including 1996 tour de france winner riis , have admitted using substances like epo , which increases red-blood cell production .
two team doctors have also confessed to administering the drugs . ullrich , who retired this february amidst a separate set of doping suspicions , has refused to issue a statement about d 'hont 's allegations .

" i neither organized nor financed doping in our cycling team , " godefroot told reports at a press conference in his home town of ghent , belgium . " i do n't want to comment on others , " godefroot added .

dw-world.de 's readers wrote in this week with their opinions on the pros and cons of globalization and their expectations for this week 's g8 summit . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i am from africa , looking at the g8 summit from a tiny window and with an empty stomach .
in a sense , i am saying that we in africa believe strongly that we are not part of the equation .
authorities are busy looting the scarce resources meant for the provision of shelter , water , and education for the masses .
many african leaders maintain bank accounts in the so-called advanced or first world countries .
the g8 countries over-subsidies food items to africa so that african peasant farmers can not break even by tilling the soil .
they also turn africa into a dumping ground for their inferior products and phased-out consumer items .
while africa remains poor , depending on hand-outs to prevent hiv / aids , bird flu , family control , but not much is being done in areas of malaria control , infant mortality , education , and job creation .
g8 or no g8 , africa - and , indeed , black africa - will remain poor . - alhassan jaoji , nigeria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa will stay poor , wrote one reader i am all for globalization bringing the far-flung countries closer to talk to each other about the economy , world debts for poor countries , trade talks , and climate change .
opposition to globalization is not only selfish , but is short-sighted and harmful to maintaining harmony with one another and harmony with the planet earth . - bernard , australia it is my fervent hope that europe will assume a greater leadership role at the g8 meeting rather than falling prey to arguments of and between the us and russia .
may the force be with europe ! - peter peters , thailand a global economy only works if we have global rules .
the agricultural sector is a good example where developed countries pay high subsidies and then they export their goods to underdeveloped ones , who of course can not compete . - heinz schwabe , germany globalization and the g8 have been rendered totally pointless because they do not serve to rein in a madman like george bush .
good grief , if the other seven members of this group of eight ca n't tell that this man does n't play with a full deck , they must be blind in one eye and not see out of the other .
while germany should n't even have invited bush , it even removes demonstrators who recognize a madman when they see one - unlike merkel , blair , and sarkozy . - an mongere , usa germans need to realize that rioting is becoming a national sport in germany , just as football hooliganism is to the british .
germans ' love of practicing politics " en masse " has evolved into an excuse for violence .
when the police are the ones who are getting hurt , this sad imbalance only encourages the more violent elements of society the next time around .
and what difference does it make if some clown hands a policemen a flower , if others with black masks on their face go on a violent rampage ?
even in a violent and somewhat hazardous country like america , neither the public nor the law enforcement community would tolerate this kind of nonsense . - paul falk , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioting has become a national sport in germany , opined a reader criminals who use protests as an excuse to commit violence should be locked up and made to repair the damage they cause .
as a public safety officer , my sympathies go out to all police and firemen who are under attack by the criminal element there .
my heart goes out to all the law-abiding citizens who have their peaceful lives disrupted in this manner . - john langenford , usa i would have never expected such numbers and such violence .
i am for freedom of speech but not for organized violence .
yesterday i saw on the internet how young people prepared for the demonstration .
picking up cobblestones to be thrown at the police is creating chaos , not change ; it backfires and does not help the poor .
service , generosity , respect , are means for a better world .
seeing what happens in organized germany makes me have a little understanding for putin , who forbids some such demonstrations . - elisabeth heptner , usa why are they talking about africa ?
you ca n't solve any problems there .
africa is n't in the g8 .
it should only be about g8 countries .
immigration should be first .
if the g8 encouraged high birth rates we would n't need immigrants .
the g8 creates more problems for itself and then wonders how it can solve them all . - john , usa no one can stop globalization , but we must take care to protect the poor who are suffering more in global competition .
there are good as well as bad effects of globalization .
we must reduce the bad effects and increase the good effects and for that purpose there must be watch dog - wise people who constantly the behavior of multinational corporations in balance . - ramesh raghuvanshi , india the leaders of the g8 will not hear nor do they care to hear from protestors or dissenters of any kind from anywhere . - william sarpas , usa please consider the sentiments of the protestors . - philip lau , singapore we can use taxation as a way to help people who are affected in a negative way .
we could take from energy taxes to retain displaced workers , or fund tax credits to the poor with the increased cost of bio-fuels or other forms of clean energy .
this is being talked about in the us . - lee davis , oregon , usa the major issue is environment . - karuna kanta pal , india the g8 nations must not be scared of nations like india and china and start to cut all power generation supplies from fossil fuel generation .
oil and gas reserves need to be used at a slower rate to sustain what we have left and bio-fuels need to be encouraged by the g8 nations .
and third world agricultural nations need to start growing the sugar cane , olives , canola , corn and harvest timber with the aid money supplied to them and not buy weapons or line their greedy pockets with the money .
if they want aid money they must have an administrator from the g8 nations managing the money being used for the production of renewable energy resources .
that will benefit the world supply . - paul , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : globalization improves , does n't worsen peoples ' lives proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now .
-lrb- 04.06.2007 -rrb- " a new day is dawning for globalization critics " around 100,000 demonstrators are expected at the g8 summit in june .
dw-world.de spoke with sven giegold , one of the founders of attac , a group which describes itself as a skeptical of globalization , about the protests .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 06.06.2007 g8 summit : it 's foolish to oppose it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demonstrators at the g8 summit in heiligendamm blame that group of nations for many of the world 's inequities .
but dw 's henrik böhme says their view is one-sided , myopic and unfair . if a group of nations is responsible for more than two-thirds of world trade and pays more than three-quarters of the world 's financial aid , why should n't those countries meet to talk to one another ?
what 's the problem with analyzing the world economic situation to identify potential problems and come up with solutions ?
is it wrong to invite representatives from africa , china and india and start a dialogue ? admittedly the g8 needs to bridge the gap between world leaders and ordinary people .
the last time , germany hosted a g8 summit , in cologne in 1999 , then-us president bill clinton was able to walk outside his hotel and visit a brew-pub . but in the wake of the riots in genoa in 2001 , not to mention the terrorist attacks of september 11th , the world has changed and the barriers have gotten much higher .
but that 's no reason for world leaders not to talk about initiatives to relieve poverty or to fight aids and other deadly diseases . there 's no way to solve all the world 's problems in three days .
but the summit is the first step in a process that will be continued on various levels around the world . moreover , globalization is not a g8 invention .
arguably , globalization began in 1620 when the first shipment of tea arrived from japan in the port of amsterdam .
globalization is not some outside phenomenon afflicting the world , but something that we , as world citizens , can influence and direct . that 's a fact many of the demonstrators choose to ignore .
blaming the g8 for everything that 's wrong in the world is what 's wrong .
heiligendamm is just a symbol for a collection of problems that have no one address . for that 's reason , it 's foolish to oppose the g8 summit in knee-jerk fashion .
we no longer live in a world of clearly defined good and evil . or to pose the question the other way around : would the world be any better a place , if there were no g8 summits ? henrik böhme is a business editor at dw radio -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also urged the 1997 tour de france winner to come clean . the allegations about doping during team telekom 's glory years in the mid-1990s were n't new .
but they did increase the pressure on ullrich as the only major rider from the team at that time not to have admitted using banned substances . " with one hundred percent certainty , jan took epo and human growth hormones , " d 'hont told the tv news show " tagesthemen , " one of the most-watched programs of its kind in germany .
" like bjarne riis , rolf aldag and the other members of the team , jan has to admit how it was . " d 'hont , who worked for team telekom from 1992 to 1996 , first made his accusations when he published a book this spring .
since then a number of former telekom stars , including 1996 tour de france winner riis , have admitted using substances like epo , which increases red-blood cell production .
two team doctors have also confessed to administering the drugs . ullrich , who retired this february amidst a separate set of doping suspicions , has refused to issue a statement about d 'hont 's allegations .

" i neither organized nor financed doping in our cycling team , " godefroot told reports at a press conference in his home town of ghent , belgium . " i do n't want to comment on others , " godefroot added .

ever since their four-year-old daughter went missing from a holiday resort in portugal 's algarve region on may 3 , gerry and kate mccann have launched a high profile campaign to find madeleine , who was allegedly abducted from the bedroom of the villa where they stayed . the british couple , who are doctors , had left her and her two-year-old twin siblings , who were unharmed , in the apartment , while they went to a restaurant on the premises . they have already met pope benedict xvi in rome and traveled to madrid , which was the start of their tour of european capitals to raise awareness for their daughter 's disappearance . now they have publicized their appeal in germany since german and dutch tourists make up the majority of foreign tourists in algarve . publicizing appeal in germany " we are here to ask the german public for help in searching for our little daughter , " gerry mccann announced at a press conference in berlin with his wife kate at his side . the couple asked german tourists to look through holiday photographs taken in portugal last month to see whether the little girl , and perhaps also her abductor , might be in the background .
when a journalist suggested that they could in some way be involved in the abduction of their child , gerry mccann retorted : " i have never heard before that anyone considers us suspects in this and the portuguese police certainly do n't . " the case has captured considerable attention from the german media .
bild , the mass circulation tabloid , published an open letter to the mccanns from brigitta sirny , the mother of the austrian girl natascha kampusch , who had been kidnapped as a 10-year-old on her way to school and held in captivity for more than eight years .
last summer , kampusch made a dramatic escape from her abductor , who then killed himself before he could be arrested . parallels with abduction of austrian girl last year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha kampusch was held in captivity for 3,096 days " my daughter natascha was also kidnapped , " sirny wrote .
" she was held for 3,096 days at the mercy of a demented criminal .
i have suffered countless hours of despair .
hours in which i kept asking myself : why ?
why my child ?
who has done this ?
who would kidnap a defenseless child ?
could i have stopped it ?
did a lapse of a few minutes cost years of my child 's life ? " the newspaper also quoted sirny as saying that publicizing the case , which became a sensation in germany , was the right thing to do , " because the worst that could happen for a kidnapped child is to be forgotten . " there is still hope in an interview with german newspaper berliner morgenpost on sunday , gerry mccann said that there was still hope . " as long as there is hope , we are not giving up , " he said .
kate mccann said she hoped madeleine was safe and was being cared for . " we know there are evil people out there , but there are also confused people , " she said .
" we do not know who this person is .
we hope the latter . " the couple also met with the mayor of berlin , klaus wowereit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de g8 summit -pipe- 06.06.2007 outlook is bleak for big strides on climate issues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is causing divisions germany 's agenda for the g8 summit ranges from africa and trade to hedge funds , relations with russia , the middle east and kosovo .
but it is the climate that is getting the most heat . german chancellor angela merkel has made climate change and the challenges to combat it a key issue at the group of eight summit she is hosting at the baltic coastal resort of heiligendamm in germany .
observers are saying a substantial outcome is unlikely , however .
and in recent statements , merkel has tried to put the stress on at least getting the g8 countries to agree to keep at least agreeing to keep talks on climate change within a united nations framework .
" in heiligendamm we want to give impetus to the negotiations on global climate protection , " the chancellor said .
" i hope there will be a signal from heiligendamm that the countries represented there clearly recognize their collective responsibility , " she said .
with the world leaders from industrialized nations attending the meeting , some consensus about how to tackle the climate change problem could be possible .
no fixed targets likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has set climate high on the agenda but german press agency dpa reported wednesday morning that the united states and germany had apparently failed to agree on fixed targets in the fight against global warming in talks ahead of the summit .
and us president george w. bush 's chief environment adviser , james connaughton , has said the summit would end without an agreement on fixed targets .
connaughton said each country had to set its own targets .
this was not only washington 's view but also that of , for instance , japan and canada , he said .
it would take more time until all leading industrialized nations could agree on a joint vision .
however , british prime minister tony blair said wednesday he believes he can persuade bush to agree for the first time to a global target for a " substantial cut " in greenhouse gas emissions .
in an interview with the guardian newspaper wednesday , blair said that america was " on the move " in its position on climate change .
last-ditch effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has not endorsed the kyoto protocol to limit emissions chancellor merkel was to hold a pre-summit lunch meeting with bush on wednesday in a bid to find common ground on climate change .
the summit officially begins with a formal dinner later in the evening . last week , the chancellor had welcomed bush 's call for a new strategy on tackling global warming through joint action by the world 's top polluters - including china and india - as a " positive " step .
but merkel has also made clear that she will still press g8 leaders to commit to cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- .
support from other nations germany 's plan for a binding pact has won qualified support from some nations , but bush last week unveiled his own proposals and said a long-term goal for reducing greenhouses gases could be set by the end of 2008 .
merkel wants the g8 to guide other nations towards negotiations due to take place in december to find a successor to the kyoto protocol .
the 1997 kyoto protocol , named after japan 's ancient capital , where it was signed , is the world 's first treaty mandating emission cuts and will expire in 2012 .
on tuesday , the european union - represented by merkel as the current eu president - and japan agreed to take the lead in forging a successor to kyoto . they jointly proposed to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
bildunterschrift : police and protestors clashed before the summit " the eu and japan are committed to take strong leadership towards the development of a fair , flexible , effective and comprehensive un post-2012 framework that ensures the participation of all major emitting countries , " a joint statement said after the tuesday meeting .
developing countries ' role while the eu and japan insisted that developed countries should play a vital role in fighting global warming , they also called for a " fair contribution " by developing countries .
" we have to take action under a un framework so that all members of the international community can participate bindingly , " merkel said after talks with japanese prime minister shinzo abe in berlin tuesday .
merkel has also repeatedly said that talks on climate change must be within a united nations framework .
earlier in the week , merkel made a statment to that effect , together with canadian prime minister stephen harper .
president bush will also meet japan 's prime minister shinzo abe before the summit begins .
russia also in limelight g8 members include germany , france , britain , italy , japan , the united states , canada and russia .
the european commission is also represented at all meetings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive security fence around the summit location chinese president hu jintao and counterparts from five emerging economies - brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa - will participate in the summit , highlighting their growing weight in international affairs .
other non-g8 members at the meeting include the leaders of algeria , egypt , ghana , nigeria and senegal .
another issue likely to take center-stage at the summit is the west 's relations with russia , with russian president vladimir putin attending the meeting .
both chancellor merkel and us president bush are set to hold bilateral talks with putin in a bid to defuse rising east-west tensions .
the leaders are striving to strike a conciliatory tone in relations with russia despite putin 's most recent angry attack against us plans to station elements of an anti-missile defence system in poland and the czech republic . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de climate change : the world 's greatest challenge climate change and global warming have steadily risen to the top of the world 's agenda as reports and predictions have made it clear that time is running out .

but western hopes for progress were met with intransigence by iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier met with iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani , in surprise talks in berlin on the eve of the g8 summit . but no progress was made towards resolving the ongoing row over tehran 's nuclear program . steinmeier told reporters the aim of the talks had been to create more " suppleness " on the part of iran and to persuade the islamic republic to rethink its stance . iran has defied international pressure to halt uranium enrichment , saying it wants only to generate energy for a growing population when fossil fuels eventually run out . the western powers believe that iran is conducting a nuclear enrichment program with the aim of making a bomb , a charge which tehran has repeatedly denied . " it 's too late to push us back " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has met with larijani in the past ; here , in 2006 talks back in tehran , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that it was too late to stop his nation 's nuclear program , telling reporters tuesday , " we have broken through to a new stage and it is too late to push us back . " at a typically defiant news conference , ahmadinejad also warned the un security council of the dangers of seeking to pressure iran , telling the world body not to risk playing with a " lion 's tail . " " we advise them not to indulge in child 's play ...
they say that iran is a lion sat down in a corner .
and we tell them : do not play with the lion 's tail . " diplomatic sources in berlin said germany was making " efforts to map the way forward on the iranian nuclear dossier in close consultation with the eu foreign policy coordinator javier solana . " solana and larijani have met twice in recent weeks but failed to defuse the standoff over iran 's refusal to stop enrichment work .
solana tried to coax tehran to halt enrichment in exchange for a package of political , economic and trade incentives . but instead , tehran 's intransigence has led the west to threaten more sanctions against the islamic republic .
the un security council has already agreed to two sets of sanctions against iran for ignoring its calls to suspend enrichment , and western powers are now openly talking of a new resolution after iran missed the latest deadline . a un report released last month stated that tehran could be three to eight years away from developing nuclear arms . " we are dealing with psychological warfare " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian leader has defied un sanctions in jerusalem on tuesday , israeli foreign minister tzipi livni urged the international community not to succumb to iran 's position . " iran is trying to convince the world that it has crossed the point of no return in order to weaken the international community 's efforts to stop iran , " her office quoted her as saying . " we are dealing with psychological warfare , " said livni , whose country is considered the sole , undeclared nuclear power in the middle east . meanwhile , ahmadinejad predicted that washington would never be able to hurt the islamic republic even though the us has never ruled out military action to bring iran to heel over its nuclear drive . us secretary of state condoleezza rice , in the northeastern german resort of heiligendamm for the g8 talks said that ahmadinejad , who has repeatedly called for the destruction of the jewish state , was " digging a deeper and deeper hole for his country . " the g8 grouping of the us , britain , germany , france , italy , canada , japan and russia have threatened tougher sanctions if iran fails to meet un demands to halt enrichment . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

life here is usually sedate , which is why it is an oasis of calm for retirees and young families .
one gets the impression that nothing much happens here and that 's the way the locals like it .
even when there 's a major international summit happening nearby , there are very few indicators which suggest anything other than idyllic normality is , as usual , in abundance .
from time to time the cry of seagulls is interrupted by the dull thud of distant rotor blades as a military chopper circles overhead .
occasionally when traveling the undulating roads the picturesque view is disturbed by random crews of armor-clad cops guarding lonely crossroads .
but even then , their green overalls attempt to minimize the disruption to the surroundings by blending into the fields around them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if if were n't for the police vehicles , one local resident would n't have noticed a difference for the residents of heilingendamm and kühlungsborn , the arrival of the g8 leaders and the thousands of protestors has so far barely even registered .
" if it was n't for the police vehicles parked around town , i would n't even have noticed anything different , " said jörg kessling , a retired resident of kühlungsborn , the location of the summit 's media center and a staging post for many journalists and delegates .
" there seems to be more people here than usual but no more than in a busy month during the summer . "
sabina meller , an assistant in a local bakery in the seaside resort of heiligendamm , where the summit is being held , expected more of an impact .
" there have been a few more strangers around , more young people , but the streets are just as quiet as ever , " she said .
" anyway , the kempinski hotel is quite a way from the town center .

life here is usually sedate , which is why it is an oasis of calm for retirees and young families .
one gets the impression that nothing much happens here and that 's the way the locals like it .
even when there 's a major international summit happening nearby , there are very few indicators which suggest anything other than idyllic normality is , as usual , in abundance .
from time to time the cry of seagulls is interrupted by the dull thud of distant rotor blades as a military chopper circles overhead .
occasionally when traveling the undulating roads the picturesque view is disturbed by random crews of armor-clad cops guarding lonely crossroads .
but even then , their green overalls attempt to minimize the disruption to the surroundings by blending into the fields around them .

" if it was n't for the police vehicles parked around town , i would n't even have noticed anything different , " said jörg kessling , a retired resident of kühlungsborn , the location of the summit 's media center and a staging post for many journalists and delegates .
" there seems to be more people here than usual but no more than in a busy month during the summer . "
sabina meller , an assistant in a local bakery in the seaside resort of heiligendamm , where the summit is being held , expected more of an impact .
" there have been a few more strangers around , more young people , but the streets are just as quiet as ever , " she said .
" anyway , the kempinski hotel is quite a way from the town center .

but it is the climate that is getting the most heat . german chancellor angela merkel has made climate change and the challenges to combat it a key issue at the group of eight summit she is hosting at the baltic coastal resort of heiligendamm in germany .
observers are saying a substantial outcome is unlikely , however .
and in recent statements , merkel has tried to put the stress on at least getting the g8 countries to agree to keep at least agreeing to keep talks on climate change within a united nations framework .
" in heiligendamm we want to give impetus to the negotiations on global climate protection , " the chancellor said .
" i hope there will be a signal from heiligendamm that the countries represented there clearly recognize their collective responsibility , " she said .
with the world leaders from industrialized nations attending the meeting , some consensus about how to tackle the climate change problem could be possible .
no fixed targets likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has set climate high on the agenda but german press agency dpa reported wednesday morning that the united states and germany had apparently failed to agree on fixed targets in the fight against global warming in talks ahead of the summit .
and us president george w. bush 's chief environment adviser , james connaughton , has said the summit would end without an agreement on fixed targets .
connaughton said each country had to set its own targets .
this was not only washington 's view but also that of , for instance , japan and canada , he said .
it would take more time until all leading industrialized nations could agree on a joint vision .
however , british prime minister tony blair said wednesday he believes he can persuade bush to agree for the first time to a global target for a " substantial cut " in greenhouse gas emissions .
in an interview with the guardian newspaper wednesday , blair said that america was " on the move " in its position on climate change .
last-ditch effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has not endorsed the kyoto protocol to limit emissions chancellor merkel was to hold a pre-summit lunch meeting with bush on wednesday in a bid to find common ground on climate change .
the summit officially begins with a formal dinner later in the evening . last week , the chancellor had welcomed bush 's call for a new strategy on tackling global warming through joint action by the world 's top polluters - including china and india - as a " positive " step .
but merkel has also made clear that she will still press g8 leaders to commit to cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- .
support from other nations germany 's plan for a binding pact has won qualified support from some nations , but bush last week unveiled his own proposals and said a long-term goal for reducing greenhouses gases could be set by the end of 2008 .
merkel wants the g8 to guide other nations towards negotiations due to take place in december to find a successor to the kyoto protocol .
the 1997 kyoto protocol , named after japan 's ancient capital , where it was signed , is the world 's first treaty mandating emission cuts and will expire in 2012 .
on tuesday , the european union - represented by merkel as the current eu president - and japan agreed to take the lead in forging a successor to kyoto . they jointly proposed to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
bildunterschrift : police and protestors clashed before the summit " the eu and japan are committed to take strong leadership towards the development of a fair , flexible , effective and comprehensive un post-2012 framework that ensures the participation of all major emitting countries , " a joint statement said after the tuesday meeting .
developing countries ' role while the eu and japan insisted that developed countries should play a vital role in fighting global warming , they also called for a " fair contribution " by developing countries .
" we have to take action under a un framework so that all members of the international community can participate bindingly , " merkel said after talks with japanese prime minister shinzo abe in berlin tuesday .
merkel has also repeatedly said that talks on climate change must be within a united nations framework .
earlier in the week , merkel made a statment to that effect , together with canadian prime minister stephen harper .
president bush will also meet japan 's prime minister shinzo abe before the summit begins .
russia also in limelight g8 members include germany , france , britain , italy , japan , the united states , canada and russia .
the european commission is also represented at all meetings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive security fence around the summit location chinese president hu jintao and counterparts from five emerging economies - brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa - will participate in the summit , highlighting their growing weight in international affairs .
other non-g8 members at the meeting include the leaders of algeria , egypt , ghana , nigeria and senegal .
another issue likely to take center-stage at the summit is the west 's relations with russia , with russian president vladimir putin attending the meeting .
both chancellor merkel and us president bush are set to hold bilateral talks with putin in a bid to defuse rising east-west tensions .
the leaders are striving to strike a conciliatory tone in relations with russia despite putin 's most recent angry attack against us plans to station elements of an anti-missile defence system in poland and the czech republic . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de climate change : the world 's greatest challenge climate change and global warming have steadily risen to the top of the world 's agenda as reports and predictions have made it clear that time is running out .

according to a recent study , it 's doubtful that membership in the " club " will help the poor in these countries . without the five emerging guest nations , the g8 summit 's motto " growth and responsibility " couldn ’ t be implemented , said german chancellor angela merkel recently .
indeed , all five of them exhibited healthy growth in their gross domestic products in 2006 : china and india topped the group with 10.7 and 9.2 percent respectively , while south africa -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- , brazil -lrb- 4.4 percent -rrb- and mexico -lrb- 3.5 percent -rrb- came in strong .
according to the german office for foreign trade -lrb- bfai -rrb- in cologne , the upward trend is expected to continue in 2007 and 2008 .
economic growth encourages confidence on the international political playing field .
they have already become key players in the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and in climate debates , for example .
their businesses are expanding worldwide and representatives from these emerging nations are already questioning the legitimacy of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
in addition , brazil , india and south africa are aspiring to obtain a permanent seat in the united nations security council .
g20 represents world majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of emerging countries in political bodies wo n't affect poverty , say some experts in the wto , the " big five " belong to the so-called g20 , a group of emerging and developing nations that was founded in cancun , mexico in 2003 and represents two-thirds of the world 's population .
however , in international economic negotiations , the big five sometimes give the impression that they are already playing in a league of their own .
" the economic upturn of china , india , brazil and south africa does n't necessarily lead to a poverty-oriented global economic policy , " concluded a study by the aid organizations bread for the world and südwind institute , which is to be presented wednesday at the alternative summit in rostock .
" economic growth alone does n't help the poorest of the poor . "
the gap between rich and poor is growing even wider , particularly in brazil , mexico , india and south africa .
in the run-up to this year 's summit , there was talk of expanding the g8 - which currently represents only 13 percent of the world population - to the g13 .
however , this could weaken the position of the world 's poor , say experts .
the poor still lose out " the dominance of the wealthy industrialized countries in the world trade organization and the international monetary fund would be reduced , but the interests of poor people in emerging nations and the least-developed nations would still be pushed onto the back burner in the world trade system , " said reinhard koppe , development policy expert at bread for the world .
furthermore , the study reveals how power relationships have shifted over the past few years through the offensive economic policies of four of the largest emerging nations - china , india , brazil and south africa .
" all four states have become world powers in many sectors , not just in their regions but worldwide , " said koppe .
the study 's author friedel hütz-adams said that " established industrialized nations are no longer in a position to assert their own interests without making major compromises - both in the wto and in bilateral and regional treaties . "
strategies on the political front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 represents two thirds of the world 's population according to the study , brazil 's discourse within the wto focuses on close cooperation with the g20 countries and the nama 11 group -lrb- argentina , brazil , egypt , india , indonesia , namibia , philippines , south africa , tunisia and venezuela -rrb- , while making deals of its own behind the scenes . " the government in brazil is getting involved in the non-transparent structures of the wto by agreeing , together with india , to talks with the us , the eu and japan , " said the study .
china , which like brazil has only signed a handful of bilateral open-trade treaties , continues to focus on the wto negotiations and is prepared to support the positions of other emerging and developing countries .
conflict of interest is standing in the way , however , said hütz-adams .
in addition , china 's engagement in africa is now being seen as a threat by governments and companies from industrialized countries , added the author .
india sees itself as a spokesperson for developing countries on the international playing field , which could soon change .
hütz-adams sees the willingness of the indian government to join brazil in informal trade talks with the us , the eu and japan as a warning sign .
" no on knows whether india will stay connected with the goals of the g20 and g33 in the world trade organization negotiations , " he said .
the country has increasingly been distinguishing itself as an economic power and seems to be going its own way .
mexico continues to be an emerging country but , at the same time , is a member of oecd .
of the five " guest " nations at the g8 summit , its economy has opened up the most since the 1990s .
it maintains 13 free trade agreements with 42 other countries , including one with nafta since 1994 and with the eu since 2000 .
last year , the mexican government reduced customs duties on merchandise with 148 wto member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment has been a sticky issue with some major emerging nations like china after mexico joined nafta , cheap corn from the us flooded the mexican market and led to protests by farmers .
since mexico had increased the use of corn in ethanol production , it became scarce .
" that 's why there were tortilla rebellions and the country was noncommittal during the wto agricultural negotiations , " said hütz-adams .
what 's more , economic expansion in china and india is putting competitive pressure on mexico and brazil .
more influence for smaller countries the study named other differences between the major emerging countries as well .
brazil and south africa support a fundamental voting reform in the international monetary fund and the world bank that would give small countries more say .
india and china , on the other hand , want to enhance their own positions in both institutions .
it remains to be seen whether india and china will agree to the united states ' new climate initiative .
" that would require a parallel structure to the un where the small states would n't have any say anymore , " said hütz-adams .

according to a recent study , it 's doubtful that membership in the " club " will help the poor in these countries . without the five emerging guest nations , the g8 summit 's motto " growth and responsibility " couldn ’ t be implemented , said german chancellor angela merkel recently .
indeed , all five of them exhibited healthy growth in their gross domestic products in 2006 : china and india topped the group with 10.7 and 9.2 percent respectively , while south africa -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- , brazil -lrb- 4.4 percent -rrb- and mexico -lrb- 3.5 percent -rrb- came in strong .
according to the german office for foreign trade -lrb- bfai -rrb- in cologne , the upward trend is expected to continue in 2007 and 2008 .
economic growth encourages confidence on the international political playing field .
they have already become key players in the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and in climate debates , for example .
their businesses are expanding worldwide and representatives from these emerging nations are already questioning the legitimacy of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
in addition , brazil , india and south africa are aspiring to obtain a permanent seat in the united nations security council .
g20 represents world majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of emerging countries in political bodies wo n't affect poverty , say some experts in the wto , the " big five " belong to the so-called g20 , a group of emerging and developing nations that was founded in cancun , mexico in 2003 and represents two-thirds of the world 's population .
however , in international economic negotiations , the big five sometimes give the impression that they are already playing in a league of their own .
" the economic upturn of china , india , brazil and south africa does n't necessarily lead to a poverty-oriented global economic policy , " concluded a study by the aid organizations bread for the world and südwind institute , which is to be presented wednesday at the alternative summit in rostock .
" economic growth alone does n't help the poorest of the poor . "
the gap between rich and poor is growing even wider , particularly in brazil , mexico , india and south africa .
in the run-up to this year 's summit , there was talk of expanding the g8 - which currently represents only 13 percent of the world population - to the g13 .
however , this could weaken the position of the world 's poor , say experts .
the poor still lose out " the dominance of the wealthy industrialized countries in the world trade organization and the international monetary fund would be reduced , but the interests of poor people in emerging nations and the least-developed nations would still be pushed onto the back burner in the world trade system , " said reinhard koppe , development policy expert at bread for the world .
furthermore , the study reveals how power relationships have shifted over the past few years through the offensive economic policies of four of the largest emerging nations - china , india , brazil and south africa .
" all four states have become world powers in many sectors , not just in their regions but worldwide , " said koppe .
the study 's author friedel hütz-adams said that " established industrialized nations are no longer in a position to assert their own interests without making major compromises - both in the wto and in bilateral and regional treaties . "
strategies on the political front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 represents two thirds of the world 's population according to the study , brazil 's discourse within the wto focuses on close cooperation with the g20 countries and the nama 11 group -lrb- argentina , brazil , egypt , india , indonesia , namibia , philippines , south africa , tunisia and venezuela -rrb- , while making deals of its own behind the scenes . " the government in brazil is getting involved in the non-transparent structures of the wto by agreeing , together with india , to talks with the us , the eu and japan , " said the study .
china , which like brazil has only signed a handful of bilateral open-trade treaties , continues to focus on the wto negotiations and is prepared to support the positions of other emerging and developing countries .
conflict of interest is standing in the way , however , said hütz-adams .
in addition , china 's engagement in africa is now being seen as a threat by governments and companies from industrialized countries , added the author .
india sees itself as a spokesperson for developing countries on the international playing field , which could soon change .
hütz-adams sees the willingness of the indian government to join brazil in informal trade talks with the us , the eu and japan as a warning sign .
" no on knows whether india will stay connected with the goals of the g20 and g33 in the world trade organization negotiations , " he said .
the country has increasingly been distinguishing itself as an economic power and seems to be going its own way .
mexico continues to be an emerging country but , at the same time , is a member of oecd .
of the five " guest " nations at the g8 summit , its economy has opened up the most since the 1990s .
it maintains 13 free trade agreements with 42 other countries , including one with nafta since 1994 and with the eu since 2000 .
last year , the mexican government reduced customs duties on merchandise with 148 wto member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment has been a sticky issue with some major emerging nations like china after mexico joined nafta , cheap corn from the us flooded the mexican market and led to protests by farmers .
since mexico had increased the use of corn in ethanol production , it became scarce .
" that 's why there were tortilla rebellions and the country was noncommittal during the wto agricultural negotiations , " said hütz-adams .
what 's more , economic expansion in china and india is putting competitive pressure on mexico and brazil .
more influence for smaller countries the study named other differences between the major emerging countries as well .
brazil and south africa support a fundamental voting reform in the international monetary fund and the world bank that would give small countries more say .
india and china , on the other hand , want to enhance their own positions in both institutions .
it remains to be seen whether india and china will agree to the united states ' new climate initiative .
" that would require a parallel structure to the un where the small states would n't have any say anymore , " said hütz-adams .

ever since their four-year-old daughter went missing from a holiday resort in portugal 's algarve region on may 3 , gerry and kate mccann have launched a high profile campaign to find madeleine , who was allegedly abducted from the bedroom of the villa where they stayed . the british couple , who are doctors , had left her and her two-year-old twin siblings , who were unharmed , in the apartment , while they went to a restaurant on the premises . they have already met pope benedict xvi in rome and traveled to madrid , which was the start of their tour of european capitals to raise awareness for their daughter 's disappearance . now they have publicized their appeal in germany since german and dutch tourists make up the majority of foreign tourists in algarve . publicizing appeal in germany " we are here to ask the german public for help in searching for our little daughter , " gerry mccann announced at a press conference in berlin with his wife kate at his side . the couple asked german tourists to look through holiday photographs taken in portugal last month to see whether the little girl , and perhaps also her abductor , might be in the background .
when a journalist suggested that they could in some way be involved in the abduction of their child , gerry mccann retorted : " i have never heard before that anyone considers us suspects in this and the portuguese police certainly do n't . " the case has captured considerable attention from the german media .
bild , the mass circulation tabloid , published an open letter to the mccanns from brigitta sirny , the mother of the austrian girl natascha kampusch , who had been kidnapped as a 10-year-old on her way to school and held in captivity for more than eight years .
last summer , kampusch made a dramatic escape from her abductor , who then killed himself before he could be arrested . parallels with abduction of austrian girl last year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha kampusch was held in captivity for 3,096 days " my daughter natascha was also kidnapped , " sirny wrote .
" she was held for 3,096 days at the mercy of a demented criminal .
i have suffered countless hours of despair .
hours in which i kept asking myself : why ?
why my child ?
who has done this ?
who would kidnap a defenseless child ?
could i have stopped it ?
did a lapse of a few minutes cost years of my child 's life ? " the newspaper also quoted sirny as saying that publicizing the case , which became a sensation in germany , was the right thing to do , " because the worst that could happen for a kidnapped child is to be forgotten . " there is still hope in an interview with german newspaper berliner morgenpost on sunday , gerry mccann said that there was still hope . " as long as there is hope , we are not giving up , " he said .
kate mccann said she hoped madeleine was safe and was being cared for . " we know there are evil people out there , but there are also confused people , " she said .
" we do not know who this person is .
we hope the latter . " the couple also met with the mayor of berlin , klaus wowereit .

life here is usually sedate , which is why it is an oasis of calm for retirees and young families .
one gets the impression that nothing much happens here and that 's the way the locals like it .
even when there 's a major international summit happening nearby , there are very few indicators which suggest anything other than idyllic normality is , as usual , in abundance .
from time to time the cry of seagulls is interrupted by the dull thud of distant rotor blades as a military chopper circles overhead .
occasionally when traveling the undulating roads the picturesque view is disturbed by random crews of armor-clad cops guarding lonely crossroads .
but even then , their green overalls attempt to minimize the disruption to the surroundings by blending into the fields around them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if if were n't for the police vehicles , one local resident would n't have noticed a difference for the residents of heilingendamm and kühlungsborn , the arrival of the g8 leaders and the thousands of protestors has so far barely even registered .
" if it was n't for the police vehicles parked around town , i would n't even have noticed anything different , " said jörg kessling , a retired resident of kühlungsborn , the location of the summit 's media center and a staging post for many journalists and delegates .
" there seems to be more people here than usual but no more than in a busy month during the summer . "
sabina meller , an assistant in a local bakery in the seaside resort of heiligendamm , where the summit is being held , expected more of an impact .
" there have been a few more strangers around , more young people , but the streets are just as quiet as ever , " she said .
" anyway , the kempinski hotel is quite a way from the town center .
when the protestors come , they 'll probably miss us completely .
i do n't expect the same thing to happen here as in rostock … maybe at the fence but not here . "
protest town to feel the full effects of the g8 , one has to travel to rostock .
the residents of the ancient hanseatic city have already felt the impact of the protestors after a weekend of mass demonstrations laced with violence and chaos .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business has been slow in the rostock area the past few days jana beger stands in the doorway of her newsagent 's shop and watches with a concerned look as a group of colorful and boisterous protestors march past on their way to the main train station .
jana has lived every one of her 62 years in rostock and says that she has never witnessed anything to compare to the events of the weekend when thousands took to the streets and a minority fought the police .
" these ones do n't look so bad , " she says , her eyes narrowing behind thick glasses as she scans each passing face .
" it 's the ones in black you have to watch out for . "
her son christian stands protectively beside her .
while there have been no reports yet of willful damage to shops , the cobbled streets of the city have already been violated and some businesses have already boarded up their windows just to be sure .
christian guards his mother and the shop 's large glass façade just in case .
" i went for my usual run early on sunday morning and the city maintenance crews were still replacing the stones , " he says , in reference to the cobbles prized from the road to be used in saturday 's violence .
" when there are people like that out there , who will go to such lengths , you ca n't help to be on your guard , even if you are n't their principle target . "
staying home others are not concerned about the violent " black block " extremists laying the city to waste .
many shops were open over the weekend even though there was a marked reduction in the number of customers , perhaps a reflection of residents ' unwillingness to put themselves at potential risk .
rostock 's lively hub , the kröpeliner-tor-vorstadt -lrb- ktv -rrb- area of the city , was like a ghost town on sunday with bar and café staff twiddling their thumbs .
some even took the decision to close on monday , much to the satisfaction of those who were open for business .
" it was dead around here at the weekend , " says timo kastnic , a bar worker in the ktv .
" i 'd never seen it like that … ever .
but we still opened up monday and because the others were shut , we did a lot of business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : missing cobblestones were one side-effect of the nearby demonstrations drinkers and those wanting to eat out were not the only rostock residents safely behind closed doors at home .
according to the local ostsee zeitung newspaper , a number of parents are keeping their children at home during the summit .
one high school had a third of its 768 students stay home monday , although many returned on tuesday for classes .
will it spread ?
such disruption can be expected to spread beyond rostock as the summit proper gets underway on wednesday .
one of the seaside sanctuaries , warnemünde , has already had a taste of the slow creep of protests as around 10,000 demonstrators marched through the quaint port resort to the nearby military harbor on tuesday .
as the slow , winding carnival of the anti-militarization demonstration passed through the city , the pavements either side of the crowded street were full of curious bystanders .
a few , as if heeding a silent call of conscience , stepped off the curb and joined the flow , moved by the commitment of those involved or just by the current of the event itself .
" we all live in this world , " said an elderly gentleman who , along with his wife , made a spontaneous decision to protest .
" you ca n't leave it to others to save it , " he added .
" i would never travel to one of these things , i 'm too old for that , but while it 's here in my home town i can make my voice heard . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 06.06.2007 emerging nations visit the " rich country club " - the g8 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the five g8 guest countries met in march in preparation for this year 's summit brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa will join the leading industrial nations at the g8 summit .
according to a recent study , it 's doubtful that membership in the " club " will help the poor in these countries . without the five emerging guest nations , the g8 summit 's motto " growth and responsibility " couldn ’ t be implemented , said german chancellor angela merkel recently .
indeed , all five of them exhibited healthy growth in their gross domestic products in 2006 : china and india topped the group with 10.7 and 9.2 percent respectively , while south africa -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- , brazil -lrb- 4.4 percent -rrb- and mexico -lrb- 3.5 percent -rrb- came in strong .
according to the german office for foreign trade -lrb- bfai -rrb- in cologne , the upward trend is expected to continue in 2007 and 2008 .
economic growth encourages confidence on the international political playing field .
they have already become key players in the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and in climate debates , for example .
their businesses are expanding worldwide and representatives from these emerging nations are already questioning the legitimacy of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
in addition , brazil , india and south africa are aspiring to obtain a permanent seat in the united nations security council .
g20 represents world majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of emerging countries in political bodies wo n't affect poverty , say some experts in the wto , the " big five " belong to the so-called g20 , a group of emerging and developing nations that was founded in cancun , mexico in 2003 and represents two-thirds of the world 's population .
however , in international economic negotiations , the big five sometimes give the impression that they are already playing in a league of their own .
" the economic upturn of china , india , brazil and south africa does n't necessarily lead to a poverty-oriented global economic policy , " concluded a study by the aid organizations bread for the world and südwind institute , which is to be presented wednesday at the alternative summit in rostock .
" economic growth alone does n't help the poorest of the poor . "
the gap between rich and poor is growing even wider , particularly in brazil , mexico , india and south africa .
in the run-up to this year 's summit , there was talk of expanding the g8 - which currently represents only 13 percent of the world population - to the g13 .
however , this could weaken the position of the world 's poor , say experts .
the poor still lose out " the dominance of the wealthy industrialized countries in the world trade organization and the international monetary fund would be reduced , but the interests of poor people in emerging nations and the least-developed nations would still be pushed onto the back burner in the world trade system , " said reinhard koppe , development policy expert at bread for the world .
furthermore , the study reveals how power relationships have shifted over the past few years through the offensive economic policies of four of the largest emerging nations - china , india , brazil and south africa .
" all four states have become world powers in many sectors , not just in their regions but worldwide , " said koppe .
the study 's author friedel hütz-adams said that " established industrialized nations are no longer in a position to assert their own interests without making major compromises - both in the wto and in bilateral and regional treaties . "
strategies on the political front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 represents two thirds of the world 's population according to the study , brazil 's discourse within the wto focuses on close cooperation with the g20 countries and the nama 11 group -lrb- argentina , brazil , egypt , india , indonesia , namibia , philippines , south africa , tunisia and venezuela -rrb- , while making deals of its own behind the scenes . " the government in brazil is getting involved in the non-transparent structures of the wto by agreeing , together with india , to talks with the us , the eu and japan , " said the study .
china , which like brazil has only signed a handful of bilateral open-trade treaties , continues to focus on the wto negotiations and is prepared to support the positions of other emerging and developing countries .
conflict of interest is standing in the way , however , said hütz-adams .
in addition , china 's engagement in africa is now being seen as a threat by governments and companies from industrialized countries , added the author .
india sees itself as a spokesperson for developing countries on the international playing field , which could soon change .
hütz-adams sees the willingness of the indian government to join brazil in informal trade talks with the us , the eu and japan as a warning sign .
" no on knows whether india will stay connected with the goals of the g20 and g33 in the world trade organization negotiations , " he said .
the country has increasingly been distinguishing itself as an economic power and seems to be going its own way .
mexico continues to be an emerging country but , at the same time , is a member of oecd .
of the five " guest " nations at the g8 summit , its economy has opened up the most since the 1990s .
it maintains 13 free trade agreements with 42 other countries , including one with nafta since 1994 and with the eu since 2000 .
last year , the mexican government reduced customs duties on merchandise with 148 wto member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment has been a sticky issue with some major emerging nations like china after mexico joined nafta , cheap corn from the us flooded the mexican market and led to protests by farmers .
since mexico had increased the use of corn in ethanol production , it became scarce .
" that 's why there were tortilla rebellions and the country was noncommittal during the wto agricultural negotiations , " said hütz-adams .
what 's more , economic expansion in china and india is putting competitive pressure on mexico and brazil .
more influence for smaller countries the study named other differences between the major emerging countries as well .
brazil and south africa support a fundamental voting reform in the international monetary fund and the world bank that would give small countries more say .
india and china , on the other hand , want to enhance their own positions in both institutions .
it remains to be seen whether india and china will agree to the united states ' new climate initiative .
" that would require a parallel structure to the un where the small states would n't have any say anymore , " said hütz-adams .

as if to emphasize that whatever had gone before had just been a dry run for the main event , the police made their own statement to that effect .
the day started with what could only be described as widespread lockdown of infrastructure and ended with a heavy-handed clampdown on the opposition .
the arrival of the g8 heads had been a red letter day in the protestors ' diary from the very beginning .
even though their main target , us president george bush , had attempted to avoid the predicted mass picketing of laage airport by arriving a day earlier , there were still seven other leaders to vent anger against .
for the past few days , the issues had been the motivation to protest .
now the people responsible for those issues were coming and a predicted 8,000 to 10,000 demonstrators were ready to give them a welcome they would never forget .
police outnumber protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators on their way to the airport the police had other plans .
from the early morning , it was evident that the " two police officers for every protestor " rumor was no longer in dispute .
the massed ranks of heavily armored officers stationed on roads , bridges and railway tracks were sending out a visible message : you shall not pass .
the 16,000 regular police and 2,000 special officers drafted in for the summit were being used to full effect .
with the first arrival due to land at laage at 10 a.m. , hundreds of protestors streamed out of the rostock fischereihafen camp towards their own private vehicles and the specially organized buses waiting to take them the few kilometers to the airport while the morning was still in its infancy .
some of them did n't even make it out of the camp car park .
preventing protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police made it clear that demonstrators would not get past them the first full bus was ready to depart when it was surrounded by police wagons .
officers ordered the passengers out of the bus and the vehicle was slowly searched while bags and pockets were emptied on demand .
another bus arrived and was immediately impounded , its human cargo forced to get comfortable on the grass verge .
for how long , it is hard to say .
many never made it out of rostock .
there were alternative routes , however .
but security had not been the only reason why laage had been chosen as the arrival point .
it is horrendously difficult to get to by public transport and even more so when the roads and train tracks are closed down .
buses carrying protestors were stopped kilometers from the airport , unloaded and the passengers allowed to continue to a specified containment point away from laage on foot .
and these were the lucky ones .
mysteriously coincidental train malfunctions paralyzed the rail system just after rush hour leaving many protestors stranded and angry .
this would later contribute to frustration and violence .
few get through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers redirected protestors those who had set out just in time to avoid the main lockdown of the transport system around laage were met at the containment points by rows of riot police .
the plan had been to picket the airport at four main sites around its perimeter .
with numbers expected in the region of 8,000 demonstrators , it had been planned that around 2,000 would go to each .
the road blocks and train cancellations had contributed to a massive decimation of those numbers .
the few hundred which had gathered at the mouth of the airport 's service road milled around in front of the police , some muttering nervously about the prevalence of unit 23 , the hardest and most uncompromising officers bandied together from various forces to create an elite division .
various attempts to begin the demonstration were stopped by senior police officers .
there would be protests allowed , but only 50 people at a time would be let through the cordons to demonstrate at the airport 's gates .
from an expected crowd of 2,000 , as few as 37 protestors eventually made it to the gate .
once there , over 70 police officers blocked the entrance and forced the small group of protestors onto a grass verge opposite and held them there for an hour .
deflated demonstrators meanwhile , reports were phoned in to the group leader from an associate at bad doberan about a major incident involving over a thousand protestors who had been denied the chance to travel to laage and a large contingent of riot police .
according to the source in bad doberan , clashes had escalated quickly and tear gas and water cannons were being used to quell the unrest .
there was even an unsubstantiated report that a badly injured protestor had been denied medical assistance by police officers .
the mood of those at laage was already deflated before hearing this .
the planned blockade and show of strength had been turned into a pathetic joke by a well-coordinated and ruthless police operation .
by denying access to thousands and controlling to the footstep the movements of those which did make it to the boundaries of the airport , the police effectively removed all opposition at the point of entry for the g8 leaders .
and in bad doberan , they showed that they had learned the mistakes of the weekend where sheer numbers could not make up for the lack of preparation in dealing with a rioting mob .
on wednesday , the police struck hard and fast to end the unrest .

but western hopes for progress were met with intransigence by iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier met with iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani , in surprise talks in berlin on the eve of the g8 summit . but no progress was made towards resolving the ongoing row over tehran 's nuclear program . steinmeier told reporters the aim of the talks had been to create more " suppleness " on the part of iran and to persuade the islamic republic to rethink its stance . iran has defied international pressure to halt uranium enrichment , saying it wants only to generate energy for a growing population when fossil fuels eventually run out . the western powers believe that iran is conducting a nuclear enrichment program with the aim of making a bomb , a charge which tehran has repeatedly denied . " it 's too late to push us back " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has met with larijani in the past ; here , in 2006 talks back in tehran , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that it was too late to stop his nation 's nuclear program , telling reporters tuesday , " we have broken through to a new stage and it is too late to push us back . " at a typically defiant news conference , ahmadinejad also warned the un security council of the dangers of seeking to pressure iran , telling the world body not to risk playing with a " lion 's tail . " " we advise them not to indulge in child 's play ...
they say that iran is a lion sat down in a corner .
and we tell them : do not play with the lion 's tail . " diplomatic sources in berlin said germany was making " efforts to map the way forward on the iranian nuclear dossier in close consultation with the eu foreign policy coordinator javier solana . " solana and larijani have met twice in recent weeks but failed to defuse the standoff over iran 's refusal to stop enrichment work .
solana tried to coax tehran to halt enrichment in exchange for a package of political , economic and trade incentives . but instead , tehran 's intransigence has led the west to threaten more sanctions against the islamic republic .
the un security council has already agreed to two sets of sanctions against iran for ignoring its calls to suspend enrichment , and western powers are now openly talking of a new resolution after iran missed the latest deadline . a un report released last month stated that tehran could be three to eight years away from developing nuclear arms . " we are dealing with psychological warfare " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian leader has defied un sanctions in jerusalem on tuesday , israeli foreign minister tzipi livni urged the international community not to succumb to iran 's position . " iran is trying to convince the world that it has crossed the point of no return in order to weaken the international community 's efforts to stop iran , " her office quoted her as saying . " we are dealing with psychological warfare , " said livni , whose country is considered the sole , undeclared nuclear power in the middle east . meanwhile , ahmadinejad predicted that washington would never be able to hurt the islamic republic even though the us has never ruled out military action to bring iran to heel over its nuclear drive . us secretary of state condoleezza rice , in the northeastern german resort of heiligendamm for the g8 talks said that ahmadinejad , who has repeatedly called for the destruction of the jewish state , was " digging a deeper and deeper hole for his country . " the g8 grouping of the us , britain , germany , france , italy , canada , japan and russia have threatened tougher sanctions if iran fails to meet un demands to halt enrichment . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this latest diplomatic exchange will do little to ease the strain .
" we can not agree on his declaration about the derailing of democratic reforms , " kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters ahead of a meeting of group of eight leaders in germany .
" russia is a democratic country that shares common world and common european values . "
earlier bush said during a speech in prague : " in russia , reforms that once promised to empower citizens have been derailed , with troubling implications for democratic development . "
on the attack peskov reiterated russia 's frequent complaint about us unilateralism , saying " one-sided decisions and double standards are inacceptable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the words coming out of the kremlin are sharp he also renewed moscow 's attack on the us plan to deploy an anti-missile system in the czech republic and poland , both former warsaw pact countries that are now members of nato and the european union .
" we have not received an explanation on the point of this shield or an explanation about whom it targets , " peskov said .
the united states says the shield would guard against hypothetical future attacks from iran or north korea , neither of which are believed currently to possess missiles of a sufficient range to reach europe .
moscow describes the planned missile shield as an aggressive step closer to russia 's borders .
addressed at summit peskov said that " these painful questions " would be raised during the g8 summit starting wednesday , including during a meeting scheduled for thursday between putin and bush .
russia will openly talk of its concerns and will wait for a corresponding explanation and , of course , the president as always will be ready to give detailed explanations on questions of concern to our partners , " peskov said .
however , he said he hoped the worsening rhetoric between moscow and washington will not " create any tension , much less confrontation . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but western hopes for progress were met with intransigence by iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier met with iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani , in surprise talks in berlin on the eve of the g8 summit . but no progress was made towards resolving the ongoing row over tehran 's nuclear program . steinmeier told reporters the aim of the talks had been to create more " suppleness " on the part of iran and to persuade the islamic republic to rethink its stance . iran has defied international pressure to halt uranium enrichment , saying it wants only to generate energy for a growing population when fossil fuels eventually run out . the western powers believe that iran is conducting a nuclear enrichment program with the aim of making a bomb , a charge which tehran has repeatedly denied . " it 's too late to push us back " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has met with larijani in the past ; here , in 2006 talks back in tehran , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that it was too late to stop his nation 's nuclear program , telling reporters tuesday , " we have broken through to a new stage and it is too late to push us back . " at a typically defiant news conference , ahmadinejad also warned the un security council of the dangers of seeking to pressure iran , telling the world body not to risk playing with a " lion 's tail . " " we advise them not to indulge in child 's play ...
they say that iran is a lion sat down in a corner .
and we tell them : do not play with the lion 's tail . " diplomatic sources in berlin said germany was making " efforts to map the way forward on the iranian nuclear dossier in close consultation with the eu foreign policy coordinator javier solana . " solana and larijani have met twice in recent weeks but failed to defuse the standoff over iran 's refusal to stop enrichment work .
solana tried to coax tehran to halt enrichment in exchange for a package of political , economic and trade incentives . but instead , tehran 's intransigence has led the west to threaten more sanctions against the islamic republic .
the un security council has already agreed to two sets of sanctions against iran for ignoring its calls to suspend enrichment , and western powers are now openly talking of a new resolution after iran missed the latest deadline . a un report released last month stated that tehran could be three to eight years away from developing nuclear arms . " we are dealing with psychological warfare " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian leader has defied un sanctions in jerusalem on tuesday , israeli foreign minister tzipi livni urged the international community not to succumb to iran 's position . " iran is trying to convince the world that it has crossed the point of no return in order to weaken the international community 's efforts to stop iran , " her office quoted her as saying . " we are dealing with psychological warfare , " said livni , whose country is considered the sole , undeclared nuclear power in the middle east . meanwhile , ahmadinejad predicted that washington would never be able to hurt the islamic republic even though the us has never ruled out military action to bring iran to heel over its nuclear drive . us secretary of state condoleezza rice , in the northeastern german resort of heiligendamm for the g8 talks said that ahmadinejad , who has repeatedly called for the destruction of the jewish state , was " digging a deeper and deeper hole for his country . " the g8 grouping of the us , britain , germany , france , italy , canada , japan and russia have threatened tougher sanctions if iran fails to meet un demands to halt enrichment . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de g8 summit -pipe- 06.06.2007 outlook is bleak for big strides on climate issues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is causing divisions germany 's agenda for the g8 summit ranges from africa and trade to hedge funds , relations with russia , the middle east and kosovo .
but it is the climate that is getting the most heat . german chancellor angela merkel has made climate change and the challenges to combat it a key issue at the group of eight summit she is hosting at the baltic coastal resort of heiligendamm in germany .
observers are saying a substantial outcome is unlikely , however .
and in recent statements , merkel has tried to put the stress on at least getting the g8 countries to agree to keep at least agreeing to keep talks on climate change within a united nations framework .
" in heiligendamm we want to give impetus to the negotiations on global climate protection , " the chancellor said .
" i hope there will be a signal from heiligendamm that the countries represented there clearly recognize their collective responsibility , " she said .
with the world leaders from industrialized nations attending the meeting , some consensus about how to tackle the climate change problem could be possible .
no fixed targets likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has set climate high on the agenda but german press agency dpa reported wednesday morning that the united states and germany had apparently failed to agree on fixed targets in the fight against global warming in talks ahead of the summit .
and us president george w. bush 's chief environment adviser , james connaughton , has said the summit would end without an agreement on fixed targets .
connaughton said each country had to set its own targets .
this was not only washington 's view but also that of , for instance , japan and canada , he said .
it would take more time until all leading industrialized nations could agree on a joint vision .
however , british prime minister tony blair said wednesday he believes he can persuade bush to agree for the first time to a global target for a " substantial cut " in greenhouse gas emissions .
in an interview with the guardian newspaper wednesday , blair said that america was " on the move " in its position on climate change .
last-ditch effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has not endorsed the kyoto protocol to limit emissions chancellor merkel was to hold a pre-summit lunch meeting with bush on wednesday in a bid to find common ground on climate change .
the summit officially begins with a formal dinner later in the evening . last week , the chancellor had welcomed bush 's call for a new strategy on tackling global warming through joint action by the world 's top polluters - including china and india - as a " positive " step .
but merkel has also made clear that she will still press g8 leaders to commit to cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- .
support from other nations germany 's plan for a binding pact has won qualified support from some nations , but bush last week unveiled his own proposals and said a long-term goal for reducing greenhouses gases could be set by the end of 2008 .
merkel wants the g8 to guide other nations towards negotiations due to take place in december to find a successor to the kyoto protocol .
the 1997 kyoto protocol , named after japan 's ancient capital , where it was signed , is the world 's first treaty mandating emission cuts and will expire in 2012 .
on tuesday , the european union - represented by merkel as the current eu president - and japan agreed to take the lead in forging a successor to kyoto . they jointly proposed to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
bildunterschrift : police and protestors clashed before the summit " the eu and japan are committed to take strong leadership towards the development of a fair , flexible , effective and comprehensive un post-2012 framework that ensures the participation of all major emitting countries , " a joint statement said after the tuesday meeting .
developing countries ' role while the eu and japan insisted that developed countries should play a vital role in fighting global warming , they also called for a " fair contribution " by developing countries .
" we have to take action under a un framework so that all members of the international community can participate bindingly , " merkel said after talks with japanese prime minister shinzo abe in berlin tuesday .
merkel has also repeatedly said that talks on climate change must be within a united nations framework .
earlier in the week , merkel made a statment to that effect , together with canadian prime minister stephen harper .
president bush will also meet japan 's prime minister shinzo abe before the summit begins .
russia also in limelight g8 members include germany , france , britain , italy , japan , the united states , canada and russia .
the european commission is also represented at all meetings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive security fence around the summit location chinese president hu jintao and counterparts from five emerging economies - brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa - will participate in the summit , highlighting their growing weight in international affairs .
other non-g8 members at the meeting include the leaders of algeria , egypt , ghana , nigeria and senegal .

as if to emphasize that whatever had gone before had just been a dry run for the main event , the police made their own statement to that effect .
the day started with what could only be described as widespread lockdown of infrastructure and ended with a heavy-handed clampdown on the opposition .
the arrival of the g8 heads had been a red letter day in the protestors ' diary from the very beginning .
even though their main target , us president george bush , had attempted to avoid the predicted mass picketing of laage airport by arriving a day earlier , there were still seven other leaders to vent anger against .
for the past few days , the issues had been the motivation to protest .
now the people responsible for those issues were coming and a predicted 8,000 to 10,000 demonstrators were ready to give them a welcome they would never forget .
police outnumber protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators on their way to the airport the police had other plans .
from the early morning , it was evident that the " two police officers for every protestor " rumor was no longer in dispute .
the massed ranks of heavily armored officers stationed on roads , bridges and railway tracks were sending out a visible message : you shall not pass .
the 16,000 regular police and 2,000 special officers drafted in for the summit were being used to full effect .
with the first arrival due to land at laage at 10 a.m. , hundreds of protestors streamed out of the rostock fischereihafen camp towards their own private vehicles and the specially organized buses waiting to take them the few kilometers to the airport while the morning was still in its infancy .
some of them did n't even make it out of the camp car park .
preventing protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police made it clear that demonstrators would not get past them the first full bus was ready to depart when it was surrounded by police wagons .
officers ordered the passengers out of the bus and the vehicle was slowly searched while bags and pockets were emptied on demand .
another bus arrived and was immediately impounded , its human cargo forced to get comfortable on the grass verge .
for how long , it is hard to say .
many never made it out of rostock .
there were alternative routes , however .
but security had not been the only reason why laage had been chosen as the arrival point .
it is horrendously difficult to get to by public transport and even more so when the roads and train tracks are closed down .
buses carrying protestors were stopped kilometers from the airport , unloaded and the passengers allowed to continue to a specified containment point away from laage on foot .
and these were the lucky ones .
mysteriously coincidental train malfunctions paralyzed the rail system just after rush hour leaving many protestors stranded and angry .
this would later contribute to frustration and violence .
few get through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers redirected protestors those who had set out just in time to avoid the main lockdown of the transport system around laage were met at the containment points by rows of riot police .
the plan had been to picket the airport at four main sites around its perimeter .
with numbers expected in the region of 8,000 demonstrators , it had been planned that around 2,000 would go to each .
the road blocks and train cancellations had contributed to a massive decimation of those numbers .
the few hundred which had gathered at the mouth of the airport 's service road milled around in front of the police , some muttering nervously about the prevalence of unit 23 , the hardest and most uncompromising officers bandied together from various forces to create an elite division .
various attempts to begin the demonstration were stopped by senior police officers .
there would be protests allowed , but only 50 people at a time would be let through the cordons to demonstrate at the airport 's gates .
from an expected crowd of 2,000 , as few as 37 protestors eventually made it to the gate .
once there , over 70 police officers blocked the entrance and forced the small group of protestors onto a grass verge opposite and held them there for an hour .
deflated demonstrators meanwhile , reports were phoned in to the group leader from an associate at bad doberan about a major incident involving over a thousand protestors who had been denied the chance to travel to laage and a large contingent of riot police .
according to the source in bad doberan , clashes had escalated quickly and tear gas and water cannons were being used to quell the unrest .
there was even an unsubstantiated report that a badly injured protestor had been denied medical assistance by police officers .
the mood of those at laage was already deflated before hearing this .
the planned blockade and show of strength had been turned into a pathetic joke by a well-coordinated and ruthless police operation .
by denying access to thousands and controlling to the footstep the movements of those which did make it to the boundaries of the airport , the police effectively removed all opposition at the point of entry for the g8 leaders .
and in bad doberan , they showed that they had learned the mistakes of the weekend where sheer numbers could not make up for the lack of preparation in dealing with a rioting mob .
on wednesday , the police struck hard and fast to end the unrest .
they more than made up for their shortcomings on previous unruly days .
on wednesday , they could claim a victory .
only in the future will it really be clear what was lost . nick amies , reporting from rostock send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 summit : it 's foolish to oppose it the demonstrators at the g8 summit in heiligendamm blame that group of nations for many of the world 's inequities .

but dw 's henrik böhme says their view is one-sided , myopic and unfair . if a group of nations is responsible for more than two-thirds of world trade and pays more than three-quarters of the world 's financial aid , why should n't those countries meet to talk to one another ?
what 's the problem with analyzing the world economic situation to identify potential problems and come up with solutions ?
is it wrong to invite representatives from africa , china and india and start a dialogue ? admittedly the g8 needs to bridge the gap between world leaders and ordinary people .
the last time , germany hosted a g8 summit , in cologne in 1999 , then-us president bill clinton was able to walk outside his hotel and visit a brew-pub . but in the wake of the riots in genoa in 2001 , not to mention the terrorist attacks of september 11th , the world has changed and the barriers have gotten much higher .
but that 's no reason for world leaders not to talk about initiatives to relieve poverty or to fight aids and other deadly diseases . there 's no way to solve all the world 's problems in three days .
but the summit is the first step in a process that will be continued on various levels around the world . moreover , globalization is not a g8 invention .
arguably , globalization began in 1620 when the first shipment of tea arrived from japan in the port of amsterdam .
globalization is not some outside phenomenon afflicting the world , but something that we , as world citizens , can influence and direct . that 's a fact many of the demonstrators choose to ignore .
blaming the g8 for everything that 's wrong in the world is what 's wrong .
heiligendamm is just a symbol for a collection of problems that have no one address . for that 's reason , it 's foolish to oppose the g8 summit in knee-jerk fashion .
we no longer live in a world of clearly defined good and evil . or to pose the question the other way around : would the world be any better a place , if there were no g8 summits ? henrik böhme is a business editor at dw radio -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it is the climate that is getting the most heat . german chancellor angela merkel has made climate change and the challenges to combat it a key issue at the group of eight summit she is hosting at the baltic coastal resort of heiligendamm in germany .
observers are saying a substantial outcome is unlikely , however .
and in recent statements , merkel has tried to put the stress on at least getting the g8 countries to agree to keep at least agreeing to keep talks on climate change within a united nations framework .
" in heiligendamm we want to give impetus to the negotiations on global climate protection , " the chancellor said .
" i hope there will be a signal from heiligendamm that the countries represented there clearly recognize their collective responsibility , " she said .
with the world leaders from industrialized nations attending the meeting , some consensus about how to tackle the climate change problem could be possible .
no fixed targets likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has set climate high on the agenda but german press agency dpa reported wednesday morning that the united states and germany had apparently failed to agree on fixed targets in the fight against global warming in talks ahead of the summit .
and us president george w. bush 's chief environment adviser , james connaughton , has said the summit would end without an agreement on fixed targets .
connaughton said each country had to set its own targets .
this was not only washington 's view but also that of , for instance , japan and canada , he said .
it would take more time until all leading industrialized nations could agree on a joint vision .
however , british prime minister tony blair said wednesday he believes he can persuade bush to agree for the first time to a global target for a " substantial cut " in greenhouse gas emissions .
in an interview with the guardian newspaper wednesday , blair said that america was " on the move " in its position on climate change .
last-ditch effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has not endorsed the kyoto protocol to limit emissions chancellor merkel was to hold a pre-summit lunch meeting with bush on wednesday in a bid to find common ground on climate change .
the summit officially begins with a formal dinner later in the evening . last week , the chancellor had welcomed bush 's call for a new strategy on tackling global warming through joint action by the world 's top polluters - including china and india - as a " positive " step .
but merkel has also made clear that she will still press g8 leaders to commit to cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- .
support from other nations germany 's plan for a binding pact has won qualified support from some nations , but bush last week unveiled his own proposals and said a long-term goal for reducing greenhouses gases could be set by the end of 2008 .
merkel wants the g8 to guide other nations towards negotiations due to take place in december to find a successor to the kyoto protocol .
the 1997 kyoto protocol , named after japan 's ancient capital , where it was signed , is the world 's first treaty mandating emission cuts and will expire in 2012 .
on tuesday , the european union - represented by merkel as the current eu president - and japan agreed to take the lead in forging a successor to kyoto . they jointly proposed to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
bildunterschrift : police and protestors clashed before the summit " the eu and japan are committed to take strong leadership towards the development of a fair , flexible , effective and comprehensive un post-2012 framework that ensures the participation of all major emitting countries , " a joint statement said after the tuesday meeting .
developing countries ' role while the eu and japan insisted that developed countries should play a vital role in fighting global warming , they also called for a " fair contribution " by developing countries .
" we have to take action under a un framework so that all members of the international community can participate bindingly , " merkel said after talks with japanese prime minister shinzo abe in berlin tuesday .
merkel has also repeatedly said that talks on climate change must be within a united nations framework .
earlier in the week , merkel made a statment to that effect , together with canadian prime minister stephen harper .
president bush will also meet japan 's prime minister shinzo abe before the summit begins .

this latest diplomatic exchange will do little to ease the strain .
" we can not agree on his declaration about the derailing of democratic reforms , " kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters ahead of a meeting of group of eight leaders in germany .
" russia is a democratic country that shares common world and common european values . "
earlier bush said during a speech in prague : " in russia , reforms that once promised to empower citizens have been derailed , with troubling implications for democratic development . "
on the attack peskov reiterated russia 's frequent complaint about us unilateralism , saying " one-sided decisions and double standards are inacceptable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the words coming out of the kremlin are sharp he also renewed moscow 's attack on the us plan to deploy an anti-missile system in the czech republic and poland , both former warsaw pact countries that are now members of nato and the european union .
" we have not received an explanation on the point of this shield or an explanation about whom it targets , " peskov said .
the united states says the shield would guard against hypothetical future attacks from iran or north korea , neither of which are believed currently to possess missiles of a sufficient range to reach europe .
moscow describes the planned missile shield as an aggressive step closer to russia 's borders .
addressed at summit peskov said that " these painful questions " would be raised during the g8 summit starting wednesday , including during a meeting scheduled for thursday between putin and bush .
russia will openly talk of its concerns and will wait for a corresponding explanation and , of course , the president as always will be ready to give detailed explanations on questions of concern to our partners , " peskov said .
however , he said he hoped the worsening rhetoric between moscow and washington will not " create any tension , much less confrontation . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's henrik böhme says their view is one-sided , myopic and unfair . if a group of nations is responsible for more than two-thirds of world trade and pays more than three-quarters of the world 's financial aid , why should n't those countries meet to talk to one another ?
what 's the problem with analyzing the world economic situation to identify potential problems and come up with solutions ?
is it wrong to invite representatives from africa , china and india and start a dialogue ? admittedly the g8 needs to bridge the gap between world leaders and ordinary people .
the last time , germany hosted a g8 summit , in cologne in 1999 , then-us president bill clinton was able to walk outside his hotel and visit a brew-pub . but in the wake of the riots in genoa in 2001 , not to mention the terrorist attacks of september 11th , the world has changed and the barriers have gotten much higher .
but that 's no reason for world leaders not to talk about initiatives to relieve poverty or to fight aids and other deadly diseases . there 's no way to solve all the world 's problems in three days .
but the summit is the first step in a process that will be continued on various levels around the world . moreover , globalization is not a g8 invention .
arguably , globalization began in 1620 when the first shipment of tea arrived from japan in the port of amsterdam .
globalization is not some outside phenomenon afflicting the world , but something that we , as world citizens , can influence and direct . that 's a fact many of the demonstrators choose to ignore .
blaming the g8 for everything that 's wrong in the world is what 's wrong .
heiligendamm is just a symbol for a collection of problems that have no one address . for that 's reason , it 's foolish to oppose the g8 summit in knee-jerk fashion .
we no longer live in a world of clearly defined good and evil . or to pose the question the other way around : would the world be any better a place , if there were no g8 summits ? henrik böhme is a business editor at dw radio -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

outlook is bleak for big strides on climate issues germany 's agenda for the g8 summit ranges from africa and trade to hedge funds , relations with russia , the middle east and kosovo .

but western hopes for progress were met with intransigence by iran . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier met with iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani , in surprise talks in berlin on the eve of the g8 summit . but no progress was made towards resolving the ongoing row over tehran 's nuclear program . steinmeier told reporters the aim of the talks had been to create more " suppleness " on the part of iran and to persuade the islamic republic to rethink its stance . iran has defied international pressure to halt uranium enrichment , saying it wants only to generate energy for a growing population when fossil fuels eventually run out . the western powers believe that iran is conducting a nuclear enrichment program with the aim of making a bomb , a charge which tehran has repeatedly denied . " it 's too late to push us back " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has met with larijani in the past ; here , in 2006 talks back in tehran , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that it was too late to stop his nation 's nuclear program , telling reporters tuesday , " we have broken through to a new stage and it is too late to push us back . " at a typically defiant news conference , ahmadinejad also warned the un security council of the dangers of seeking to pressure iran , telling the world body not to risk playing with a " lion 's tail . " " we advise them not to indulge in child 's play ...
they say that iran is a lion sat down in a corner .
and we tell them : do not play with the lion 's tail . " diplomatic sources in berlin said germany was making " efforts to map the way forward on the iranian nuclear dossier in close consultation with the eu foreign policy coordinator javier solana . " solana and larijani have met twice in recent weeks but failed to defuse the standoff over iran 's refusal to stop enrichment work .
solana tried to coax tehran to halt enrichment in exchange for a package of political , economic and trade incentives . but instead , tehran 's intransigence has led the west to threaten more sanctions against the islamic republic .
the un security council has already agreed to two sets of sanctions against iran for ignoring its calls to suspend enrichment , and western powers are now openly talking of a new resolution after iran missed the latest deadline . a un report released last month stated that tehran could be three to eight years away from developing nuclear arms . " we are dealing with psychological warfare " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian leader has defied un sanctions in jerusalem on tuesday , israeli foreign minister tzipi livni urged the international community not to succumb to iran 's position . " iran is trying to convince the world that it has crossed the point of no return in order to weaken the international community 's efforts to stop iran , " her office quoted her as saying . " we are dealing with psychological warfare , " said livni , whose country is considered the sole , undeclared nuclear power in the middle east . meanwhile , ahmadinejad predicted that washington would never be able to hurt the islamic republic even though the us has never ruled out military action to bring iran to heel over its nuclear drive . us secretary of state condoleezza rice , in the northeastern german resort of heiligendamm for the g8 talks said that ahmadinejad , who has repeatedly called for the destruction of the jewish state , was " digging a deeper and deeper hole for his country . " the g8 grouping of the us , britain , germany , france , italy , canada , japan and russia have threatened tougher sanctions if iran fails to meet un demands to halt enrichment . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 06.06.2007 british couple appeals to germans for clues in kidnapping case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abduction case has captured considerable attention from the german media a british couple whose small daughter was abducted in portugal raises public awareness by touring european capitals and giving a press conference in berlin . it is every parent 's nightmare .
ever since their four-year-old daughter went missing from a holiday resort in portugal 's algarve region on may 3 , gerry and kate mccann have launched a high profile campaign to find madeleine , who was allegedly abducted from the bedroom of the villa where they stayed . the british couple , who are doctors , had left her and her two-year-old twin siblings , who were unharmed , in the apartment , while they went to a restaurant on the premises . they have already met pope benedict xvi in rome and traveled to madrid , which was the start of their tour of european capitals to raise awareness for their daughter 's disappearance . now they have publicized their appeal in germany since german and dutch tourists make up the majority of foreign tourists in algarve . publicizing appeal in germany " we are here to ask the german public for help in searching for our little daughter , " gerry mccann announced at a press conference in berlin with his wife kate at his side . the couple asked german tourists to look through holiday photographs taken in portugal last month to see whether the little girl , and perhaps also her abductor , might be in the background .
when a journalist suggested that they could in some way be involved in the abduction of their child , gerry mccann retorted : " i have never heard before that anyone considers us suspects in this and the portuguese police certainly do n't . " the case has captured considerable attention from the german media .
bild , the mass circulation tabloid , published an open letter to the mccanns from brigitta sirny , the mother of the austrian girl natascha kampusch , who had been kidnapped as a 10-year-old on her way to school and held in captivity for more than eight years .
last summer , kampusch made a dramatic escape from her abductor , who then killed himself before he could be arrested . parallels with abduction of austrian girl last year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha kampusch was held in captivity for 3,096 days " my daughter natascha was also kidnapped , " sirny wrote .
" she was held for 3,096 days at the mercy of a demented criminal .
i have suffered countless hours of despair .
hours in which i kept asking myself : why ?
why my child ?
who has done this ?
who would kidnap a defenseless child ?
could i have stopped it ?
did a lapse of a few minutes cost years of my child 's life ? " the newspaper also quoted sirny as saying that publicizing the case , which became a sensation in germany , was the right thing to do , " because the worst that could happen for a kidnapped child is to be forgotten . " there is still hope in an interview with german newspaper berliner morgenpost on sunday , gerry mccann said that there was still hope . " as long as there is hope , we are not giving up , " he said .
kate mccann said she hoped madeleine was safe and was being cared for . " we know there are evil people out there , but there are also confused people , " she said .
" we do not know who this person is .
we hope the latter . " the couple also met with the mayor of berlin , klaus wowereit .
they said they would fly to amsterdam later wednesday to make a similar appeal there . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 06.06.2007 kremlin rejects bush criticism on democracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush appears to have his doubts about putin 's democratic credentials just before the us and russian leaders meet in germany , the kremlin rejected president george w. bush 's questioning during his prague visit whether russia is moving toward or away from a democratic system of government . the kremlin 's rejection on tuesday of bush 's accusation that russia is no longer striving for democracy comes as tensions are already high between the one-time cold war rivals over a planned us missile defense system in central europe .
this latest diplomatic exchange will do little to ease the strain .
" we can not agree on his declaration about the derailing of democratic reforms , " kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters ahead of a meeting of group of eight leaders in germany .
" russia is a democratic country that shares common world and common european values . "
earlier bush said during a speech in prague : " in russia , reforms that once promised to empower citizens have been derailed , with troubling implications for democratic development . "
on the attack peskov reiterated russia 's frequent complaint about us unilateralism , saying " one-sided decisions and double standards are inacceptable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the words coming out of the kremlin are sharp he also renewed moscow 's attack on the us plan to deploy an anti-missile system in the czech republic and poland , both former warsaw pact countries that are now members of nato and the european union .
" we have not received an explanation on the point of this shield or an explanation about whom it targets , " peskov said .
the united states says the shield would guard against hypothetical future attacks from iran or north korea , neither of which are believed currently to possess missiles of a sufficient range to reach europe .
moscow describes the planned missile shield as an aggressive step closer to russia 's borders .
addressed at summit peskov said that " these painful questions " would be raised during the g8 summit starting wednesday , including during a meeting scheduled for thursday between putin and bush .
russia will openly talk of its concerns and will wait for a corresponding explanation and , of course , the president as always will be ready to give detailed explanations on questions of concern to our partners , " peskov said .
however , he said he hoped the worsening rhetoric between moscow and washington will not " create any tension , much less confrontation . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as if to emphasize that whatever had gone before had just been a dry run for the main event , the police made their own statement to that effect .
the day started with what could only be described as widespread lockdown of infrastructure and ended with a heavy-handed clampdown on the opposition .
the arrival of the g8 heads had been a red letter day in the protestors ' diary from the very beginning .
even though their main target , us president george bush , had attempted to avoid the predicted mass picketing of laage airport by arriving a day earlier , there were still seven other leaders to vent anger against .
for the past few days , the issues had been the motivation to protest .
now the people responsible for those issues were coming and a predicted 8,000 to 10,000 demonstrators were ready to give them a welcome they would never forget .
police outnumber protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators on their way to the airport the police had other plans .
from the early morning , it was evident that the " two police officers for every protestor " rumor was no longer in dispute .
the massed ranks of heavily armored officers stationed on roads , bridges and railway tracks were sending out a visible message : you shall not pass .
the 16,000 regular police and 2,000 special officers drafted in for the summit were being used to full effect .
with the first arrival due to land at laage at 10 a.m. , hundreds of protestors streamed out of the rostock fischereihafen camp towards their own private vehicles and the specially organized buses waiting to take them the few kilometers to the airport while the morning was still in its infancy .
some of them did n't even make it out of the camp car park .
preventing protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police made it clear that demonstrators would not get past them the first full bus was ready to depart when it was surrounded by police wagons .
officers ordered the passengers out of the bus and the vehicle was slowly searched while bags and pockets were emptied on demand .
another bus arrived and was immediately impounded , its human cargo forced to get comfortable on the grass verge .
for how long , it is hard to say .
many never made it out of rostock .
there were alternative routes , however .
but security had not been the only reason why laage had been chosen as the arrival point .
it is horrendously difficult to get to by public transport and even more so when the roads and train tracks are closed down .
buses carrying protestors were stopped kilometers from the airport , unloaded and the passengers allowed to continue to a specified containment point away from laage on foot .
and these were the lucky ones .
mysteriously coincidental train malfunctions paralyzed the rail system just after rush hour leaving many protestors stranded and angry .
this would later contribute to frustration and violence .
few get through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers redirected protestors those who had set out just in time to avoid the main lockdown of the transport system around laage were met at the containment points by rows of riot police .
the plan had been to picket the airport at four main sites around its perimeter .
with numbers expected in the region of 8,000 demonstrators , it had been planned that around 2,000 would go to each .
the road blocks and train cancellations had contributed to a massive decimation of those numbers .
the few hundred which had gathered at the mouth of the airport 's service road milled around in front of the police , some muttering nervously about the prevalence of unit 23 , the hardest and most uncompromising officers bandied together from various forces to create an elite division .
various attempts to begin the demonstration were stopped by senior police officers .
there would be protests allowed , but only 50 people at a time would be let through the cordons to demonstrate at the airport 's gates .
from an expected crowd of 2,000 , as few as 37 protestors eventually made it to the gate .
once there , over 70 police officers blocked the entrance and forced the small group of protestors onto a grass verge opposite and held them there for an hour .
deflated demonstrators meanwhile , reports were phoned in to the group leader from an associate at bad doberan about a major incident involving over a thousand protestors who had been denied the chance to travel to laage and a large contingent of riot police .
according to the source in bad doberan , clashes had escalated quickly and tear gas and water cannons were being used to quell the unrest .
there was even an unsubstantiated report that a badly injured protestor had been denied medical assistance by police officers .
the mood of those at laage was already deflated before hearing this .
the planned blockade and show of strength had been turned into a pathetic joke by a well-coordinated and ruthless police operation .
by denying access to thousands and controlling to the footstep the movements of those which did make it to the boundaries of the airport , the police effectively removed all opposition at the point of entry for the g8 leaders .
and in bad doberan , they showed that they had learned the mistakes of the weekend where sheer numbers could not make up for the lack of preparation in dealing with a rioting mob .
on wednesday , the police struck hard and fast to end the unrest .
they more than made up for their shortcomings on previous unruly days .
on wednesday , they could claim a victory .
only in the future will it really be clear what was lost . nick amies , reporting from rostock send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 summit : it 's foolish to oppose it the demonstrators at the g8 summit in heiligendamm blame that group of nations for many of the world 's inequities .

he voiced a " strong desire " to work with g8 nations on a new agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce dependence on foreign oil supplies . " some areas need discussion " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush in heiligendamm on wednesday but the us president made no reference to merkel 's push for the developed countries of the g8 to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 percent of 1990 levels by 2050 , and to commit themselves to a global temperature rise of no more than two celsius degrees this century . merkel , who has said she will in no case back off the two-degree limit , diplomatically noted that there were " areas here and there " which needed further discussion . european commission president jose manuel barroso said he expected no definite agreement to emerge from the summit and repeated his criticism of the us approach . " i do n't expect this summit to establish targets , but i expect there will be recognition of the need to have targets , " said barroso , attending the summit as the head of the eu 's executive body . barros rues lack of leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso , with wife , called for leadership on the climate issue he added that the problem was not so much competition between different approaches , " but what is missing is leadership from some of our partners . " like merkel , barroso nevertheless welcomed the initiative on climate change put forward by bush last month , saying it marked an " evolution " in the us position . senior japanese foreign ministry official koji tsuruoka said definite goals would not be agreed but that the summit was rather " a golden opportunity to make clear at the level of heads of state and government that this is a problem of the highest priority .

as if to emphasize that whatever had gone before had just been a dry run for the main event , the police made their own statement to that effect .
the day started with what could only be described as widespread lockdown of infrastructure and ended with a heavy-handed clampdown on the opposition .
the arrival of the g8 heads had been a red letter day in the protestors ' diary from the very beginning .
even though their main target , us president george bush , had attempted to avoid the predicted mass picketing of laage airport by arriving a day earlier , there were still seven other leaders to vent anger against .
for the past few days , the issues had been the motivation to protest .
now the people responsible for those issues were coming and a predicted 8,000 to 10,000 demonstrators were ready to give them a welcome they would never forget .
police outnumber protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators on their way to the airport the police had other plans .
from the early morning , it was evident that the " two police officers for every protestor " rumor was no longer in dispute .
the massed ranks of heavily armored officers stationed on roads , bridges and railway tracks were sending out a visible message : you shall not pass .
the 16,000 regular police and 2,000 special officers drafted in for the summit were being used to full effect .
with the first arrival due to land at laage at 10 a.m. , hundreds of protestors streamed out of the rostock fischereihafen camp towards their own private vehicles and the specially organized buses waiting to take them the few kilometers to the airport while the morning was still in its infancy .
some of them did n't even make it out of the camp car park .
preventing protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police made it clear that demonstrators would not get past them the first full bus was ready to depart when it was surrounded by police wagons .
officers ordered the passengers out of the bus and the vehicle was slowly searched while bags and pockets were emptied on demand .
another bus arrived and was immediately impounded , its human cargo forced to get comfortable on the grass verge .
for how long , it is hard to say .
many never made it out of rostock .
there were alternative routes , however .
but security had not been the only reason why laage had been chosen as the arrival point .
it is horrendously difficult to get to by public transport and even more so when the roads and train tracks are closed down .
buses carrying protestors were stopped kilometers from the airport , unloaded and the passengers allowed to continue to a specified containment point away from laage on foot .
and these were the lucky ones .
mysteriously coincidental train malfunctions paralyzed the rail system just after rush hour leaving many protestors stranded and angry .
this would later contribute to frustration and violence .
few get through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers redirected protestors those who had set out just in time to avoid the main lockdown of the transport system around laage were met at the containment points by rows of riot police .
the plan had been to picket the airport at four main sites around its perimeter .
with numbers expected in the region of 8,000 demonstrators , it had been planned that around 2,000 would go to each .
the road blocks and train cancellations had contributed to a massive decimation of those numbers .
the few hundred which had gathered at the mouth of the airport 's service road milled around in front of the police , some muttering nervously about the prevalence of unit 23 , the hardest and most uncompromising officers bandied together from various forces to create an elite division .
various attempts to begin the demonstration were stopped by senior police officers .
there would be protests allowed , but only 50 people at a time would be let through the cordons to demonstrate at the airport 's gates .
from an expected crowd of 2,000 , as few as 37 protestors eventually made it to the gate .
once there , over 70 police officers blocked the entrance and forced the small group of protestors onto a grass verge opposite and held them there for an hour .
deflated demonstrators meanwhile , reports were phoned in to the group leader from an associate at bad doberan about a major incident involving over a thousand protestors who had been denied the chance to travel to laage and a large contingent of riot police .
according to the source in bad doberan , clashes had escalated quickly and tear gas and water cannons were being used to quell the unrest .
there was even an unsubstantiated report that a badly injured protestor had been denied medical assistance by police officers .
the mood of those at laage was already deflated before hearing this .
the planned blockade and show of strength had been turned into a pathetic joke by a well-coordinated and ruthless police operation .
by denying access to thousands and controlling to the footstep the movements of those which did make it to the boundaries of the airport , the police effectively removed all opposition at the point of entry for the g8 leaders .
and in bad doberan , they showed that they had learned the mistakes of the weekend where sheer numbers could not make up for the lack of preparation in dealing with a rioting mob .
on wednesday , the police struck hard and fast to end the unrest .
they more than made up for their shortcomings on previous unruly days .

ever since their four-year-old daughter went missing from a holiday resort in portugal 's algarve region on may 3 , gerry and kate mccann have launched a high profile campaign to find madeleine , who was allegedly abducted from the bedroom of the villa where they stayed . the british couple , who are doctors , had left her and her two-year-old twin siblings , who were unharmed , in the apartment , while they went to a restaurant on the premises . they have already met pope benedict xvi in rome and traveled to madrid , which was the start of their tour of european capitals to raise awareness for their daughter 's disappearance . now they have publicized their appeal in germany since german and dutch tourists make up the majority of foreign tourists in algarve . publicizing appeal in germany " we are here to ask the german public for help in searching for our little daughter , " gerry mccann announced at a press conference in berlin with his wife kate at his side . the couple asked german tourists to look through holiday photographs taken in portugal last month to see whether the little girl , and perhaps also her abductor , might be in the background .
when a journalist suggested that they could in some way be involved in the abduction of their child , gerry mccann retorted : " i have never heard before that anyone considers us suspects in this and the portuguese police certainly do n't . " the case has captured considerable attention from the german media .
bild , the mass circulation tabloid , published an open letter to the mccanns from brigitta sirny , the mother of the austrian girl natascha kampusch , who had been kidnapped as a 10-year-old on her way to school and held in captivity for more than eight years .
last summer , kampusch made a dramatic escape from her abductor , who then killed himself before he could be arrested . parallels with abduction of austrian girl last year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha kampusch was held in captivity for 3,096 days " my daughter natascha was also kidnapped , " sirny wrote .
" she was held for 3,096 days at the mercy of a demented criminal .
i have suffered countless hours of despair .
hours in which i kept asking myself : why ?
why my child ?
who has done this ?
who would kidnap a defenseless child ?
could i have stopped it ?
did a lapse of a few minutes cost years of my child 's life ? " the newspaper also quoted sirny as saying that publicizing the case , which became a sensation in germany , was the right thing to do , " because the worst that could happen for a kidnapped child is to be forgotten . " there is still hope in an interview with german newspaper berliner morgenpost on sunday , gerry mccann said that there was still hope . " as long as there is hope , we are not giving up , " he said .
kate mccann said she hoped madeleine was safe and was being cared for . " we know there are evil people out there , but there are also confused people , " she said .
" we do not know who this person is .
we hope the latter . " the couple also met with the mayor of berlin , klaus wowereit .
they said they would fly to amsterdam later wednesday to make a similar appeal there . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

life here is usually sedate , which is why it is an oasis of calm for retirees and young families .
one gets the impression that nothing much happens here and that 's the way the locals like it .
even when there 's a major international summit happening nearby , there are very few indicators which suggest anything other than idyllic normality is , as usual , in abundance .
from time to time the cry of seagulls is interrupted by the dull thud of distant rotor blades as a military chopper circles overhead .
occasionally when traveling the undulating roads the picturesque view is disturbed by random crews of armor-clad cops guarding lonely crossroads .
but even then , their green overalls attempt to minimize the disruption to the surroundings by blending into the fields around them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if if were n't for the police vehicles , one local resident would n't have noticed a difference for the residents of heilingendamm and kühlungsborn , the arrival of the g8 leaders and the thousands of protestors has so far barely even registered .
" if it was n't for the police vehicles parked around town , i would n't even have noticed anything different , " said jörg kessling , a retired resident of kühlungsborn , the location of the summit 's media center and a staging post for many journalists and delegates .
" there seems to be more people here than usual but no more than in a busy month during the summer . "
sabina meller , an assistant in a local bakery in the seaside resort of heiligendamm , where the summit is being held , expected more of an impact .
" there have been a few more strangers around , more young people , but the streets are just as quiet as ever , " she said .
" anyway , the kempinski hotel is quite a way from the town center .
when the protestors come , they 'll probably miss us completely .
i do n't expect the same thing to happen here as in rostock … maybe at the fence but not here . "
protest town to feel the full effects of the g8 , one has to travel to rostock .
the residents of the ancient hanseatic city have already felt the impact of the protestors after a weekend of mass demonstrations laced with violence and chaos .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business has been slow in the rostock area the past few days jana beger stands in the doorway of her newsagent 's shop and watches with a concerned look as a group of colorful and boisterous protestors march past on their way to the main train station .
jana has lived every one of her 62 years in rostock and says that she has never witnessed anything to compare to the events of the weekend when thousands took to the streets and a minority fought the police .
" these ones do n't look so bad , " she says , her eyes narrowing behind thick glasses as she scans each passing face .
" it 's the ones in black you have to watch out for . "
her son christian stands protectively beside her .
while there have been no reports yet of willful damage to shops , the cobbled streets of the city have already been violated and some businesses have already boarded up their windows just to be sure .
christian guards his mother and the shop 's large glass façade just in case .
" i went for my usual run early on sunday morning and the city maintenance crews were still replacing the stones , " he says , in reference to the cobbles prized from the road to be used in saturday 's violence .
" when there are people like that out there , who will go to such lengths , you ca n't help to be on your guard , even if you are n't their principle target . "
staying home others are not concerned about the violent " black block " extremists laying the city to waste .
many shops were open over the weekend even though there was a marked reduction in the number of customers , perhaps a reflection of residents ' unwillingness to put themselves at potential risk .
rostock 's lively hub , the kröpeliner-tor-vorstadt -lrb- ktv -rrb- area of the city , was like a ghost town on sunday with bar and café staff twiddling their thumbs .
some even took the decision to close on monday , much to the satisfaction of those who were open for business .
" it was dead around here at the weekend , " says timo kastnic , a bar worker in the ktv .
" i 'd never seen it like that … ever .
but we still opened up monday and because the others were shut , we did a lot of business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : missing cobblestones were one side-effect of the nearby demonstrations drinkers and those wanting to eat out were not the only rostock residents safely behind closed doors at home .
according to the local ostsee zeitung newspaper , a number of parents are keeping their children at home during the summit .
one high school had a third of its 768 students stay home monday , although many returned on tuesday for classes .
will it spread ?
such disruption can be expected to spread beyond rostock as the summit proper gets underway on wednesday .
one of the seaside sanctuaries , warnemünde , has already had a taste of the slow creep of protests as around 10,000 demonstrators marched through the quaint port resort to the nearby military harbor on tuesday .
as the slow , winding carnival of the anti-militarization demonstration passed through the city , the pavements either side of the crowded street were full of curious bystanders .
a few , as if heeding a silent call of conscience , stepped off the curb and joined the flow , moved by the commitment of those involved or just by the current of the event itself .
" we all live in this world , " said an elderly gentleman who , along with his wife , made a spontaneous decision to protest .
" you ca n't leave it to others to save it , " he added .
" i would never travel to one of these things , i 'm too old for that , but while it 's here in my home town i can make my voice heard . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de 's readers wrote in this week with their opinions on the pros and cons of globalization and their expectations for this week 's g8 summit . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i am from africa , looking at the g8 summit from a tiny window and with an empty stomach .
in a sense , i am saying that we in africa believe strongly that we are not part of the equation .
authorities are busy looting the scarce resources meant for the provision of shelter , water , and education for the masses .
many african leaders maintain bank accounts in the so-called advanced or first world countries .
the g8 countries over-subsidies food items to africa so that african peasant farmers can not break even by tilling the soil .
they also turn africa into a dumping ground for their inferior products and phased-out consumer items .
while africa remains poor , depending on hand-outs to prevent hiv / aids , bird flu , family control , but not much is being done in areas of malaria control , infant mortality , education , and job creation .
g8 or no g8 , africa - and , indeed , black africa - will remain poor . - alhassan jaoji , nigeria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa will stay poor , wrote one reader i am all for globalization bringing the far-flung countries closer to talk to each other about the economy , world debts for poor countries , trade talks , and climate change .
opposition to globalization is not only selfish , but is short-sighted and harmful to maintaining harmony with one another and harmony with the planet earth . - bernard , australia it is my fervent hope that europe will assume a greater leadership role at the g8 meeting rather than falling prey to arguments of and between the us and russia .
may the force be with europe ! - peter peters , thailand a global economy only works if we have global rules .
the agricultural sector is a good example where developed countries pay high subsidies and then they export their goods to underdeveloped ones , who of course can not compete . - heinz schwabe , germany globalization and the g8 have been rendered totally pointless because they do not serve to rein in a madman like george bush .
good grief , if the other seven members of this group of eight ca n't tell that this man does n't play with a full deck , they must be blind in one eye and not see out of the other .
while germany should n't even have invited bush , it even removes demonstrators who recognize a madman when they see one - unlike merkel , blair , and sarkozy . - an mongere , usa germans need to realize that rioting is becoming a national sport in germany , just as football hooliganism is to the british .
germans ' love of practicing politics " en masse " has evolved into an excuse for violence .
when the police are the ones who are getting hurt , this sad imbalance only encourages the more violent elements of society the next time around .
and what difference does it make if some clown hands a policemen a flower , if others with black masks on their face go on a violent rampage ?
even in a violent and somewhat hazardous country like america , neither the public nor the law enforcement community would tolerate this kind of nonsense . - paul falk , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioting has become a national sport in germany , opined a reader criminals who use protests as an excuse to commit violence should be locked up and made to repair the damage they cause .
as a public safety officer , my sympathies go out to all police and firemen who are under attack by the criminal element there .
my heart goes out to all the law-abiding citizens who have their peaceful lives disrupted in this manner . - john langenford , usa i would have never expected such numbers and such violence .
i am for freedom of speech but not for organized violence .
yesterday i saw on the internet how young people prepared for the demonstration .
picking up cobblestones to be thrown at the police is creating chaos , not change ; it backfires and does not help the poor .
service , generosity , respect , are means for a better world .
seeing what happens in organized germany makes me have a little understanding for putin , who forbids some such demonstrations . - elisabeth heptner , usa why are they talking about africa ?
you ca n't solve any problems there .
africa is n't in the g8 .
it should only be about g8 countries .
immigration should be first .
if the g8 encouraged high birth rates we would n't need immigrants .
the g8 creates more problems for itself and then wonders how it can solve them all . - john , usa no one can stop globalization , but we must take care to protect the poor who are suffering more in global competition .
there are good as well as bad effects of globalization .
we must reduce the bad effects and increase the good effects and for that purpose there must be watch dog - wise people who constantly the behavior of multinational corporations in balance . - ramesh raghuvanshi , india the leaders of the g8 will not hear nor do they care to hear from protestors or dissenters of any kind from anywhere . - william sarpas , usa please consider the sentiments of the protestors . - philip lau , singapore we can use taxation as a way to help people who are affected in a negative way .
we could take from energy taxes to retain displaced workers , or fund tax credits to the poor with the increased cost of bio-fuels or other forms of clean energy .
this is being talked about in the us . - lee davis , oregon , usa the major issue is environment . - karuna kanta pal , india the g8 nations must not be scared of nations like india and china and start to cut all power generation supplies from fossil fuel generation .
oil and gas reserves need to be used at a slower rate to sustain what we have left and bio-fuels need to be encouraged by the g8 nations .
and third world agricultural nations need to start growing the sugar cane , olives , canola , corn and harvest timber with the aid money supplied to them and not buy weapons or line their greedy pockets with the money .
if they want aid money they must have an administrator from the g8 nations managing the money being used for the production of renewable energy resources .

but it is the climate that is getting the most heat . german chancellor angela merkel has made climate change and the challenges to combat it a key issue at the group of eight summit she is hosting at the baltic coastal resort of heiligendamm in germany .
observers are saying a substantial outcome is unlikely , however .
and in recent statements , merkel has tried to put the stress on at least getting the g8 countries to agree to keep at least agreeing to keep talks on climate change within a united nations framework .
" in heiligendamm we want to give impetus to the negotiations on global climate protection , " the chancellor said .
" i hope there will be a signal from heiligendamm that the countries represented there clearly recognize their collective responsibility , " she said .
with the world leaders from industrialized nations attending the meeting , some consensus about how to tackle the climate change problem could be possible .
no fixed targets likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has set climate high on the agenda but german press agency dpa reported wednesday morning that the united states and germany had apparently failed to agree on fixed targets in the fight against global warming in talks ahead of the summit .
and us president george w. bush 's chief environment adviser , james connaughton , has said the summit would end without an agreement on fixed targets .
connaughton said each country had to set its own targets .
this was not only washington 's view but also that of , for instance , japan and canada , he said .
it would take more time until all leading industrialized nations could agree on a joint vision .
however , british prime minister tony blair said wednesday he believes he can persuade bush to agree for the first time to a global target for a " substantial cut " in greenhouse gas emissions .
in an interview with the guardian newspaper wednesday , blair said that america was " on the move " in its position on climate change .
last-ditch effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has not endorsed the kyoto protocol to limit emissions chancellor merkel was to hold a pre-summit lunch meeting with bush on wednesday in a bid to find common ground on climate change .
the summit officially begins with a formal dinner later in the evening . last week , the chancellor had welcomed bush 's call for a new strategy on tackling global warming through joint action by the world 's top polluters - including china and india - as a " positive " step .
but merkel has also made clear that she will still press g8 leaders to commit to cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- .
support from other nations germany 's plan for a binding pact has won qualified support from some nations , but bush last week unveiled his own proposals and said a long-term goal for reducing greenhouses gases could be set by the end of 2008 .
merkel wants the g8 to guide other nations towards negotiations due to take place in december to find a successor to the kyoto protocol .
the 1997 kyoto protocol , named after japan 's ancient capital , where it was signed , is the world 's first treaty mandating emission cuts and will expire in 2012 .
on tuesday , the european union - represented by merkel as the current eu president - and japan agreed to take the lead in forging a successor to kyoto . they jointly proposed to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
bildunterschrift : police and protestors clashed before the summit " the eu and japan are committed to take strong leadership towards the development of a fair , flexible , effective and comprehensive un post-2012 framework that ensures the participation of all major emitting countries , " a joint statement said after the tuesday meeting .
developing countries ' role while the eu and japan insisted that developed countries should play a vital role in fighting global warming , they also called for a " fair contribution " by developing countries .
" we have to take action under a un framework so that all members of the international community can participate bindingly , " merkel said after talks with japanese prime minister shinzo abe in berlin tuesday .
merkel has also repeatedly said that talks on climate change must be within a united nations framework .
earlier in the week , merkel made a statment to that effect , together with canadian prime minister stephen harper .
president bush will also meet japan 's prime minister shinzo abe before the summit begins .
russia also in limelight g8 members include germany , france , britain , italy , japan , the united states , canada and russia .
the european commission is also represented at all meetings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive security fence around the summit location chinese president hu jintao and counterparts from five emerging economies - brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa - will participate in the summit , highlighting their growing weight in international affairs .
other non-g8 members at the meeting include the leaders of algeria , egypt , ghana , nigeria and senegal .
another issue likely to take center-stage at the summit is the west 's relations with russia , with russian president vladimir putin attending the meeting .
both chancellor merkel and us president bush are set to hold bilateral talks with putin in a bid to defuse rising east-west tensions .
the leaders are striving to strike a conciliatory tone in relations with russia despite putin 's most recent angry attack against us plans to station elements of an anti-missile defence system in poland and the czech republic . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : climate change : the world 's greatest challenge climate change and global warming have steadily risen to the top of the world 's agenda as reports and predictions have made it clear that time is running out .

according to a recent study , it 's doubtful that membership in the " club " will help the poor in these countries . without the five emerging guest nations , the g8 summit 's motto " growth and responsibility " couldn ’ t be implemented , said german chancellor angela merkel recently .
indeed , all five of them exhibited healthy growth in their gross domestic products in 2006 : china and india topped the group with 10.7 and 9.2 percent respectively , while south africa -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- , brazil -lrb- 4.4 percent -rrb- and mexico -lrb- 3.5 percent -rrb- came in strong .
according to the german office for foreign trade -lrb- bfai -rrb- in cologne , the upward trend is expected to continue in 2007 and 2008 .
economic growth encourages confidence on the international political playing field .
they have already become key players in the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and in climate debates , for example .
their businesses are expanding worldwide and representatives from these emerging nations are already questioning the legitimacy of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
in addition , brazil , india and south africa are aspiring to obtain a permanent seat in the united nations security council .
g20 represents world majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of emerging countries in political bodies wo n't affect poverty , say some experts in the wto , the " big five " belong to the so-called g20 , a group of emerging and developing nations that was founded in cancun , mexico in 2003 and represents two-thirds of the world 's population .
however , in international economic negotiations , the big five sometimes give the impression that they are already playing in a league of their own .
" the economic upturn of china , india , brazil and south africa does n't necessarily lead to a poverty-oriented global economic policy , " concluded a study by the aid organizations bread for the world and südwind institute , which is to be presented wednesday at the alternative summit in rostock .
" economic growth alone does n't help the poorest of the poor . "
the gap between rich and poor is growing even wider , particularly in brazil , mexico , india and south africa .
in the run-up to this year 's summit , there was talk of expanding the g8 - which currently represents only 13 percent of the world population - to the g13 .
however , this could weaken the position of the world 's poor , say experts .
the poor still lose out " the dominance of the wealthy industrialized countries in the world trade organization and the international monetary fund would be reduced , but the interests of poor people in emerging nations and the least-developed nations would still be pushed onto the back burner in the world trade system , " said reinhard koppe , development policy expert at bread for the world .
furthermore , the study reveals how power relationships have shifted over the past few years through the offensive economic policies of four of the largest emerging nations - china , india , brazil and south africa .
" all four states have become world powers in many sectors , not just in their regions but worldwide , " said koppe .
the study 's author friedel hütz-adams said that " established industrialized nations are no longer in a position to assert their own interests without making major compromises - both in the wto and in bilateral and regional treaties . "
strategies on the political front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 represents two thirds of the world 's population according to the study , brazil 's discourse within the wto focuses on close cooperation with the g20 countries and the nama 11 group -lrb- argentina , brazil , egypt , india , indonesia , namibia , philippines , south africa , tunisia and venezuela -rrb- , while making deals of its own behind the scenes . " the government in brazil is getting involved in the non-transparent structures of the wto by agreeing , together with india , to talks with the us , the eu and japan , " said the study .
china , which like brazil has only signed a handful of bilateral open-trade treaties , continues to focus on the wto negotiations and is prepared to support the positions of other emerging and developing countries .
conflict of interest is standing in the way , however , said hütz-adams .
in addition , china 's engagement in africa is now being seen as a threat by governments and companies from industrialized countries , added the author .
india sees itself as a spokesperson for developing countries on the international playing field , which could soon change .
hütz-adams sees the willingness of the indian government to join brazil in informal trade talks with the us , the eu and japan as a warning sign .
" no on knows whether india will stay connected with the goals of the g20 and g33 in the world trade organization negotiations , " he said .
the country has increasingly been distinguishing itself as an economic power and seems to be going its own way .
mexico continues to be an emerging country but , at the same time , is a member of oecd .
of the five " guest " nations at the g8 summit , its economy has opened up the most since the 1990s .
it maintains 13 free trade agreements with 42 other countries , including one with nafta since 1994 and with the eu since 2000 .
last year , the mexican government reduced customs duties on merchandise with 148 wto member states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment has been a sticky issue with some major emerging nations like china after mexico joined nafta , cheap corn from the us flooded the mexican market and led to protests by farmers .
since mexico had increased the use of corn in ethanol production , it became scarce .
" that 's why there were tortilla rebellions and the country was noncommittal during the wto agricultural negotiations , " said hütz-adams .
what 's more , economic expansion in china and india is putting competitive pressure on mexico and brazil .
more influence for smaller countries the study named other differences between the major emerging countries as well .
brazil and south africa support a fundamental voting reform in the international monetary fund and the world bank that would give small countries more say .
india and china , on the other hand , want to enhance their own positions in both institutions .
it remains to be seen whether india and china will agree to the united states ' new climate initiative .
" that would require a parallel structure to the un where the small states would n't have any say anymore , " said hütz-adams .

as if to emphasize that whatever had gone before had just been a dry run for the main event , the police made their own statement to that effect .
the day started with what could only be described as widespread lockdown of infrastructure and ended with a heavy-handed clampdown on the opposition .
the arrival of the g8 heads had been a red letter day in the protestors ' diary from the very beginning .
even though their main target , us president george bush , had attempted to avoid the predicted mass picketing of laage airport by arriving a day earlier , there were still seven other leaders to vent anger against .
for the past few days , the issues had been the motivation to protest .
now the people responsible for those issues were coming and a predicted 8,000 to 10,000 demonstrators were ready to give them a welcome they would never forget .
police outnumber protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators on their way to the airport the police had other plans .
from the early morning , it was evident that the " two police officers for every protestor " rumor was no longer in dispute .
the massed ranks of heavily armored officers stationed on roads , bridges and railway tracks were sending out a visible message : you shall not pass .
the 16,000 regular police and 2,000 special officers drafted in for the summit were being used to full effect .
with the first arrival due to land at laage at 10 a.m. , hundreds of protestors streamed out of the rostock fischereihafen camp towards their own private vehicles and the specially organized buses waiting to take them the few kilometers to the airport while the morning was still in its infancy .
some of them did n't even make it out of the camp car park .
preventing protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police made it clear that demonstrators would not get past them the first full bus was ready to depart when it was surrounded by police wagons .
officers ordered the passengers out of the bus and the vehicle was slowly searched while bags and pockets were emptied on demand .
another bus arrived and was immediately impounded , its human cargo forced to get comfortable on the grass verge .
for how long , it is hard to say .
many never made it out of rostock .
there were alternative routes , however .
but security had not been the only reason why laage had been chosen as the arrival point .
it is horrendously difficult to get to by public transport and even more so when the roads and train tracks are closed down .
buses carrying protestors were stopped kilometers from the airport , unloaded and the passengers allowed to continue to a specified containment point away from laage on foot .
and these were the lucky ones .
mysteriously coincidental train malfunctions paralyzed the rail system just after rush hour leaving many protestors stranded and angry .
this would later contribute to frustration and violence .
few get through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers redirected protestors those who had set out just in time to avoid the main lockdown of the transport system around laage were met at the containment points by rows of riot police .
the plan had been to picket the airport at four main sites around its perimeter .
with numbers expected in the region of 8,000 demonstrators , it had been planned that around 2,000 would go to each .
the road blocks and train cancellations had contributed to a massive decimation of those numbers .
the few hundred which had gathered at the mouth of the airport 's service road milled around in front of the police , some muttering nervously about the prevalence of unit 23 , the hardest and most uncompromising officers bandied together from various forces to create an elite division .
various attempts to begin the demonstration were stopped by senior police officers .
there would be protests allowed , but only 50 people at a time would be let through the cordons to demonstrate at the airport 's gates .
from an expected crowd of 2,000 , as few as 37 protestors eventually made it to the gate .
once there , over 70 police officers blocked the entrance and forced the small group of protestors onto a grass verge opposite and held them there for an hour .
deflated demonstrators meanwhile , reports were phoned in to the group leader from an associate at bad doberan about a major incident involving over a thousand protestors who had been denied the chance to travel to laage and a large contingent of riot police .
according to the source in bad doberan , clashes had escalated quickly and tear gas and water cannons were being used to quell the unrest .
there was even an unsubstantiated report that a badly injured protestor had been denied medical assistance by police officers .
the mood of those at laage was already deflated before hearing this .
the planned blockade and show of strength had been turned into a pathetic joke by a well-coordinated and ruthless police operation .
by denying access to thousands and controlling to the footstep the movements of those which did make it to the boundaries of the airport , the police effectively removed all opposition at the point of entry for the g8 leaders .
and in bad doberan , they showed that they had learned the mistakes of the weekend where sheer numbers could not make up for the lack of preparation in dealing with a rioting mob .
on wednesday , the police struck hard and fast to end the unrest .
they more than made up for their shortcomings on previous unruly days .
on wednesday , they could claim a victory .

the warning comes ahead of a conference organised by amnesty , where victims of repression will outline their plights .
the " virus of internet repression " has spread from a handful of countries to dozens of governments , said the group .
amnesty accused companies such as google , microsoft and yahoo of being complicit in the problem .
website closures when challenged on their presence in countries such as china in the past , the companies accused have always maintained that they were simply abiding by local laws .
amnesty is concerned that censorship is on the increase .
" the chinese model of an internet that allows economic growth but not free speech or privacy is growing in popularity , from a handful of countries five years ago to dozens of governments today who block sites and arrest bloggers , " said tim hancock , amnesty 's campaign director .

egyptian blogger filtering was only one aspect of internet repression , the group said .
it added that increasingly it was seeing " politically motivated " closures of websites and net cafes , as well as threats and imprisonments .
twenty-two-year-old egyptian blogger abdul kareem nabeel suleiman was imprisoned for four years in february for insulting islam and defaming the president of egypt .

the two-year project will be run in 484 primary and secondary schools to trial new ways of assessing pupils ' progress .
the scheme also aims to stimulate the undemanding , " invisible " child who may escape the teacher 's attention .
the pilot involves a range of schools , including single-sex and mixed schools , middle schools , grammars and academies .
under the scheme , thousands of children who are making slow progress will receive short " bursts " of 10 hours of extra one-to-one tuition in english and / or maths .
the government estimates 21,500 pupils will receive tuition in english and 21,500 will get extra help with maths .
schools will have specific targets to help more children to move up two ability levels within a key stage .
' tracking by teachers ' education secretary alan johnson said : " i want to make sure that no child falls behind or gets stuck at any stage and i am backing teachers up with extra resources to test out these new approaches .
parents need to understand how their child is progressing education secretary alan johnson " we think that good tracking by teachers , confirmed by shorter , more frequent tests , will help schools to personalise each child 's learning .
" this will motivate all pupils to move on and up by recognising what they have achieved and showing them where they have to go next - just as a child who passes their grade one on the recorder feels excited to move on to playing harder tunes . "
mr johnson said teachers ' day-to-day judgements about the children in their classes should be better interwoven with externally marked and set tests .
and he said teachers and schools deserved more credit when they had helped a child to improve .
" parents need to understand how their child is progressing , " he said .
" i want a system which gives timely information to parents , demonstrates simply whether a child is making good enough progress at every stage of their education , and which motivates children to achieve more in every lesson . "
' great progress ' the scheme was announced as the department for education and skills published a report called making great progress , which outlines how 20 schools in england are making " excellent progress " with pupils between the ages of seven and 11 years .
the report says regular tracking of children 's progress is one of the most effective ways primary schools can help pupils achieve the best they can .
the study of the 20 schools found strong , enthusiastic leaders created a culture where learning was valued and " boffins " were not bullied .
and it found teachers in these schools assumed every child - whatever their background , race or gender - had the ability to succeed .
schools minister jim knight said : " today 's report shows that good schools which make excellent progress have a culture which celebrates learning ; they expect success from every child , whatever their background .
" the attitudes and experience of teachers and heads are just as important as the tools they use to help children achieve .
" they carefully identify children who show early promise , who have untapped potential , or who are in danger of stalling or slowing down . "

under the scheme , thousands of children who are making slow progress will receive short " bursts " of 10 hours of extra one-to-one tuition in english and / or maths .
the government estimates 21,500 pupils will receive tuition in english and 21,500 will get extra help with maths .
schools will have specific targets to help more children to move up two ability levels within a key stage .
' tracking by teachers ' education secretary alan johnson said : " i want to make sure that no child falls behind or gets stuck at any stage and i am backing teachers up with extra resources to test out these new approaches .
parents need to understand how their child is progressing education secretary alan johnson " we think that good tracking by teachers , confirmed by shorter , more frequent tests , will help schools to personalise each child 's learning .
" this will motivate all pupils to move on and up by recognising what they have achieved and showing them where they have to go next - just as a child who passes their grade one on the recorder feels excited to move on to playing harder tunes . "
mr johnson said teachers ' day-to-day judgements about the children in their classes should be better interwoven with externally marked and set tests .
and he said teachers and schools deserved more credit when they had helped a child to improve .
" parents need to understand how their child is progressing , " he said .
" i want a system which gives timely information to parents , demonstrates simply whether a child is making good enough progress at every stage of their education , and which motivates children to achieve more in every lesson . "
' great progress ' the scheme was announced as the department for education and skills published a report called making great progress , which outlines how 20 schools in england are making " excellent progress " with pupils between the ages of seven and 11 years .
the report says regular tracking of children 's progress is one of the most effective ways primary schools can help pupils achieve the best they can .
the study of the 20 schools found strong , enthusiastic leaders created a culture where learning was valued and " boffins " were not bullied .
and it found teachers in these schools assumed every child - whatever their background , race or gender - had the ability to succeed .
schools minister jim knight said : " today 's report shows that good schools which make excellent progress have a culture which celebrates learning ; they expect success from every child , whatever their background .
" the attitudes and experience of teachers and heads are just as important as the tools they use to help children achieve .
" they carefully identify children who show early promise , who have untapped potential , or who are in danger of stalling or slowing down . "

prince william and prince harry 's private secretary wrote to the channel saying they felt it would be a " gross disrespect " to their mother 's memory .
but channel 4 said it will run the images in wednesday 's programme after considering the princes ' concerns against wider public interest .
the pictures by french photographers are of the august 1997 crash in paris .
diana , 36 , dodi al fayed , 42 , and driver henri paul were killed when their mercedes crashed in the pont de l 'alma tunnel in paris as they drove away from paparazzi after leaving the ritz hotel .
' public interest ' the letter from the princes ' private secretary , jamie lowther-pinkerton , was sent to hamish mykura , head of history , science and religion at channel 4 , last friday .
mr lowther-pinkerton wrote : " if it were your or my mother dying in that tunnel , would we want the scene broadcast to the nation ?
indeed , would the nation so want it ? "
in particular , the letter asked channel 4 to remove several images of the crashed car with diana still inside and of a medic treating her which appear in the documentary called diana : the witnesses in the tunnel .
what we do n't do is cross the line of showing the dead or the injured hamish mykura channel 4 princes ' letter : full text c4 response to princes " these photographs , regardless of the fact that they do not actually show the princess 's features , are redolent with the atmosphere and tragedy of the closing moments of her life , " mr lowther-pinkerton added .
the bbc 's royal correspondent , nicholas witchell , said he believed the letter was instigated by prince william .
he said the second-in-line to the throne was taking a stand and making sure his and harry 's objections were known .
in an interview with the bbc on tuesday , mr lowther-pinkerton said it did not take " any imagination " to realise why prince william and prince harry would be offended by the programme .
conservative leader david cameron said the broadcaster needed to ask itself : " are we making this programme because there 's a genuine public interest , or are we just being prurient ? "
' ill-informed hysteria ' he added : " if the latter answer is the case , they should n't do it . "
lib dem shadow culture , media and sport secretary don foster backed channel 4 .
" channel 4 is right to refuse the princes ' request to change the programme , " he said .
have your say her family should not have to live this painful memory over and over .
i most certainly will not be watching .
a sullivan , woodbridge send us your comments " while any programme about diana 's death will cause distress to some members of the royal family , there is a legitimate public interest in the event , especially from a programme which provides new insights . "
lord st john of fawsley , who was a friend of the princess , has demanded an inquiry into the screening of the images .
' distress not intended ' he said : " this is worse than tabloid journalism , because everybody knows when they pick up a tabloid what to expect .
" but when you see a serious programme meant to be dedicated to the arts and intellectual matters and history , really going down into the gutter in this way , this is something which must be condemned . "
head of channel 4 julian bellamy said it had not intended to cause william and harry distress and did not believe its decision was disrespectful to the memory of the princess .
they believe the broadcast of these photographs to be wholly inappropriate clarence house , on behalf of the princes " we have weighed the princes ' concerns against the legitimate public interest we believe there is in the subject of this documentary and in the still photography it includes , " he said .
he added that photos and interviews provided the " most detailed and credible eyewitness account yet delivered " of the crash .
kevin lygo , the director of television and content at channel 4 , said in a letter to mr lowther-pinkerton that many of the photographs had already appeared in the british media , including in a bbc panorama documentary .
and channel 4 's hamish mykura , who commissioned the programme , said the film was not disrespectful to the memory of the princess .
" what we do n't do is cross the line of showing the dead or the injured , " he said .
clarence house said william and harry felt they had no choice but to make their feelings public .
media watchdog ofcom has received 17 complaints about the documentary since the controversy erupted just over a week ago .
but the regulator can only investigate a programme after it is aired .
if complaints are received , the programme could be challenged on whether it broke rules on harm and offence to the viewer .

prince william and prince harry 's private secretary wrote to the channel saying they felt it would be a " gross disrespect " to their mother 's memory .
but channel 4 said it will run the images in wednesday 's programme after considering the princes ' concerns against wider public interest .
the pictures by french photographers are of the august 1997 crash in paris .
diana , 36 , dodi al fayed , 42 , and driver henri paul were killed when their mercedes crashed in the pont de l 'alma tunnel in paris as they drove away from paparazzi after leaving the ritz hotel .
' public interest ' the letter from the princes ' private secretary , jamie lowther-pinkerton , was sent to hamish mykura , head of history , science and religion at channel 4 , last friday .
mr lowther-pinkerton wrote : " if it were your or my mother dying in that tunnel , would we want the scene broadcast to the nation ?
indeed , would the nation so want it ? "
in particular , the letter asked channel 4 to remove several images of the crashed car with diana still inside and of a medic treating her which appear in the documentary called diana : the witnesses in the tunnel .
what we do n't do is cross the line of showing the dead or the injured hamish mykura channel 4 princes ' letter : full text c4 response to princes " these photographs , regardless of the fact that they do not actually show the princess 's features , are redolent with the atmosphere and tragedy of the closing moments of her life , " mr lowther-pinkerton added .
the bbc 's royal correspondent , nicholas witchell , said he believed the letter was instigated by prince william .
he said the second-in-line to the throne was taking a stand and making sure his and harry 's objections were known .
in an interview with the bbc on tuesday , mr lowther-pinkerton said it did not take " any imagination " to realise why prince william and prince harry would be offended by the programme .
conservative leader david cameron said the broadcaster needed to ask itself : " are we making this programme because there 's a genuine public interest , or are we just being prurient ? "
' ill-informed hysteria ' he added : " if the latter answer is the case , they should n't do it . "
lib dem shadow culture , media and sport secretary don foster backed channel 4 .

lord st john of fawsley , who was a friend of the princess , has demanded an inquiry into the screening of the images .
' distress not intended ' he said : " this is worse than tabloid journalism , because everybody knows when they pick up a tabloid what to expect .
" but when you see a serious programme meant to be dedicated to the arts and intellectual matters and history , really going down into the gutter in this way , this is something which must be condemned . "
head of channel 4 julian bellamy said it had not intended to cause william and harry distress and did not believe its decision was disrespectful to the memory of the princess .
they believe the broadcast of these photographs to be wholly inappropriate clarence house , on behalf of the princes " we have weighed the princes ' concerns against the legitimate public interest we believe there is in the subject of this documentary and in the still photography it includes , " he said .
he added that photos and interviews provided the " most detailed and credible eyewitness account yet delivered " of the crash .
kevin lygo , the director of television and content at channel 4 , said in a letter to mr lowther-pinkerton that many of the photographs had already appeared in the british media , including in a bbc panorama documentary .
and channel 4 's hamish mykura , who commissioned the programme , said the film was not disrespectful to the memory of the princess .
" what we do n't do is cross the line of showing the dead or the injured , " he said .
clarence house said william and harry felt they had no choice but to make their feelings public .

the pictures by french photographers are of the august 1997 crash in paris .
diana , 36 , dodi al fayed , 42 , and driver henri paul were killed when their mercedes crashed in the pont de l 'alma tunnel in paris as they drove away from paparazzi after leaving the ritz hotel .

mr lowther-pinkerton wrote : " if it were your or my mother dying in that tunnel , would we want the scene broadcast to the nation ?
indeed , would the nation so want it ? "

prince william and prince harry 's private secretary wrote to the channel saying they felt it would be a " gross disrespect " to their mother 's memory .
but channel 4 said it will run the images in wednesday 's programme after considering the princes ' concerns against wider public interest .
the pictures by french photographers are of the august 1997 crash in paris .
diana , 36 , dodi al fayed , 42 , and driver henri paul were killed when their mercedes crashed in the pont de l 'alma tunnel in paris as they drove away from paparazzi after leaving the ritz hotel .
' public interest ' the letter from the princes ' private secretary , jamie lowther-pinkerton , was sent to hamish mykura , head of history , science and religion at channel 4 , last friday .
mr lowther-pinkerton wrote : " if it were your or my mother dying in that tunnel , would we want the scene broadcast to the nation ?
indeed , would the nation so want it ? "
in particular , the letter asked channel 4 to remove several images of the crashed car with diana still inside and of a medic treating her which appear in the documentary called diana : the witnesses in the tunnel . "
what we do n't do is cross the line of showing the dead or the injured " hamish mykura channel 4 princes ' letter : full text c4 response to princes " these photographs , regardless of the fact that they do not actually show the princess 's features , are redolent with the atmosphere and tragedy of the closing moments of her life , " mr lowther-pinkerton added .
the bbc 's royal correspondent , nicholas witchell , said he believed the letter was instigated by prince william .
he said the second-in-line to the throne was taking a stand and making sure his and harry 's objections were known .
in an interview with the bbc on tuesday , mr lowther-pinkerton said it did not take " any imagination " to realise why prince william and prince harry would be offended by the programme .
conservative leader david cameron said the broadcaster needed to ask itself : " are we making this programme because there 's a genuine public interest , or are we just being prurient ? "
' ill-informed hysteria ' he added : " if the latter answer is the case , they should n't do it . "
lib dem shadow culture , media and sport secretary don foster backed channel 4 .
" channel 4 is right to refuse the princes ' request to change the programme , " he said .
have your say " her family should not have to live this painful memory over and over .
i most certainly will not be watching . "
a sullivan , woodbridge send us your comments " while any programme about diana 's death will cause distress to some members of the royal family , there is a legitimate public interest in the event , especially from a programme which provides new insights . "
lord st john of fawsley , who was a friend of the princess , has demanded an inquiry into the screening of the images .
' distress not intended ' he said : " this is worse than tabloid journalism , because everybody knows when they pick up a tabloid what to expect .
" but when you see a serious programme meant to be dedicated to the arts and intellectual matters and history , really going down into the gutter in this way , this is something which must be condemned . "
head of channel 4 julian bellamy said it had not intended to cause william and harry distress and did not believe its decision was disrespectful to the memory of the princess . "
they believe the broadcast of these photographs to be wholly inappropriate " clarence house , on behalf of the princes " we have weighed the princes ' concerns against the legitimate public interest we believe there is in the subject of this documentary and in the still photography it includes , " he said .

it was only 18 months ago that north tees and hartlepool nhs trust was forecasting a deficit that was fast approaching £ 20m .
with a budget of £ 200m to run to hospitals in hartlepool and stockton plus a community centre in nearby peterlee , the forecasts seemed pretty dire .

within months , it became one of scores of nhs trust to be brought under government monitoring through a turnaround director .
after a spate of cuts , the trust , which covers a local population of 400,000 in the north east , has emerged from the 2006-7 financial year with a £ 3m surplus .
the measures taken by managers are typical of those forced on many parts of a health service that has been under immense pressure from ministers to break even .

there have even been allegations from the royal college of nursing that the trust was paying staff below the minimum wage , although officials maintained these were newly trained nurses who were on work experience .
alan foster , the trust 's director of finance , said : " i would not say it has been pain-free .
but we have managed to push through the programme without affecting patient care .
" we are still meeting all our targets and have become more efficient at the same time .
" we were overstaffed .

" there are also better services in the community and this meant we had to reduce our workforce . "

with a budget of £ 200m to run to hospitals in hartlepool and stockton plus a community centre in nearby peterlee , the forecasts seemed pretty dire .
the situation began to be addressed in earnest in the autumn of 2005 when a new chief executive , ian dalton , was brought in .

opec secretary general abdalla el-badri said moves to use biofuels would make his members consider cutting investment in new oil production , the ft said .
president bush says the us will cut petrol use by 20 % in 10 years , partly through increased use of biofuels .
opec members control about 40 % of the world 's oil production .
mr el-badri said that while opec members had so far maintained their investment plans , he added : " if we are unable to see a security of demand ... we may revisit investment in the long term . "
the warning comes as leaders of the g8 industrialised nations gather for their summit in germany .
environmental issues are high on the agenda and the use of biofuels is central to the attempts of many g8 countries to cut their carbon emissions .
biofuels can be anything made with vegetable matter that burns .
they can be used to replace some or all of the petrol used in vehicles .

samia , palestinian , east jerusalem moshe , israeli , jerusalem rahaf , syrian , damascus fathi , palestinian , jenin , west bank george , israeli / canadian , vancouver adnan , jordanian , jordan ronnie , former iraqi jew , now uk citizen nashed , egyptian / canadian , canada josephine , british / israeli , london samia khoury , 73 , palestinian , east jerusalem we were living in beit hanina , a suburb north of jerusalem .
there was a jordanian military camp right behind our house .
the israeli planes raiding the area did n't realise that the jordanian camp had been evacuated before the war had even begun .
one of the bombs fell directly on the strawberry bed in our garden , breaking our living room window .
it was not really a six-day war .
it was a 24-hour walk-through with minimal resistance .
almost overnight the whole population was facing a new reality .
we were under a military occupation , and to add insult to injury we had to put up a white piece of cloth as a sign of surrender .
we just stood helpless , not realising what we were up against .
in fact our anger was focused on the arab armies who lost the war on three fronts , and on jordan specifically for abandoning the area before the fighting had started .
click to return moshe , 67 , israeli , jerusalem at about 10am we heard a rumour that the egyptian air force had been destroyed .
to be at the wailing wall ; it was a dream for us !
i was doing my military service , working as a technician for the air force .
of course i knew the reservists were already called up ; but i did n't have the feeling war was imminent .
no-one believed it would be so easy .
suddenly we had a big israel with all the sites of the bible .
on the sixth day of war we said " let 's go the wailing wall " .
i had n't been there before , not to east jerusalem .
before 1967 , there was a viewpoint from which you could see the wailing wall ; i remember my father pointing it out to me as a child .
you must understand , this was only 22 years after the holocaust .
remembering my family members who were killed ... and then to be at the wall ; it was a dream for us !
the history of 2,000 years was coming back !
after the war , there was enormous prosperity in israel ; people started to invest in the country .
jews came from all over the world .
click to return rahaf , 68 , syrian , damascus i remember it being quite a hot summer .
i was 28 years old and alone with my four children in quneitra , as my husband was quite close to the front .
he was a member of the military police .
during the build-up , the media was very one-sided and patriotic .
it was all about defeating israel and gaining a victory for the arab street , something that was very much needed .
you must understand , at the time damascus was inundated with palestinian refugees ; their suffering was very evident and there was an animosity towards israel that permeated through society ; it still does .
there were a lot of rumours and the only way to determine how close the israeli army actually was , was by word of mouth .
i was anxious and felt quite isolated ; i could see my neighbours slowly closing up and leaving for damascus .
my husband finally called me and told me to do the same , which i did .
he followed about a week later .
i remember people thinking that syria had fallen and soon the israeli army would enter the gates of damascus .
the media was very subdued and did not elaborate on our defeat .
the nation went from a state of euphoria , to utter despondency .
it was the ultimate anti-climax , and i could see it etched clearly on my husband 's face when he returned .
he never spoke much of what he saw , as it would bring tears to his eyes , and he hated me seeing him cry .
click to return fathi salameh , 47 , palestinian , jenin , west bank jenin was under the protection of jordanian and iraqi troops at the time .
there were just 30 or 40 kilometres between us and israeli territory .
i was seven years old and i remember it all well .
when they started to bomb us we hid in caves in the village .
my family have horrible stories about what israel did to our people in 1948 .
so , we spent two or three nights in the caves without electricity or water .
it 's a myth that it was a six day war ; everything was finished in just 48 hours .
we were at the top of the mountain watching the iraqis and jordanians escape from the area .
there was no unified command ; they gave up the land very easily .
there were individual heroes who tried to resist .
we watched one lone iraqi tank stay on the hill and fire on the approaching israeli tanks .
he kept on firing and holding them back until an israeli war plane flew in and bombed him .
the jordanians did n't have the strength or weapons that the israelis had and they did n't want to commit suicide .
so , they went home to their families .
after we left the caves we went home too .
everyone in the village put white flags on their houses .
i 'm now 47 and i 've spent 40 years of my life under occupation .
click to return george muenz , 52 , canadian / israeli , vancouver i was 12 years old in 1967 , living in montreal .
as the son of an auschwitz survivor , this was initially a traumatic time for me and jews in general .
i first heard about the war when i came into the kitchen for breakfast and my foster mother was crying .
i did not really understand war , but i sensed that we were in great danger .
i remember watching tv and seeing mobs in cairo screaming " itabch al yahud " - " slaughter the jews " and there was real fear that we were facing another holocaust .
the subsequent israeli victory was a huge watershed in our lives , and in 1974 i moved to israel and joined the israeli army .
click to return adnan awamlah , 58 , jordanian , jordan -lrb- from bbcarabic.com -rrb- i was a student when the war broke out .
we were expecting certain victory over israel .
however , i woke up out of a series of dreams to a surprising and horrific reality .
these dreams were fuelled by the arab leaders of the time and by the official media .
they included a romantic desire to return palestinian lands occupied by israel ; and another one of forming an unbeatable joint arab army .
if there is one main consequence of the war , it could be that i lost confidence in arab leaders .
i still remember king hussein of jordan promising arab armies would " eat up israelis with their hands and teeth " - words that later proved no more than rhetoric after israel destroyed three arab armies in a few hours .
i also ca n't forget my friends and relatives breaking down in tears after the defeat .
with all pre-war talk about certain victory , we just did n't expect to lose .
click to return ronnie dallal , 54 , formerly iraqi jew , now british citizen by 1967 there were only about 2,500 jews left in iraq .
we kept ourselves to ourselves and were generally left alone ; but things changed dramatically after the war .
i was 14 and went to the jewish school where we tried to maintain a semblance of normal life despite the many restrictions imposed on us as jews .
on the day it started , all i was aware of was parents coming to pick their children up .
i could n't understand what was happening .
the mother of a friend told me war had started .
for the first few days of the war no-one knew what was happening .
when the truth came out , we started being persecuted .
after this , jews were not allowed to have ' phones , my brother could n't go to university .
in 1969 nine jews were publicly hanged in iraq for spying for israel .
we had our own id to show we were jewish .
guess what colour the card was : yellow .
i was 18 when i left ; i was smuggled into iran .
i think the jewish community in iraq has dwindled to about 10 .
click to return nashed rashed , 53 , egyptian / canadian , canada i was 13 years old at the time , living in cairo .
after 40 years the events are still fresh in my mind .
we used to live near a railway line connecting cairo to suez .
before the war you could see the heavy equipment being taken by rail from cairo to sinai , through suez .
you could see the faces of the soldiers ; they were singing and chanting as if they were going on a picnic .
after the war , the trains used to sneak back after midnight , carrying the wounded , the dead and the destroyed artillery .
it was such a shock to me and everyone else , but at the time we knew very little ; neither when nor how the war ended , because all information was controlled by the nasser regime .
more and more memories come to my mind , but they are all sad .
we felt destroyed as a nation .
click to return josephine bacon , 65 , british / israeli , london for the first three days of the war we were told nothing by israeli radio , we did not know if we were winning or losing .
i was living in jerusalem with my husband , a reservist in the air force , and my baby daughter .
we lived opposite the head of news at kol israel , israeli radio , who was a friend of ours , but he would not tell us what was happening .
on the third day , people who had stayed at home started to venture out , as we realised the shelling had stopped .
when i went to buy groceries i saw a crowd of people had gathered .
when i got closer , i saw they were crowding around a jeep with an israeli soldier in it - but could see immediately from the camouflage that it was not an israeli jeep !
sure enough , there were the arabic numerals on the number plate .
that was the first time i knew we had won .

after the war , the trains used to sneak back after midnight , carrying the wounded , the dead and the destroyed artillery .
it was such a shock to me and everyone else , but at the time we knew very little ; neither when nor how the war ended , because all information was controlled by the nasser regime .

there was a jordanian military camp right behind our house .
the israeli planes raiding the area did n't realise that the jordanian camp had been evacuated before the war had even begun .
one of the bombs fell directly on the strawberry bed in our garden , breaking our living room window .
it was not really a six-day war .
it was a 24-hour walk-through with minimal resistance .
almost overnight the whole population was facing a new reality .
we were under a military occupation , and to add insult to injury we had to put up a white piece of cloth as a sign of surrender .
we just stood helpless , not realising what we were up against .
in fact our anger was focused on the arab armies who lost the war on three fronts , and on jordan specifically for abandoning the area before the fighting had started .
click to return moshe , 67 , israeli , jerusalem at about 10am we heard a rumour that the egyptian air force had been destroyed .
to be at the wailing wall ; it was a dream for us !
i was doing my military service , working as a technician for the air force .
of course i knew the reservists were already called up ; but i did n't have the feeling war was imminent .
no-one believed it would be so easy .
suddenly we had a big israel with all the sites of the bible .
on the sixth day of war we said " let 's go the wailing wall " .
i had n't been there before , not to east jerusalem .
before 1967 , there was a viewpoint from which you could see the wailing wall ; i remember my father pointing it out to me as a child .
you must understand , this was only 22 years after the holocaust .
remembering my family members who were killed ... and then to be at the wall ; it was a dream for us !
the history of 2,000 years was coming back !
after the war , there was enormous prosperity in israel ; people started to invest in the country .
jews came from all over the world .
click to return rahaf , 68 , syrian , damascus i remember it being quite a hot summer .
i was 28 years old and alone with my four children in quneitra , as my husband was quite close to the front .
he was a member of the military police .
during the build-up , the media was very one-sided and patriotic .
it was all about defeating israel and gaining a victory for the arab street , something that was very much needed .
you must understand , at the time damascus was inundated with palestinian refugees ; their suffering was very evident and there was an animosity towards israel that permeated through society ; it still does .
there were a lot of rumours and the only way to determine how close the israeli army actually was , was by word of mouth .
i was anxious and felt quite isolated ; i could see my neighbours slowly closing up and leaving for damascus .
my husband finally called me and told me to do the same , which i did .
he followed about a week later .
i remember people thinking that syria had fallen and soon the israeli army would enter the gates of damascus .
the media was very subdued and did not elaborate on our defeat .
the nation went from a state of euphoria , to utter despondency .
it was the ultimate anti-climax , and i could see it etched clearly on my husband 's face when he returned .
he never spoke much of what he saw , as it would bring tears to his eyes , and he hated me seeing him cry .
click to return fathi salameh , 47 , palestinian , jenin , west bank jenin was under the protection of jordanian and iraqi troops at the time .
there were just 30 or 40 kilometres between us and israeli territory .
i was seven years old and i remember it all well .
when they started to bomb us we hid in caves in the village .
my family have horrible stories about what israel did to our people in 1948 .
so , we spent two or three nights in the caves without electricity or water .
it 's a myth that it was a six day war ; everything was finished in just 48 hours .
we were at the top of the mountain watching the iraqis and jordanians escape from the area .
there was no unified command ; they gave up the land very easily .
there were individual heroes who tried to resist .
we watched one lone iraqi tank stay on the hill and fire on the approaching israeli tanks .
he kept on firing and holding them back until an israeli war plane flew in and bombed him .
the jordanians did n't have the strength or weapons that the israelis had and they did n't want to commit suicide .
so , they went home to their families .
after we left the caves we went home too .
everyone in the village put white flags on their houses .

as the son of an auschwitz survivor , this was initially a traumatic time for me and jews in general .
i first heard about the war when i came into the kitchen for breakfast and my foster mother was crying .
i did not really understand war , but i sensed that we were in great danger .
i remember watching tv and seeing mobs in cairo screaming " itabch al yahud " - " slaughter the jews " and there was real fear that we were facing another holocaust .
the subsequent israeli victory was a huge watershed in our lives , and in 1974 i moved to israel and joined the israeli army .
click to return adnan awamlah , 58 , jordanian , jordan -lrb- from bbcarabic.com -rrb- i was a student when the war broke out .
we were expecting certain victory over israel .
however , i woke up out of a series of dreams to a surprising and horrific reality .
these dreams were fuelled by the arab leaders of the time and by the official media .
they included a romantic desire to return palestinian lands occupied by israel ; and another one of forming an unbeatable joint arab army .
if there is one main consequence of the war , it could be that i lost confidence in arab leaders .
i still remember king hussein of jordan promising arab armies would " eat up israelis with their hands and teeth " - words that later proved no more than rhetoric after israel destroyed three arab armies in a few hours .
i also ca n't forget my friends and relatives breaking down in tears after the defeat .
with all pre-war talk about certain victory , we just did n't expect to lose .
click to return ronnie dallal , 54 , formerly iraqi jew , now british citizen by 1967 there were only about 2,500 jews left in iraq .
we kept ourselves to ourselves and were generally left alone ; but things changed dramatically after the war .
i was 14 and went to the jewish school where we tried to maintain a semblance of normal life despite the many restrictions imposed on us as jews .
on the day it started , all i was aware of was parents coming to pick their children up .
i could n't understand what was happening .
the mother of a friend told me war had started .
for the first few days of the war no-one knew what was happening .
when the truth came out , we started being persecuted .
after this , jews were not allowed to have ' phones , my brother could n't go to university .
in 1969 nine jews were publicly hanged in iraq for spying for israel .
we had our own id to show we were jewish .
guess what colour the card was : yellow .

there was a jordanian military camp right behind our house .
the israeli planes raiding the area did n't realise that the jordanian camp had been evacuated before the war had even begun .
one of the bombs fell directly on the strawberry bed in our garden , breaking our living room window .
it was not really a six-day war .
it was a 24-hour walk-through with minimal resistance .
almost overnight the whole population was facing a new reality .
we were under a military occupation , and to add insult to injury we had to put up a white piece of cloth as a sign of surrender .
we just stood helpless , not realising what we were up against .
in fact our anger was focused on the arab armies who lost the war on three fronts , and on jordan specifically for abandoning the area before the fighting had started .
click to return moshe , 67 , israeli , jerusalem at about 10am we heard a rumour that the egyptian air force had been destroyed .
to be at the wailing wall ; it was a dream for us !
i was doing my military service , working as a technician for the air force .
of course i knew the reservists were already called up ; but i did n't have the feeling war was imminent .
no-one believed it would be so easy .
suddenly we had a big israel with all the sites of the bible .
on the sixth day of war we said " let 's go the wailing wall " .
i had n't been there before , not to east jerusalem .
before 1967 , there was a viewpoint from which you could see the wailing wall ; i remember my father pointing it out to me as a child .
you must understand , this was only 22 years after the holocaust .
remembering my family members who were killed ... and then to be at the wall ; it was a dream for us !
the history of 2,000 years was coming back !
after the war , there was enormous prosperity in israel ; people started to invest in the country .
jews came from all over the world .
click to return rahaf , 68 , syrian , damascus i remember it being quite a hot summer .
i was 28 years old and alone with my four children in quneitra , as my husband was quite close to the front .
he was a member of the military police .
during the build-up , the media was very one-sided and patriotic .
it was all about defeating israel and gaining a victory for the arab street , something that was very much needed .
you must understand , at the time damascus was inundated with palestinian refugees ; their suffering was very evident and there was an animosity towards israel that permeated through society ; it still does .
there were a lot of rumours and the only way to determine how close the israeli army actually was , was by word of mouth .
i was anxious and felt quite isolated ; i could see my neighbours slowly closing up and leaving for damascus .
my husband finally called me and told me to do the same , which i did .
he followed about a week later .
i remember people thinking that syria had fallen and soon the israeli army would enter the gates of damascus .
the media was very subdued and did not elaborate on our defeat .
the nation went from a state of euphoria , to utter despondency .
it was the ultimate anti-climax , and i could see it etched clearly on my husband 's face when he returned .
he never spoke much of what he saw , as it would bring tears to his eyes , and he hated me seeing him cry .
click to return fathi salameh , 47 , palestinian , jenin , west bank jenin was under the protection of jordanian and iraqi troops at the time .
there were just 30 or 40 kilometres between us and israeli territory .
i was seven years old and i remember it all well .
when they started to bomb us we hid in caves in the village .
my family have horrible stories about what israel did to our people in 1948 .
so , we spent two or three nights in the caves without electricity or water .
it 's a myth that it was a six day war ; everything was finished in just 48 hours .
we were at the top of the mountain watching the iraqis and jordanians escape from the area .
there was no unified command ; they gave up the land very easily .
there were individual heroes who tried to resist .
we watched one lone iraqi tank stay on the hill and fire on the approaching israeli tanks .
he kept on firing and holding them back until an israeli war plane flew in and bombed him .
the jordanians did n't have the strength or weapons that the israelis had and they did n't want to commit suicide .
so , they went home to their families .
after we left the caves we went home too .

click to return rahaf , 68 , syrian , damascus i remember it being quite a hot summer .
i was 28 years old and alone with my four children in quneitra , as my husband was quite close to the front .
he was a member of the military police .
during the build-up , the media was very one-sided and patriotic .
it was all about defeating israel and gaining a victory for the arab street , something that was very much needed .
you must understand , at the time damascus was inundated with palestinian refugees ; their suffering was very evident and there was an animosity towards israel that permeated through society ; it still does .
there were a lot of rumours and the only way to determine how close the israeli army actually was , was by word of mouth .
i was anxious and felt quite isolated ; i could see my neighbours slowly closing up and leaving for damascus .
my husband finally called me and told me to do the same , which i did .
he followed about a week later .
i remember people thinking that syria had fallen and soon the israeli army would enter the gates of damascus .
the media was very subdued and did not elaborate on our defeat .
the nation went from a state of euphoria , to utter despondency .
it was the ultimate anti-climax , and i could see it etched clearly on my husband 's face when he returned .
he never spoke much of what he saw , as it would bring tears to his eyes , and he hated me seeing him cry .

there were just 30 or 40 kilometres between us and israeli territory .
i was seven years old and i remember it all well .
when they started to bomb us we hid in caves in the village .
my family have horrible stories about what israel did to our people in 1948 .
so , we spent two or three nights in the caves without electricity or water .
it 's a myth that it was a six day war ; everything was finished in just 48 hours .
we were at the top of the mountain watching the iraqis and jordanians escape from the area .
there was no unified command ; they gave up the land very easily .
there were individual heroes who tried to resist .
we watched one lone iraqi tank stay on the hill and fire on the approaching israeli tanks .
he kept on firing and holding them back until an israeli war plane flew in and bombed him .
the jordanians did n't have the strength or weapons that the israelis had and they did n't want to commit suicide .
so , they went home to their families .
after we left the caves we went home too .
everyone in the village put white flags on their houses .

i did not really understand war , but i sensed that we were in great danger .
i remember watching tv and seeing mobs in cairo screaming " itabch al yahud " - " slaughter the jews " and there was real fear that we were facing another holocaust .
the subsequent israeli victory was a huge watershed in our lives , and in 1974 i moved to israel and joined the israeli army .

we were expecting certain victory over israel .
however , i woke up out of a series of dreams to a surprising and horrific reality .
these dreams were fuelled by the arab leaders of the time and by the official media .
they included a romantic desire to return palestinian lands occupied by israel ; and another one of forming an unbeatable joint arab army .
if there is one main consequence of the war , it could be that i lost confidence in arab leaders .
i still remember king hussein of jordan promising arab armies would " eat up israelis with their hands and teeth " - words that later proved no more than rhetoric after israel destroyed three arab armies in a few hours .
i also ca n't forget my friends and relatives breaking down in tears after the defeat .
with all pre-war talk about certain victory , we just did n't expect to lose .
click to return ronnie dallal , 54 , formerly iraqi jew , now british citizen by 1967 there were only about 2,500 jews left in iraq .
we kept ourselves to ourselves and were generally left alone ; but things changed dramatically after the war .
i was 14 and went to the jewish school where we tried to maintain a semblance of normal life despite the many restrictions imposed on us as jews .
on the day it started , all i was aware of was parents coming to pick their children up .
i could n't understand what was happening .
the mother of a friend told me war had started .
for the first few days of the war no-one knew what was happening .
when the truth came out , we started being persecuted .
after this , jews were not allowed to have ' phones , my brother could n't go to university .
in 1969 nine jews were publicly hanged in iraq for spying for israel .

after 40 years the events are still fresh in my mind .
we used to live near a railway line connecting cairo to suez .
before the war you could see the heavy equipment being taken by rail from cairo to sinai , through suez .
you could see the faces of the soldiers ; they were singing and chanting as if they were going on a picnic .
after the war , the trains used to sneak back after midnight , carrying the wounded , the dead and the destroyed artillery .
it was such a shock to me and everyone else , but at the time we knew very little ; neither when nor how the war ended , because all information was controlled by the nasser regime .
more and more memories come to my mind , but they are all sad .
we felt destroyed as a nation .

we lived opposite the head of news at kol israel , israeli radio , who was a friend of ours , but he would not tell us what was happening .
on the third day , people who had stayed at home started to venture out , as we realised the shelling had stopped .
when i went to buy groceries i saw a crowd of people had gathered .
when i got closer , i saw they were crowding around a jeep with an israeli soldier in it - but could see immediately from the camouflage that it was not an israeli jeep !
sure enough , there were the arabic numerals on the number plate .
that was the first time i knew we had won .
