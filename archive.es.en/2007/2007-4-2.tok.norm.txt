unlike many other shows of its kind , it does not deal exclusively with state repression , but focuses on everyday life . to museum director hans ottomeyer , the new exhibition in the german historical museum plugs an important gap in the way that east germany has been presented up to now .
in part , it is a response to the lack of a museum devoted to the history of the former communist regime . " there is no museum of east german history .
on the one hand , there are calls for such a museum to be set up .
on the other hand , it is also vehemently rejected , " ottomeyer said .
" until the permanent exhibition in the german historical museum , no one had begun to tackle this . " last year , peter kenzelmann , a political scientist from southwestern germany , set up a private museum in the german capital to look at this more personal part of east germany , which had been mostly neglected .
but he was accused of failing to make the brutality of the regime clear in his permanent display . everyday lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a children 's tv puppet , the sandman , was a beloved feature of east german life the aim of the exhibition in the german historical museum , according to ottomeyer , is to explore the interface between people 's everyday lives and the influence of the east german state . " the gdr had 17 million inhabitants on average .
that amounted to 17 million daily lives , " said exhibition organizer jörn schütrumpf . " the question we asked ourselves was what did these daily lives - or at least the majority of them - have in common ? " for him , it was important to show that life in east germany was not only affected by a massive concrete wall that divided the city , but also a second wall in the form of the state that tried to influence the lives of its citizens . " we kept on being asked how we would present the stasi , the east german secret police .
that is , of course , a theme without which you ca n't define the regime in the gdr , " said schütrumpf . diverse exhibits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files from the east german secret police headquarters are among the displays alongside such exhibits as a filing card cabinet from the headquarters of the east german secret police , there are also more banal articles , such as a school satchel made out of cardboard . all 550 items come from the museum 's own archive and were donated by members of the public after the collapse of the communist regime . " the public was asked , on television and in the newspapers , to bring to the museum what they saw as the most important objects relating to gdr history , " said curator regine falkenberg .
" you can also find little things such as meat stock paste , tins , tvs , darning utensils and vitamin preparations . " everyday resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has seen a wave of nostalgia for everyday east german products no longer available the show covers the period from 1956 up to the end of the communist regime .
but its 550 exhibits are not arranged chronologically .
instead , it is grouped according to thematic blocs such as work , the collective and the family . the exhibition , which runs until july 29 , also shows how ordinary east german citizens sought to resist the demands of the state .
that was not an easy task , since the stasi secret police had some 100,000 regular employees in addition to around 500,000 to two million collaborators in a country whose 1990 population was just over 16 million . the activities of the secret police were obviously no laughing matter for those who ended up in its custody .
but humor was one weapon that ordinary citizens used to deal with so-called " real existing socialism " and there is a special section especially devoted to jokes . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum takes controversial look at mundane east germany a new , private berlin museum focuses on everyday life in east germany .

verka serduchka is accused by nationalists of enforcing negative ukrainian stereotypes while the russians see her song as a political snub . the eurovision song contest will soon be upon us once again , giving fans and detractors alike another opportunity to watch the annual back scratching - and back-stabbing - which makes the event more than just a bunch of above-average karaoke singers trying to get the better of each other . for those not in the know , the annual contest , held since 1956 , pits active member countries of the european broadcasting union against one another .
each country submits a song to be performed on live television and then voters from the participating countries cast votes for the other countries ' songs .
it is seen by many as a festival of kitsch , adored or disdained for its campy , over-the-top presentation of usually forgettable three-minute songs . the contest is as much about allegiances as it is about competition .
it doesn ’ t matter if a particular song is terrible or not , if one country considers the other a friend , then it will get the vote regardless of its entry ’ s quality . while this low-level political bargaining has always been a part of eurovision , the light-hearted entertainment event has rarely been overtly subversive .
however , this year may be the first time that actual protests may stem from the presentation and lyrics of a particular contestant . that contestant is a ukrainian drag queen called verka serduchka .
a cult star in " her " native country , verka was the choice of the people by a massive majority in the competition to become ukraine ’ s entry with the song “ dancing . ” stereotype prompts demonstrations however , the first potentially political row revolving around the song has started at home with ukrainian nationalists up in arms over verka ’ s image . while they seem to accept the fact that a drag queen is representing the country , they have taken umbrage over verka ’ s portrayal of a stupid ukrainian villager , saying she could damage ukraine ’ s image abroad . it has riled the nationalists to such an extent that demonstrations aimed at getting ukraine pulled from eurovision were staged across the country on sunday . snub to former soviet master bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the square is in the song , the protests are n't russia , which has already made its feeling against verka known , is likely to become even more irate when verka belts out her apparently anti-russian lyrics in front of an international audience .
it seems that the chorus refrain of " russia goodbye " has been interpreted as a snub to ukraine ’ s former soviet master . the russians have also taken offense to the reference to a kiev square that was the focus of anti-russian protests during the 2004 orange revolution , despite the fact that no mention of the demonstrations which signaled ukraine ’ s westward shift is included in the song . should verka win a moral victory and actually perform the song on the show , it could prove quite an eventful night . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany swings around eurovision in surprising national final germany has never fully recovered from its 2005 eurovision debacle when it came last .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.04.2007 nationalists , russia find ukraine 's eurovision song quite a drag großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drag queen verka serduchka is causing more than her fair share of commotion ukraine 's eurovision song contest entry is causing friction at home and abroad .
verka serduchka is accused by nationalists of enforcing negative ukrainian stereotypes while the russians see her song as a political snub . the eurovision song contest will soon be upon us once again , giving fans and detractors alike another opportunity to watch the annual back scratching - and back-stabbing - which makes the event more than just a bunch of above-average karaoke singers trying to get the better of each other . for those not in the know , the annual contest , held since 1956 , pits active member countries of the european broadcasting union against one another .
each country submits a song to be performed on live television and then voters from the participating countries cast votes for the other countries ' songs .
it is seen by many as a festival of kitsch , adored or disdained for its campy , over-the-top presentation of usually forgettable three-minute songs . the contest is as much about allegiances as it is about competition .
it doesn ’ t matter if a particular song is terrible or not , if one country considers the other a friend , then it will get the vote regardless of its entry ’ s quality . while this low-level political bargaining has always been a part of eurovision , the light-hearted entertainment event has rarely been overtly subversive .
however , this year may be the first time that actual protests may stem from the presentation and lyrics of a particular contestant . that contestant is a ukrainian drag queen called verka serduchka .
a cult star in " her " native country , verka was the choice of the people by a massive majority in the competition to become ukraine ’ s entry with the song “ dancing . ” stereotype prompts demonstrations however , the first potentially political row revolving around the song has started at home with ukrainian nationalists up in arms over verka ’ s image . while they seem to accept the fact that a drag queen is representing the country , they have taken umbrage over verka ’ s portrayal of a stupid ukrainian villager , saying she could damage ukraine ’ s image abroad . it has riled the nationalists to such an extent that demonstrations aimed at getting ukraine pulled from eurovision were staged across the country on sunday . snub to former soviet master bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the square is in the song , the protests are n't russia , which has already made its feeling against verka known , is likely to become even more irate when verka belts out her apparently anti-russian lyrics in front of an international audience .
it seems that the chorus refrain of " russia goodbye " has been interpreted as a snub to ukraine ’ s former soviet master . the russians have also taken offense to the reference to a kiev square that was the focus of anti-russian protests during the 2004 orange revolution , despite the fact that no mention of the demonstrations which signaled ukraine ’ s westward shift is included in the song . should verka win a moral victory and actually perform the song on the show , it could prove quite an eventful night . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany swings around eurovision in surprising national final germany has never fully recovered from its 2005 eurovision debacle when it came last .

despite their well-publicized surveillance role , the new troops may soon find the taliban does not see a difference between combat and support . germany ’ s deployment of eight tornado jets , their crew and support personnel to afghanistan avoided a final spanner in the works on friday when the federal constitutional court refused to grant a request from the opposition left party for an injunction stopping the deployment . with the removal of this last hurdle , 200 troops from the bundeswehr ’ s jagel base begin their deployment to masir-i-sharif via sardinia and the united arab emirates on monday . from their new base in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , the tornados - which are requested by nato - will fly surveillance missions at an altitude of 3000 meters -lrb- 9842 feet -rrb- over the hindu kush , charged with photographing taliban positions in support of nato forces on the ground . at a sending-off ceremony on monday , german defense minister franz josef jung said the aim of the mission was to bring assistance not fear to the afghan people . " the reconnaissance gathered by our tornadoes will bring more stability and security to afghanistan , " jung said .
" their mission is to protect isaf troops , as well as civilian aid workers and the afghan population . " worries mount in germany about planes ' role but despite the german german government 's assurances that the mission is purely a support role and not a combat deployment , there are still concerns within the government and the military that the tornado mission , just as the bundeswehr ’ s reconstruction efforts on the ground , will become embroiled in the growing conflict as a resurgent taliban readies to launch a widely expected spring offensive . public opinion back home in germany is also showing signs of concern and deployment fatigue .
a recent poll by the tns institute commissioned by der spiegel news magazine found that 57 per cent of those surveyed wanted a complete withdrawal of german troops from afghanistan , while 36 per cent were in favor of continued engagement .
a meager four per cent backed increasing the german military presence . regardless of mission , germany still an enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tornados are fitted with special camera equipment after five years of conflict , afghanistan is now more dangerous for the nato contingent , not less so and germany ’ s troops - despite their reconstruction mandate - are increasingly in the firing line .
and with the deployment of the tornado jets and support personnel , germany is moving up the taliban ’ s list of targets . the bundeswehr ’ s approach to the general population and their mission has provided a relatively stable environment in the north .
however , several recent incidents have unsettled german officials .
in march , a german aid worker was ambushed and killed in northern afghanistan , and in late february a german woman and her son were kidnapped in iraq by a group who threatened to execute the pair if berlin did not withdraw its troops from afghanistan . quoted in an interview published by german magazine cicero last month , mullah obaidullah , a senior taliban official and deputy to the elusive taliban leader mullah omar , said that germany ’ s 3,000 troops stationed in kabul and the northern provinces will be attacked by a wave of taliban fighters , and that no one would be spared . " not the germans , not the british , not the canadians and certainly not the americans .
we kill them all , " obaidullah was quoted as saying .
“ some 6,000 young warriors will sacrifice themselves for allah in the struggle , " he added . surveillance planes a target like any other bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocket propelled grenades and missiles will prove dangerous the german tornados - six fully operational jets backed up by two reserve planes - could face attack from the taliban ’ s man-portable air defense systems , or manpads .
a ground-to-air stinger rocket , which can hit aircraft at a range of up to 4785 meters and at altitudes between 182 and 3810 meters , can be fired from the shoulder of a single taliban fighter , making surveillance runs over the hindi kush mountain range very hazardous . the situation on the ground for bundeswehr troops in afghanistan is also a cause for concern with soldiers complaining of a lack of support , inadequate equipment and diminishing supplies . the tornado crews may also be shocked to discover on their arrival in afghanistan that if any of them are shot down , the bundeswehr do not have the capacity to rescue their own pilots because they lack the necessary helicopters .
in an emergency , us , british or canadian troops would have to embark on a rescue mission . soldiers air grievances to spd 's beck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops are coping with increasingly difficult conditions such conditions were made aware to social democrat chairperson kurt beck at the weekend when he visited troops in the north of the country .
soldiers openly complained about the cramped conditions , rationing problems and the fact that a camp of 1600 troops had only four telephones between them .
one told beck that , “ if our motivation goes down the drain , then we have a real problem . ” beck points out that the mission is bringing german military capabilities to their limits . " i ’ m sure we can do more as far as reconstruction in afghanistan is concerned but i ’ m as much convinced that this mission is driving our military capacities to the brink of exhaustion , " beck said .
the spd leader has promised that he would pass on the grievances of the troops to the german government on his return . but with the tornado deployment likely to begin active service by the middle of april , an extra 200 troops to cater for and an expected increase in taliban attacks , germany ’ s troops in afghanistan do not have the luxury of waiting for the outcome of another extended debate in the bundestag about their mandate . despite governmental assurances of their role in the peace , germany ’ s troops know that they are in a war , regardless if they are firing bullets or not . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court rejects bid to stop afghanistan plane deployment germany 's top court friday rejected a bid by an opposition party to prevent the deployment of six tornado surveillance aircraft to help nato forces fighting the taliban in southern afghanistan .

verka serduchka is accused by nationalists of enforcing negative ukrainian stereotypes while the russians see her song as a political snub . the eurovision song contest will soon be upon us once again , giving fans and detractors alike another opportunity to watch the annual back scratching - and back-stabbing - which makes the event more than just a bunch of above-average karaoke singers trying to get the better of each other . for those not in the know , the annual contest , held since 1956 , pits active member countries of the european broadcasting union against one another .

verka serduchka is accused by nationalists of enforcing negative ukrainian stereotypes while the russians see her song as a political snub . the eurovision song contest will soon be upon us once again , giving fans and detractors alike another opportunity to watch the annual back scratching - and back-stabbing - which makes the event more than just a bunch of above-average karaoke singers trying to get the better of each other . for those not in the know , the annual contest , held since 1956 , pits active member countries of the european broadcasting union against one another .

unlike many other shows of its kind , it does not deal exclusively with state repression , but focuses on everyday life . to museum director hans ottomeyer , the new exhibition in the german historical museum plugs an important gap in the way that east germany has been presented up to now .
in part , it is a response to the lack of a museum devoted to the history of the former communist regime . " there is no museum of east german history .
on the one hand , there are calls for such a museum to be set up .
on the other hand , it is also vehemently rejected , " ottomeyer said .
" until the permanent exhibition in the german historical museum , no one had begun to tackle this . " last year , peter kenzelmann , a political scientist from southwestern germany , set up a private museum in the german capital to look at this more personal part of east germany , which had been mostly neglected .
but he was accused of failing to make the brutality of the regime clear in his permanent display . everyday lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a children 's tv puppet , the sandman , was a beloved feature of east german life the aim of the exhibition in the german historical museum , according to ottomeyer , is to explore the interface between people 's everyday lives and the influence of the east german state . " the gdr had 17 million inhabitants on average .
that amounted to 17 million daily lives , " said exhibition organizer jörn schütrumpf . " the question we asked ourselves was what did these daily lives - or at least the majority of them - have in common ? " for him , it was important to show that life in east germany was not only affected by a massive concrete wall that divided the city , but also a second wall in the form of the state that tried to influence the lives of its citizens . " we kept on being asked how we would present the stasi , the east german secret police .
that is , of course , a theme without which you ca n't define the regime in the gdr , " said schütrumpf . diverse exhibits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files from the east german secret police headquarters are among the displays alongside such exhibits as a filing card cabinet from the headquarters of the east german secret police , there are also more banal articles , such as a school satchel made out of cardboard . all 550 items come from the museum 's own archive and were donated by members of the public after the collapse of the communist regime . " the public was asked , on television and in the newspapers , to bring to the museum what they saw as the most important objects relating to gdr history , " said curator regine falkenberg .
" you can also find little things such as meat stock paste , tins , tvs , darning utensils and vitamin preparations . " everyday resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has seen a wave of nostalgia for everyday east german products no longer available the show covers the period from 1956 up to the end of the communist regime .
but its 550 exhibits are not arranged chronologically .
instead , it is grouped according to thematic blocs such as work , the collective and the family . the exhibition , which runs until july 29 , also shows how ordinary east german citizens sought to resist the demands of the state .
that was not an easy task , since the stasi secret police had some 100,000 regular employees in addition to around 500,000 to two million collaborators in a country whose 1990 population was just over 16 million . the activities of the secret police were obviously no laughing matter for those who ended up in its custody .
but humor was one weapon that ordinary citizens used to deal with so-called " real existing socialism " and there is a special section especially devoted to jokes . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum takes controversial look at mundane east germany a new , private berlin museum focuses on everyday life in east germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.04.2007 new exhibition looks at daily life in east germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit focuses on the daily lives of everyday people a new exhibition on east germany has just opened in berlin 's german historical museum .
unlike many other shows of its kind , it does not deal exclusively with state repression , but focuses on everyday life . to museum director hans ottomeyer , the new exhibition in the german historical museum plugs an important gap in the way that east germany has been presented up to now .
in part , it is a response to the lack of a museum devoted to the history of the former communist regime . " there is no museum of east german history .
on the one hand , there are calls for such a museum to be set up .
on the other hand , it is also vehemently rejected , " ottomeyer said .
" until the permanent exhibition in the german historical museum , no one had begun to tackle this . " last year , peter kenzelmann , a political scientist from southwestern germany , set up a private museum in the german capital to look at this more personal part of east germany , which had been mostly neglected .
but he was accused of failing to make the brutality of the regime clear in his permanent display . everyday lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a children 's tv puppet , the sandman , was a beloved feature of east german life the aim of the exhibition in the german historical museum , according to ottomeyer , is to explore the interface between people 's everyday lives and the influence of the east german state . " the gdr had 17 million inhabitants on average .
that amounted to 17 million daily lives , " said exhibition organizer jörn schütrumpf . " the question we asked ourselves was what did these daily lives - or at least the majority of them - have in common ? " for him , it was important to show that life in east germany was not only affected by a massive concrete wall that divided the city , but also a second wall in the form of the state that tried to influence the lives of its citizens . " we kept on being asked how we would present the stasi , the east german secret police .
that is , of course , a theme without which you ca n't define the regime in the gdr , " said schütrumpf . diverse exhibits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files from the east german secret police headquarters are among the displays alongside such exhibits as a filing card cabinet from the headquarters of the east german secret police , there are also more banal articles , such as a school satchel made out of cardboard . all 550 items come from the museum 's own archive and were donated by members of the public after the collapse of the communist regime . " the public was asked , on television and in the newspapers , to bring to the museum what they saw as the most important objects relating to gdr history , " said curator regine falkenberg .
" you can also find little things such as meat stock paste , tins , tvs , darning utensils and vitamin preparations . " everyday resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has seen a wave of nostalgia for everyday east german products no longer available the show covers the period from 1956 up to the end of the communist regime .
but its 550 exhibits are not arranged chronologically .
instead , it is grouped according to thematic blocs such as work , the collective and the family . the exhibition , which runs until july 29 , also shows how ordinary east german citizens sought to resist the demands of the state .
that was not an easy task , since the stasi secret police had some 100,000 regular employees in addition to around 500,000 to two million collaborators in a country whose 1990 population was just over 16 million . the activities of the secret police were obviously no laughing matter for those who ended up in its custody .
but humor was one weapon that ordinary citizens used to deal with so-called " real existing socialism " and there is a special section especially devoted to jokes . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum takes controversial look at mundane east germany a new , private berlin museum focuses on everyday life in east germany .

unlike many other shows of its kind , it does not deal exclusively with state repression , but focuses on everyday life . to museum director hans ottomeyer , the new exhibition in the german historical museum plugs an important gap in the way that east germany has been presented up to now .
in part , it is a response to the lack of a museum devoted to the history of the former communist regime . " there is no museum of east german history .
on the one hand , there are calls for such a museum to be set up .
on the other hand , it is also vehemently rejected , " ottomeyer said .
" until the permanent exhibition in the german historical museum , no one had begun to tackle this . " last year , peter kenzelmann , a political scientist from southwestern germany , set up a private museum in the german capital to look at this more personal part of east germany , which had been mostly neglected .
but he was accused of failing to make the brutality of the regime clear in his permanent display . everyday lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a children 's tv puppet , the sandman , was a beloved feature of east german life the aim of the exhibition in the german historical museum , according to ottomeyer , is to explore the interface between people 's everyday lives and the influence of the east german state . " the gdr had 17 million inhabitants on average .
that amounted to 17 million daily lives , " said exhibition organizer jörn schütrumpf . " the question we asked ourselves was what did these daily lives - or at least the majority of them - have in common ? " for him , it was important to show that life in east germany was not only affected by a massive concrete wall that divided the city , but also a second wall in the form of the state that tried to influence the lives of its citizens . " we kept on being asked how we would present the stasi , the east german secret police .
that is , of course , a theme without which you ca n't define the regime in the gdr , " said schütrumpf . diverse exhibits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files from the east german secret police headquarters are among the displays alongside such exhibits as a filing card cabinet from the headquarters of the east german secret police , there are also more banal articles , such as a school satchel made out of cardboard . all 550 items come from the museum 's own archive and were donated by members of the public after the collapse of the communist regime . " the public was asked , on television and in the newspapers , to bring to the museum what they saw as the most important objects relating to gdr history , " said curator regine falkenberg .
" you can also find little things such as meat stock paste , tins , tvs , darning utensils and vitamin preparations . " everyday resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has seen a wave of nostalgia for everyday east german products no longer available the show covers the period from 1956 up to the end of the communist regime .
but its 550 exhibits are not arranged chronologically .
instead , it is grouped according to thematic blocs such as work , the collective and the family . the exhibition , which runs until july 29 , also shows how ordinary east german citizens sought to resist the demands of the state .
that was not an easy task , since the stasi secret police had some 100,000 regular employees in addition to around 500,000 to two million collaborators in a country whose 1990 population was just over 16 million . the activities of the secret police were obviously no laughing matter for those who ended up in its custody .
but humor was one weapon that ordinary citizens used to deal with so-called " real existing socialism " and there is a special section especially devoted to jokes . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum takes controversial look at mundane east germany a new , private berlin museum focuses on everyday life in east germany .

unlike many other shows of its kind , it does not deal exclusively with state repression , but focuses on everyday life . to museum director hans ottomeyer , the new exhibition in the german historical museum plugs an important gap in the way that east germany has been presented up to now .
in part , it is a response to the lack of a museum devoted to the history of the former communist regime . " there is no museum of east german history .
on the one hand , there are calls for such a museum to be set up .
on the other hand , it is also vehemently rejected , " ottomeyer said .
" until the permanent exhibition in the german historical museum , no one had begun to tackle this . " last year , peter kenzelmann , a political scientist from southwestern germany , set up a private museum in the german capital to look at this more personal part of east germany , which had been mostly neglected .
but he was accused of failing to make the brutality of the regime clear in his permanent display . everyday lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a children 's tv puppet , the sandman , was a beloved feature of east german life the aim of the exhibition in the german historical museum , according to ottomeyer , is to explore the interface between people 's everyday lives and the influence of the east german state . " the gdr had 17 million inhabitants on average .
that amounted to 17 million daily lives , " said exhibition organizer jörn schütrumpf . " the question we asked ourselves was what did these daily lives - or at least the majority of them - have in common ? " for him , it was important to show that life in east germany was not only affected by a massive concrete wall that divided the city , but also a second wall in the form of the state that tried to influence the lives of its citizens . " we kept on being asked how we would present the stasi , the east german secret police .
that is , of course , a theme without which you ca n't define the regime in the gdr , " said schütrumpf . diverse exhibits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files from the east german secret police headquarters are among the displays alongside such exhibits as a filing card cabinet from the headquarters of the east german secret police , there are also more banal articles , such as a school satchel made out of cardboard . all 550 items come from the museum 's own archive and were donated by members of the public after the collapse of the communist regime . " the public was asked , on television and in the newspapers , to bring to the museum what they saw as the most important objects relating to gdr history , " said curator regine falkenberg .
" you can also find little things such as meat stock paste , tins , tvs , darning utensils and vitamin preparations . " everyday resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has seen a wave of nostalgia for everyday east german products no longer available the show covers the period from 1956 up to the end of the communist regime .
but its 550 exhibits are not arranged chronologically .
instead , it is grouped according to thematic blocs such as work , the collective and the family . the exhibition , which runs until july 29 , also shows how ordinary east german citizens sought to resist the demands of the state .
that was not an easy task , since the stasi secret police had some 100,000 regular employees in addition to around 500,000 to two million collaborators in a country whose 1990 population was just over 16 million . the activities of the secret police were obviously no laughing matter for those who ended up in its custody .

verka serduchka is accused by nationalists of enforcing negative ukrainian stereotypes while the russians see her song as a political snub . the eurovision song contest will soon be upon us once again , giving fans and detractors alike another opportunity to watch the annual back scratching - and back-stabbing - which makes the event more than just a bunch of above-average karaoke singers trying to get the better of each other . for those not in the know , the annual contest , held since 1956 , pits active member countries of the european broadcasting union against one another .
each country submits a song to be performed on live television and then voters from the participating countries cast votes for the other countries ' songs .
it is seen by many as a festival of kitsch , adored or disdained for its campy , over-the-top presentation of usually forgettable three-minute songs . the contest is as much about allegiances as it is about competition .
it doesn ’ t matter if a particular song is terrible or not , if one country considers the other a friend , then it will get the vote regardless of its entry ’ s quality . while this low-level political bargaining has always been a part of eurovision , the light-hearted entertainment event has rarely been overtly subversive .
however , this year may be the first time that actual protests may stem from the presentation and lyrics of a particular contestant . that contestant is a ukrainian drag queen called verka serduchka .
a cult star in " her " native country , verka was the choice of the people by a massive majority in the competition to become ukraine ’ s entry with the song “ dancing . ” stereotype prompts demonstrations however , the first potentially political row revolving around the song has started at home with ukrainian nationalists up in arms over verka ’ s image . while they seem to accept the fact that a drag queen is representing the country , they have taken umbrage over verka ’ s portrayal of a stupid ukrainian villager , saying she could damage ukraine ’ s image abroad . it has riled the nationalists to such an extent that demonstrations aimed at getting ukraine pulled from eurovision were staged across the country on sunday . snub to former soviet master bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the square is in the song , the protests are n't russia , which has already made its feeling against verka known , is likely to become even more irate when verka belts out her apparently anti-russian lyrics in front of an international audience .
it seems that the chorus refrain of " russia goodbye " has been interpreted as a snub to ukraine ’ s former soviet master . the russians have also taken offense to the reference to a kiev square that was the focus of anti-russian protests during the 2004 orange revolution , despite the fact that no mention of the demonstrations which signaled ukraine ’ s westward shift is included in the song . should verka win a moral victory and actually perform the song on the show , it could prove quite an eventful night . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany swings around eurovision in surprising national final germany has never fully recovered from its 2005 eurovision debacle when it came last .

it is another step in yet another scandal to engulf the german engineering giant .
this latest move indicates momentum continues to gather pace and is another blow to the company 's weakened executives . the charge is that siemens illegally financed aub , a small union which is considered more employer friendly .
siemens allegedly hoped aub would act as a counterweight to ig metall , which has said that aub sometimes blocked its positions in labor talks .

a recent poll by the tns institute commissioned by der spiegel news magazine found that 57 per cent of those surveyed wanted a complete withdrawal of german troops from afghanistan , while 36 per cent were in favor of continued engagement .
a meager four per cent backed increasing the german military presence . regardless of mission , germany still an enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tornados are fitted with special camera equipment after five years of conflict , afghanistan is now more dangerous for the nato contingent , not less so and germany ’ s troops - despite their reconstruction mandate - are increasingly in the firing line .
and with the deployment of the tornado jets and support personnel , germany is moving up the taliban ’ s list of targets . the bundeswehr ’ s approach to the general population and their mission has provided a relatively stable environment in the north .
however , several recent incidents have unsettled german officials .
in march , a german aid worker was ambushed and killed in northern afghanistan , and in late february a german woman and her son were kidnapped in iraq by a group who threatened to execute the pair if berlin did not withdraw its troops from afghanistan . quoted in an interview published by german magazine cicero last month , mullah obaidullah , a senior taliban official and deputy to the elusive taliban leader mullah omar , said that germany ’ s 3,000 troops stationed in kabul and the northern provinces will be attacked by a wave of taliban fighters , and that no one would be spared . " not the germans , not the british , not the canadians and certainly not the americans .
we kill them all , " obaidullah was quoted as saying .
“ some 6,000 young warriors will sacrifice themselves for allah in the struggle , " he added . surveillance planes a target like any other bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocket propelled grenades and missiles will prove dangerous the german tornados - six fully operational jets backed up by two reserve planes - could face attack from the taliban ’ s man-portable air defense systems , or manpads .
a ground-to-air stinger rocket , which can hit aircraft at a range of up to 4785 meters and at altitudes between 182 and 3810 meters , can be fired from the shoulder of a single taliban fighter , making surveillance runs over the hindi kush mountain range very hazardous . the situation on the ground for bundeswehr troops in afghanistan is also a cause for concern with soldiers complaining of a lack of support , inadequate equipment and diminishing supplies . the tornado crews may also be shocked to discover on their arrival in afghanistan that if any of them are shot down , the bundeswehr do not have the capacity to rescue their own pilots because they lack the necessary helicopters .
in an emergency , us , british or canadian troops would have to embark on a rescue mission . soldiers air grievances to spd 's beck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops are coping with increasingly difficult conditions such conditions were made aware to social democrat chairperson kurt beck at the weekend when he visited troops in the north of the country .
soldiers openly complained about the cramped conditions , rationing problems and the fact that a camp of 1600 troops had only four telephones between them .
one told beck that , “ if our motivation goes down the drain , then we have a real problem . ” beck points out that the mission is bringing german military capabilities to their limits . " i ’ m sure we can do more as far as reconstruction in afghanistan is concerned but i ’ m as much convinced that this mission is driving our military capacities to the brink of exhaustion , " beck said .
the spd leader has promised that he would pass on the grievances of the troops to the german government on his return . but with the tornado deployment likely to begin active service by the middle of april , an extra 200 troops to cater for and an expected increase in taliban attacks , germany ’ s troops in afghanistan do not have the luxury of waiting for the outcome of another extended debate in the bundestag about their mandate . despite governmental assurances of their role in the peace , germany ’ s troops know that they are in a war , regardless if they are firing bullets or not . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court rejects bid to stop afghanistan plane deployment germany 's top court friday rejected a bid by an opposition party to prevent the deployment of six tornado surveillance aircraft to help nato forces fighting the taliban in southern afghanistan .

unlike many other shows of its kind , it does not deal exclusively with state repression , but focuses on everyday life . to museum director hans ottomeyer , the new exhibition in the german historical museum plugs an important gap in the way that east germany has been presented up to now .

on the one hand , there are calls for such a museum to be set up .
on the other hand , it is also vehemently rejected , " ottomeyer said .
" until the permanent exhibition in the german historical museum , no one had begun to tackle this . " last year , peter kenzelmann , a political scientist from southwestern germany , set up a private museum in the german capital to look at this more personal part of east germany , which had been mostly neglected .

that amounted to 17 million daily lives , " said exhibition organizer jörn schütrumpf . " the question we asked ourselves was what did these daily lives - or at least the majority of them - have in common ?

instead , it is grouped according to thematic blocs such as work , the collective and the family . the exhibition , which runs until july 29 , also shows how ordinary east german citizens sought to resist the demands of the state .
that was not an easy task , since the stasi secret police had some 100,000 regular employees in addition to around 500,000 to two million collaborators in a country whose 1990 population was just over 16 million . the activities of the secret police were obviously no laughing matter for those who ended up in its custody .

unlike many other shows of its kind , it does not deal exclusively with state repression , but focuses on everyday life . to museum director hans ottomeyer , the new exhibition in the german historical museum plugs an important gap in the way that east germany has been presented up to now .
in part , it is a response to the lack of a museum devoted to the history of the former communist regime . " there is no museum of east german history .
on the one hand , there are calls for such a museum to be set up .
on the other hand , it is also vehemently rejected , " ottomeyer said .
" until the permanent exhibition in the german historical museum , no one had begun to tackle this . " last year , peter kenzelmann , a political scientist from southwestern germany , set up a private museum in the german capital to look at this more personal part of east germany , which had been mostly neglected .
but he was accused of failing to make the brutality of the regime clear in his permanent display . everyday lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a children 's tv puppet , the sandman , was a beloved feature of east german life the aim of the exhibition in the german historical museum , according to ottomeyer , is to explore the interface between people 's everyday lives and the influence of the east german state . " the gdr had 17 million inhabitants on average .
that amounted to 17 million daily lives , " said exhibition organizer jörn schütrumpf . " the question we asked ourselves was what did these daily lives - or at least the majority of them - have in common ? " for him , it was important to show that life in east germany was not only affected by a massive concrete wall that divided the city , but also a second wall in the form of the state that tried to influence the lives of its citizens . " we kept on being asked how we would present the stasi , the east german secret police .
that is , of course , a theme without which you ca n't define the regime in the gdr , " said schütrumpf . diverse exhibits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files from the east german secret police headquarters are among the displays alongside such exhibits as a filing card cabinet from the headquarters of the east german secret police , there are also more banal articles , such as a school satchel made out of cardboard . all 550 items come from the museum 's own archive and were donated by members of the public after the collapse of the communist regime . " the public was asked , on television and in the newspapers , to bring to the museum what they saw as the most important objects relating to gdr history , " said curator regine falkenberg .
" you can also find little things such as meat stock paste , tins , tvs , darning utensils and vitamin preparations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.04.2007 nationalists , russia find ukraine 's eurovision song quite a drag großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drag queen verka serduchka is causing more than her fair share of commotion ukraine 's eurovision song contest entry is causing friction at home and abroad .
verka serduchka is accused by nationalists of enforcing negative ukrainian stereotypes while the russians see her song as a political snub . the eurovision song contest will soon be upon us once again , giving fans and detractors alike another opportunity to watch the annual back scratching - and back-stabbing - which makes the event more than just a bunch of above-average karaoke singers trying to get the better of each other . for those not in the know , the annual contest , held since 1956 , pits active member countries of the european broadcasting union against one another .
each country submits a song to be performed on live television and then voters from the participating countries cast votes for the other countries ' songs .
it is seen by many as a festival of kitsch , adored or disdained for its campy , over-the-top presentation of usually forgettable three-minute songs . the contest is as much about allegiances as it is about competition .
it doesn ’ t matter if a particular song is terrible or not , if one country considers the other a friend , then it will get the vote regardless of its entry ’ s quality . while this low-level political bargaining has always been a part of eurovision , the light-hearted entertainment event has rarely been overtly subversive .
however , this year may be the first time that actual protests may stem from the presentation and lyrics of a particular contestant . that contestant is a ukrainian drag queen called verka serduchka .
a cult star in " her " native country , verka was the choice of the people by a massive majority in the competition to become ukraine ’ s entry with the song “ dancing . ” stereotype prompts demonstrations however , the first potentially political row revolving around the song has started at home with ukrainian nationalists up in arms over verka ’ s image . while they seem to accept the fact that a drag queen is representing the country , they have taken umbrage over verka ’ s portrayal of a stupid ukrainian villager , saying she could damage ukraine ’ s image abroad . it has riled the nationalists to such an extent that demonstrations aimed at getting ukraine pulled from eurovision were staged across the country on sunday . snub to former soviet master bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the square is in the song , the protests are n't russia , which has already made its feeling against verka known , is likely to become even more irate when verka belts out her apparently anti-russian lyrics in front of an international audience .
it seems that the chorus refrain of " russia goodbye " has been interpreted as a snub to ukraine ’ s former soviet master . the russians have also taken offense to the reference to a kiev square that was the focus of anti-russian protests during the 2004 orange revolution , despite the fact that no mention of the demonstrations which signaled ukraine ’ s westward shift is included in the song . should verka win a moral victory and actually perform the song on the show , it could prove quite an eventful night . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany swings around eurovision in surprising national final germany has never fully recovered from its 2005 eurovision debacle when it came last .

verka serduchka is accused by nationalists of enforcing negative ukrainian stereotypes while the russians see her song as a political snub . the eurovision song contest will soon be upon us once again , giving fans and detractors alike another opportunity to watch the annual back scratching - and back-stabbing - which makes the event more than just a bunch of above-average karaoke singers trying to get the better of each other . for those not in the know , the annual contest , held since 1956 , pits active member countries of the european broadcasting union against one another .
each country submits a song to be performed on live television and then voters from the participating countries cast votes for the other countries ' songs .
it is seen by many as a festival of kitsch , adored or disdained for its campy , over-the-top presentation of usually forgettable three-minute songs . the contest is as much about allegiances as it is about competition .
it doesn ’ t matter if a particular song is terrible or not , if one country considers the other a friend , then it will get the vote regardless of its entry ’ s quality . while this low-level political bargaining has always been a part of eurovision , the light-hearted entertainment event has rarely been overtly subversive .
however , this year may be the first time that actual protests may stem from the presentation and lyrics of a particular contestant . that contestant is a ukrainian drag queen called verka serduchka .
a cult star in " her " native country , verka was the choice of the people by a massive majority in the competition to become ukraine ’ s entry with the song “ dancing . ” stereotype prompts demonstrations however , the first potentially political row revolving around the song has started at home with ukrainian nationalists up in arms over verka ’ s image . while they seem to accept the fact that a drag queen is representing the country , they have taken umbrage over verka ’ s portrayal of a stupid ukrainian villager , saying she could damage ukraine ’ s image abroad . it has riled the nationalists to such an extent that demonstrations aimed at getting ukraine pulled from eurovision were staged across the country on sunday . snub to former soviet master bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the square is in the song , the protests are n't russia , which has already made its feeling against verka known , is likely to become even more irate when verka belts out her apparently anti-russian lyrics in front of an international audience .
it seems that the chorus refrain of " russia goodbye " has been interpreted as a snub to ukraine ’ s former soviet master . the russians have also taken offense to the reference to a kiev square that was the focus of anti-russian protests during the 2004 orange revolution , despite the fact that no mention of the demonstrations which signaled ukraine ’ s westward shift is included in the song . should verka win a moral victory and actually perform the song on the show , it could prove quite an eventful night . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany swings around eurovision in surprising national final germany has never fully recovered from its 2005 eurovision debacle when it came last .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.04.2007 nationalists , russia find ukraine 's eurovision song quite a drag großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drag queen verka serduchka is causing more than her fair share of commotion ukraine 's eurovision song contest entry is causing friction at home and abroad .
verka serduchka is accused by nationalists of enforcing negative ukrainian stereotypes while the russians see her song as a political snub . the eurovision song contest will soon be upon us once again , giving fans and detractors alike another opportunity to watch the annual back scratching - and back-stabbing - which makes the event more than just a bunch of above-average karaoke singers trying to get the better of each other . for those not in the know , the annual contest , held since 1956 , pits active member countries of the european broadcasting union against one another .
each country submits a song to be performed on live television and then voters from the participating countries cast votes for the other countries ' songs .
it is seen by many as a festival of kitsch , adored or disdained for its campy , over-the-top presentation of usually forgettable three-minute songs . the contest is as much about allegiances as it is about competition .
it doesn ’ t matter if a particular song is terrible or not , if one country considers the other a friend , then it will get the vote regardless of its entry ’ s quality . while this low-level political bargaining has always been a part of eurovision , the light-hearted entertainment event has rarely been overtly subversive .
however , this year may be the first time that actual protests may stem from the presentation and lyrics of a particular contestant . that contestant is a ukrainian drag queen called verka serduchka .
a cult star in " her " native country , verka was the choice of the people by a massive majority in the competition to become ukraine ’ s entry with the song “ dancing . ” stereotype prompts demonstrations however , the first potentially political row revolving around the song has started at home with ukrainian nationalists up in arms over verka ’ s image . while they seem to accept the fact that a drag queen is representing the country , they have taken umbrage over verka ’ s portrayal of a stupid ukrainian villager , saying she could damage ukraine ’ s image abroad . it has riled the nationalists to such an extent that demonstrations aimed at getting ukraine pulled from eurovision were staged across the country on sunday . snub to former soviet master bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the square is in the song , the protests are n't russia , which has already made its feeling against verka known , is likely to become even more irate when verka belts out her apparently anti-russian lyrics in front of an international audience .
it seems that the chorus refrain of " russia goodbye " has been interpreted as a snub to ukraine ’ s former soviet master . the russians have also taken offense to the reference to a kiev square that was the focus of anti-russian protests during the 2004 orange revolution , despite the fact that no mention of the demonstrations which signaled ukraine ’ s westward shift is included in the song . should verka win a moral victory and actually perform the song on the show , it could prove quite an eventful night . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany swings around eurovision in surprising national final germany has never fully recovered from its 2005 eurovision debacle when it came last .

despite their well-publicized surveillance role , the new troops may soon find the taliban does not see a difference between combat and support . germany ’ s deployment of eight tornado jets , their crew and support personnel to afghanistan avoided a final spanner in the works on friday when the federal constitutional court refused to grant a request from the opposition left party for an injunction stopping the deployment . with the removal of this last hurdle , 200 troops from the bundeswehr ’ s jagel base begin their deployment to masir-i-sharif via sardinia and the united arab emirates on monday . from their new base in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , the tornados - which are requested by nato - will fly surveillance missions at an altitude of 3000 meters -lrb- 9842 feet -rrb- over the hindu kush , charged with photographing taliban positions in support of nato forces on the ground . at a sending-off ceremony on monday , german defense minister franz josef jung said the aim of the mission was to bring assistance not fear to the afghan people . " the reconnaissance gathered by our tornadoes will bring more stability and security to afghanistan , " jung said .
" their mission is to protect isaf troops , as well as civilian aid workers and the afghan population . " worries mount in germany about planes ' role but despite the german german government 's assurances that the mission is purely a support role and not a combat deployment , there are still concerns within the government and the military that the tornado mission , just as the bundeswehr ’ s reconstruction efforts on the ground , will become embroiled in the growing conflict as a resurgent taliban readies to launch a widely expected spring offensive . public opinion back home in germany is also showing signs of concern and deployment fatigue .
a recent poll by the tns institute commissioned by der spiegel news magazine found that 57 per cent of those surveyed wanted a complete withdrawal of german troops from afghanistan , while 36 per cent were in favor of continued engagement .
a meager four per cent backed increasing the german military presence . regardless of mission , germany still an enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tornados are fitted with special camera equipment after five years of conflict , afghanistan is now more dangerous for the nato contingent , not less so and germany ’ s troops - despite their reconstruction mandate - are increasingly in the firing line .
and with the deployment of the tornado jets and support personnel , germany is moving up the taliban ’ s list of targets . the bundeswehr ’ s approach to the general population and their mission has provided a relatively stable environment in the north .
however , several recent incidents have unsettled german officials .
in march , a german aid worker was ambushed and killed in northern afghanistan , and in late february a german woman and her son were kidnapped in iraq by a group who threatened to execute the pair if berlin did not withdraw its troops from afghanistan . quoted in an interview published by german magazine cicero last month , mullah obaidullah , a senior taliban official and deputy to the elusive taliban leader mullah omar , said that germany ’ s 3,000 troops stationed in kabul and the northern provinces will be attacked by a wave of taliban fighters , and that no one would be spared . " not the germans , not the british , not the canadians and certainly not the americans .
we kill them all , " obaidullah was quoted as saying .
“ some 6,000 young warriors will sacrifice themselves for allah in the struggle , " he added . surveillance planes a target like any other bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocket propelled grenades and missiles will prove dangerous the german tornados - six fully operational jets backed up by two reserve planes - could face attack from the taliban ’ s man-portable air defense systems , or manpads .
a ground-to-air stinger rocket , which can hit aircraft at a range of up to 4785 meters and at altitudes between 182 and 3810 meters , can be fired from the shoulder of a single taliban fighter , making surveillance runs over the hindi kush mountain range very hazardous . the situation on the ground for bundeswehr troops in afghanistan is also a cause for concern with soldiers complaining of a lack of support , inadequate equipment and diminishing supplies . the tornado crews may also be shocked to discover on their arrival in afghanistan that if any of them are shot down , the bundeswehr do not have the capacity to rescue their own pilots because they lack the necessary helicopters .
in an emergency , us , british or canadian troops would have to embark on a rescue mission . soldiers air grievances to spd 's beck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops are coping with increasingly difficult conditions such conditions were made aware to social democrat chairperson kurt beck at the weekend when he visited troops in the north of the country .
soldiers openly complained about the cramped conditions , rationing problems and the fact that a camp of 1600 troops had only four telephones between them .
one told beck that , “ if our motivation goes down the drain , then we have a real problem . ” beck points out that the mission is bringing german military capabilities to their limits . " i ’ m sure we can do more as far as reconstruction in afghanistan is concerned but i ’ m as much convinced that this mission is driving our military capacities to the brink of exhaustion , " beck said .
the spd leader has promised that he would pass on the grievances of the troops to the german government on his return . but with the tornado deployment likely to begin active service by the middle of april , an extra 200 troops to cater for and an expected increase in taliban attacks , germany ’ s troops in afghanistan do not have the luxury of waiting for the outcome of another extended debate in the bundestag about their mandate . despite governmental assurances of their role in the peace , germany ’ s troops know that they are in a war , regardless if they are firing bullets or not . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court rejects bid to stop afghanistan plane deployment germany 's top court friday rejected a bid by an opposition party to prevent the deployment of six tornado surveillance aircraft to help nato forces fighting the taliban in southern afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.04.2007 nationalists , russia find ukraine 's eurovision song quite a drag großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drag queen verka serduchka is causing more than her fair share of commotion ukraine 's eurovision song contest entry is causing friction at home and abroad .
verka serduchka is accused by nationalists of enforcing negative ukrainian stereotypes while the russians see her song as a political snub . the eurovision song contest will soon be upon us once again , giving fans and detractors alike another opportunity to watch the annual back scratching - and back-stabbing - which makes the event more than just a bunch of above-average karaoke singers trying to get the better of each other . for those not in the know , the annual contest , held since 1956 , pits active member countries of the european broadcasting union against one another .
each country submits a song to be performed on live television and then voters from the participating countries cast votes for the other countries ' songs .
it is seen by many as a festival of kitsch , adored or disdained for its campy , over-the-top presentation of usually forgettable three-minute songs . the contest is as much about allegiances as it is about competition .
it doesn ’ t matter if a particular song is terrible or not , if one country considers the other a friend , then it will get the vote regardless of its entry ’ s quality . while this low-level political bargaining has always been a part of eurovision , the light-hearted entertainment event has rarely been overtly subversive .
however , this year may be the first time that actual protests may stem from the presentation and lyrics of a particular contestant . that contestant is a ukrainian drag queen called verka serduchka .
a cult star in " her " native country , verka was the choice of the people by a massive majority in the competition to become ukraine ’ s entry with the song “ dancing . ” stereotype prompts demonstrations however , the first potentially political row revolving around the song has started at home with ukrainian nationalists up in arms over verka ’ s image . while they seem to accept the fact that a drag queen is representing the country , they have taken umbrage over verka ’ s portrayal of a stupid ukrainian villager , saying she could damage ukraine ’ s image abroad . it has riled the nationalists to such an extent that demonstrations aimed at getting ukraine pulled from eurovision were staged across the country on sunday . snub to former soviet master bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the square is in the song , the protests are n't russia , which has already made its feeling against verka known , is likely to become even more irate when verka belts out her apparently anti-russian lyrics in front of an international audience .
it seems that the chorus refrain of " russia goodbye " has been interpreted as a snub to ukraine ’ s former soviet master . the russians have also taken offense to the reference to a kiev square that was the focus of anti-russian protests during the 2004 orange revolution , despite the fact that no mention of the demonstrations which signaled ukraine ’ s westward shift is included in the song . should verka win a moral victory and actually perform the song on the show , it could prove quite an eventful night . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany swings around eurovision in surprising national final germany has never fully recovered from its 2005 eurovision debacle when it came last .

despite their well-publicized surveillance role , the new troops may soon find the taliban does not see a difference between combat and support . germany ’ s deployment of eight tornado jets , their crew and support personnel to afghanistan avoided a final spanner in the works on friday when the federal constitutional court refused to grant a request from the opposition left party for an injunction stopping the deployment . with the removal of this last hurdle , 200 troops from the bundeswehr ’ s jagel base begin their deployment to masir-i-sharif via sardinia and the united arab emirates on monday . from their new base in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , the tornados - which are requested by nato - will fly surveillance missions at an altitude of 3000 meters -lrb- 9842 feet -rrb- over the hindu kush , charged with photographing taliban positions in support of nato forces on the ground . at a sending-off ceremony on monday , german defense minister franz josef jung said the aim of the mission was to bring assistance not fear to the afghan people . " the reconnaissance gathered by our tornadoes will bring more stability and security to afghanistan , " jung said .
" their mission is to protect isaf troops , as well as civilian aid workers and the afghan population . " worries mount in germany about planes ' role but despite the german german government 's assurances that the mission is purely a support role and not a combat deployment , there are still concerns within the government and the military that the tornado mission , just as the bundeswehr ’ s reconstruction efforts on the ground , will become embroiled in the growing conflict as a resurgent taliban readies to launch a widely expected spring offensive . public opinion back home in germany is also showing signs of concern and deployment fatigue .
a recent poll by the tns institute commissioned by der spiegel news magazine found that 57 per cent of those surveyed wanted a complete withdrawal of german troops from afghanistan , while 36 per cent were in favor of continued engagement .
a meager four per cent backed increasing the german military presence . regardless of mission , germany still an enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tornados are fitted with special camera equipment after five years of conflict , afghanistan is now more dangerous for the nato contingent , not less so and germany ’ s troops - despite their reconstruction mandate - are increasingly in the firing line .
and with the deployment of the tornado jets and support personnel , germany is moving up the taliban ’ s list of targets . the bundeswehr ’ s approach to the general population and their mission has provided a relatively stable environment in the north .
however , several recent incidents have unsettled german officials .
in march , a german aid worker was ambushed and killed in northern afghanistan , and in late february a german woman and her son were kidnapped in iraq by a group who threatened to execute the pair if berlin did not withdraw its troops from afghanistan . quoted in an interview published by german magazine cicero last month , mullah obaidullah , a senior taliban official and deputy to the elusive taliban leader mullah omar , said that germany ’ s 3,000 troops stationed in kabul and the northern provinces will be attacked by a wave of taliban fighters , and that no one would be spared .

despite their well-publicized surveillance role , the new troops may soon find the taliban does not see a difference between combat and support . germany ’ s deployment of eight tornado jets , their crew and support personnel to afghanistan avoided a final spanner in the works on friday when the federal constitutional court refused to grant a request from the opposition left party for an injunction stopping the deployment . with the removal of this last hurdle , 200 troops from the bundeswehr ’ s jagel base begin their deployment to masir-i-sharif via sardinia and the united arab emirates on monday . from their new base in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , the tornados - which are requested by nato - will fly surveillance missions at an altitude of 3000 meters -lrb- 9842 feet -rrb- over the hindu kush , charged with photographing taliban positions in support of nato forces on the ground . at a sending-off ceremony on monday , german defense minister franz josef jung said the aim of the mission was to bring assistance not fear to the afghan people . " the reconnaissance gathered by our tornadoes will bring more stability and security to afghanistan , " jung said .
" their mission is to protect isaf troops , as well as civilian aid workers and the afghan population . " worries mount in germany about planes ' role but despite the german german government 's assurances that the mission is purely a support role and not a combat deployment , there are still concerns within the government and the military that the tornado mission , just as the bundeswehr ’ s reconstruction efforts on the ground , will become embroiled in the growing conflict as a resurgent taliban readies to launch a widely expected spring offensive . public opinion back home in germany is also showing signs of concern and deployment fatigue .
a recent poll by the tns institute commissioned by der spiegel news magazine found that 57 per cent of those surveyed wanted a complete withdrawal of german troops from afghanistan , while 36 per cent were in favor of continued engagement .
a meager four per cent backed increasing the german military presence . regardless of mission , germany still an enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tornados are fitted with special camera equipment after five years of conflict , afghanistan is now more dangerous for the nato contingent , not less so and germany ’ s troops - despite their reconstruction mandate - are increasingly in the firing line .
and with the deployment of the tornado jets and support personnel , germany is moving up the taliban ’ s list of targets . the bundeswehr ’ s approach to the general population and their mission has provided a relatively stable environment in the north .
however , several recent incidents have unsettled german officials .
in march , a german aid worker was ambushed and killed in northern afghanistan , and in late february a german woman and her son were kidnapped in iraq by a group who threatened to execute the pair if berlin did not withdraw its troops from afghanistan . quoted in an interview published by german magazine cicero last month , mullah obaidullah , a senior taliban official and deputy to the elusive taliban leader mullah omar , said that germany ’ s 3,000 troops stationed in kabul and the northern provinces will be attacked by a wave of taliban fighters , and that no one would be spared . " not the germans , not the british , not the canadians and certainly not the americans .
we kill them all , " obaidullah was quoted as saying .
“ some 6,000 young warriors will sacrifice themselves for allah in the struggle , " he added . surveillance planes a target like any other bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocket propelled grenades and missiles will prove dangerous the german tornados - six fully operational jets backed up by two reserve planes - could face attack from the taliban ’ s man-portable air defense systems , or manpads .

unlike many other shows of its kind , it does not deal exclusively with state repression , but focuses on everyday life . to museum director hans ottomeyer , the new exhibition in the german historical museum plugs an important gap in the way that east germany has been presented up to now .
in part , it is a response to the lack of a museum devoted to the history of the former communist regime . " there is no museum of east german history .
on the one hand , there are calls for such a museum to be set up .
on the other hand , it is also vehemently rejected , " ottomeyer said .
" until the permanent exhibition in the german historical museum , no one had begun to tackle this . " last year , peter kenzelmann , a political scientist from southwestern germany , set up a private museum in the german capital to look at this more personal part of east germany , which had been mostly neglected .
but he was accused of failing to make the brutality of the regime clear in his permanent display . everyday lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a children 's tv puppet , the sandman , was a beloved feature of east german life the aim of the exhibition in the german historical museum , according to ottomeyer , is to explore the interface between people 's everyday lives and the influence of the east german state . " the gdr had 17 million inhabitants on average .
that amounted to 17 million daily lives , " said exhibition organizer jörn schütrumpf . " the question we asked ourselves was what did these daily lives - or at least the majority of them - have in common ? " for him , it was important to show that life in east germany was not only affected by a massive concrete wall that divided the city , but also a second wall in the form of the state that tried to influence the lives of its citizens . " we kept on being asked how we would present the stasi , the east german secret police .
that is , of course , a theme without which you ca n't define the regime in the gdr , " said schütrumpf . diverse exhibits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files from the east german secret police headquarters are among the displays alongside such exhibits as a filing card cabinet from the headquarters of the east german secret police , there are also more banal articles , such as a school satchel made out of cardboard . all 550 items come from the museum 's own archive and were donated by members of the public after the collapse of the communist regime . " the public was asked , on television and in the newspapers , to bring to the museum what they saw as the most important objects relating to gdr history , " said curator regine falkenberg .
" you can also find little things such as meat stock paste , tins , tvs , darning utensils and vitamin preparations . " everyday resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has seen a wave of nostalgia for everyday east german products no longer available the show covers the period from 1956 up to the end of the communist regime .
but its 550 exhibits are not arranged chronologically .
instead , it is grouped according to thematic blocs such as work , the collective and the family . the exhibition , which runs until july 29 , also shows how ordinary east german citizens sought to resist the demands of the state .
that was not an easy task , since the stasi secret police had some 100,000 regular employees in addition to around 500,000 to two million collaborators in a country whose 1990 population was just over 16 million . the activities of the secret police were obviously no laughing matter for those who ended up in its custody .
but humor was one weapon that ordinary citizens used to deal with so-called " real existing socialism " and there is a special section especially devoted to jokes . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum takes controversial look at mundane east germany a new , private berlin museum focuses on everyday life in east germany .

verka serduchka is accused by nationalists of enforcing negative ukrainian stereotypes while the russians see her song as a political snub . the eurovision song contest will soon be upon us once again , giving fans and detractors alike another opportunity to watch the annual back scratching - and back-stabbing - which makes the event more than just a bunch of above-average karaoke singers trying to get the better of each other . for those not in the know , the annual contest , held since 1956 , pits active member countries of the european broadcasting union against one another .
each country submits a song to be performed on live television and then voters from the participating countries cast votes for the other countries ' songs .
it is seen by many as a festival of kitsch , adored or disdained for its campy , over-the-top presentation of usually forgettable three-minute songs . the contest is as much about allegiances as it is about competition .
it doesn ’ t matter if a particular song is terrible or not , if one country considers the other a friend , then it will get the vote regardless of its entry ’ s quality . while this low-level political bargaining has always been a part of eurovision , the light-hearted entertainment event has rarely been overtly subversive .
however , this year may be the first time that actual protests may stem from the presentation and lyrics of a particular contestant . that contestant is a ukrainian drag queen called verka serduchka .
a cult star in " her " native country , verka was the choice of the people by a massive majority in the competition to become ukraine ’ s entry with the song “ dancing . ” stereotype prompts demonstrations however , the first potentially political row revolving around the song has started at home with ukrainian nationalists up in arms over verka ’ s image . while they seem to accept the fact that a drag queen is representing the country , they have taken umbrage over verka ’ s portrayal of a stupid ukrainian villager , saying she could damage ukraine ’ s image abroad . it has riled the nationalists to such an extent that demonstrations aimed at getting ukraine pulled from eurovision were staged across the country on sunday . snub to former soviet master bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the square is in the song , the protests are n't russia , which has already made its feeling against verka known , is likely to become even more irate when verka belts out her apparently anti-russian lyrics in front of an international audience .
it seems that the chorus refrain of " russia goodbye " has been interpreted as a snub to ukraine ’ s former soviet master . the russians have also taken offense to the reference to a kiev square that was the focus of anti-russian protests during the 2004 orange revolution , despite the fact that no mention of the demonstrations which signaled ukraine ’ s westward shift is included in the song . should verka win a moral victory and actually perform the song on the show , it could prove quite an eventful night . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany swings around eurovision in surprising national final germany has never fully recovered from its 2005 eurovision debacle when it came last .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.04.2007 nationalists , russia find ukraine 's eurovision song quite a drag großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drag queen verka serduchka is causing more than her fair share of commotion ukraine 's eurovision song contest entry is causing friction at home and abroad .
verka serduchka is accused by nationalists of enforcing negative ukrainian stereotypes while the russians see her song as a political snub . the eurovision song contest will soon be upon us once again , giving fans and detractors alike another opportunity to watch the annual back scratching - and back-stabbing - which makes the event more than just a bunch of above-average karaoke singers trying to get the better of each other . for those not in the know , the annual contest , held since 1956 , pits active member countries of the european broadcasting union against one another .
each country submits a song to be performed on live television and then voters from the participating countries cast votes for the other countries ' songs .
it is seen by many as a festival of kitsch , adored or disdained for its campy , over-the-top presentation of usually forgettable three-minute songs . the contest is as much about allegiances as it is about competition .
it doesn ’ t matter if a particular song is terrible or not , if one country considers the other a friend , then it will get the vote regardless of its entry ’ s quality . while this low-level political bargaining has always been a part of eurovision , the light-hearted entertainment event has rarely been overtly subversive .
however , this year may be the first time that actual protests may stem from the presentation and lyrics of a particular contestant . that contestant is a ukrainian drag queen called verka serduchka .
a cult star in " her " native country , verka was the choice of the people by a massive majority in the competition to become ukraine ’ s entry with the song “ dancing . ” stereotype prompts demonstrations however , the first potentially political row revolving around the song has started at home with ukrainian nationalists up in arms over verka ’ s image . while they seem to accept the fact that a drag queen is representing the country , they have taken umbrage over verka ’ s portrayal of a stupid ukrainian villager , saying she could damage ukraine ’ s image abroad . it has riled the nationalists to such an extent that demonstrations aimed at getting ukraine pulled from eurovision were staged across the country on sunday . snub to former soviet master bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the square is in the song , the protests are n't russia , which has already made its feeling against verka known , is likely to become even more irate when verka belts out her apparently anti-russian lyrics in front of an international audience .
it seems that the chorus refrain of " russia goodbye " has been interpreted as a snub to ukraine ’ s former soviet master . the russians have also taken offense to the reference to a kiev square that was the focus of anti-russian protests during the 2004 orange revolution , despite the fact that no mention of the demonstrations which signaled ukraine ’ s westward shift is included in the song . should verka win a moral victory and actually perform the song on the show , it could prove quite an eventful night . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany swings around eurovision in surprising national final germany has never fully recovered from its 2005 eurovision debacle when it came last .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.04.2007 new exhibition looks at daily life in east germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit focuses on the daily lives of everyday people a new exhibition on east germany has just opened in berlin 's german historical museum .
unlike many other shows of its kind , it does not deal exclusively with state repression , but focuses on everyday life . to museum director hans ottomeyer , the new exhibition in the german historical museum plugs an important gap in the way that east germany has been presented up to now .
in part , it is a response to the lack of a museum devoted to the history of the former communist regime . " there is no museum of east german history .
on the one hand , there are calls for such a museum to be set up .
on the other hand , it is also vehemently rejected , " ottomeyer said .
" until the permanent exhibition in the german historical museum , no one had begun to tackle this . " last year , peter kenzelmann , a political scientist from southwestern germany , set up a private museum in the german capital to look at this more personal part of east germany , which had been mostly neglected .
but he was accused of failing to make the brutality of the regime clear in his permanent display . everyday lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a children 's tv puppet , the sandman , was a beloved feature of east german life the aim of the exhibition in the german historical museum , according to ottomeyer , is to explore the interface between people 's everyday lives and the influence of the east german state . " the gdr had 17 million inhabitants on average .
that amounted to 17 million daily lives , " said exhibition organizer jörn schütrumpf . " the question we asked ourselves was what did these daily lives - or at least the majority of them - have in common ? " for him , it was important to show that life in east germany was not only affected by a massive concrete wall that divided the city , but also a second wall in the form of the state that tried to influence the lives of its citizens . " we kept on being asked how we would present the stasi , the east german secret police .
that is , of course , a theme without which you ca n't define the regime in the gdr , " said schütrumpf . diverse exhibits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files from the east german secret police headquarters are among the displays alongside such exhibits as a filing card cabinet from the headquarters of the east german secret police , there are also more banal articles , such as a school satchel made out of cardboard . all 550 items come from the museum 's own archive and were donated by members of the public after the collapse of the communist regime . " the public was asked , on television and in the newspapers , to bring to the museum what they saw as the most important objects relating to gdr history , " said curator regine falkenberg .
" you can also find little things such as meat stock paste , tins , tvs , darning utensils and vitamin preparations . " everyday resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has seen a wave of nostalgia for everyday east german products no longer available the show covers the period from 1956 up to the end of the communist regime .
but its 550 exhibits are not arranged chronologically .
instead , it is grouped according to thematic blocs such as work , the collective and the family . the exhibition , which runs until july 29 , also shows how ordinary east german citizens sought to resist the demands of the state .
that was not an easy task , since the stasi secret police had some 100,000 regular employees in addition to around 500,000 to two million collaborators in a country whose 1990 population was just over 16 million . the activities of the secret police were obviously no laughing matter for those who ended up in its custody .
but humor was one weapon that ordinary citizens used to deal with so-called " real existing socialism " and there is a special section especially devoted to jokes . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum takes controversial look at mundane east germany a new , private berlin museum focuses on everyday life in east germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.04.2007 nationalists , russia find ukraine 's eurovision song quite a drag großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drag queen verka serduchka is causing more than her fair share of commotion ukraine 's eurovision song contest entry is causing friction at home and abroad .
verka serduchka is accused by nationalists of enforcing negative ukrainian stereotypes while the russians see her song as a political snub . the eurovision song contest will soon be upon us once again , giving fans and detractors alike another opportunity to watch the annual back scratching - and back-stabbing - which makes the event more than just a bunch of above-average karaoke singers trying to get the better of each other . for those not in the know , the annual contest , held since 1956 , pits active member countries of the european broadcasting union against one another .
each country submits a song to be performed on live television and then voters from the participating countries cast votes for the other countries ' songs .
it is seen by many as a festival of kitsch , adored or disdained for its campy , over-the-top presentation of usually forgettable three-minute songs . the contest is as much about allegiances as it is about competition .
it doesn ’ t matter if a particular song is terrible or not , if one country considers the other a friend , then it will get the vote regardless of its entry ’ s quality . while this low-level political bargaining has always been a part of eurovision , the light-hearted entertainment event has rarely been overtly subversive .
however , this year may be the first time that actual protests may stem from the presentation and lyrics of a particular contestant . that contestant is a ukrainian drag queen called verka serduchka .
a cult star in " her " native country , verka was the choice of the people by a massive majority in the competition to become ukraine ’ s entry with the song “ dancing . ” stereotype prompts demonstrations however , the first potentially political row revolving around the song has started at home with ukrainian nationalists up in arms over verka ’ s image . while they seem to accept the fact that a drag queen is representing the country , they have taken umbrage over verka ’ s portrayal of a stupid ukrainian villager , saying she could damage ukraine ’ s image abroad . it has riled the nationalists to such an extent that demonstrations aimed at getting ukraine pulled from eurovision were staged across the country on sunday . snub to former soviet master bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the square is in the song , the protests are n't russia , which has already made its feeling against verka known , is likely to become even more irate when verka belts out her apparently anti-russian lyrics in front of an international audience .
it seems that the chorus refrain of " russia goodbye " has been interpreted as a snub to ukraine ’ s former soviet master . the russians have also taken offense to the reference to a kiev square that was the focus of anti-russian protests during the 2004 orange revolution , despite the fact that no mention of the demonstrations which signaled ukraine ’ s westward shift is included in the song . should verka win a moral victory and actually perform the song on the show , it could prove quite an eventful night . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany swings around eurovision in surprising national final germany has never fully recovered from its 2005 eurovision debacle when it came last .

it is another step in yet another scandal to engulf the german engineering giant .
this latest move indicates momentum continues to gather pace and is another blow to the company 's weakened executives . the charge is that siemens illegally financed aub , a small union which is considered more employer friendly .
siemens allegedly hoped aub would act as a counterweight to ig metall , which has said that aub sometimes blocked its positions in labor talks . " ig metall has filed a complaint over possible favoritism " of the independent organization aub and possible attempts to influence voting in work council elections within the siemens group , the union said in a statement . " we have the suspicion and indications that aub was financed by siemens in order to build it up into a sort of counter union to ig metall , " union chief jürgen peters said . ig metall may possibly have been disadvantaged in its work and in works council elections , he alleged . hoping for transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall leader jürgen peters " we hope the lawsuit will bring about transparency , " peters said . his deputy , berthold huber , said there may have been systematic favoritism to aub .

despite their well-publicized surveillance role , the new troops may soon find the taliban does not see a difference between combat and support . germany ’ s deployment of eight tornado jets , their crew and support personnel to afghanistan avoided a final spanner in the works on friday when the federal constitutional court refused to grant a request from the opposition left party for an injunction stopping the deployment . with the removal of this last hurdle , 200 troops from the bundeswehr ’ s jagel base begin their deployment to masir-i-sharif via sardinia and the united arab emirates on monday . from their new base in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , the tornados - which are requested by nato - will fly surveillance missions at an altitude of 3000 meters -lrb- 9842 feet -rrb- over the hindu kush , charged with photographing taliban positions in support of nato forces on the ground . at a sending-off ceremony on monday , german defense minister franz josef jung said the aim of the mission was to bring assistance not fear to the afghan people . " the reconnaissance gathered by our tornadoes will bring more stability and security to afghanistan , " jung said .
" their mission is to protect isaf troops , as well as civilian aid workers and the afghan population . " worries mount in germany about planes ' role but despite the german german government 's assurances that the mission is purely a support role and not a combat deployment , there are still concerns within the government and the military that the tornado mission , just as the bundeswehr ’ s reconstruction efforts on the ground , will become embroiled in the growing conflict as a resurgent taliban readies to launch a widely expected spring offensive . public opinion back home in germany is also showing signs of concern and deployment fatigue .
a recent poll by the tns institute commissioned by der spiegel news magazine found that 57 per cent of those surveyed wanted a complete withdrawal of german troops from afghanistan , while 36 per cent were in favor of continued engagement .

however , several recent incidents have unsettled german officials .
in march , a german aid worker was ambushed and killed in northern afghanistan , and in late february a german woman and her son were kidnapped in iraq by a group who threatened to execute the pair if berlin did not withdraw its troops from afghanistan . quoted in an interview published by german magazine cicero last month , mullah obaidullah , a senior taliban official and deputy to the elusive taliban leader mullah omar , said that germany ’ s 3,000 troops stationed in kabul and the northern provinces will be attacked by a wave of taliban fighters , and that no one would be spared . " not the germans , not the british , not the canadians and certainly not the americans .

in an emergency , us , british or canadian troops would have to embark on a rescue mission . soldiers air grievances to spd 's beck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops are coping with increasingly difficult conditions such conditions were made aware to social democrat chairperson kurt beck at the weekend when he visited troops in the north of the country .
soldiers openly complained about the cramped conditions , rationing problems and the fact that a camp of 1600 troops had only four telephones between them .

" i ’ m sure we can do more as far as reconstruction in afghanistan is concerned but i ’ m as much convinced that this mission is driving our military capacities to the brink of exhaustion , " beck said .

soldiers openly complained about the cramped conditions , rationing problems and the fact that a camp of 1600 troops had only four telephones between them .
one told beck that , “ if our motivation goes down the drain , then we have a real problem . ” beck points out that the mission is bringing german military capabilities to their limits . " i ’ m sure we can do more as far as reconstruction in afghanistan is concerned but i ’ m as much convinced that this mission is driving our military capacities to the brink of exhaustion , " beck said .
the spd leader has promised that he would pass on the grievances of the troops to the german government on his return . but with the tornado deployment likely to begin active service by the middle of april , an extra 200 troops to cater for and an expected increase in taliban attacks , germany ’ s troops in afghanistan do not have the luxury of waiting for the outcome of another extended debate in the bundestag about their mandate . despite governmental assurances of their role in the peace , germany ’ s troops know that they are in a war , regardless if they are firing bullets or not . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court rejects bid to stop afghanistan plane deployment germany 's top court friday rejected a bid by an opposition party to prevent the deployment of six tornado surveillance aircraft to help nato forces fighting the taliban in southern afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.04.2007 nationalists , russia find ukraine 's eurovision song quite a drag großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drag queen verka serduchka is causing more than her fair share of commotion ukraine 's eurovision song contest entry is causing friction at home and abroad .
verka serduchka is accused by nationalists of enforcing negative ukrainian stereotypes while the russians see her song as a political snub . the eurovision song contest will soon be upon us once again , giving fans and detractors alike another opportunity to watch the annual back scratching - and back-stabbing - which makes the event more than just a bunch of above-average karaoke singers trying to get the better of each other . for those not in the know , the annual contest , held since 1956 , pits active member countries of the european broadcasting union against one another .
each country submits a song to be performed on live television and then voters from the participating countries cast votes for the other countries ' songs .
it is seen by many as a festival of kitsch , adored or disdained for its campy , over-the-top presentation of usually forgettable three-minute songs . the contest is as much about allegiances as it is about competition .
it doesn ’ t matter if a particular song is terrible or not , if one country considers the other a friend , then it will get the vote regardless of its entry ’ s quality . while this low-level political bargaining has always been a part of eurovision , the light-hearted entertainment event has rarely been overtly subversive .
however , this year may be the first time that actual protests may stem from the presentation and lyrics of a particular contestant . that contestant is a ukrainian drag queen called verka serduchka .
a cult star in " her " native country , verka was the choice of the people by a massive majority in the competition to become ukraine ’ s entry with the song “ dancing . ” stereotype prompts demonstrations however , the first potentially political row revolving around the song has started at home with ukrainian nationalists up in arms over verka ’ s image . while they seem to accept the fact that a drag queen is representing the country , they have taken umbrage over verka ’ s portrayal of a stupid ukrainian villager , saying she could damage ukraine ’ s image abroad . it has riled the nationalists to such an extent that demonstrations aimed at getting ukraine pulled from eurovision were staged across the country on sunday . snub to former soviet master bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the square is in the song , the protests are n't russia , which has already made its feeling against verka known , is likely to become even more irate when verka belts out her apparently anti-russian lyrics in front of an international audience .
it seems that the chorus refrain of " russia goodbye " has been interpreted as a snub to ukraine ’ s former soviet master . the russians have also taken offense to the reference to a kiev square that was the focus of anti-russian protests during the 2004 orange revolution , despite the fact that no mention of the demonstrations which signaled ukraine ’ s westward shift is included in the song . should verka win a moral victory and actually perform the song on the show , it could prove quite an eventful night . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany swings around eurovision in surprising national final germany has never fully recovered from its 2005 eurovision debacle when it came last .

unlike many other shows of its kind , it does not deal exclusively with state repression , but focuses on everyday life . to museum director hans ottomeyer , the new exhibition in the german historical museum plugs an important gap in the way that east germany has been presented up to now .
in part , it is a response to the lack of a museum devoted to the history of the former communist regime . " there is no museum of east german history .
on the one hand , there are calls for such a museum to be set up .
on the other hand , it is also vehemently rejected , " ottomeyer said .
" until the permanent exhibition in the german historical museum , no one had begun to tackle this . " last year , peter kenzelmann , a political scientist from southwestern germany , set up a private museum in the german capital to look at this more personal part of east germany , which had been mostly neglected .

" the gdr had 17 million inhabitants on average .
that amounted to 17 million daily lives , " said exhibition organizer jörn schütrumpf . " the question we asked ourselves was what did these daily lives - or at least the majority of them - have in common ? " for him , it was important to show that life in east germany was not only affected by a massive concrete wall that divided the city , but also a second wall in the form of the state that tried to influence the lives of its citizens . " we kept on being asked how we would present the stasi , the east german secret police .

" the public was asked , on television and in the newspapers , to bring to the museum what they saw as the most important objects relating to gdr history , " said curator regine falkenberg .

" everyday resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has seen a wave of nostalgia for everyday east german products no longer available the show covers the period from 1956 up to the end of the communist regime .
but its 550 exhibits are not arranged chronologically .
instead , it is grouped according to thematic blocs such as work , the collective and the family . the exhibition , which runs until july 29 , also shows how ordinary east german citizens sought to resist the demands of the state .
that was not an easy task , since the stasi secret police had some 100,000 regular employees in addition to around 500,000 to two million collaborators in a country whose 1990 population was just over 16 million . the activities of the secret police were obviously no laughing matter for those who ended up in its custody .

unlike many other shows of its kind , it does not deal exclusively with state repression , but focuses on everyday life . to museum director hans ottomeyer , the new exhibition in the german historical museum plugs an important gap in the way that east germany has been presented up to now .
in part , it is a response to the lack of a museum devoted to the history of the former communist regime . " there is no museum of east german history .
on the one hand , there are calls for such a museum to be set up .
on the other hand , it is also vehemently rejected , " ottomeyer said .
" until the permanent exhibition in the german historical museum , no one had begun to tackle this . " last year , peter kenzelmann , a political scientist from southwestern germany , set up a private museum in the german capital to look at this more personal part of east germany , which had been mostly neglected .
but he was accused of failing to make the brutality of the regime clear in his permanent display . everyday lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a children 's tv puppet , the sandman , was a beloved feature of east german life the aim of the exhibition in the german historical museum , according to ottomeyer , is to explore the interface between people 's everyday lives and the influence of the east german state . " the gdr had 17 million inhabitants on average .
that amounted to 17 million daily lives , " said exhibition organizer jörn schütrumpf . " the question we asked ourselves was what did these daily lives - or at least the majority of them - have in common ? " for him , it was important to show that life in east germany was not only affected by a massive concrete wall that divided the city , but also a second wall in the form of the state that tried to influence the lives of its citizens . " we kept on being asked how we would present the stasi , the east german secret police .

despite their well-publicized surveillance role , the new troops may soon find the taliban does not see a difference between combat and support . germany ’ s deployment of eight tornado jets , their crew and support personnel to afghanistan avoided a final spanner in the works on friday when the federal constitutional court refused to grant a request from the opposition left party for an injunction stopping the deployment . with the removal of this last hurdle , 200 troops from the bundeswehr ’ s jagel base begin their deployment to masir-i-sharif via sardinia and the united arab emirates on monday . from their new base in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , the tornados - which are requested by nato - will fly surveillance missions at an altitude of 3000 meters -lrb- 9842 feet -rrb- over the hindu kush , charged with photographing taliban positions in support of nato forces on the ground . at a sending-off ceremony on monday , german defense minister franz josef jung said the aim of the mission was to bring assistance not fear to the afghan people . " the reconnaissance gathered by our tornadoes will bring more stability and security to afghanistan , " jung said .
" their mission is to protect isaf troops , as well as civilian aid workers and the afghan population . " worries mount in germany about planes ' role but despite the german german government 's assurances that the mission is purely a support role and not a combat deployment , there are still concerns within the government and the military that the tornado mission , just as the bundeswehr ’ s reconstruction efforts on the ground , will become embroiled in the growing conflict as a resurgent taliban readies to launch a widely expected spring offensive . public opinion back home in germany is also showing signs of concern and deployment fatigue .
a recent poll by the tns institute commissioned by der spiegel news magazine found that 57 per cent of those surveyed wanted a complete withdrawal of german troops from afghanistan , while 36 per cent were in favor of continued engagement .
a meager four per cent backed increasing the german military presence . regardless of mission , germany still an enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tornados are fitted with special camera equipment after five years of conflict , afghanistan is now more dangerous for the nato contingent , not less so and germany ’ s troops - despite their reconstruction mandate - are increasingly in the firing line .
and with the deployment of the tornado jets and support personnel , germany is moving up the taliban ’ s list of targets . the bundeswehr ’ s approach to the general population and their mission has provided a relatively stable environment in the north .
however , several recent incidents have unsettled german officials .
in march , a german aid worker was ambushed and killed in northern afghanistan , and in late february a german woman and her son were kidnapped in iraq by a group who threatened to execute the pair if berlin did not withdraw its troops from afghanistan . quoted in an interview published by german magazine cicero last month , mullah obaidullah , a senior taliban official and deputy to the elusive taliban leader mullah omar , said that germany ’ s 3,000 troops stationed in kabul and the northern provinces will be attacked by a wave of taliban fighters , and that no one would be spared . " not the germans , not the british , not the canadians and certainly not the americans .
we kill them all , " obaidullah was quoted as saying .
“ some 6,000 young warriors will sacrifice themselves for allah in the struggle , " he added . surveillance planes a target like any other bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocket propelled grenades and missiles will prove dangerous the german tornados - six fully operational jets backed up by two reserve planes - could face attack from the taliban ’ s man-portable air defense systems , or manpads .
a ground-to-air stinger rocket , which can hit aircraft at a range of up to 4785 meters and at altitudes between 182 and 3810 meters , can be fired from the shoulder of a single taliban fighter , making surveillance runs over the hindi kush mountain range very hazardous . the situation on the ground for bundeswehr troops in afghanistan is also a cause for concern with soldiers complaining of a lack of support , inadequate equipment and diminishing supplies . the tornado crews may also be shocked to discover on their arrival in afghanistan that if any of them are shot down , the bundeswehr do not have the capacity to rescue their own pilots because they lack the necessary helicopters .
in an emergency , us , british or canadian troops would have to embark on a rescue mission . soldiers air grievances to spd 's beck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops are coping with increasingly difficult conditions such conditions were made aware to social democrat chairperson kurt beck at the weekend when he visited troops in the north of the country .
soldiers openly complained about the cramped conditions , rationing problems and the fact that a camp of 1600 troops had only four telephones between them .
one told beck that , “ if our motivation goes down the drain , then we have a real problem . ” beck points out that the mission is bringing german military capabilities to their limits . " i ’ m sure we can do more as far as reconstruction in afghanistan is concerned but i ’ m as much convinced that this mission is driving our military capacities to the brink of exhaustion , " beck said .
the spd leader has promised that he would pass on the grievances of the troops to the german government on his return . but with the tornado deployment likely to begin active service by the middle of april , an extra 200 troops to cater for and an expected increase in taliban attacks , germany ’ s troops in afghanistan do not have the luxury of waiting for the outcome of another extended debate in the bundestag about their mandate . despite governmental assurances of their role in the peace , germany ’ s troops know that they are in a war , regardless if they are firing bullets or not . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court rejects bid to stop afghanistan plane deployment germany 's top court friday rejected a bid by an opposition party to prevent the deployment of six tornado surveillance aircraft to help nato forces fighting the taliban in southern afghanistan .

verka serduchka is accused by nationalists of enforcing negative ukrainian stereotypes while the russians see her song as a political snub . the eurovision song contest will soon be upon us once again , giving fans and detractors alike another opportunity to watch the annual back scratching - and back-stabbing - which makes the event more than just a bunch of above-average karaoke singers trying to get the better of each other . for those not in the know , the annual contest , held since 1956 , pits active member countries of the european broadcasting union against one another .
each country submits a song to be performed on live television and then voters from the participating countries cast votes for the other countries ' songs .
it is seen by many as a festival of kitsch , adored or disdained for its campy , over-the-top presentation of usually forgettable three-minute songs . the contest is as much about allegiances as it is about competition .
it doesn ’ t matter if a particular song is terrible or not , if one country considers the other a friend , then it will get the vote regardless of its entry ’ s quality . while this low-level political bargaining has always been a part of eurovision , the light-hearted entertainment event has rarely been overtly subversive .
however , this year may be the first time that actual protests may stem from the presentation and lyrics of a particular contestant . that contestant is a ukrainian drag queen called verka serduchka .
a cult star in " her " native country , verka was the choice of the people by a massive majority in the competition to become ukraine ’ s entry with the song “ dancing . ” stereotype prompts demonstrations however , the first potentially political row revolving around the song has started at home with ukrainian nationalists up in arms over verka ’ s image . while they seem to accept the fact that a drag queen is representing the country , they have taken umbrage over verka ’ s portrayal of a stupid ukrainian villager , saying she could damage ukraine ’ s image abroad . it has riled the nationalists to such an extent that demonstrations aimed at getting ukraine pulled from eurovision were staged across the country on sunday . snub to former soviet master bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the square is in the song , the protests are n't russia , which has already made its feeling against verka known , is likely to become even more irate when verka belts out her apparently anti-russian lyrics in front of an international audience .
it seems that the chorus refrain of " russia goodbye " has been interpreted as a snub to ukraine ’ s former soviet master . the russians have also taken offense to the reference to a kiev square that was the focus of anti-russian protests during the 2004 orange revolution , despite the fact that no mention of the demonstrations which signaled ukraine ’ s westward shift is included in the song . should verka win a moral victory and actually perform the song on the show , it could prove quite an eventful night . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany swings around eurovision in surprising national final germany has never fully recovered from its 2005 eurovision debacle when it came last .

despite their well-publicized surveillance role , the new troops may soon find the taliban does not see a difference between combat and support . germany ’ s deployment of eight tornado jets , their crew and support personnel to afghanistan avoided a final spanner in the works on friday when the federal constitutional court refused to grant a request from the opposition left party for an injunction stopping the deployment . with the removal of this last hurdle , 200 troops from the bundeswehr ’ s jagel base begin their deployment to masir-i-sharif via sardinia and the united arab emirates on monday . from their new base in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , the tornados - which are requested by nato - will fly surveillance missions at an altitude of 3000 meters -lrb- 9842 feet -rrb- over the hindu kush , charged with photographing taliban positions in support of nato forces on the ground . at a sending-off ceremony on monday , german defense minister franz josef jung said the aim of the mission was to bring assistance not fear to the afghan people . " the reconnaissance gathered by our tornadoes will bring more stability and security to afghanistan , " jung said .
" their mission is to protect isaf troops , as well as civilian aid workers and the afghan population . " worries mount in germany about planes ' role but despite the german german government 's assurances that the mission is purely a support role and not a combat deployment , there are still concerns within the government and the military that the tornado mission , just as the bundeswehr ’ s reconstruction efforts on the ground , will become embroiled in the growing conflict as a resurgent taliban readies to launch a widely expected spring offensive . public opinion back home in germany is also showing signs of concern and deployment fatigue .
a recent poll by the tns institute commissioned by der spiegel news magazine found that 57 per cent of those surveyed wanted a complete withdrawal of german troops from afghanistan , while 36 per cent were in favor of continued engagement .
a meager four per cent backed increasing the german military presence . regardless of mission , germany still an enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tornados are fitted with special camera equipment after five years of conflict , afghanistan is now more dangerous for the nato contingent , not less so and germany ’ s troops - despite their reconstruction mandate - are increasingly in the firing line .
and with the deployment of the tornado jets and support personnel , germany is moving up the taliban ’ s list of targets . the bundeswehr ’ s approach to the general population and their mission has provided a relatively stable environment in the north .
however , several recent incidents have unsettled german officials .
in march , a german aid worker was ambushed and killed in northern afghanistan , and in late february a german woman and her son were kidnapped in iraq by a group who threatened to execute the pair if berlin did not withdraw its troops from afghanistan . quoted in an interview published by german magazine cicero last month , mullah obaidullah , a senior taliban official and deputy to the elusive taliban leader mullah omar , said that germany ’ s 3,000 troops stationed in kabul and the northern provinces will be attacked by a wave of taliban fighters , and that no one would be spared . " not the germans , not the british , not the canadians and certainly not the americans .
we kill them all , " obaidullah was quoted as saying .
“ some 6,000 young warriors will sacrifice themselves for allah in the struggle , " he added . surveillance planes a target like any other bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocket propelled grenades and missiles will prove dangerous the german tornados - six fully operational jets backed up by two reserve planes - could face attack from the taliban ’ s man-portable air defense systems , or manpads .
a ground-to-air stinger rocket , which can hit aircraft at a range of up to 4785 meters and at altitudes between 182 and 3810 meters , can be fired from the shoulder of a single taliban fighter , making surveillance runs over the hindi kush mountain range very hazardous . the situation on the ground for bundeswehr troops in afghanistan is also a cause for concern with soldiers complaining of a lack of support , inadequate equipment and diminishing supplies . the tornado crews may also be shocked to discover on their arrival in afghanistan that if any of them are shot down , the bundeswehr do not have the capacity to rescue their own pilots because they lack the necessary helicopters .
in an emergency , us , british or canadian troops would have to embark on a rescue mission . soldiers air grievances to spd 's beck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops are coping with increasingly difficult conditions such conditions were made aware to social democrat chairperson kurt beck at the weekend when he visited troops in the north of the country .
soldiers openly complained about the cramped conditions , rationing problems and the fact that a camp of 1600 troops had only four telephones between them .
one told beck that , “ if our motivation goes down the drain , then we have a real problem . ” beck points out that the mission is bringing german military capabilities to their limits . " i ’ m sure we can do more as far as reconstruction in afghanistan is concerned but i ’ m as much convinced that this mission is driving our military capacities to the brink of exhaustion , " beck said .

verka serduchka is accused by nationalists of enforcing negative ukrainian stereotypes while the russians see her song as a political snub . the eurovision song contest will soon be upon us once again , giving fans and detractors alike another opportunity to watch the annual back scratching - and back-stabbing - which makes the event more than just a bunch of above-average karaoke singers trying to get the better of each other . for those not in the know , the annual contest , held since 1956 , pits active member countries of the european broadcasting union against one another .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.04.2007 new exhibition looks at daily life in east germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit focuses on the daily lives of everyday people a new exhibition on east germany has just opened in berlin 's german historical museum .
unlike many other shows of its kind , it does not deal exclusively with state repression , but focuses on everyday life . to museum director hans ottomeyer , the new exhibition in the german historical museum plugs an important gap in the way that east germany has been presented up to now .
in part , it is a response to the lack of a museum devoted to the history of the former communist regime . " there is no museum of east german history .
on the one hand , there are calls for such a museum to be set up .
on the other hand , it is also vehemently rejected , " ottomeyer said .
" until the permanent exhibition in the german historical museum , no one had begun to tackle this . " last year , peter kenzelmann , a political scientist from southwestern germany , set up a private museum in the german capital to look at this more personal part of east germany , which had been mostly neglected .
but he was accused of failing to make the brutality of the regime clear in his permanent display . everyday lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a children 's tv puppet , the sandman , was a beloved feature of east german life the aim of the exhibition in the german historical museum , according to ottomeyer , is to explore the interface between people 's everyday lives and the influence of the east german state . " the gdr had 17 million inhabitants on average .
that amounted to 17 million daily lives , " said exhibition organizer jörn schütrumpf . " the question we asked ourselves was what did these daily lives - or at least the majority of them - have in common ? " for him , it was important to show that life in east germany was not only affected by a massive concrete wall that divided the city , but also a second wall in the form of the state that tried to influence the lives of its citizens . " we kept on being asked how we would present the stasi , the east german secret police .
that is , of course , a theme without which you ca n't define the regime in the gdr , " said schütrumpf . diverse exhibits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files from the east german secret police headquarters are among the displays alongside such exhibits as a filing card cabinet from the headquarters of the east german secret police , there are also more banal articles , such as a school satchel made out of cardboard . all 550 items come from the museum 's own archive and were donated by members of the public after the collapse of the communist regime . " the public was asked , on television and in the newspapers , to bring to the museum what they saw as the most important objects relating to gdr history , " said curator regine falkenberg .
" you can also find little things such as meat stock paste , tins , tvs , darning utensils and vitamin preparations . " everyday resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has seen a wave of nostalgia for everyday east german products no longer available the show covers the period from 1956 up to the end of the communist regime .
but its 550 exhibits are not arranged chronologically .
instead , it is grouped according to thematic blocs such as work , the collective and the family . the exhibition , which runs until july 29 , also shows how ordinary east german citizens sought to resist the demands of the state .
that was not an easy task , since the stasi secret police had some 100,000 regular employees in addition to around 500,000 to two million collaborators in a country whose 1990 population was just over 16 million . the activities of the secret police were obviously no laughing matter for those who ended up in its custody .
but humor was one weapon that ordinary citizens used to deal with so-called " real existing socialism " and there is a special section especially devoted to jokes . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum takes controversial look at mundane east germany a new , private berlin museum focuses on everyday life in east germany .
while some see the exhibition as an important part of coming to terms with the gdr , others feel that it plays down the brutality of a dictatorship .

unlike many other shows of its kind , it does not deal exclusively with state repression , but focuses on everyday life . to museum director hans ottomeyer , the new exhibition in the german historical museum plugs an important gap in the way that east germany has been presented up to now .
in part , it is a response to the lack of a museum devoted to the history of the former communist regime . " there is no museum of east german history .
on the one hand , there are calls for such a museum to be set up .
on the other hand , it is also vehemently rejected , " ottomeyer said .
" until the permanent exhibition in the german historical museum , no one had begun to tackle this . " last year , peter kenzelmann , a political scientist from southwestern germany , set up a private museum in the german capital to look at this more personal part of east germany , which had been mostly neglected .
but he was accused of failing to make the brutality of the regime clear in his permanent display . everyday lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a children 's tv puppet , the sandman , was a beloved feature of east german life the aim of the exhibition in the german historical museum , according to ottomeyer , is to explore the interface between people 's everyday lives and the influence of the east german state . " the gdr had 17 million inhabitants on average .
that amounted to 17 million daily lives , " said exhibition organizer jörn schütrumpf . " the question we asked ourselves was what did these daily lives - or at least the majority of them - have in common ? " for him , it was important to show that life in east germany was not only affected by a massive concrete wall that divided the city , but also a second wall in the form of the state that tried to influence the lives of its citizens . " we kept on being asked how we would present the stasi , the east german secret police .
that is , of course , a theme without which you ca n't define the regime in the gdr , " said schütrumpf . diverse exhibits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files from the east german secret police headquarters are among the displays alongside such exhibits as a filing card cabinet from the headquarters of the east german secret police , there are also more banal articles , such as a school satchel made out of cardboard . all 550 items come from the museum 's own archive and were donated by members of the public after the collapse of the communist regime . " the public was asked , on television and in the newspapers , to bring to the museum what they saw as the most important objects relating to gdr history , " said curator regine falkenberg .
" you can also find little things such as meat stock paste , tins , tvs , darning utensils and vitamin preparations . " everyday resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has seen a wave of nostalgia for everyday east german products no longer available the show covers the period from 1956 up to the end of the communist regime .
but its 550 exhibits are not arranged chronologically .
instead , it is grouped according to thematic blocs such as work , the collective and the family . the exhibition , which runs until july 29 , also shows how ordinary east german citizens sought to resist the demands of the state .
that was not an easy task , since the stasi secret police had some 100,000 regular employees in addition to around 500,000 to two million collaborators in a country whose 1990 population was just over 16 million . the activities of the secret police were obviously no laughing matter for those who ended up in its custody .

despite their well-publicized surveillance role , the new troops may soon find the taliban does not see a difference between combat and support . germany ’ s deployment of eight tornado jets , their crew and support personnel to afghanistan avoided a final spanner in the works on friday when the federal constitutional court refused to grant a request from the opposition left party for an injunction stopping the deployment . with the removal of this last hurdle , 200 troops from the bundeswehr ’ s jagel base begin their deployment to masir-i-sharif via sardinia and the united arab emirates on monday . from their new base in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , the tornados - which are requested by nato - will fly surveillance missions at an altitude of 3000 meters -lrb- 9842 feet -rrb- over the hindu kush , charged with photographing taliban positions in support of nato forces on the ground . at a sending-off ceremony on monday , german defense minister franz josef jung said the aim of the mission was to bring assistance not fear to the afghan people . " the reconnaissance gathered by our tornadoes will bring more stability and security to afghanistan , " jung said .
" their mission is to protect isaf troops , as well as civilian aid workers and the afghan population . " worries mount in germany about planes ' role but despite the german german government 's assurances that the mission is purely a support role and not a combat deployment , there are still concerns within the government and the military that the tornado mission , just as the bundeswehr ’ s reconstruction efforts on the ground , will become embroiled in the growing conflict as a resurgent taliban readies to launch a widely expected spring offensive . public opinion back home in germany is also showing signs of concern and deployment fatigue .
a recent poll by the tns institute commissioned by der spiegel news magazine found that 57 per cent of those surveyed wanted a complete withdrawal of german troops from afghanistan , while 36 per cent were in favor of continued engagement .
a meager four per cent backed increasing the german military presence . regardless of mission , germany still an enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tornados are fitted with special camera equipment after five years of conflict , afghanistan is now more dangerous for the nato contingent , not less so and germany ’ s troops - despite their reconstruction mandate - are increasingly in the firing line .

however , several recent incidents have unsettled german officials .
in march , a german aid worker was ambushed and killed in northern afghanistan , and in late february a german woman and her son were kidnapped in iraq by a group who threatened to execute the pair if berlin did not withdraw its troops from afghanistan . quoted in an interview published by german magazine cicero last month , mullah obaidullah , a senior taliban official and deputy to the elusive taliban leader mullah omar , said that germany ’ s 3,000 troops stationed in kabul and the northern provinces will be attacked by a wave of taliban fighters , and that no one would be spared . " not the germans , not the british , not the canadians and certainly not the americans .
we kill them all , " obaidullah was quoted as saying .
“ some 6,000 young warriors will sacrifice themselves for allah in the struggle , " he added . surveillance planes a target like any other bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocket propelled grenades and missiles will prove dangerous the german tornados - six fully operational jets backed up by two reserve planes - could face attack from the taliban ’ s man-portable air defense systems , or manpads .
a ground-to-air stinger rocket , which can hit aircraft at a range of up to 4785 meters and at altitudes between 182 and 3810 meters , can be fired from the shoulder of a single taliban fighter , making surveillance runs over the hindi kush mountain range very hazardous . the situation on the ground for bundeswehr troops in afghanistan is also a cause for concern with soldiers complaining of a lack of support , inadequate equipment and diminishing supplies . the tornado crews may also be shocked to discover on their arrival in afghanistan that if any of them are shot down , the bundeswehr do not have the capacity to rescue their own pilots because they lack the necessary helicopters .
in an emergency , us , british or canadian troops would have to embark on a rescue mission . soldiers air grievances to spd 's beck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops are coping with increasingly difficult conditions such conditions were made aware to social democrat chairperson kurt beck at the weekend when he visited troops in the north of the country .

" i ’ m sure we can do more as far as reconstruction in afghanistan is concerned but i ’ m as much convinced that this mission is driving our military capacities to the brink of exhaustion , " beck said .
the spd leader has promised that he would pass on the grievances of the troops to the german government on his return . but with the tornado deployment likely to begin active service by the middle of april , an extra 200 troops to cater for and an expected increase in taliban attacks , germany ’ s troops in afghanistan do not have the luxury of waiting for the outcome of another extended debate in the bundestag about their mandate . despite governmental assurances of their role in the peace , germany ’ s troops know that they are in a war , regardless if they are firing bullets or not . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court rejects bid to stop afghanistan plane deployment germany 's top court friday rejected a bid by an opposition party to prevent the deployment of six tornado surveillance aircraft to help nato forces fighting the taliban in southern afghanistan .

despite their well-publicized surveillance role , the new troops may soon find the taliban does not see a difference between combat and support . germany ’ s deployment of eight tornado jets , their crew and support personnel to afghanistan avoided a final spanner in the works on friday when the federal constitutional court refused to grant a request from the opposition left party for an injunction stopping the deployment . with the removal of this last hurdle , 200 troops from the bundeswehr ’ s jagel base begin their deployment to masir-i-sharif via sardinia and the united arab emirates on monday . from their new base in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , the tornados - which are requested by nato - will fly surveillance missions at an altitude of 3000 meters -lrb- 9842 feet -rrb- over the hindu kush , charged with photographing taliban positions in support of nato forces on the ground . at a sending-off ceremony on monday , german defense minister franz josef jung said the aim of the mission was to bring assistance not fear to the afghan people . " the reconnaissance gathered by our tornadoes will bring more stability and security to afghanistan , " jung said .
" their mission is to protect isaf troops , as well as civilian aid workers and the afghan population . " worries mount in germany about planes ' role but despite the german german government 's assurances that the mission is purely a support role and not a combat deployment , there are still concerns within the government and the military that the tornado mission , just as the bundeswehr ’ s reconstruction efforts on the ground , will become embroiled in the growing conflict as a resurgent taliban readies to launch a widely expected spring offensive . public opinion back home in germany is also showing signs of concern and deployment fatigue .
a recent poll by the tns institute commissioned by der spiegel news magazine found that 57 per cent of those surveyed wanted a complete withdrawal of german troops from afghanistan , while 36 per cent were in favor of continued engagement .
a meager four per cent backed increasing the german military presence . regardless of mission , germany still an enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tornados are fitted with special camera equipment after five years of conflict , afghanistan is now more dangerous for the nato contingent , not less so and germany ’ s troops - despite their reconstruction mandate - are increasingly in the firing line .
and with the deployment of the tornado jets and support personnel , germany is moving up the taliban ’ s list of targets . the bundeswehr ’ s approach to the general population and their mission has provided a relatively stable environment in the north .
however , several recent incidents have unsettled german officials .
in march , a german aid worker was ambushed and killed in northern afghanistan , and in late february a german woman and her son were kidnapped in iraq by a group who threatened to execute the pair if berlin did not withdraw its troops from afghanistan . quoted in an interview published by german magazine cicero last month , mullah obaidullah , a senior taliban official and deputy to the elusive taliban leader mullah omar , said that germany ’ s 3,000 troops stationed in kabul and the northern provinces will be attacked by a wave of taliban fighters , and that no one would be spared . " not the germans , not the british , not the canadians and certainly not the americans .
we kill them all , " obaidullah was quoted as saying .
“ some 6,000 young warriors will sacrifice themselves for allah in the struggle , " he added . surveillance planes a target like any other bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocket propelled grenades and missiles will prove dangerous the german tornados - six fully operational jets backed up by two reserve planes - could face attack from the taliban ’ s man-portable air defense systems , or manpads .
a ground-to-air stinger rocket , which can hit aircraft at a range of up to 4785 meters and at altitudes between 182 and 3810 meters , can be fired from the shoulder of a single taliban fighter , making surveillance runs over the hindi kush mountain range very hazardous . the situation on the ground for bundeswehr troops in afghanistan is also a cause for concern with soldiers complaining of a lack of support , inadequate equipment and diminishing supplies . the tornado crews may also be shocked to discover on their arrival in afghanistan that if any of them are shot down , the bundeswehr do not have the capacity to rescue their own pilots because they lack the necessary helicopters .
in an emergency , us , british or canadian troops would have to embark on a rescue mission . soldiers air grievances to spd 's beck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops are coping with increasingly difficult conditions such conditions were made aware to social democrat chairperson kurt beck at the weekend when he visited troops in the north of the country .
soldiers openly complained about the cramped conditions , rationing problems and the fact that a camp of 1600 troops had only four telephones between them .
one told beck that , “ if our motivation goes down the drain , then we have a real problem . ” beck points out that the mission is bringing german military capabilities to their limits . " i ’ m sure we can do more as far as reconstruction in afghanistan is concerned but i ’ m as much convinced that this mission is driving our military capacities to the brink of exhaustion , " beck said .
the spd leader has promised that he would pass on the grievances of the troops to the german government on his return . but with the tornado deployment likely to begin active service by the middle of april , an extra 200 troops to cater for and an expected increase in taliban attacks , germany ’ s troops in afghanistan do not have the luxury of waiting for the outcome of another extended debate in the bundestag about their mandate . despite governmental assurances of their role in the peace , germany ’ s troops know that they are in a war , regardless if they are firing bullets or not . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court rejects bid to stop afghanistan plane deployment germany 's top court friday rejected a bid by an opposition party to prevent the deployment of six tornado surveillance aircraft to help nato forces fighting the taliban in southern afghanistan .

verka serduchka is accused by nationalists of enforcing negative ukrainian stereotypes while the russians see her song as a political snub . the eurovision song contest will soon be upon us once again , giving fans and detractors alike another opportunity to watch the annual back scratching - and back-stabbing - which makes the event more than just a bunch of above-average karaoke singers trying to get the better of each other . for those not in the know , the annual contest , held since 1956 , pits active member countries of the european broadcasting union against one another .
each country submits a song to be performed on live television and then voters from the participating countries cast votes for the other countries ' songs .
it is seen by many as a festival of kitsch , adored or disdained for its campy , over-the-top presentation of usually forgettable three-minute songs . the contest is as much about allegiances as it is about competition .
it doesn ’ t matter if a particular song is terrible or not , if one country considers the other a friend , then it will get the vote regardless of its entry ’ s quality . while this low-level political bargaining has always been a part of eurovision , the light-hearted entertainment event has rarely been overtly subversive .
however , this year may be the first time that actual protests may stem from the presentation and lyrics of a particular contestant . that contestant is a ukrainian drag queen called verka serduchka .
a cult star in " her " native country , verka was the choice of the people by a massive majority in the competition to become ukraine ’ s entry with the song “ dancing . ” stereotype prompts demonstrations however , the first potentially political row revolving around the song has started at home with ukrainian nationalists up in arms over verka ’ s image . while they seem to accept the fact that a drag queen is representing the country , they have taken umbrage over verka ’ s portrayal of a stupid ukrainian villager , saying she could damage ukraine ’ s image abroad . it has riled the nationalists to such an extent that demonstrations aimed at getting ukraine pulled from eurovision were staged across the country on sunday . snub to former soviet master bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the square is in the song , the protests are n't russia , which has already made its feeling against verka known , is likely to become even more irate when verka belts out her apparently anti-russian lyrics in front of an international audience .
it seems that the chorus refrain of " russia goodbye " has been interpreted as a snub to ukraine ’ s former soviet master . the russians have also taken offense to the reference to a kiev square that was the focus of anti-russian protests during the 2004 orange revolution , despite the fact that no mention of the demonstrations which signaled ukraine ’ s westward shift is included in the song . should verka win a moral victory and actually perform the song on the show , it could prove quite an eventful night . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany swings around eurovision in surprising national final germany has never fully recovered from its 2005 eurovision debacle when it came last .

it is another step in yet another scandal to engulf the german engineering giant .
this latest move indicates momentum continues to gather pace and is another blow to the company 's weakened executives . the charge is that siemens illegally financed aub , a small union which is considered more employer friendly .
siemens allegedly hoped aub would act as a counterweight to ig metall , which has said that aub sometimes blocked its positions in labor talks . " ig metall has filed a complaint over possible favoritism " of the independent organization aub and possible attempts to influence voting in work council elections within the siemens group , the union said in a statement .

ig metall dismissed suggestions that the aub was a proper labor union . " the aub has not conducted any wage negotiations , nor is it in a position to conduct strike action , " huber said . siemens rocked by scandals siemens is currently entangled in a web of different corruption allegations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes feldmayer last week , a member of siemens ' central management board , johannes feldmayer , was arrested over his alleged involvement in allegations that management tried to build up the tiny aub into a possible counterweight to the all-powerful ig metall . siemens ' former finance chief , karl-hermann baumann , was also being investigated in the matter . both he and feldmayer are being involved in 15-20 million euros -lrb- $ 20-26 million -rrb- in alleged bogus consultancy fees to aub chief wilhelm schelsky , who was arrested last month . alleged slush funds at the same time , siemens is also engulfed in a massive slush-fund scandal , where prosecutors allege that company managers siphoned off hundreds of millions of euros in company money to obtain foreign contracts . prosecutors this week said they had arrested two more current and former managers in connection with the matter following a series of high-profile arrests at the end of last year , including the former head of siemens ' telecoms division , thomas ganswindt . prosecutors allege that the employees concerned are suspected of collaborating to open slush fund accounts abroad and of operating a system to embezzle company money . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens ' former mobile company faces break-up the bankrupt german mobile phone division of the taiwanese benq corp is to be broken up , the administrators appointed to find a buyer for the former siemens company said saturday .

despite their well-publicized surveillance role , the new troops may soon find the taliban does not see a difference between combat and support . germany ’ s deployment of eight tornado jets , their crew and support personnel to afghanistan avoided a final spanner in the works on friday when the federal constitutional court refused to grant a request from the opposition left party for an injunction stopping the deployment . with the removal of this last hurdle , 200 troops from the bundeswehr ’ s jagel base begin their deployment to masir-i-sharif via sardinia and the united arab emirates on monday . from their new base in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , the tornados - which are requested by nato - will fly surveillance missions at an altitude of 3000 meters -lrb- 9842 feet -rrb- over the hindu kush , charged with photographing taliban positions in support of nato forces on the ground . at a sending-off ceremony on monday , german defense minister franz josef jung said the aim of the mission was to bring assistance not fear to the afghan people . " the reconnaissance gathered by our tornadoes will bring more stability and security to afghanistan , " jung said .
" their mission is to protect isaf troops , as well as civilian aid workers and the afghan population . " worries mount in germany about planes ' role but despite the german german government 's assurances that the mission is purely a support role and not a combat deployment , there are still concerns within the government and the military that the tornado mission , just as the bundeswehr ’ s reconstruction efforts on the ground , will become embroiled in the growing conflict as a resurgent taliban readies to launch a widely expected spring offensive . public opinion back home in germany is also showing signs of concern and deployment fatigue .
a recent poll by the tns institute commissioned by der spiegel news magazine found that 57 per cent of those surveyed wanted a complete withdrawal of german troops from afghanistan , while 36 per cent were in favor of continued engagement .
a meager four per cent backed increasing the german military presence . regardless of mission , germany still an enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tornados are fitted with special camera equipment after five years of conflict , afghanistan is now more dangerous for the nato contingent , not less so and germany ’ s troops - despite their reconstruction mandate - are increasingly in the firing line .
and with the deployment of the tornado jets and support personnel , germany is moving up the taliban ’ s list of targets . the bundeswehr ’ s approach to the general population and their mission has provided a relatively stable environment in the north .
however , several recent incidents have unsettled german officials .
in march , a german aid worker was ambushed and killed in northern afghanistan , and in late february a german woman and her son were kidnapped in iraq by a group who threatened to execute the pair if berlin did not withdraw its troops from afghanistan . quoted in an interview published by german magazine cicero last month , mullah obaidullah , a senior taliban official and deputy to the elusive taliban leader mullah omar , said that germany ’ s 3,000 troops stationed in kabul and the northern provinces will be attacked by a wave of taliban fighters , and that no one would be spared . " not the germans , not the british , not the canadians and certainly not the americans .
we kill them all , " obaidullah was quoted as saying .
“ some 6,000 young warriors will sacrifice themselves for allah in the struggle , " he added . surveillance planes a target like any other bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocket propelled grenades and missiles will prove dangerous the german tornados - six fully operational jets backed up by two reserve planes - could face attack from the taliban ’ s man-portable air defense systems , or manpads .
a ground-to-air stinger rocket , which can hit aircraft at a range of up to 4785 meters and at altitudes between 182 and 3810 meters , can be fired from the shoulder of a single taliban fighter , making surveillance runs over the hindi kush mountain range very hazardous . the situation on the ground for bundeswehr troops in afghanistan is also a cause for concern with soldiers complaining of a lack of support , inadequate equipment and diminishing supplies . the tornado crews may also be shocked to discover on their arrival in afghanistan that if any of them are shot down , the bundeswehr do not have the capacity to rescue their own pilots because they lack the necessary helicopters .
in an emergency , us , british or canadian troops would have to embark on a rescue mission . soldiers air grievances to spd 's beck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops are coping with increasingly difficult conditions such conditions were made aware to social democrat chairperson kurt beck at the weekend when he visited troops in the north of the country .
soldiers openly complained about the cramped conditions , rationing problems and the fact that a camp of 1600 troops had only four telephones between them .
one told beck that , “ if our motivation goes down the drain , then we have a real problem . ” beck points out that the mission is bringing german military capabilities to their limits . " i ’ m sure we can do more as far as reconstruction in afghanistan is concerned but i ’ m as much convinced that this mission is driving our military capacities to the brink of exhaustion , " beck said .
the spd leader has promised that he would pass on the grievances of the troops to the german government on his return . but with the tornado deployment likely to begin active service by the middle of april , an extra 200 troops to cater for and an expected increase in taliban attacks , germany ’ s troops in afghanistan do not have the luxury of waiting for the outcome of another extended debate in the bundestag about their mandate . despite governmental assurances of their role in the peace , germany ’ s troops know that they are in a war , regardless if they are firing bullets or not . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court rejects bid to stop afghanistan plane deployment germany 's top court friday rejected a bid by an opposition party to prevent the deployment of six tornado surveillance aircraft to help nato forces fighting the taliban in southern afghanistan .

despite their well-publicized surveillance role , the new troops may soon find the taliban does not see a difference between combat and support . germany ’ s deployment of eight tornado jets , their crew and support personnel to afghanistan avoided a final spanner in the works on friday when the federal constitutional court refused to grant a request from the opposition left party for an injunction stopping the deployment . with the removal of this last hurdle , 200 troops from the bundeswehr ’ s jagel base begin their deployment to masir-i-sharif via sardinia and the united arab emirates on monday . from their new base in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan , the tornados - which are requested by nato - will fly surveillance missions at an altitude of 3000 meters -lrb- 9842 feet -rrb- over the hindu kush , charged with photographing taliban positions in support of nato forces on the ground . at a sending-off ceremony on monday , german defense minister franz josef jung said the aim of the mission was to bring assistance not fear to the afghan people .

verka serduchka is accused by nationalists of enforcing negative ukrainian stereotypes while the russians see her song as a political snub . the eurovision song contest will soon be upon us once again , giving fans and detractors alike another opportunity to watch the annual back scratching - and back-stabbing - which makes the event more than just a bunch of above-average karaoke singers trying to get the better of each other . for those not in the know , the annual contest , held since 1956 , pits active member countries of the european broadcasting union against one another .
each country submits a song to be performed on live television and then voters from the participating countries cast votes for the other countries ' songs .
it is seen by many as a festival of kitsch , adored or disdained for its campy , over-the-top presentation of usually forgettable three-minute songs . the contest is as much about allegiances as it is about competition .
it doesn ’ t matter if a particular song is terrible or not , if one country considers the other a friend , then it will get the vote regardless of its entry ’ s quality . while this low-level political bargaining has always been a part of eurovision , the light-hearted entertainment event has rarely been overtly subversive .
however , this year may be the first time that actual protests may stem from the presentation and lyrics of a particular contestant . that contestant is a ukrainian drag queen called verka serduchka .
a cult star in " her " native country , verka was the choice of the people by a massive majority in the competition to become ukraine ’ s entry with the song “ dancing . ” stereotype prompts demonstrations however , the first potentially political row revolving around the song has started at home with ukrainian nationalists up in arms over verka ’ s image . while they seem to accept the fact that a drag queen is representing the country , they have taken umbrage over verka ’ s portrayal of a stupid ukrainian villager , saying she could damage ukraine ’ s image abroad . it has riled the nationalists to such an extent that demonstrations aimed at getting ukraine pulled from eurovision were staged across the country on sunday . snub to former soviet master bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the square is in the song , the protests are n't russia , which has already made its feeling against verka known , is likely to become even more irate when verka belts out her apparently anti-russian lyrics in front of an international audience .
it seems that the chorus refrain of " russia goodbye " has been interpreted as a snub to ukraine ’ s former soviet master . the russians have also taken offense to the reference to a kiev square that was the focus of anti-russian protests during the 2004 orange revolution , despite the fact that no mention of the demonstrations which signaled ukraine ’ s westward shift is included in the song . should verka win a moral victory and actually perform the song on the show , it could prove quite an eventful night . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany swings around eurovision in surprising national final germany has never fully recovered from its 2005 eurovision debacle when it came last .

unlike many other shows of its kind , it does not deal exclusively with state repression , but focuses on everyday life . to museum director hans ottomeyer , the new exhibition in the german historical museum plugs an important gap in the way that east germany has been presented up to now .
in part , it is a response to the lack of a museum devoted to the history of the former communist regime . " there is no museum of east german history .
on the one hand , there are calls for such a museum to be set up .
on the other hand , it is also vehemently rejected , " ottomeyer said .
" until the permanent exhibition in the german historical museum , no one had begun to tackle this . " last year , peter kenzelmann , a political scientist from southwestern germany , set up a private museum in the german capital to look at this more personal part of east germany , which had been mostly neglected .
but he was accused of failing to make the brutality of the regime clear in his permanent display . everyday lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a children 's tv puppet , the sandman , was a beloved feature of east german life the aim of the exhibition in the german historical museum , according to ottomeyer , is to explore the interface between people 's everyday lives and the influence of the east german state . " the gdr had 17 million inhabitants on average .
that amounted to 17 million daily lives , " said exhibition organizer jörn schütrumpf . " the question we asked ourselves was what did these daily lives - or at least the majority of them - have in common ? " for him , it was important to show that life in east germany was not only affected by a massive concrete wall that divided the city , but also a second wall in the form of the state that tried to influence the lives of its citizens . " we kept on being asked how we would present the stasi , the east german secret police .
that is , of course , a theme without which you ca n't define the regime in the gdr , " said schütrumpf . diverse exhibits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : files from the east german secret police headquarters are among the displays alongside such exhibits as a filing card cabinet from the headquarters of the east german secret police , there are also more banal articles , such as a school satchel made out of cardboard . all 550 items come from the museum 's own archive and were donated by members of the public after the collapse of the communist regime . " the public was asked , on television and in the newspapers , to bring to the museum what they saw as the most important objects relating to gdr history , " said curator regine falkenberg .
" you can also find little things such as meat stock paste , tins , tvs , darning utensils and vitamin preparations . " everyday resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has seen a wave of nostalgia for everyday east german products no longer available the show covers the period from 1956 up to the end of the communist regime .
but its 550 exhibits are not arranged chronologically .
instead , it is grouped according to thematic blocs such as work , the collective and the family . the exhibition , which runs until july 29 , also shows how ordinary east german citizens sought to resist the demands of the state .
that was not an easy task , since the stasi secret police had some 100,000 regular employees in addition to around 500,000 to two million collaborators in a country whose 1990 population was just over 16 million . the activities of the secret police were obviously no laughing matter for those who ended up in its custody .

verka serduchka is accused by nationalists of enforcing negative ukrainian stereotypes while the russians see her song as a political snub . the eurovision song contest will soon be upon us once again , giving fans and detractors alike another opportunity to watch the annual back scratching - and back-stabbing - which makes the event more than just a bunch of above-average karaoke singers trying to get the better of each other . for those not in the know , the annual contest , held since 1956 , pits active member countries of the european broadcasting union against one another .
each country submits a song to be performed on live television and then voters from the participating countries cast votes for the other countries ' songs .
it is seen by many as a festival of kitsch , adored or disdained for its campy , over-the-top presentation of usually forgettable three-minute songs . the contest is as much about allegiances as it is about competition .
it doesn ’ t matter if a particular song is terrible or not , if one country considers the other a friend , then it will get the vote regardless of its entry ’ s quality . while this low-level political bargaining has always been a part of eurovision , the light-hearted entertainment event has rarely been overtly subversive .
however , this year may be the first time that actual protests may stem from the presentation and lyrics of a particular contestant . that contestant is a ukrainian drag queen called verka serduchka .
a cult star in " her " native country , verka was the choice of the people by a massive majority in the competition to become ukraine ’ s entry with the song “ dancing . ” stereotype prompts demonstrations however , the first potentially political row revolving around the song has started at home with ukrainian nationalists up in arms over verka ’ s image . while they seem to accept the fact that a drag queen is representing the country , they have taken umbrage over verka ’ s portrayal of a stupid ukrainian villager , saying she could damage ukraine ’ s image abroad . it has riled the nationalists to such an extent that demonstrations aimed at getting ukraine pulled from eurovision were staged across the country on sunday . snub to former soviet master bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the square is in the song , the protests are n't russia , which has already made its feeling against verka known , is likely to become even more irate when verka belts out her apparently anti-russian lyrics in front of an international audience .
it seems that the chorus refrain of " russia goodbye " has been interpreted as a snub to ukraine ’ s former soviet master . the russians have also taken offense to the reference to a kiev square that was the focus of anti-russian protests during the 2004 orange revolution , despite the fact that no mention of the demonstrations which signaled ukraine ’ s westward shift is included in the song . should verka win a moral victory and actually perform the song on the show , it could prove quite an eventful night . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany swings around eurovision in surprising national final germany has never fully recovered from its 2005 eurovision debacle when it came last .

all matches were oversubscribed . about 346,000 tickets were available for all 31 matches during the one-month internet sale . the random lottery will be held in mid-april under the supervision of legal officials .
fans should know the outcome by the end of this month , the euro 2008 organizers said . all of the applications will be checked before they enter the lottery to prevent black market sales and for security vetting , said euro 2008 spokesman wolfgang eichler . " this is mainly to see if there are false applications or not , " eichler told afp news service .
" there are also hooligan databases involved , to find if people are registered there . " the last chance to find a seat at euro 2008 will be early next year , when another 399,000 tickets will be sold through the national associations of the 16 teams that eventually qualify for the finals . on average , each nation will be allocated 19 percent of the seats available in the matches they play .
the rest of the 1.05 million seats at the june 7-29 finals will be used for vips and sponsors . germans clamor for tickets the biggest demand in the initial phase of sales came from joint hosts switzerland , who accounted for 29 percent of the ticket requests , followed by neighboring germany -lrb- 27 percent -rrb- and the other host , austria -lrb- 21 percent -rrb- . other countries each accounted for one to three percent of the requests , led by portugal . german , swiss , english and dutch fans ordered the most " follow my team " subscriptions , the organizers said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : kuranyi double sinks czechs and keeps germany in command striker kevin kuranyi ensured germany stay top of their euro 2008 qualifying group with two headed goals either side of half-time as his side poached a 2-1 win over the czech republic on saturday .

bbc news -pipe- middle east -pipe- yemeni women sign up to fight terror bbc news / middle east graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- monday , 2 april 2007 , 07:22 gmt 08:22 uk yemeni women sign up to fight terror by ginny hill bbc news , yemen afrah pulls back her camouflage jacket to show me the pistol strapped to her belt .
her military uniform is specially designed to meet islamic principles of modesty , with a long , loose tunic and long sleeves .
she travelled to work this morning wearing a veil and a full-length black balto , an all-encompassing cloak which is traditional dress for women in yemen .
but now she is dressed in fatigues , heavy black boots and shades .
afrah , 23 , is one of 20 women recruited to join yemen 's elite counter-terrorism unit -lrb- ctu -rrb- last summer .
only 13 recruits have stayed the course , after a rigorous training programme that has taught them how to enter a house by force , drive a hummer military vehicle and shoot .
yahya saleh , chief of staff of yemen 's central security forces , sponsored the creation of the women 's unit and supervises the ctu .
he says the women 's main purpose is to follow their male colleagues on house raids and search any women they encounter .
" male terrorists often disguise themselves as women in order to evade detection and arrest , but yemen 's strict social code means that women suspects can not be touched by the men on the unit , " he explains .
yemen 's political security organisation runs a separate team of women , trained to gather and assess intelligence , but afrah and her colleagues in the ctu are the only women to put themselves at the sharp end of yemeni counter-terrorism .
" at the beginning , we were afraid , " she says , " but now we 're getting used to our job . "
family values the ctu is barracked in a special compound at the central security forces headquarters in yemen 's capital , sanaa .
the grounds are bristling with uniformed men carrying ak-47s .
access is tightly restricted .
the women are housed separately from the men but they study and take part in training exercises alongside their male counterparts . "
at the beginning , my family was divided about my new job .
my father opposed me but my mother supported me .
gradually , my mum convinced him " saba as part of the programme , they learn first aid and study english on-site at the frances guy academy - named after a former british ambassador .
afrah , saba and sisters kfaih and faten are resting in the locker rooms during their lunch-break .
all in their early 20s , they were recruited from the military police .
nine of their peers are away studying in the united states for additional training , but this group of four were refused permission to travel by their relatives .
yemen is an extremely conservative society , where a woman 's honour reflects on her whole family .
leaving the country without a chaperone was a step too far for worried parents who had already struggled to accept their daughters ' employment in the police force .
" at the beginning , my family was divided about my new job , " says saba .
" my father opposed me but my mother supported me .
gradually , my mum convinced him that we have separate rooms from the men , and that we 're not mingling with them unsupervised .
now he accepts my choice . "
afrar agrees she is a pioneer who is " challenging people 's ideas about what is possible for women in yemen " .
in a country where unemployment runs at 40 % , these women are evidently proud of their jobs and pleased to take a regular income home to their families .
counter-terrorism and economics the ctu , established in 2003 , is seen as a success by british and american trainers .
ctu teams recently captured and killed three convicted terrorists during shoot-outs in two house raids in sanaa and a separate operation in the southern province of abiyan .
the trio were on the run after tunnelling their way out of prison in february 2006 . "
-lsb- the ctu is -rsb- one of our favourite security institutions to work with because it 's new and there is no corruption .
they 're willing to try new approaches and tactics " nabeel khoury us embassy in sanaa " it 's a good unit , " says nabeel khoury , deputy chief of mission at the us embassy in sanaa .
" it 's one of our favourite security institutions to work with because it 's new and there is no corruption .
" they are forward-looking and proactive .
they 're willing to try new approaches and tactics .
and they are growing gradually , as they develop additional capacity . "
yemen 's president , ali abdullah saleh , walks a fine line on counter-terrorism .
his strategy must appease yemeni public opinion , which is often hostile to america and israel , and yet also satisfy the west .
the yemeni army are currently battling an insurgency in the northern province of saada , close to the border with saudi arabia .
the sporadic three-year rebellion started , in part , as a protest against mr saleh 's alliance with the current us administration .
hundreds have died since fighting broke out again at the start of the year .
at the same time , mr saleh ca n't afford to alienate potential donors .
his country suffers from faltering economic prospects and dwindling oil reserves .
reform and corruption early stages of an aggressive reform drive , designed to stamp out corruption and boost the independence of the judiciary , have already generated a wave of optimism among countries with an interest in yemen 's development .
in november 2006 , britain and yemen 's gulf neighbours pledged £ 2.3bn -lrb- $ 4.7bn -rrb- in aid over the next four years .
and in february , us aid re-instated yemen 's eligibility to apply to the millennium challenge account , a bush administration plan that ties aid to governance benchmarks and could reward up to £ 250m -lrb- $ 500m -rrb- in long-term assistance .
" there is no doubt that yemen faces a real and renewed threat from home-grown terrorism , " says kevin rosser , an oil and gas analyst at risk consulting firm control risks .
" last year 's attempted suicide attacks on two major oil facilities would have paralysed yemen 's oil industry and crippled the economy , if they had succeeded . "
the attackers were shot as they drove their car bombs towards their intended targets , foiling the plot .
a new group called al-qaeda yemen subsequently claimed responsibility , warning that " these operations are only the first spark " and what is coming is " more severe and bitter " .

afrah , 23 , is one of 20 women recruited to join yemen 's elite counter-terrorism unit -lrb- ctu -rrb- last summer .

yahya saleh , chief of staff of yemen 's central security forces , sponsored the creation of the women 's unit and supervises the ctu .
he says the women 's main purpose is to follow their male colleagues on house raids and search any women they encounter .
" male terrorists often disguise themselves as women in order to evade detection and arrest , but yemen 's strict social code means that women suspects can not be touched by the men on the unit , " he explains .
yemen 's political security organisation runs a separate team of women , trained to gather and assess intelligence , but afrah and her colleagues in the ctu are the only women to put themselves at the sharp end of yemeni counter-terrorism .

i saw things i really do n't want to talk about now , " ante tells me , looking into the distance , his words slow and thoughtful .
" like many others , i suffered psychological problems after the war ended .
" i could n't find peace of mind or concentrate on anything .
i would n't even speak to my family and locked myself in a room . "
ante slavic , a former croatian soldier from the mountain town of knin , has largely recovered from the post-traumatic stress he suffered .
but his recovery has not been down to medicines or psychological counselling .
it is a result of a pioneering project set up and run by war veterans themselves .
self-help knin and the surrounding region saw fierce fighting between croat and serb forces during the war in the early 1990s .
the bullet holes have still not been plastered over on the walls in the town .
these days high unemployment and a poor economy are people 's main concerns .
" we wanted to do something for ourselves , " says boris kraljic , who was one of the initiators of the war veterans ' project .
" we set up this centre and began offering computer courses to former soldiers .
" the courses meet european standards .
and then we also included the families as well .
it brought some people out of the depression they had sunk into . "
around 800 former soldiers have gone through the centre .
some of the veterans now train other former soldiers .
they have set up their own wireless network and are continually looking to upgrade the technology at their disposal .
" the next stage is to try to find employment for our people .
these people now have the skills and knowledge .
the real challenge is to now help find them jobs , " says boris .
" this project is hugely important .
it 's a fantastic way of developing an information society .
but also it is dealing in the best possible way with some of the issues that this country has had and the consequences of war , " says miroslav kovacic , state secretary with the croatian government .
corporate aid multinational companies have also got involved .
ibm 's general manager for croatia , ivan vidakovic , says he was impressed by the determination of those who ran the course .
" they took their destiny in their hands .
some of them are now starting their own businesses and we want to help by providing skills and support . "
the centre has now become a focal point for the local community .
one of the rooms is now set aside to teach children foreign languages .
" we would like to offer our experiences and ideas to other war veterans organisations around the world , " says mladen milosevic , president of the war veterans ' association .
" we think we have a lot to offer . "
ante has made such a recovery that he is now one of the main organisers at the centre .
" i feel a lot better in myself , " says ante with a smile .
" look what we 've achieved in the past three years .

i saw things i really do n't want to talk about now , " ante tells me , looking into the distance , his words slow and thoughtful .
" like many others , i suffered psychological problems after the war ended .
" i could n't find peace of mind or concentrate on anything .
i would n't even speak to my family and locked myself in a room . "
ante slavic , a former croatian soldier from the mountain town of knin , has largely recovered from the post-traumatic stress he suffered .
but his recovery has not been down to medicines or psychological counselling .
it is a result of a pioneering project set up and run by war veterans themselves .
self-help knin and the surrounding region saw fierce fighting between croat and serb forces during the war in the early 1990s .
the bullet holes have still not been plastered over on the walls in the town .
these days high unemployment and a poor economy are people 's main concerns .
ante slavic helped pioneer the project " we wanted to do something for ourselves , " says boris kraljic , who was one of the initiators of the war veterans ' project .
" we set up this centre and began offering computer courses to former soldiers .
" the courses meet european standards .
and then we also included the families as well .
it brought some people out of the depression they had sunk into . "
around 800 former soldiers have gone through the centre .
some of the veterans now train other former soldiers .
they have set up their own wireless network and are continually looking to upgrade the technology at their disposal .
" the next stage is to try to find employment for our people .
these people now have the skills and knowledge .
the real challenge is to now help find them jobs , " says boris .
" this project is hugely important .
it 's a fantastic way of developing an information society .
but also it is dealing in the best possible way with some of the issues that this country has had and the consequences of war , " says miroslav kovacic , state secretary with the croatian government .
corporate aid multinational companies have also got involved .
knin was the scene of fierce fighting in 1995 ibm 's general manager for croatia , ivan vidakovic , says he was impressed by the determination of those who ran the course .
" they took their destiny in their hands .
some of them are now starting their own businesses and we want to help by providing skills and support . "
the centre has now become a focal point for the local community .
one of the rooms is now set aside to teach children foreign languages .
" we would like to offer our experiences and ideas to other war veterans organisations around the world , " says mladen milosevic , president of the war veterans ' association .
" we think we have a lot to offer . "
ante has made such a recovery that he is now one of the main organisers at the centre .
" i feel a lot better in myself , " says ante with a smile .
" look what we 've achieved in the past three years .
we may soon set up our own internet radio and tv stations .
who knows what the future holds ? "

i saw things i really do n't want to talk about now , " ante tells me , looking into the distance , his words slow and thoughtful .
" like many others , i suffered psychological problems after the war ended .
" i could n't find peace of mind or concentrate on anything .
i would n't even speak to my family and locked myself in a room . "
ante slavic , a former croatian soldier from the mountain town of knin , has largely recovered from the post-traumatic stress he suffered .
but his recovery has not been down to medicines or psychological counselling .
it is a result of a pioneering project set up and run by war veterans themselves .
self-help knin and the surrounding region saw fierce fighting between croat and serb forces during the war in the early 1990s .
the bullet holes have still not been plastered over on the walls in the town .
these days high unemployment and a poor economy are people 's main concerns .
ante slavic helped pioneer the project " we wanted to do something for ourselves , " says boris kraljic , who was one of the initiators of the war veterans ' project .
" we set up this centre and began offering computer courses to former soldiers .
" the courses meet european standards .
and then we also included the families as well .
it brought some people out of the depression they had sunk into . "
around 800 former soldiers have gone through the centre .
some of the veterans now train other former soldiers .
they have set up their own wireless network and are continually looking to upgrade the technology at their disposal .
" the next stage is to try to find employment for our people .
these people now have the skills and knowledge .
the real challenge is to now help find them jobs , " says boris .
" this project is hugely important .
it 's a fantastic way of developing an information society .
but also it is dealing in the best possible way with some of the issues that this country has had and the consequences of war , " says miroslav kovacic , state secretary with the croatian government .
corporate aid multinational companies have also got involved .
knin was the scene of fierce fighting in 1995 ibm 's general manager for croatia , ivan vidakovic , says he was impressed by the determination of those who ran the course .
" they took their destiny in their hands .
some of them are now starting their own businesses and we want to help by providing skills and support . "
the centre has now become a focal point for the local community .
one of the rooms is now set aside to teach children foreign languages .
" we would like to offer our experiences and ideas to other war veterans organisations around the world , " says mladen milosevic , president of the war veterans ' association .
" we think we have a lot to offer . "
ante has made such a recovery that he is now one of the main organisers at the centre .
" i feel a lot better in myself , " says ante with a smile .
" look what we 've achieved in the past three years .
we may soon set up our own internet radio and tv stations .
who knows what the future holds ? "

photorealistic characters , vast game environments in high-definition detail , and artificial intelligence continue to improve .
but as the visible parts of games get closer to perfection , the tools used to tell the story in the game are also due an overhaul , according to some veteran games industry figures .
both peter molyneux , head of lionhead studios , and david braben , head of frontier developments , agree that the industry is focusing on new ways to add greater depth to stories .
" at the moment there 's a huge amount of talk about story and narrative , branching plots and multiple endings , and player-directed content , " mr molyneux said .
cut scenes the industry needed to find new alternatives to existing , outmoded storytelling techniques , said mr molyneux , whose firm is working on the sequel to its award winning role-playing title fable . "
because of branching complexity , where fable had 20,000 lines of dialogue , fable 2 has about 250,000 " peter molyneux lionhead studios many video games move story forward by using " cut scenes " , short expositional interludes which punctuate the play .
but cut scenes suffer from several different problems .
mr molyneux said they were " tragic moments in gameplay because gamers ' patience and tolerance for cut scenes are measured in seconds " .
research shows that many gamers skip cut scenes , preferring to get straight back into the action , he said .
multiple branching and it is not just players that they frustrate , they also cause problems for game makers too .
the main problem is tailoring play so it reaches a point where using a cut scene makes sense , said mr braben , a 25-year industry veteran , who made his name with classic title elite .
" so what you end up with is pinch points in the story which very much dictate the storyline and you almost have a game-over situation if those points are n't met , " mr braben said .
" there have been some experiments where there have been multiple cut scenes for each point .
but that creates a major issue for the amount of story creation you have to do . "
creating scenes that can branch in many directions is impractical because the number of possible storylines grows exponentially , said mr braben .
and though giving players lots of ways to get through a game sounds good , the psychology of the average gamer confounds its usefulness , mr molyneux has found .
" the tragic thing we found with multiple branching is what actually happens is that when gamers spoke to each other about their experiences they felt they had done the task the wrong way , " said mr molyneux .
" we found people were restarting parts of the game to get to the same thread as their friends . "
gamer choice but in spite of the complications , developers are seeking ways to give gamers more say in directing the action .
frontier 's current project , the outsider , is a political thriller in which the main character is falsely accused of killing the us president .
" we 've chosen a story where it makes sense for the player to go in many different directions , " said frontier head david braben .
" you are actively making the choices and then living with them .
people make snap decisions that are not always best for them , " he said .
" they think they can shoot their way out of a situation , but then they get painted as a killer . "
but increasing the number of game choices impacts on other aspects of game development .
" because of branching complexity , where fable had 20,000 lines of dialogue , fable 2 has about 250,000 , " said mr molyneux .
hollywood techniques and it is not just in story that the games industry is looking to improve , it is looking to hollywood scriptwriters and directors for help to improve dialogue and characterisation .
sometimes this influence is explicit .
for instance the cut scenes and in-game dialogue for frontier 's game thrillville were written by one of the scriptwriters of the simpsons . "
i 'm sitting here as a buster keaton or charlie chaplin saying i 'm going to become a hitchcock " david braben frontier developments frontier continues to draw on film industry techniques to create deeper , more engaging characters .
" most game characters are as shallow as a puddle - they 're really lightweight , " said mr braben .
" ' i 'm a baddy , i shoot people ; i 'm a passer-by , i get shot . '
that 's about as much characterisation as they get , " he said .
" we 're going through a process - in the same way the film industry does - of putting together character bibles .
" so even though it may not be evident in the story - we know this is where this character grew up , this is why they are the way they are , these are the chips they have on their shoulder , " said mr braben .
by creating a back story for characters game writers gain a better understanding of their own creations , giving characters greater depth and enriching their dialogue .
" it 's astonishing how much of a character 's background defines how they would respond to something , " said mr braben .
the characters ' history defines the language they use in different situations , he added .
changing mindset many game industry figures see parallels between the evolution of video games and film .
like the early movie industry , the games sector sees itself as an emerging medium that has yet to mature .
the new technologies emerging in gaming are similar to the shift from silent films to the synchronised sound of " talkies " , said mr braben .
silent film producers introduced very little dialogue to early talking films because they did not change their mindset , he said .
but directors like alfred hitchcock and orson welles in the 1930s saw cinema as a medium for story-telling not merely a medium for spectacle .
" i think that 's where the games industry is at now - we have n't changed our mindset but we 're moving forward .
many of us are in the industry for the potential rather than the history , " said mr braben " i 'm sitting here as a buster keaton or charlie chaplin saying i 'm going to become a hitchcock , hopefully , " he said .
mr molyneux agrees that the video games industry is in the process of redefining what the medium is capable of .
" the future of storytelling , the future of narrative , the future of what are great compelling moments in entertainment are more likely to be held by what you think of as computer games now than any other medium , " he said .

hollywood techniques and it is not just in story that the games industry is looking to improve , it is looking to hollywood scriptwriters and directors for help to improve dialogue and characterisation .

silent film producers introduced very little dialogue to early talking films because they did not change their mindset , he said .

photorealistic characters , vast game environments in high-definition detail , and artificial intelligence continue to improve .
but as the visible parts of games get closer to perfection , the tools used to tell the story in the game are also due an overhaul , according to some veteran games industry figures .
both peter molyneux , head of lionhead studios , and david braben , head of frontier developments , agree that the industry is focusing on new ways to add greater depth to stories .
" at the moment there 's a huge amount of talk about story and narrative , branching plots and multiple endings , and player-directed content , " mr molyneux said .
cut scenes the industry needed to find new alternatives to existing , outmoded storytelling techniques , said mr molyneux , whose firm is working on the sequel to its award winning role-playing title fable .
because of branching complexity , where fable had 20,000 lines of dialogue , fable 2 has about 250,000 peter molyneux lionhead studios many video games move story forward by using " cut scenes " , short expositional interludes which punctuate the play .
but cut scenes suffer from several different problems .
mr molyneux said they were " tragic moments in gameplay because gamers ' patience and tolerance for cut scenes are measured in seconds " .
research shows that many gamers skip cut scenes , preferring to get straight back into the action , he said .
multiple branching and it is not just players that they frustrate , they also cause problems for game makers too .
the main problem is tailoring play so it reaches a point where using a cut scene makes sense , said mr braben , a 25-year industry veteran , who made his name with classic title elite .
" so what you end up with is pinch points in the story which very much dictate the storyline and you almost have a game-over situation if those points are n't met , " mr braben said .
" there have been some experiments where there have been multiple cut scenes for each point .
but that creates a major issue for the amount of story creation you have to do . "
game characters are becoming less two-dimensional , experts say creating scenes that can branch in many directions is impractical because the number of possible storylines grows exponentially , said mr braben .
and though giving players lots of ways to get through a game sounds good , the psychology of the average gamer confounds its usefulness , mr molyneux has found .
" the tragic thing we found with multiple branching is what actually happens is that when gamers spoke to each other about their experiences they felt they had done the task the wrong way , " said mr molyneux .
" we found people were restarting parts of the game to get to the same thread as their friends . "
gamer choice but in spite of the complications , developers are seeking ways to give gamers more say in directing the action .
frontier 's current project , the outsider , is a political thriller in which the main character is falsely accused of killing the us president .
" we 've chosen a story where it makes sense for the player to go in many different directions , " said frontier head david braben .
" you are actively making the choices and then living with them .
people make snap decisions that are not always best for them , " he said .
" they think they can shoot their way out of a situation , but then they get painted as a killer . "
but increasing the number of game choices impacts on other aspects of game development .
" because of branching complexity , where fable had 20,000 lines of dialogue , fable 2 has about 250,000 , " said mr molyneux .
hollywood techniques and it is not just in story that the games industry is looking to improve , it is looking to hollywood scriptwriters and directors for help to improve dialogue and characterisation .
sometimes this influence is explicit .
for instance the cut scenes and in-game dialogue for frontier 's game thrillville were written by one of the scriptwriters of the simpsons .
