" then i sat on the bed and waited . " when a caretaker - whom milz graciously described as " that peasant klutz " - came into the room , she assumed that frau milz could n't have gotten ready on her own .

maria milz from blankeneim in der eifel - a picturesque town of 8,000 in the western state of north rhine-westphalia - waited exactly 100 years . these days , the lively centenarian is making headlines all over germany for her rebellious pride and loud dignity . six weeks after moving into a retirement home , she decided to move out because : " it was full of old people with gray hair . " but i looked pretty ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens like to have fun too frau milz , who strongly believes that an early bird always catches the worm , was horrified by the way she was treated by the retirement home staff . " i got up at six a.m. , took a shower and made myself pretty , " milz said .
" then i sat on the bed and waited . " when a caretaker - whom milz graciously described as " that peasant klutz " - came into the room , she assumed that frau milz could n't have gotten ready on her own . " she looked at me in such a stupid way , she must have thought : ' the old bag is off her rocker . " ' devil is in the detail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some people , dogs are better companions than other people frau milz insisted she was ready to have her breakfast , but the heartless caretaker , who showed no appreciation of the fact that frau milz was a lady of quality who had already freshened up , told her she had sleep in her eyes . " sleep in my eyes ! "
frau milz said .
" who do you think you are ? ! " that was the drop that made the cup of frau milz 's discontent run over .

his lawyers have also said they may take the case to the european court of justice in luxembourg . " that will be the last appeal , " motassadeq 's lawyer udo jacob told news agency ap on friday . jacob added that friday 's decision by germany 's highest court had not impressed him .

maria milz from blankeneim in der eifel - a picturesque town of 8,000 in the western state of north rhine-westphalia - waited exactly 100 years . these days , the lively centenarian is making headlines all over germany for her rebellious pride and loud dignity . six weeks after moving into a retirement home , she decided to move out because : " it was full of old people with gray hair . " but i looked pretty ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens like to have fun too frau milz , who strongly believes that an early bird always catches the worm , was horrified by the way she was treated by the retirement home staff . " i got up at six a.m. , took a shower and made myself pretty , " milz said .
" then i sat on the bed and waited . " when a caretaker - whom milz graciously described as " that peasant klutz " - came into the room , she assumed that frau milz could n't have gotten ready on her own . " she looked at me in such a stupid way , she must have thought : ' the old bag is off her rocker . " ' devil is in the detail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some people , dogs are better companions than other people frau milz insisted she was ready to have her breakfast , but the heartless caretaker , who showed no appreciation of the fact that frau milz was a lady of quality who had already freshened up , told her she had sleep in her eyes . " sleep in my eyes ! "
frau milz said .
" who do you think you are ? ! " that was the drop that made the cup of frau milz 's discontent run over .
in justified indignation , she called her daughter , packed her bags and moved out . " i was not mature enough for the retirement home , " she said . frau milz is now back home , enjoying the company of her faithful wiener dog inka . " she understands every word , " frau milz said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

his resignation is a part of a major restructuring at the automaking giant . europe 's biggest carmaker announced on thursday that the head of its flagship vw brand , wolfgang bernhard , will be leaving . the move is a part of a major reshuffling of the vw group led by new chief executive officer martin winterkorn , who was promoted after bernd pischetsrieder stepped down on jan .
1 . winterkorn , the former head of audi , will also assume responsibility for the vw brand and the carmaker 's research and development unit . in a brief statement released thursday , the wolfsburg-based company said that bernhard , " will leave the company by mutual agreement as of jan .
31 , 2007 as part of the reorganization of responsibilities within the volkswagen group . " bernhard has been chairman of the volkswagen brand group since may 2005 and spearheaded a series of cost-cutting measures including cutting its german workforce by 20,000 jobs and lengthening the work week . as part of the restructuring , the company also announced that vw 's other brands - skoda , bentley , bugatti , audi , seat and lamborghini - will operate independently instead of in two groups , with all brands reporting results separately this year . an auto maverick bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bernhard spearheaded changes at vw before being ousted wolfgang bernhard joined the vw group from daimlerchrysler after being credited with turning around the struggling chrysler brand and cutting 26,000 jobs . according to reports , bernhard handed in his resignation to the volkswagen supervisory board at a meeting thursday .
the move was highly anticipated after bernhard was passed over for the chief executive position . bernhard 's resignation has led to speculation that the former chrysler executive might be heading back to detroit to take over the struggling us carmaker .
however , he would have to negotiate out of a non-compete clause in his vw contract . known for his sometimes abrasive methods , bernhard is regarded as a tough executive who is willing to do what needs to be done in order to bring a company out of the red .
his appointment in 2005 was greeted warmly by financial analysts . throughout his tenure at vw , bernhard pushed hard to cut costs and increase productivity .
in the process he may have angered members of the vw board including chairman ferdinand piech . a power struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand piech has been fighting for greater control over vw by porsche this latest move is seen as part of a long-time power struggle behind the doors at volkswagen as luxury carmaker porsche has been fighting to gain greater control of the vw group . porsche , which is controlled by vw 's supervisory board chief ferdinand piech , now owns just over 21 percent of volkswagen and is pushing to increase its stake to 27.4 percent and perhaps extending that to 29.9 percent . according to german law , once porsche holds a 30 percent control , it would be forced into launching a takeover bid . all this assumes that a german court will overturn the so-called volkswagen law , which was enacted to prevent a hostile takeover of the carmaker and is preventing porsche from raising its current stake .
a decision is expected in february . in an interview with business week on wednesday , porsche chairman wendelin wiedeking said that as the major shareholder of vw , porsche would be able to share some of the product development costs and aggressively push for expansion into new markets like china . " everybody knows that all the new technologies you have to use for the environment and safety are getting much more expensive .

vw is the biggest shareholder in both groups . thursday 's board meeting follows a turbulent period for the northern germany-based company with several former senior executives facing court cases over a sex and bribery scandal that has badly shaken the group . on sunday , vw announced that its group vehicle sales across the globe rose 9.3 percent to 5.73 million units in 2006 , with the volkswagen brand rising by 10 percent . both totals were company records . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers expect record 2006 us sales german carmakers are projecting record sales of 900,000 vehicles for 2006 - a year that marked steady setbacks for us producers .

11 accomplice may appeal to eu court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's lawyers are leaving no stone unturned in an attempt to clear him germany 's highest court on friday rejected attempts by a moroccan accomplice in the sept 11 , 2001 terror attacks in the united states to have his guilty verdict declared unconstitutional . the karlsruhe-based federal constitutional court said the attempt by mounir el motassadeq was inadmissible . motassadeq , who was friends with members of the hamburg-based terror cell involved in the suicide attacks , was found guilty in november of being an accessory to murder in the deaths of 246 passengers and crew on the four hijacked aircraft used in the attacks . he was sentenced to 15 years in prison by a court in hamburg on monday . but his five-year legal battle is set to continue as his lawyers turn to germany 's federal court of justice to appeal his sentence .
his lawyers have also said they may take the case to the european court of justice in luxembourg . " that will be the last appeal , " motassadeq 's lawyer udo jacob told news agency ap on friday . jacob added that friday 's decision by germany 's highest court had not impressed him . " i still think that basic rights have been violated , " jacob said . guilty of " immense wrong " motassadeq , 32 , has claimed throughout the legal saga , which saw him in and out of several courtrooms , he was friends with the hijackers but did not know about their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed atta and his friends are thought to have plotted the attacks in hamburg he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of the hamburg-based cell , including the presumed ringleader of the attacks , mohammed atta , and to have helped cover up their whereabouts . the sentencing hearing for motassadeq in hamburg this week was marked by delays as the moroccan 's lawyers filed a series of appeals to halt the process . eventually however the court followed the recommendation of state prosecutor walter hemberger who said motassadeq deserved the toughest sentence possible under german law because he had committed an " immense wrong .

11 accomplice may appeal to eu court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's lawyers are leaving no stone unturned in an attempt to clear him germany 's highest court on friday rejected attempts by a moroccan accomplice in the sept 11 , 2001 terror attacks in the united states to have his guilty verdict declared unconstitutional . the karlsruhe-based federal constitutional court said the attempt by mounir el motassadeq was inadmissible . motassadeq , who was friends with members of the hamburg-based terror cell involved in the suicide attacks , was found guilty in november of being an accessory to murder in the deaths of 246 passengers and crew on the four hijacked aircraft used in the attacks . he was sentenced to 15 years in prison by a court in hamburg on monday . but his five-year legal battle is set to continue as his lawyers turn to germany 's federal court of justice to appeal his sentence .
his lawyers have also said they may take the case to the european court of justice in luxembourg . " that will be the last appeal , " motassadeq 's lawyer udo jacob told news agency ap on friday . jacob added that friday 's decision by germany 's highest court had not impressed him . " i still think that basic rights have been violated , " jacob said . guilty of " immense wrong " motassadeq , 32 , has claimed throughout the legal saga , which saw him in and out of several courtrooms , he was friends with the hijackers but did not know about their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed atta and his friends are thought to have plotted the attacks in hamburg he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of the hamburg-based cell , including the presumed ringleader of the attacks , mohammed atta , and to have helped cover up their whereabouts . the sentencing hearing for motassadeq in hamburg this week was marked by delays as the moroccan 's lawyers filed a series of appeals to halt the process . eventually however the court followed the recommendation of state prosecutor walter hemberger who said motassadeq deserved the toughest sentence possible under german law because he had committed an " immense wrong .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 12.01.2007 resignation of key executive leads to uncertainty at volkswagen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shake-up is underway at vw in a highly anticipated move , wolfgang bernhard will be leaving his post as head of the vw brand by the end of january .
his resignation is a part of a major restructuring at the automaking giant . europe 's biggest carmaker announced on thursday that the head of its flagship vw brand , wolfgang bernhard , will be leaving . the move is a part of a major reshuffling of the vw group led by new chief executive officer martin winterkorn , who was promoted after bernd pischetsrieder stepped down on jan .
1 . winterkorn , the former head of audi , will also assume responsibility for the vw brand and the carmaker 's research and development unit . in a brief statement released thursday , the wolfsburg-based company said that bernhard , " will leave the company by mutual agreement as of jan .
31 , 2007 as part of the reorganization of responsibilities within the volkswagen group . " bernhard has been chairman of the volkswagen brand group since may 2005 and spearheaded a series of cost-cutting measures including cutting its german workforce by 20,000 jobs and lengthening the work week . as part of the restructuring , the company also announced that vw 's other brands - skoda , bentley , bugatti , audi , seat and lamborghini - will operate independently instead of in two groups , with all brands reporting results separately this year . an auto maverick bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bernhard spearheaded changes at vw before being ousted wolfgang bernhard joined the vw group from daimlerchrysler after being credited with turning around the struggling chrysler brand and cutting 26,000 jobs . according to reports , bernhard handed in his resignation to the volkswagen supervisory board at a meeting thursday .
the move was highly anticipated after bernhard was passed over for the chief executive position . bernhard 's resignation has led to speculation that the former chrysler executive might be heading back to detroit to take over the struggling us carmaker .
however , he would have to negotiate out of a non-compete clause in his vw contract . known for his sometimes abrasive methods , bernhard is regarded as a tough executive who is willing to do what needs to be done in order to bring a company out of the red .
his appointment in 2005 was greeted warmly by financial analysts . throughout his tenure at vw , bernhard pushed hard to cut costs and increase productivity .
in the process he may have angered members of the vw board including chairman ferdinand piech . a power struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand piech has been fighting for greater control over vw by porsche this latest move is seen as part of a long-time power struggle behind the doors at volkswagen as luxury carmaker porsche has been fighting to gain greater control of the vw group . porsche , which is controlled by vw 's supervisory board chief ferdinand piech , now owns just over 21 percent of volkswagen and is pushing to increase its stake to 27.4 percent and perhaps extending that to 29.9 percent . according to german law , once porsche holds a 30 percent control , it would be forced into launching a takeover bid . all this assumes that a german court will overturn the so-called volkswagen law , which was enacted to prevent a hostile takeover of the carmaker and is preventing porsche from raising its current stake .
a decision is expected in february . in an interview with business week on wednesday , porsche chairman wendelin wiedeking said that as the major shareholder of vw , porsche would be able to share some of the product development costs and aggressively push for expansion into new markets like china . " everybody knows that all the new technologies you have to use for the environment and safety are getting much more expensive .
you need partners willing to share technologies and thinking , " said wiedeking . ups and downs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is trying to buy a controlling stake in vw the volkswagen board also announced thursday that it had rejected german truckmaker man 's hostile 10.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.3 billion -rrb- takeover bid for swedish rival scania . the board hoped that the two companies could work together to reach a " friendly " merger .
vw is the biggest shareholder in both groups . thursday 's board meeting follows a turbulent period for the northern germany-based company with several former senior executives facing court cases over a sex and bribery scandal that has badly shaken the group . on sunday , vw announced that its group vehicle sales across the globe rose 9.3 percent to 5.73 million units in 2006 , with the volkswagen brand rising by 10 percent . both totals were company records . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers expect record 2006 us sales german carmakers are projecting record sales of 900,000 vehicles for 2006 - a year that marked steady setbacks for us producers .

" we shall study this request and take a decision in good time , " steinmeier told reporters in brussels , adding that he would discuss a nato request made in december for reconnaissance planes at an alliance meeting on jan .
26 . top official says deployment done deal earlier , germany 's former defense minister , the social democrats ' parliamentary group leader peter struck , told reporters in brussels that germany would deploy the six aircraft requested by nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers have so far largely been based in kabul struck said the fighter-bombers would be based in the capital kabul but used in the south of the country , a bastion of taliban insurgents who surprised nato last year with fiercer than expected resistance . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said he would welcome such a move . " if the german government would announce , or has announced , the deployment of tornado aircraft in a reconnaissance role to afghanistan , i would highly welcome such a decision , " he told reporters . struck said it might be possible to send the fighter-bombers for two or three months but that a deployment of seven months , for example , " would surely not be covered by the current mandate . " politicians want parliament to approve struck 's comments , however , have sparked anger among some members of germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- as well as in the opposition . some have raised doubts about whether the sending of military aircraft is possible without an additional parliamentary mandate than the one that presently covers the deployment of some 3,000 german peacekeepers in the calmer north of the country . volker kauder , cdu parliamentary chief , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper the issue could only be solved once the government bared all the facts . " one thing is clear : there 's no sneaking past the parliament , " kauder said . but germany 's opposition reacted with anger to news of a possible imminent deployment of the reconnaissance planes . hans-christian ströbele , deputy head of the green party said he would consider lodging a complaint with germany 's federal constitutional court if the government went ahead with the deployment without parliamentary approval . germany under pressure at the same time , if germany were to go ahead with the deployment of the reconnaissance planes , it could deflect criticism that the country has ignored calls to help provide reinforcements to fight taliban-led insurgents in the south and preferred to keep its troops in the relatively calm north . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rugged terrain of southern afghanistan remains the heartland of the taliban nato leaders agreed in november to move troops around inside afghanistan in emergency cases , as commanders demanded more flexibility to fight the insurgents . the insurgency claimed the lives of around 3,700 people last year - four times more than in 2005 , according to official figures .
around 120 foreign soldiers were killed . britain , canada and the netherlands led the nato push south in mid-2006 and have borne the brunt of causalities in the fight between the 32,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and the taliban . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany split over plane deployment to afghanistan germany 's government is split over whether the decision to send spy planes to afghanistan , which could see german troops deployed in the volatile south , needs parliamentary approval .
-lrb- 22.12.2006 -rrb- " in afghanistan , damage limitation is the only realistic option " nato 's mission in afghanistan has n't been a failure , but it still could be , cambridge university political scientist christopher hill told dw-world.de. -lrb- 27.11.2006 -rrb- us calls on germany for riskier afghanistan missions the us administration is increasing pressure on germany to lift restrictions on its afghanistan directive and help reinforce combat troops in the south to stop taliban insurgents .

11 accomplice may appeal to eu court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's lawyers are leaving no stone unturned in an attempt to clear him germany 's highest court on friday rejected attempts by a moroccan accomplice in the sept 11 , 2001 terror attacks in the united states to have his guilty verdict declared unconstitutional . the karlsruhe-based federal constitutional court said the attempt by mounir el motassadeq was inadmissible . motassadeq , who was friends with members of the hamburg-based terror cell involved in the suicide attacks , was found guilty in november of being an accessory to murder in the deaths of 246 passengers and crew on the four hijacked aircraft used in the attacks . he was sentenced to 15 years in prison by a court in hamburg on monday . but his five-year legal battle is set to continue as his lawyers turn to germany 's federal court of justice to appeal his sentence .

" if you take the third step before the first , you will stumble , " glos said . glos initially opposed to eu plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos has switched tracks on energy glos ' comments come days after the commission unveiled an ambitious energy policy aimed at cutting greenhouse emissions and liberalizing the bloc 's energy sector . at the time , glos joined germany 's big energy firms in criticizing proposals to dilute the big energy companies ' power .
the minister said germany would " not take any hasty steps " and first verify if the plan was compatible with the country 's constitution . glos 's comments to the financial times mark a sharp departure from his earlier stance . " we must first make sure that the decisions made so far , for instance the obligation legally to unbundle distribution and production , are implemented everywhere , " glos said in the interview friday .
" that 's a prerequisite . " the minister added that an independent operator could take over management of the distribution networks of integrated energy firms , according to the paper . the companies should only be broken up if that failed to boost competition , he said .
" if the independent operator model works , we will not need such a step . " " not enough competition in german market " glos also said in friday 's interview that europe should only establish an energy regulator if closer cooperation between existing national agencies failed to boost competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as current eu president , chancellor merkel wants to focus on energy " we used to defend the line that national regulators are all we need , but we must admit this is not sufficient , " glos said .
" we do not have enough competition in the german market . " we need to now discuss with the other member states about how much national competence we want to concede to europe , " he added . as head of the six-month rotating eu presidency , germany has made fighting climate change a priority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 12.01.2007 resignation of key executive leads to uncertainty at volkswagen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shake-up is underway at vw in a highly anticipated move , wolfgang bernhard will be leaving his post as head of the vw brand by the end of january .
his resignation is a part of a major restructuring at the automaking giant . europe 's biggest carmaker announced on thursday that the head of its flagship vw brand , wolfgang bernhard , will be leaving . the move is a part of a major reshuffling of the vw group led by new chief executive officer martin winterkorn , who was promoted after bernd pischetsrieder stepped down on jan .
1 . winterkorn , the former head of audi , will also assume responsibility for the vw brand and the carmaker 's research and development unit . in a brief statement released thursday , the wolfsburg-based company said that bernhard , " will leave the company by mutual agreement as of jan .
31 , 2007 as part of the reorganization of responsibilities within the volkswagen group . " bernhard has been chairman of the volkswagen brand group since may 2005 and spearheaded a series of cost-cutting measures including cutting its german workforce by 20,000 jobs and lengthening the work week . as part of the restructuring , the company also announced that vw 's other brands - skoda , bentley , bugatti , audi , seat and lamborghini - will operate independently instead of in two groups , with all brands reporting results separately this year . an auto maverick bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bernhard spearheaded changes at vw before being ousted wolfgang bernhard joined the vw group from daimlerchrysler after being credited with turning around the struggling chrysler brand and cutting 26,000 jobs . according to reports , bernhard handed in his resignation to the volkswagen supervisory board at a meeting thursday .
the move was highly anticipated after bernhard was passed over for the chief executive position . bernhard 's resignation has led to speculation that the former chrysler executive might be heading back to detroit to take over the struggling us carmaker .

in the us , california-based apple has entered into an exclusive agreement with america 's biggest mobile phone operator , cingular .

" owning an apartment that 's really cheap in the middle of such a vibrant and culturally rich city is a dream come true , " said munch of her 100-square-meter -lrb- 1,080-square-feet -rrb- home located on the 19th floor of a prefabricated high-rise close to where the berlin wall once stood . the apartment , which offers sweeping views of the city , is five minutes away from a subway station in the city 's center . flood of foreign homebuyers notwithstanding berlin 's sluggish economy and high jobless rate , munch is among a wave of foreign buyers lured to the german capital in recent years by some of the lowest property prices in europe .
most of the investors are from britain , ireland and the us , followed by spain , norway , sweden and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the area around berlin 's new hauptbahnhof rail station might be the next big thing jürgen michael schick , vice president of the ivd real estate association of germany said that over 10 billion euros were spent on berlin properties in 2006 .
" foreign investors accounted for more than 66 percent of those transactions , " he said . the surge in interest is fuelled by coverage in the international media with british dailies such as the observer and the daily telegraph labeling berlin a good place to buy a second home and the property pages of newspapers in france , spain and ireland routinely advertising real estate in the german capital . " cheapest metropolis in europe " " berlin is the cheapest metropolis in europe .
real estate values are significantly lower than those in london , new york or even prague and moscow , " said philipp c. tabert , head of berlin-based real estate consultancy winters & hirsch , whose firm generated annual revenue of 220 million euros last year .
almost 95 percent of tabert 's clients are from britain , ireland , america , spain , italy and france . the dramatically low-cost nature of berlin 's property market is obvious when compared with other european cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tv tower in berlin 's mitte district according to statistics , real estate prices for berlin dropped every year from 1996 to 2004 .
for that same period , real estate values in london climbed 80 percent .
one estimate said a square meter for a renovated apartment in a prime area in berlin today costs around 1,500 euros , while in london it 's no less than 15,000 euros . it 's a difference that 's hard to ignore . gary savage , a teacher from london , said his 87-square-meter apartment in the heart of the coveted mitte district - for which he shelled out 145,000 euros - was a real bargain . " you could n't even buy a garage or a shed in london today for that price , " he said . eastern neighborhoods still popular foreign homebuyers are attracted to the neighborhoods of friedrichshain , prenzlauer berg and mitte in former communist-ruled east berlin - famed for their fashionable cafes , lively clubs and central locations . but investors are also increasingly shopping around in districts in western berlin such as zehlendorf and steglitz and other outlying neighborhoods , experts say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern berlin is popular in recent years , not only private homebuyers have been flocking to berlin but also increasingly private equity funds , such as new york-based cerberus capital management and goldman sachs group 's whitehall investment fund .
in 2004 , the two together bought 65,700 units of berlin 's public housing for 2.1 billion euros . in 2006 , other big investors included swedish insurance company akelius and ge real estate . " very attractive market " experts say the large-scale foreign purchases have begun to affect prices . " last year the price for residential properties in berlin increased by about 10 to 20 percent , " schick said .
but berlin still remained a " very attractive market , " he said , because it offered investors guaranteed returns . " today foreign investors are n't just looking for high yields and quick profits but are more interested in sustainability with a long-term commitment of 10 to 15 years , " schick said , adding that berlin 's home-ownership rate of just 13 percent also meant that the market still had potential to grow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic upswing is expected to attract more foreign investors experts point out that foreign investors are also emboldened by signs of an overall economic revival in germany as rising consumer confidence drives demand for housing .
the country 's economy is expected to increase by 2.5 percent this year , unemployment fell to the lowest in four years in november and business confidence surged to a 15-month high . most agree that berlin 's present property boom is here to stay as opposed to the upswing of the 1990s , which was marked by a spectacular crash when a state-owned bank had to be bailed out by the city as a result of failed real-estate investments . " in the long-term , berlin property investments will turn out to be very positive , " schick said .

" we shall study this request and take a decision in good time , " steinmeier told reporters in brussels , adding that he would discuss a nato request made in december for reconnaissance planes at an alliance meeting on jan .
26 . top official says deployment done deal earlier , germany 's former defense minister , the social democrats ' parliamentary group leader peter struck , told reporters in brussels that germany would deploy the six aircraft requested by nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers have so far largely been based in kabul struck said the fighter-bombers would be based in the capital kabul but used in the south of the country , a bastion of taliban insurgents who surprised nato last year with fiercer than expected resistance . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said he would welcome such a move . " if the german government would announce , or has announced , the deployment of tornado aircraft in a reconnaissance role to afghanistan , i would highly welcome such a decision , " he told reporters . struck said it might be possible to send the fighter-bombers for two or three months but that a deployment of seven months , for example , " would surely not be covered by the current mandate . " politicians want parliament to approve struck 's comments , however , have sparked anger among some members of germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- as well as in the opposition . some have raised doubts about whether the sending of military aircraft is possible without an additional parliamentary mandate than the one that presently covers the deployment of some 3,000 german peacekeepers in the calmer north of the country . volker kauder , cdu parliamentary chief , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper the issue could only be solved once the government bared all the facts . " one thing is clear : there 's no sneaking past the parliament , " kauder said . but germany 's opposition reacted with anger to news of a possible imminent deployment of the reconnaissance planes . hans-christian ströbele , deputy head of the green party said he would consider lodging a complaint with germany 's federal constitutional court if the government went ahead with the deployment without parliamentary approval . germany under pressure at the same time , if germany were to go ahead with the deployment of the reconnaissance planes , it could deflect criticism that the country has ignored calls to help provide reinforcements to fight taliban-led insurgents in the south and preferred to keep its troops in the relatively calm north . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rugged terrain of southern afghanistan remains the heartland of the taliban nato leaders agreed in november to move troops around inside afghanistan in emergency cases , as commanders demanded more flexibility to fight the insurgents . the insurgency claimed the lives of around 3,700 people last year - four times more than in 2005 , according to official figures .
around 120 foreign soldiers were killed . britain , canada and the netherlands led the nato push south in mid-2006 and have borne the brunt of causalities in the fight between the 32,000-strong nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and the taliban . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany split over plane deployment to afghanistan germany 's government is split over whether the decision to send spy planes to afghanistan , which could see german troops deployed in the volatile south , needs parliamentary approval .

" today foreign investors are n't just looking for high yields and quick profits but are more interested in sustainability with a long-term commitment of 10 to 15 years , " schick said , adding that berlin 's home-ownership rate of just 13 percent also meant that the market still had potential to grow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic upswing is expected to attract more foreign investors experts point out that foreign investors are also emboldened by signs of an overall economic revival in germany as rising consumer confidence drives demand for housing .
the country 's economy is expected to increase by 2.5 percent this year , unemployment fell to the lowest in four years in november and business confidence surged to a 15-month high . most agree that berlin 's present property boom is here to stay as opposed to the upswing of the 1990s , which was marked by a spectacular crash when a state-owned bank had to be bailed out by the city as a result of failed real-estate investments .

" if you take the third step before the first , you will stumble , " glos said . glos initially opposed to eu plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos has switched tracks on energy glos ' comments come days after the commission unveiled an ambitious energy policy aimed at cutting greenhouse emissions and liberalizing the bloc 's energy sector . at the time , glos joined germany 's big energy firms in criticizing proposals to dilute the big energy companies ' power .
the minister said germany would " not take any hasty steps " and first verify if the plan was compatible with the country 's constitution . glos 's comments to the financial times mark a sharp departure from his earlier stance . " we must first make sure that the decisions made so far , for instance the obligation legally to unbundle distribution and production , are implemented everywhere , " glos said in the interview friday .
" that 's a prerequisite . " the minister added that an independent operator could take over management of the distribution networks of integrated energy firms , according to the paper . the companies should only be broken up if that failed to boost competition , he said .

11 accomplice may appeal to eu court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's lawyers are leaving no stone unturned in an attempt to clear him germany 's highest court on friday rejected attempts by a moroccan accomplice in the sept 11 , 2001 terror attacks in the united states to have his guilty verdict declared unconstitutional . the karlsruhe-based federal constitutional court said the attempt by mounir el motassadeq was inadmissible . motassadeq , who was friends with members of the hamburg-based terror cell involved in the suicide attacks , was found guilty in november of being an accessory to murder in the deaths of 246 passengers and crew on the four hijacked aircraft used in the attacks . he was sentenced to 15 years in prison by a court in hamburg on monday . but his five-year legal battle is set to continue as his lawyers turn to germany 's federal court of justice to appeal his sentence .
his lawyers have also said they may take the case to the european court of justice in luxembourg . " that will be the last appeal , " motassadeq 's lawyer udo jacob told news agency ap on friday . jacob added that friday 's decision by germany 's highest court had not impressed him . " i still think that basic rights have been violated , " jacob said . guilty of " immense wrong " motassadeq , 32 , has claimed throughout the legal saga , which saw him in and out of several courtrooms , he was friends with the hijackers but did not know about their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed atta and his friends are thought to have plotted the attacks in hamburg he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of the hamburg-based cell , including the presumed ringleader of the attacks , mohammed atta , and to have helped cover up their whereabouts . the sentencing hearing for motassadeq in hamburg this week was marked by delays as the moroccan 's lawyers filed a series of appeals to halt the process . eventually however the court followed the recommendation of state prosecutor walter hemberger who said motassadeq deserved the toughest sentence possible under german law because he had committed an " immense wrong . " transatlantic tensions german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . motassadeq 's case and the perceived failure of german courts to prosecute him swiftly and successfully have strained berlin 's ties with washington over recent years . motassadeq is only the second man to be convicted of a role in the sept .

his resignation is a part of a major restructuring at the automaking giant . europe 's biggest carmaker announced on thursday that the head of its flagship vw brand , wolfgang bernhard , will be leaving . the move is a part of a major reshuffling of the vw group led by new chief executive officer martin winterkorn , who was promoted after bernd pischetsrieder stepped down on jan .
1 . winterkorn , the former head of audi , will also assume responsibility for the vw brand and the carmaker 's research and development unit . in a brief statement released thursday , the wolfsburg-based company said that bernhard , " will leave the company by mutual agreement as of jan .
31 , 2007 as part of the reorganization of responsibilities within the volkswagen group . " bernhard has been chairman of the volkswagen brand group since may 2005 and spearheaded a series of cost-cutting measures including cutting its german workforce by 20,000 jobs and lengthening the work week . as part of the restructuring , the company also announced that vw 's other brands - skoda , bentley , bugatti , audi , seat and lamborghini - will operate independently instead of in two groups , with all brands reporting results separately this year . an auto maverick bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bernhard spearheaded changes at vw before being ousted wolfgang bernhard joined the vw group from daimlerchrysler after being credited with turning around the struggling chrysler brand and cutting 26,000 jobs . according to reports , bernhard handed in his resignation to the volkswagen supervisory board at a meeting thursday .
the move was highly anticipated after bernhard was passed over for the chief executive position . bernhard 's resignation has led to speculation that the former chrysler executive might be heading back to detroit to take over the struggling us carmaker .
however , he would have to negotiate out of a non-compete clause in his vw contract . known for his sometimes abrasive methods , bernhard is regarded as a tough executive who is willing to do what needs to be done in order to bring a company out of the red .

a decision is expected in february . in an interview with business week on wednesday , porsche chairman wendelin wiedeking said that as the major shareholder of vw , porsche would be able to share some of the product development costs and aggressively push for expansion into new markets like china .

" we shall study this request and take a decision in good time , " steinmeier told reporters in brussels , adding that he would discuss a nato request made in december for reconnaissance planes at an alliance meeting on jan .
26 . top official says deployment done deal earlier , germany 's former defense minister , the social democrats ' parliamentary group leader peter struck , told reporters in brussels that germany would deploy the six aircraft requested by nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers have so far largely been based in kabul struck said the fighter-bombers would be based in the capital kabul but used in the south of the country , a bastion of taliban insurgents who surprised nato last year with fiercer than expected resistance . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said he would welcome such a move . " if the german government would announce , or has announced , the deployment of tornado aircraft in a reconnaissance role to afghanistan , i would highly welcome such a decision , " he told reporters . struck said it might be possible to send the fighter-bombers for two or three months but that a deployment of seven months , for example , " would surely not be covered by the current mandate .

" then i sat on the bed and waited . " when a caretaker - whom milz graciously described as " that peasant klutz " - came into the room , she assumed that frau milz could n't have gotten ready on her own . " she looked at me in such a stupid way , she must have thought : ' the old bag is off her rocker .

" sleep in my eyes ! "
frau milz said .
" who do you think you are ? ! " that was the drop that made the cup of frau milz 's discontent run over .
in justified indignation , she called her daughter , packed her bags and moved out .

" if you take the third step before the first , you will stumble , " glos said . glos initially opposed to eu plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos has switched tracks on energy glos ' comments come days after the commission unveiled an ambitious energy policy aimed at cutting greenhouse emissions and liberalizing the bloc 's energy sector . at the time , glos joined germany 's big energy firms in criticizing proposals to dilute the big energy companies ' power .
the minister said germany would " not take any hasty steps " and first verify if the plan was compatible with the country 's constitution . glos 's comments to the financial times mark a sharp departure from his earlier stance . " we must first make sure that the decisions made so far , for instance the obligation legally to unbundle distribution and production , are implemented everywhere , " glos said in the interview friday .
" that 's a prerequisite . " the minister added that an independent operator could take over management of the distribution networks of integrated energy firms , according to the paper . the companies should only be broken up if that failed to boost competition , he said .
" if the independent operator model works , we will not need such a step . " " not enough competition in german market " glos also said in friday 's interview that europe should only establish an energy regulator if closer cooperation between existing national agencies failed to boost competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as current eu president , chancellor merkel wants to focus on energy " we used to defend the line that national regulators are all we need , but we must admit this is not sufficient , " glos said .
" we do not have enough competition in the german market . " we need to now discuss with the other member states about how much national competence we want to concede to europe , " he added . as head of the six-month rotating eu presidency , germany has made fighting climate change a priority .
chancellor angela merkel has signaled that she wants to forge consensus among the 27-member eu on a common , long-term energy policy based on proposals from the eu commission . germany is likely to deal with the issue of a common eu energy policy at a european summit in march . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wary about eu energy policy germany reacted cautiously wednesday to an eu plan to diversify energy sources , raising concerns about the new eu president 's ability to tackle the issue in the 27-member bloc .

" if you take the third step before the first , you will stumble , " glos said . glos initially opposed to eu plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos has switched tracks on energy glos ' comments come days after the commission unveiled an ambitious energy policy aimed at cutting greenhouse emissions and liberalizing the bloc 's energy sector . at the time , glos joined germany 's big energy firms in criticizing proposals to dilute the big energy companies ' power .
the minister said germany would " not take any hasty steps " and first verify if the plan was compatible with the country 's constitution . glos 's comments to the financial times mark a sharp departure from his earlier stance . " we must first make sure that the decisions made so far , for instance the obligation legally to unbundle distribution and production , are implemented everywhere , " glos said in the interview friday .
" that 's a prerequisite . " the minister added that an independent operator could take over management of the distribution networks of integrated energy firms , according to the paper . the companies should only be broken up if that failed to boost competition , he said .
" if the independent operator model works , we will not need such a step . " " not enough competition in german market " glos also said in friday 's interview that europe should only establish an energy regulator if closer cooperation between existing national agencies failed to boost competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as current eu president , chancellor merkel wants to focus on energy " we used to defend the line that national regulators are all we need , but we must admit this is not sufficient , " glos said .
" we do not have enough competition in the german market . " we need to now discuss with the other member states about how much national competence we want to concede to europe , " he added . as head of the six-month rotating eu presidency , germany has made fighting climate change a priority .
chancellor angela merkel has signaled that she wants to forge consensus among the 27-member eu on a common , long-term energy policy based on proposals from the eu commission . germany is likely to deal with the issue of a common eu energy policy at a european summit in march . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wary about eu energy policy germany reacted cautiously wednesday to an eu plan to diversify energy sources , raising concerns about the new eu president 's ability to tackle the issue in the 27-member bloc .

" if you take the third step before the first , you will stumble , " glos said . glos initially opposed to eu plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos has switched tracks on energy glos ' comments come days after the commission unveiled an ambitious energy policy aimed at cutting greenhouse emissions and liberalizing the bloc 's energy sector . at the time , glos joined germany 's big energy firms in criticizing proposals to dilute the big energy companies ' power .
the minister said germany would " not take any hasty steps " and first verify if the plan was compatible with the country 's constitution . glos 's comments to the financial times mark a sharp departure from his earlier stance . " we must first make sure that the decisions made so far , for instance the obligation legally to unbundle distribution and production , are implemented everywhere , " glos said in the interview friday .
" that 's a prerequisite . " the minister added that an independent operator could take over management of the distribution networks of integrated energy firms , according to the paper . the companies should only be broken up if that failed to boost competition , he said .
" if the independent operator model works , we will not need such a step . " " not enough competition in german market " glos also said in friday 's interview that europe should only establish an energy regulator if closer cooperation between existing national agencies failed to boost competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as current eu president , chancellor merkel wants to focus on energy " we used to defend the line that national regulators are all we need , but we must admit this is not sufficient , " glos said .

" if the german government would announce , or has announced , the deployment of tornado aircraft in a reconnaissance role to afghanistan , i would highly welcome such a decision , " he told reporters . struck said it might be possible to send the fighter-bombers for two or three months but that a deployment of seven months , for example , " would surely not be covered by the current mandate .

" one thing is clear : there 's no sneaking past the parliament , " kauder said . but germany 's opposition reacted with anger to news of a possible imminent deployment of the reconnaissance planes . hans-christian ströbele , deputy head of the green party said he would consider lodging a complaint with germany 's federal constitutional court if the government went ahead with the deployment without parliamentary approval . germany under pressure at the same time , if germany were to go ahead with the deployment of the reconnaissance planes , it could deflect criticism that the country has ignored calls to help provide reinforcements to fight taliban-led insurgents in the south and preferred to keep its troops in the relatively calm north . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rugged terrain of southern afghanistan remains the heartland of the taliban nato leaders agreed in november to move troops around inside afghanistan in emergency cases , as commanders demanded more flexibility to fight the insurgents . the insurgency claimed the lives of around 3,700 people last year - four times more than in 2005 , according to official figures .

" if you take the third step before the first , you will stumble , " glos said . glos initially opposed to eu plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos has switched tracks on energy glos ' comments come days after the commission unveiled an ambitious energy policy aimed at cutting greenhouse emissions and liberalizing the bloc 's energy sector . at the time , glos joined germany 's big energy firms in criticizing proposals to dilute the big energy companies ' power .
the minister said germany would " not take any hasty steps " and first verify if the plan was compatible with the country 's constitution . glos 's comments to the financial times mark a sharp departure from his earlier stance . " we must first make sure that the decisions made so far , for instance the obligation legally to unbundle distribution and production , are implemented everywhere , " glos said in the interview friday .
" that 's a prerequisite . " the minister added that an independent operator could take over management of the distribution networks of integrated energy firms , according to the paper . the companies should only be broken up if that failed to boost competition , he said .
" if the independent operator model works , we will not need such a step . " " not enough competition in german market " glos also said in friday 's interview that europe should only establish an energy regulator if closer cooperation between existing national agencies failed to boost competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as current eu president , chancellor merkel wants to focus on energy " we used to defend the line that national regulators are all we need , but we must admit this is not sufficient , " glos said .
" we do not have enough competition in the german market . " we need to now discuss with the other member states about how much national competence we want to concede to europe , " he added . as head of the six-month rotating eu presidency , germany has made fighting climate change a priority .

11 accomplice may appeal to eu court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's lawyers are leaving no stone unturned in an attempt to clear him germany 's highest court on friday rejected attempts by a moroccan accomplice in the sept 11 , 2001 terror attacks in the united states to have his guilty verdict declared unconstitutional . the karlsruhe-based federal constitutional court said the attempt by mounir el motassadeq was inadmissible . motassadeq , who was friends with members of the hamburg-based terror cell involved in the suicide attacks , was found guilty in november of being an accessory to murder in the deaths of 246 passengers and crew on the four hijacked aircraft used in the attacks . he was sentenced to 15 years in prison by a court in hamburg on monday . but his five-year legal battle is set to continue as his lawyers turn to germany 's federal court of justice to appeal his sentence .
his lawyers have also said they may take the case to the european court of justice in luxembourg . " that will be the last appeal , " motassadeq 's lawyer udo jacob told news agency ap on friday . jacob added that friday 's decision by germany 's highest court had not impressed him . " i still think that basic rights have been violated , " jacob said . guilty of " immense wrong " motassadeq , 32 , has claimed throughout the legal saga , which saw him in and out of several courtrooms , he was friends with the hijackers but did not know about their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed atta and his friends are thought to have plotted the attacks in hamburg he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of the hamburg-based cell , including the presumed ringleader of the attacks , mohammed atta , and to have helped cover up their whereabouts . the sentencing hearing for motassadeq in hamburg this week was marked by delays as the moroccan 's lawyers filed a series of appeals to halt the process . eventually however the court followed the recommendation of state prosecutor walter hemberger who said motassadeq deserved the toughest sentence possible under german law because he had committed an " immense wrong . " transatlantic tensions german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . motassadeq 's case and the perceived failure of german courts to prosecute him swiftly and successfully have strained berlin 's ties with washington over recent years . motassadeq is only the second man to be convicted of a role in the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 12.01.2007 resignation of key executive leads to uncertainty at volkswagen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shake-up is underway at vw in a highly anticipated move , wolfgang bernhard will be leaving his post as head of the vw brand by the end of january .
his resignation is a part of a major restructuring at the automaking giant . europe 's biggest carmaker announced on thursday that the head of its flagship vw brand , wolfgang bernhard , will be leaving . the move is a part of a major reshuffling of the vw group led by new chief executive officer martin winterkorn , who was promoted after bernd pischetsrieder stepped down on jan .
1 . winterkorn , the former head of audi , will also assume responsibility for the vw brand and the carmaker 's research and development unit . in a brief statement released thursday , the wolfsburg-based company said that bernhard , " will leave the company by mutual agreement as of jan .
31 , 2007 as part of the reorganization of responsibilities within the volkswagen group . " bernhard has been chairman of the volkswagen brand group since may 2005 and spearheaded a series of cost-cutting measures including cutting its german workforce by 20,000 jobs and lengthening the work week . as part of the restructuring , the company also announced that vw 's other brands - skoda , bentley , bugatti , audi , seat and lamborghini - will operate independently instead of in two groups , with all brands reporting results separately this year . an auto maverick bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bernhard spearheaded changes at vw before being ousted wolfgang bernhard joined the vw group from daimlerchrysler after being credited with turning around the struggling chrysler brand and cutting 26,000 jobs . according to reports , bernhard handed in his resignation to the volkswagen supervisory board at a meeting thursday .
the move was highly anticipated after bernhard was passed over for the chief executive position . bernhard 's resignation has led to speculation that the former chrysler executive might be heading back to detroit to take over the struggling us carmaker .
however , he would have to negotiate out of a non-compete clause in his vw contract . known for his sometimes abrasive methods , bernhard is regarded as a tough executive who is willing to do what needs to be done in order to bring a company out of the red .
his appointment in 2005 was greeted warmly by financial analysts . throughout his tenure at vw , bernhard pushed hard to cut costs and increase productivity .
in the process he may have angered members of the vw board including chairman ferdinand piech . a power struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand piech has been fighting for greater control over vw by porsche this latest move is seen as part of a long-time power struggle behind the doors at volkswagen as luxury carmaker porsche has been fighting to gain greater control of the vw group . porsche , which is controlled by vw 's supervisory board chief ferdinand piech , now owns just over 21 percent of volkswagen and is pushing to increase its stake to 27.4 percent and perhaps extending that to 29.9 percent . according to german law , once porsche holds a 30 percent control , it would be forced into launching a takeover bid . all this assumes that a german court will overturn the so-called volkswagen law , which was enacted to prevent a hostile takeover of the carmaker and is preventing porsche from raising its current stake .
a decision is expected in february . in an interview with business week on wednesday , porsche chairman wendelin wiedeking said that as the major shareholder of vw , porsche would be able to share some of the product development costs and aggressively push for expansion into new markets like china . " everybody knows that all the new technologies you have to use for the environment and safety are getting much more expensive .
you need partners willing to share technologies and thinking , " said wiedeking . ups and downs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is trying to buy a controlling stake in vw the volkswagen board also announced thursday that it had rejected german truckmaker man 's hostile 10.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.3 billion -rrb- takeover bid for swedish rival scania . the board hoped that the two companies could work together to reach a " friendly " merger .
vw is the biggest shareholder in both groups . thursday 's board meeting follows a turbulent period for the northern germany-based company with several former senior executives facing court cases over a sex and bribery scandal that has badly shaken the group . on sunday , vw announced that its group vehicle sales across the globe rose 9.3 percent to 5.73 million units in 2006 , with the volkswagen brand rising by 10 percent . both totals were company records . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers expect record 2006 us sales german carmakers are projecting record sales of 900,000 vehicles for 2006 - a year that marked steady setbacks for us producers .

11 accomplice may appeal to eu court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's lawyers are leaving no stone unturned in an attempt to clear him germany 's highest court on friday rejected attempts by a moroccan accomplice in the sept 11 , 2001 terror attacks in the united states to have his guilty verdict declared unconstitutional . the karlsruhe-based federal constitutional court said the attempt by mounir el motassadeq was inadmissible . motassadeq , who was friends with members of the hamburg-based terror cell involved in the suicide attacks , was found guilty in november of being an accessory to murder in the deaths of 246 passengers and crew on the four hijacked aircraft used in the attacks . he was sentenced to 15 years in prison by a court in hamburg on monday . but his five-year legal battle is set to continue as his lawyers turn to germany 's federal court of justice to appeal his sentence .
his lawyers have also said they may take the case to the european court of justice in luxembourg . " that will be the last appeal , " motassadeq 's lawyer udo jacob told news agency ap on friday . jacob added that friday 's decision by germany 's highest court had not impressed him . " i still think that basic rights have been violated , " jacob said . guilty of " immense wrong " motassadeq , 32 , has claimed throughout the legal saga , which saw him in and out of several courtrooms , he was friends with the hijackers but did not know about their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed atta and his friends are thought to have plotted the attacks in hamburg he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of the hamburg-based cell , including the presumed ringleader of the attacks , mohammed atta , and to have helped cover up their whereabouts . the sentencing hearing for motassadeq in hamburg this week was marked by delays as the moroccan 's lawyers filed a series of appeals to halt the process . eventually however the court followed the recommendation of state prosecutor walter hemberger who said motassadeq deserved the toughest sentence possible under german law because he had committed an " immense wrong . " transatlantic tensions german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . motassadeq 's case and the perceived failure of german courts to prosecute him swiftly and successfully have strained berlin 's ties with washington over recent years . motassadeq is only the second man to be convicted of a role in the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 12.01.2007 resignation of key executive leads to uncertainty at volkswagen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shake-up is underway at vw in a highly anticipated move , wolfgang bernhard will be leaving his post as head of the vw brand by the end of january .
his resignation is a part of a major restructuring at the automaking giant . europe 's biggest carmaker announced on thursday that the head of its flagship vw brand , wolfgang bernhard , will be leaving . the move is a part of a major reshuffling of the vw group led by new chief executive officer martin winterkorn , who was promoted after bernd pischetsrieder stepped down on jan .
1 . winterkorn , the former head of audi , will also assume responsibility for the vw brand and the carmaker 's research and development unit . in a brief statement released thursday , the wolfsburg-based company said that bernhard , " will leave the company by mutual agreement as of jan .
31 , 2007 as part of the reorganization of responsibilities within the volkswagen group . " bernhard has been chairman of the volkswagen brand group since may 2005 and spearheaded a series of cost-cutting measures including cutting its german workforce by 20,000 jobs and lengthening the work week . as part of the restructuring , the company also announced that vw 's other brands - skoda , bentley , bugatti , audi , seat and lamborghini - will operate independently instead of in two groups , with all brands reporting results separately this year . an auto maverick bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bernhard spearheaded changes at vw before being ousted wolfgang bernhard joined the vw group from daimlerchrysler after being credited with turning around the struggling chrysler brand and cutting 26,000 jobs . according to reports , bernhard handed in his resignation to the volkswagen supervisory board at a meeting thursday .
the move was highly anticipated after bernhard was passed over for the chief executive position . bernhard 's resignation has led to speculation that the former chrysler executive might be heading back to detroit to take over the struggling us carmaker .
however , he would have to negotiate out of a non-compete clause in his vw contract . known for his sometimes abrasive methods , bernhard is regarded as a tough executive who is willing to do what needs to be done in order to bring a company out of the red .
his appointment in 2005 was greeted warmly by financial analysts . throughout his tenure at vw , bernhard pushed hard to cut costs and increase productivity .
in the process he may have angered members of the vw board including chairman ferdinand piech . a power struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand piech has been fighting for greater control over vw by porsche this latest move is seen as part of a long-time power struggle behind the doors at volkswagen as luxury carmaker porsche has been fighting to gain greater control of the vw group . porsche , which is controlled by vw 's supervisory board chief ferdinand piech , now owns just over 21 percent of volkswagen and is pushing to increase its stake to 27.4 percent and perhaps extending that to 29.9 percent . according to german law , once porsche holds a 30 percent control , it would be forced into launching a takeover bid . all this assumes that a german court will overturn the so-called volkswagen law , which was enacted to prevent a hostile takeover of the carmaker and is preventing porsche from raising its current stake .
a decision is expected in february . in an interview with business week on wednesday , porsche chairman wendelin wiedeking said that as the major shareholder of vw , porsche would be able to share some of the product development costs and aggressively push for expansion into new markets like china . " everybody knows that all the new technologies you have to use for the environment and safety are getting much more expensive .
you need partners willing to share technologies and thinking , " said wiedeking . ups and downs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is trying to buy a controlling stake in vw the volkswagen board also announced thursday that it had rejected german truckmaker man 's hostile 10.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.3 billion -rrb- takeover bid for swedish rival scania . the board hoped that the two companies could work together to reach a " friendly " merger .
vw is the biggest shareholder in both groups . thursday 's board meeting follows a turbulent period for the northern germany-based company with several former senior executives facing court cases over a sex and bribery scandal that has badly shaken the group . on sunday , vw announced that its group vehicle sales across the globe rose 9.3 percent to 5.73 million units in 2006 , with the volkswagen brand rising by 10 percent . both totals were company records . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers expect record 2006 us sales german carmakers are projecting record sales of 900,000 vehicles for 2006 - a year that marked steady setbacks for us producers .

11 accomplice may appeal to eu court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's lawyers are leaving no stone unturned in an attempt to clear him germany 's highest court on friday rejected attempts by a moroccan accomplice in the sept 11 , 2001 terror attacks in the united states to have his guilty verdict declared unconstitutional . the karlsruhe-based federal constitutional court said the attempt by mounir el motassadeq was inadmissible . motassadeq , who was friends with members of the hamburg-based terror cell involved in the suicide attacks , was found guilty in november of being an accessory to murder in the deaths of 246 passengers and crew on the four hijacked aircraft used in the attacks . he was sentenced to 15 years in prison by a court in hamburg on monday . but his five-year legal battle is set to continue as his lawyers turn to germany 's federal court of justice to appeal his sentence .
his lawyers have also said they may take the case to the european court of justice in luxembourg . " that will be the last appeal , " motassadeq 's lawyer udo jacob told news agency ap on friday . jacob added that friday 's decision by germany 's highest court had not impressed him . " i still think that basic rights have been violated , " jacob said . guilty of " immense wrong " motassadeq , 32 , has claimed throughout the legal saga , which saw him in and out of several courtrooms , he was friends with the hijackers but did not know about their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed atta and his friends are thought to have plotted the attacks in hamburg he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of the hamburg-based cell , including the presumed ringleader of the attacks , mohammed atta , and to have helped cover up their whereabouts . the sentencing hearing for motassadeq in hamburg this week was marked by delays as the moroccan 's lawyers filed a series of appeals to halt the process . eventually however the court followed the recommendation of state prosecutor walter hemberger who said motassadeq deserved the toughest sentence possible under german law because he had committed an " immense wrong . " transatlantic tensions german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . motassadeq 's case and the perceived failure of german courts to prosecute him swiftly and successfully have strained berlin 's ties with washington over recent years . motassadeq is only the second man to be convicted of a role in the sept .

in the us , california-based apple has entered into an exclusive agreement with america 's biggest mobile phone operator , cingular .
whether the company with what many are calling the midas touch will do the same in europe is unclear , especially since the european market is more fragmented than in the us .
it is not yet known how contracts between apple and mobile phone operators will be structured . but major phone operators in the uk are reported to already be wrangling for apple 's favor .
telefonica , the spanish company which owns o2 - operating in both germany and the uk - has held preliminary talks with apple chairman steve jobs , according to the times , a uk daily . the paper reports that for the uk market , apple is expected to offer the phone exclusively to one network operator .
besides o2 , vodafone , orange and t-mobile , all big presences in the uk , are expected to bid for the contract . germans low key for now with the high-decibel buzz currently around the multifunctional iphone mobile device , analysts say they are n't surprised that the maneuvering by operators has already started , although many , especially in germany , are keeping quiet about it . a spokesperson from vodaphone d2 would only describe the iphone as " very interesting , " given that the device fits in well with the company 's strategy of combining multimedia and a music player into its phones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iphones are going to be expensive , but still expected to sell well the headquarters of t-mobile , the mobile arm of deutsche telekom , was also reserved : " we 're reviewing if we want to market the iphone . " marketing the new device , which most critics are raving about , could be very interesting for providers .
despite the iphone 's big price tag - the starting price in the us is $ 499 -lrb- 385 euros -rrb- - it is expected to be a bestseller for apple .
that could convince mobile phone providers to pay a higher price to have their brand exclusively aligned with the device . the times has reported that in britain , operators are expected to compete aggressively for the exclusive rights , since they are seeking an edge over competitors in an ever-tighter market . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mobile boss takes seat at top of deutsche telekom rene obermann , previously the head of telekom 's profitable wireless unit , was named the ceo of europe 's largest telecommunications company on monday , following the resignation of kai-uwe ricke .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 12.01.2007 resignation of key executive leads to uncertainty at volkswagen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shake-up is underway at vw in a highly anticipated move , wolfgang bernhard will be leaving his post as head of the vw brand by the end of january .
his resignation is a part of a major restructuring at the automaking giant . europe 's biggest carmaker announced on thursday that the head of its flagship vw brand , wolfgang bernhard , will be leaving . the move is a part of a major reshuffling of the vw group led by new chief executive officer martin winterkorn , who was promoted after bernd pischetsrieder stepped down on jan .
1 . winterkorn , the former head of audi , will also assume responsibility for the vw brand and the carmaker 's research and development unit . in a brief statement released thursday , the wolfsburg-based company said that bernhard , " will leave the company by mutual agreement as of jan .
31 , 2007 as part of the reorganization of responsibilities within the volkswagen group . " bernhard has been chairman of the volkswagen brand group since may 2005 and spearheaded a series of cost-cutting measures including cutting its german workforce by 20,000 jobs and lengthening the work week . as part of the restructuring , the company also announced that vw 's other brands - skoda , bentley , bugatti , audi , seat and lamborghini - will operate independently instead of in two groups , with all brands reporting results separately this year . an auto maverick bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bernhard spearheaded changes at vw before being ousted wolfgang bernhard joined the vw group from daimlerchrysler after being credited with turning around the struggling chrysler brand and cutting 26,000 jobs . according to reports , bernhard handed in his resignation to the volkswagen supervisory board at a meeting thursday .
the move was highly anticipated after bernhard was passed over for the chief executive position . bernhard 's resignation has led to speculation that the former chrysler executive might be heading back to detroit to take over the struggling us carmaker .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 12.01.2007 lured by property bargains , foreign investors flock to berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prenzlauer berg in east berlin is one of the most popular destinations for foreign buyers drawn by some of the lowest property prices in europe and signs of an economic revival in germany , foreign investors are rushing to berlin to get a piece of the hot real estate market . christine munch , a 31-year-old graphic designer from norway , last year bought an apartment in berlin 's mitte neighborhood for 157,000 euros -lrb- $ 203,000 -rrb- , or less than at least three times the amount she would have paid for a comparable place in oslo . " owning an apartment that 's really cheap in the middle of such a vibrant and culturally rich city is a dream come true , " said munch of her 100-square-meter -lrb- 1,080-square-feet -rrb- home located on the 19th floor of a prefabricated high-rise close to where the berlin wall once stood . the apartment , which offers sweeping views of the city , is five minutes away from a subway station in the city 's center . flood of foreign homebuyers notwithstanding berlin 's sluggish economy and high jobless rate , munch is among a wave of foreign buyers lured to the german capital in recent years by some of the lowest property prices in europe .
most of the investors are from britain , ireland and the us , followed by spain , norway , sweden and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the area around berlin 's new hauptbahnhof rail station might be the next big thing jürgen michael schick , vice president of the ivd real estate association of germany said that over 10 billion euros were spent on berlin properties in 2006 .
" foreign investors accounted for more than 66 percent of those transactions , " he said . the surge in interest is fuelled by coverage in the international media with british dailies such as the observer and the daily telegraph labeling berlin a good place to buy a second home and the property pages of newspapers in france , spain and ireland routinely advertising real estate in the german capital . " cheapest metropolis in europe " " berlin is the cheapest metropolis in europe .
real estate values are significantly lower than those in london , new york or even prague and moscow , " said philipp c. tabert , head of berlin-based real estate consultancy winters & hirsch , whose firm generated annual revenue of 220 million euros last year .
almost 95 percent of tabert 's clients are from britain , ireland , america , spain , italy and france . the dramatically low-cost nature of berlin 's property market is obvious when compared with other european cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tv tower in berlin 's mitte district according to statistics , real estate prices for berlin dropped every year from 1996 to 2004 .
for that same period , real estate values in london climbed 80 percent .

his resignation is a part of a major restructuring at the automaking giant . europe 's biggest carmaker announced on thursday that the head of its flagship vw brand , wolfgang bernhard , will be leaving . the move is a part of a major reshuffling of the vw group led by new chief executive officer martin winterkorn , who was promoted after bernd pischetsrieder stepped down on jan .
1 . winterkorn , the former head of audi , will also assume responsibility for the vw brand and the carmaker 's research and development unit . in a brief statement released thursday , the wolfsburg-based company said that bernhard , " will leave the company by mutual agreement as of jan .
31 , 2007 as part of the reorganization of responsibilities within the volkswagen group . " bernhard has been chairman of the volkswagen brand group since may 2005 and spearheaded a series of cost-cutting measures including cutting its german workforce by 20,000 jobs and lengthening the work week . as part of the restructuring , the company also announced that vw 's other brands - skoda , bentley , bugatti , audi , seat and lamborghini - will operate independently instead of in two groups , with all brands reporting results separately this year . an auto maverick bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bernhard spearheaded changes at vw before being ousted wolfgang bernhard joined the vw group from daimlerchrysler after being credited with turning around the struggling chrysler brand and cutting 26,000 jobs . according to reports , bernhard handed in his resignation to the volkswagen supervisory board at a meeting thursday .
the move was highly anticipated after bernhard was passed over for the chief executive position . bernhard 's resignation has led to speculation that the former chrysler executive might be heading back to detroit to take over the struggling us carmaker .
however , he would have to negotiate out of a non-compete clause in his vw contract . known for his sometimes abrasive methods , bernhard is regarded as a tough executive who is willing to do what needs to be done in order to bring a company out of the red .
his appointment in 2005 was greeted warmly by financial analysts . throughout his tenure at vw , bernhard pushed hard to cut costs and increase productivity .
in the process he may have angered members of the vw board including chairman ferdinand piech . a power struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand piech has been fighting for greater control over vw by porsche this latest move is seen as part of a long-time power struggle behind the doors at volkswagen as luxury carmaker porsche has been fighting to gain greater control of the vw group . porsche , which is controlled by vw 's supervisory board chief ferdinand piech , now owns just over 21 percent of volkswagen and is pushing to increase its stake to 27.4 percent and perhaps extending that to 29.9 percent . according to german law , once porsche holds a 30 percent control , it would be forced into launching a takeover bid . all this assumes that a german court will overturn the so-called volkswagen law , which was enacted to prevent a hostile takeover of the carmaker and is preventing porsche from raising its current stake .
a decision is expected in february . in an interview with business week on wednesday , porsche chairman wendelin wiedeking said that as the major shareholder of vw , porsche would be able to share some of the product development costs and aggressively push for expansion into new markets like china . " everybody knows that all the new technologies you have to use for the environment and safety are getting much more expensive .
you need partners willing to share technologies and thinking , " said wiedeking . ups and downs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is trying to buy a controlling stake in vw the volkswagen board also announced thursday that it had rejected german truckmaker man 's hostile 10.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.3 billion -rrb- takeover bid for swedish rival scania . the board hoped that the two companies could work together to reach a " friendly " merger .
vw is the biggest shareholder in both groups . thursday 's board meeting follows a turbulent period for the northern germany-based company with several former senior executives facing court cases over a sex and bribery scandal that has badly shaken the group . on sunday , vw announced that its group vehicle sales across the globe rose 9.3 percent to 5.73 million units in 2006 , with the volkswagen brand rising by 10 percent . both totals were company records . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers expect record 2006 us sales german carmakers are projecting record sales of 900,000 vehicles for 2006 - a year that marked steady setbacks for us producers .

his resignation is a part of a major restructuring at the automaking giant . europe 's biggest carmaker announced on thursday that the head of its flagship vw brand , wolfgang bernhard , will be leaving . the move is a part of a major reshuffling of the vw group led by new chief executive officer martin winterkorn , who was promoted after bernd pischetsrieder stepped down on jan .

in the us , california-based apple has entered into an exclusive agreement with america 's biggest mobile phone operator , cingular .
whether the company with what many are calling the midas touch will do the same in europe is unclear , especially since the european market is more fragmented than in the us .
it is not yet known how contracts between apple and mobile phone operators will be structured . but major phone operators in the uk are reported to already be wrangling for apple 's favor .
telefonica , the spanish company which owns o2 - operating in both germany and the uk - has held preliminary talks with apple chairman steve jobs , according to the times , a uk daily . the paper reports that for the uk market , apple is expected to offer the phone exclusively to one network operator .
besides o2 , vodafone , orange and t-mobile , all big presences in the uk , are expected to bid for the contract . germans low key for now with the high-decibel buzz currently around the multifunctional iphone mobile device , analysts say they are n't surprised that the maneuvering by operators has already started , although many , especially in germany , are keeping quiet about it . a spokesperson from vodaphone d2 would only describe the iphone as " very interesting , " given that the device fits in well with the company 's strategy of combining multimedia and a music player into its phones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iphones are going to be expensive , but still expected to sell well the headquarters of t-mobile , the mobile arm of deutsche telekom , was also reserved : " we 're reviewing if we want to market the iphone . " marketing the new device , which most critics are raving about , could be very interesting for providers .
despite the iphone 's big price tag - the starting price in the us is $ 499 -lrb- 385 euros -rrb- - it is expected to be a bestseller for apple .
that could convince mobile phone providers to pay a higher price to have their brand exclusively aligned with the device . the times has reported that in britain , operators are expected to compete aggressively for the exclusive rights , since they are seeking an edge over competitors in an ever-tighter market . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mobile boss takes seat at top of deutsche telekom rene obermann , previously the head of telekom 's profitable wireless unit , was named the ceo of europe 's largest telecommunications company on monday , following the resignation of kai-uwe ricke .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 12.01.2007 lured by property bargains , foreign investors flock to berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prenzlauer berg in east berlin is one of the most popular destinations for foreign buyers drawn by some of the lowest property prices in europe and signs of an economic revival in germany , foreign investors are rushing to berlin to get a piece of the hot real estate market . christine munch , a 31-year-old graphic designer from norway , last year bought an apartment in berlin 's mitte neighborhood for 157,000 euros -lrb- $ 203,000 -rrb- , or less than at least three times the amount she would have paid for a comparable place in oslo . " owning an apartment that 's really cheap in the middle of such a vibrant and culturally rich city is a dream come true , " said munch of her 100-square-meter -lrb- 1,080-square-feet -rrb- home located on the 19th floor of a prefabricated high-rise close to where the berlin wall once stood . the apartment , which offers sweeping views of the city , is five minutes away from a subway station in the city 's center . flood of foreign homebuyers notwithstanding berlin 's sluggish economy and high jobless rate , munch is among a wave of foreign buyers lured to the german capital in recent years by some of the lowest property prices in europe .
most of the investors are from britain , ireland and the us , followed by spain , norway , sweden and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the area around berlin 's new hauptbahnhof rail station might be the next big thing jürgen michael schick , vice president of the ivd real estate association of germany said that over 10 billion euros were spent on berlin properties in 2006 .
" foreign investors accounted for more than 66 percent of those transactions , " he said . the surge in interest is fuelled by coverage in the international media with british dailies such as the observer and the daily telegraph labeling berlin a good place to buy a second home and the property pages of newspapers in france , spain and ireland routinely advertising real estate in the german capital . " cheapest metropolis in europe " " berlin is the cheapest metropolis in europe .
real estate values are significantly lower than those in london , new york or even prague and moscow , " said philipp c. tabert , head of berlin-based real estate consultancy winters & hirsch , whose firm generated annual revenue of 220 million euros last year .
almost 95 percent of tabert 's clients are from britain , ireland , america , spain , italy and france . the dramatically low-cost nature of berlin 's property market is obvious when compared with other european cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tv tower in berlin 's mitte district according to statistics , real estate prices for berlin dropped every year from 1996 to 2004 .

" owning an apartment that 's really cheap in the middle of such a vibrant and culturally rich city is a dream come true , " said munch of her 100-square-meter -lrb- 1,080-square-feet -rrb- home located on the 19th floor of a prefabricated high-rise close to where the berlin wall once stood . the apartment , which offers sweeping views of the city , is five minutes away from a subway station in the city 's center . flood of foreign homebuyers notwithstanding berlin 's sluggish economy and high jobless rate , munch is among a wave of foreign buyers lured to the german capital in recent years by some of the lowest property prices in europe .
most of the investors are from britain , ireland and the us , followed by spain , norway , sweden and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the area around berlin 's new hauptbahnhof rail station might be the next big thing jürgen michael schick , vice president of the ivd real estate association of germany said that over 10 billion euros were spent on berlin properties in 2006 .
" foreign investors accounted for more than 66 percent of those transactions , " he said . the surge in interest is fuelled by coverage in the international media with british dailies such as the observer and the daily telegraph labeling berlin a good place to buy a second home and the property pages of newspapers in france , spain and ireland routinely advertising real estate in the german capital . " cheapest metropolis in europe " " berlin is the cheapest metropolis in europe .
real estate values are significantly lower than those in london , new york or even prague and moscow , " said philipp c. tabert , head of berlin-based real estate consultancy winters & hirsch , whose firm generated annual revenue of 220 million euros last year .
almost 95 percent of tabert 's clients are from britain , ireland , america , spain , italy and france . the dramatically low-cost nature of berlin 's property market is obvious when compared with other european cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tv tower in berlin 's mitte district according to statistics , real estate prices for berlin dropped every year from 1996 to 2004 .
for that same period , real estate values in london climbed 80 percent .

" then i sat on the bed and waited . " when a caretaker - whom milz graciously described as " that peasant klutz " - came into the room , she assumed that frau milz could n't have gotten ready on her own .

" sleep in my eyes ! "
frau milz said .
" who do you think you are ? ! " that was the drop that made the cup of frau milz 's discontent run over .
in justified indignation , she called her daughter , packed her bags and moved out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 12.01.2007 lured by property bargains , foreign investors flock to berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prenzlauer berg in east berlin is one of the most popular destinations for foreign buyers drawn by some of the lowest property prices in europe and signs of an economic revival in germany , foreign investors are rushing to berlin to get a piece of the hot real estate market . christine munch , a 31-year-old graphic designer from norway , last year bought an apartment in berlin 's mitte neighborhood for 157,000 euros -lrb- $ 203,000 -rrb- , or less than at least three times the amount she would have paid for a comparable place in oslo . " owning an apartment that 's really cheap in the middle of such a vibrant and culturally rich city is a dream come true , " said munch of her 100-square-meter -lrb- 1,080-square-feet -rrb- home located on the 19th floor of a prefabricated high-rise close to where the berlin wall once stood . the apartment , which offers sweeping views of the city , is five minutes away from a subway station in the city 's center . flood of foreign homebuyers notwithstanding berlin 's sluggish economy and high jobless rate , munch is among a wave of foreign buyers lured to the german capital in recent years by some of the lowest property prices in europe .
most of the investors are from britain , ireland and the us , followed by spain , norway , sweden and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the area around berlin 's new hauptbahnhof rail station might be the next big thing jürgen michael schick , vice president of the ivd real estate association of germany said that over 10 billion euros were spent on berlin properties in 2006 .
" foreign investors accounted for more than 66 percent of those transactions , " he said . the surge in interest is fuelled by coverage in the international media with british dailies such as the observer and the daily telegraph labeling berlin a good place to buy a second home and the property pages of newspapers in france , spain and ireland routinely advertising real estate in the german capital . " cheapest metropolis in europe " " berlin is the cheapest metropolis in europe .
real estate values are significantly lower than those in london , new york or even prague and moscow , " said philipp c. tabert , head of berlin-based real estate consultancy winters & hirsch , whose firm generated annual revenue of 220 million euros last year .
almost 95 percent of tabert 's clients are from britain , ireland , america , spain , italy and france . the dramatically low-cost nature of berlin 's property market is obvious when compared with other european cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tv tower in berlin 's mitte district according to statistics , real estate prices for berlin dropped every year from 1996 to 2004 .
for that same period , real estate values in london climbed 80 percent .
one estimate said a square meter for a renovated apartment in a prime area in berlin today costs around 1,500 euros , while in london it 's no less than 15,000 euros . it 's a difference that 's hard to ignore . gary savage , a teacher from london , said his 87-square-meter apartment in the heart of the coveted mitte district - for which he shelled out 145,000 euros - was a real bargain . " you could n't even buy a garage or a shed in london today for that price , " he said . eastern neighborhoods still popular foreign homebuyers are attracted to the neighborhoods of friedrichshain , prenzlauer berg and mitte in former communist-ruled east berlin - famed for their fashionable cafes , lively clubs and central locations . but investors are also increasingly shopping around in districts in western berlin such as zehlendorf and steglitz and other outlying neighborhoods , experts say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern berlin is popular in recent years , not only private homebuyers have been flocking to berlin but also increasingly private equity funds , such as new york-based cerberus capital management and goldman sachs group 's whitehall investment fund .
in 2004 , the two together bought 65,700 units of berlin 's public housing for 2.1 billion euros . in 2006 , other big investors included swedish insurance company akelius and ge real estate . " very attractive market " experts say the large-scale foreign purchases have begun to affect prices . " last year the price for residential properties in berlin increased by about 10 to 20 percent , " schick said .
but berlin still remained a " very attractive market , " he said , because it offered investors guaranteed returns . " today foreign investors are n't just looking for high yields and quick profits but are more interested in sustainability with a long-term commitment of 10 to 15 years , " schick said , adding that berlin 's home-ownership rate of just 13 percent also meant that the market still had potential to grow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic upswing is expected to attract more foreign investors experts point out that foreign investors are also emboldened by signs of an overall economic revival in germany as rising consumer confidence drives demand for housing .
the country 's economy is expected to increase by 2.5 percent this year , unemployment fell to the lowest in four years in november and business confidence surged to a 15-month high . most agree that berlin 's present property boom is here to stay as opposed to the upswing of the 1990s , which was marked by a spectacular crash when a state-owned bank had to be bailed out by the city as a result of failed real-estate investments . " in the long-term , berlin property investments will turn out to be very positive , " schick said .

his resignation is a part of a major restructuring at the automaking giant . europe 's biggest carmaker announced on thursday that the head of its flagship vw brand , wolfgang bernhard , will be leaving . the move is a part of a major reshuffling of the vw group led by new chief executive officer martin winterkorn , who was promoted after bernd pischetsrieder stepped down on jan .
1 . winterkorn , the former head of audi , will also assume responsibility for the vw brand and the carmaker 's research and development unit . in a brief statement released thursday , the wolfsburg-based company said that bernhard , " will leave the company by mutual agreement as of jan .
31 , 2007 as part of the reorganization of responsibilities within the volkswagen group . " bernhard has been chairman of the volkswagen brand group since may 2005 and spearheaded a series of cost-cutting measures including cutting its german workforce by 20,000 jobs and lengthening the work week . as part of the restructuring , the company also announced that vw 's other brands - skoda , bentley , bugatti , audi , seat and lamborghini - will operate independently instead of in two groups , with all brands reporting results separately this year . an auto maverick bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bernhard spearheaded changes at vw before being ousted wolfgang bernhard joined the vw group from daimlerchrysler after being credited with turning around the struggling chrysler brand and cutting 26,000 jobs . according to reports , bernhard handed in his resignation to the volkswagen supervisory board at a meeting thursday .
the move was highly anticipated after bernhard was passed over for the chief executive position . bernhard 's resignation has led to speculation that the former chrysler executive might be heading back to detroit to take over the struggling us carmaker .
however , he would have to negotiate out of a non-compete clause in his vw contract . known for his sometimes abrasive methods , bernhard is regarded as a tough executive who is willing to do what needs to be done in order to bring a company out of the red .
his appointment in 2005 was greeted warmly by financial analysts . throughout his tenure at vw , bernhard pushed hard to cut costs and increase productivity .
in the process he may have angered members of the vw board including chairman ferdinand piech . a power struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand piech has been fighting for greater control over vw by porsche this latest move is seen as part of a long-time power struggle behind the doors at volkswagen as luxury carmaker porsche has been fighting to gain greater control of the vw group . porsche , which is controlled by vw 's supervisory board chief ferdinand piech , now owns just over 21 percent of volkswagen and is pushing to increase its stake to 27.4 percent and perhaps extending that to 29.9 percent . according to german law , once porsche holds a 30 percent control , it would be forced into launching a takeover bid . all this assumes that a german court will overturn the so-called volkswagen law , which was enacted to prevent a hostile takeover of the carmaker and is preventing porsche from raising its current stake .
a decision is expected in february . in an interview with business week on wednesday , porsche chairman wendelin wiedeking said that as the major shareholder of vw , porsche would be able to share some of the product development costs and aggressively push for expansion into new markets like china . " everybody knows that all the new technologies you have to use for the environment and safety are getting much more expensive .
you need partners willing to share technologies and thinking , " said wiedeking . ups and downs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is trying to buy a controlling stake in vw the volkswagen board also announced thursday that it had rejected german truckmaker man 's hostile 10.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.3 billion -rrb- takeover bid for swedish rival scania . the board hoped that the two companies could work together to reach a " friendly " merger .
vw is the biggest shareholder in both groups . thursday 's board meeting follows a turbulent period for the northern germany-based company with several former senior executives facing court cases over a sex and bribery scandal that has badly shaken the group . on sunday , vw announced that its group vehicle sales across the globe rose 9.3 percent to 5.73 million units in 2006 , with the volkswagen brand rising by 10 percent . both totals were company records . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers expect record 2006 us sales german carmakers are projecting record sales of 900,000 vehicles for 2006 - a year that marked steady setbacks for us producers .

maria milz from blankeneim in der eifel - a picturesque town of 8,000 in the western state of north rhine-westphalia - waited exactly 100 years . these days , the lively centenarian is making headlines all over germany for her rebellious pride and loud dignity . six weeks after moving into a retirement home , she decided to move out because : " it was full of old people with gray hair . " but i looked pretty ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens like to have fun too frau milz , who strongly believes that an early bird always catches the worm , was horrified by the way she was treated by the retirement home staff . " i got up at six a.m. , took a shower and made myself pretty , " milz said .
" then i sat on the bed and waited . " when a caretaker - whom milz graciously described as " that peasant klutz " - came into the room , she assumed that frau milz could n't have gotten ready on her own . " she looked at me in such a stupid way , she must have thought : ' the old bag is off her rocker . " ' devil is in the detail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some people , dogs are better companions than other people frau milz insisted she was ready to have her breakfast , but the heartless caretaker , who showed no appreciation of the fact that frau milz was a lady of quality who had already freshened up , told her she had sleep in her eyes . " sleep in my eyes ! "
frau milz said .
" who do you think you are ? ! " that was the drop that made the cup of frau milz 's discontent run over .

" owning an apartment that 's really cheap in the middle of such a vibrant and culturally rich city is a dream come true , " said munch of her 100-square-meter -lrb- 1,080-square-feet -rrb- home located on the 19th floor of a prefabricated high-rise close to where the berlin wall once stood . the apartment , which offers sweeping views of the city , is five minutes away from a subway station in the city 's center . flood of foreign homebuyers notwithstanding berlin 's sluggish economy and high jobless rate , munch is among a wave of foreign buyers lured to the german capital in recent years by some of the lowest property prices in europe .
most of the investors are from britain , ireland and the us , followed by spain , norway , sweden and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the area around berlin 's new hauptbahnhof rail station might be the next big thing jürgen michael schick , vice president of the ivd real estate association of germany said that over 10 billion euros were spent on berlin properties in 2006 .
" foreign investors accounted for more than 66 percent of those transactions , " he said . the surge in interest is fuelled by coverage in the international media with british dailies such as the observer and the daily telegraph labeling berlin a good place to buy a second home and the property pages of newspapers in france , spain and ireland routinely advertising real estate in the german capital . " cheapest metropolis in europe " " berlin is the cheapest metropolis in europe .
real estate values are significantly lower than those in london , new york or even prague and moscow , " said philipp c. tabert , head of berlin-based real estate consultancy winters & hirsch , whose firm generated annual revenue of 220 million euros last year .
almost 95 percent of tabert 's clients are from britain , ireland , america , spain , italy and france . the dramatically low-cost nature of berlin 's property market is obvious when compared with other european cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tv tower in berlin 's mitte district according to statistics , real estate prices for berlin dropped every year from 1996 to 2004 .
for that same period , real estate values in london climbed 80 percent .
one estimate said a square meter for a renovated apartment in a prime area in berlin today costs around 1,500 euros , while in london it 's no less than 15,000 euros . it 's a difference that 's hard to ignore . gary savage , a teacher from london , said his 87-square-meter apartment in the heart of the coveted mitte district - for which he shelled out 145,000 euros - was a real bargain . " you could n't even buy a garage or a shed in london today for that price , " he said . eastern neighborhoods still popular foreign homebuyers are attracted to the neighborhoods of friedrichshain , prenzlauer berg and mitte in former communist-ruled east berlin - famed for their fashionable cafes , lively clubs and central locations . but investors are also increasingly shopping around in districts in western berlin such as zehlendorf and steglitz and other outlying neighborhoods , experts say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern berlin is popular in recent years , not only private homebuyers have been flocking to berlin but also increasingly private equity funds , such as new york-based cerberus capital management and goldman sachs group 's whitehall investment fund .
in 2004 , the two together bought 65,700 units of berlin 's public housing for 2.1 billion euros . in 2006 , other big investors included swedish insurance company akelius and ge real estate . " very attractive market " experts say the large-scale foreign purchases have begun to affect prices . " last year the price for residential properties in berlin increased by about 10 to 20 percent , " schick said .
but berlin still remained a " very attractive market , " he said , because it offered investors guaranteed returns . " today foreign investors are n't just looking for high yields and quick profits but are more interested in sustainability with a long-term commitment of 10 to 15 years , " schick said , adding that berlin 's home-ownership rate of just 13 percent also meant that the market still had potential to grow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic upswing is expected to attract more foreign investors experts point out that foreign investors are also emboldened by signs of an overall economic revival in germany as rising consumer confidence drives demand for housing .
the country 's economy is expected to increase by 2.5 percent this year , unemployment fell to the lowest in four years in november and business confidence surged to a 15-month high . most agree that berlin 's present property boom is here to stay as opposed to the upswing of the 1990s , which was marked by a spectacular crash when a state-owned bank had to be bailed out by the city as a result of failed real-estate investments . " in the long-term , berlin property investments will turn out to be very positive , " schick said .

" then i sat on the bed and waited . " when a caretaker - whom milz graciously described as " that peasant klutz " - came into the room , she assumed that frau milz could n't have gotten ready on her own .

" ' devil is in the detail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some people , dogs are better companions than other people frau milz insisted she was ready to have her breakfast , but the heartless caretaker , who showed no appreciation of the fact that frau milz was a lady of quality who had already freshened up , told her she had sleep in her eyes . " sleep in my eyes ! "
frau milz said .
" who do you think you are ? ! " that was the drop that made the cup of frau milz 's discontent run over .
in justified indignation , she called her daughter , packed her bags and moved out .

in the us , california-based apple has entered into an exclusive agreement with america 's biggest mobile phone operator , cingular .
whether the company with what many are calling the midas touch will do the same in europe is unclear , especially since the european market is more fragmented than in the us .
it is not yet known how contracts between apple and mobile phone operators will be structured . but major phone operators in the uk are reported to already be wrangling for apple 's favor .
telefonica , the spanish company which owns o2 - operating in both germany and the uk - has held preliminary talks with apple chairman steve jobs , according to the times , a uk daily . the paper reports that for the uk market , apple is expected to offer the phone exclusively to one network operator .
besides o2 , vodafone , orange and t-mobile , all big presences in the uk , are expected to bid for the contract . germans low key for now with the high-decibel buzz currently around the multifunctional iphone mobile device , analysts say they are n't surprised that the maneuvering by operators has already started , although many , especially in germany , are keeping quiet about it . a spokesperson from vodaphone d2 would only describe the iphone as " very interesting , " given that the device fits in well with the company 's strategy of combining multimedia and a music player into its phones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iphones are going to be expensive , but still expected to sell well the headquarters of t-mobile , the mobile arm of deutsche telekom , was also reserved : " we 're reviewing if we want to market the iphone . " marketing the new device , which most critics are raving about , could be very interesting for providers .
despite the iphone 's big price tag - the starting price in the us is $ 499 -lrb- 385 euros -rrb- - it is expected to be a bestseller for apple .
that could convince mobile phone providers to pay a higher price to have their brand exclusively aligned with the device . the times has reported that in britain , operators are expected to compete aggressively for the exclusive rights , since they are seeking an edge over competitors in an ever-tighter market . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mobile boss takes seat at top of deutsche telekom rene obermann , previously the head of telekom 's profitable wireless unit , was named the ceo of europe 's largest telecommunications company on monday , following the resignation of kai-uwe ricke .

" owning an apartment that 's really cheap in the middle of such a vibrant and culturally rich city is a dream come true , " said munch of her 100-square-meter -lrb- 1,080-square-feet -rrb- home located on the 19th floor of a prefabricated high-rise close to where the berlin wall once stood . the apartment , which offers sweeping views of the city , is five minutes away from a subway station in the city 's center . flood of foreign homebuyers notwithstanding berlin 's sluggish economy and high jobless rate , munch is among a wave of foreign buyers lured to the german capital in recent years by some of the lowest property prices in europe .
most of the investors are from britain , ireland and the us , followed by spain , norway , sweden and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the area around berlin 's new hauptbahnhof rail station might be the next big thing jürgen michael schick , vice president of the ivd real estate association of germany said that over 10 billion euros were spent on berlin properties in 2006 .
" foreign investors accounted for more than 66 percent of those transactions , " he said . the surge in interest is fuelled by coverage in the international media with british dailies such as the observer and the daily telegraph labeling berlin a good place to buy a second home and the property pages of newspapers in france , spain and ireland routinely advertising real estate in the german capital . " cheapest metropolis in europe " " berlin is the cheapest metropolis in europe .
real estate values are significantly lower than those in london , new york or even prague and moscow , " said philipp c. tabert , head of berlin-based real estate consultancy winters & hirsch , whose firm generated annual revenue of 220 million euros last year .
almost 95 percent of tabert 's clients are from britain , ireland , america , spain , italy and france . the dramatically low-cost nature of berlin 's property market is obvious when compared with other european cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tv tower in berlin 's mitte district according to statistics , real estate prices for berlin dropped every year from 1996 to 2004 .
for that same period , real estate values in london climbed 80 percent .
one estimate said a square meter for a renovated apartment in a prime area in berlin today costs around 1,500 euros , while in london it 's no less than 15,000 euros . it 's a difference that 's hard to ignore . gary savage , a teacher from london , said his 87-square-meter apartment in the heart of the coveted mitte district - for which he shelled out 145,000 euros - was a real bargain . " you could n't even buy a garage or a shed in london today for that price , " he said . eastern neighborhoods still popular foreign homebuyers are attracted to the neighborhoods of friedrichshain , prenzlauer berg and mitte in former communist-ruled east berlin - famed for their fashionable cafes , lively clubs and central locations . but investors are also increasingly shopping around in districts in western berlin such as zehlendorf and steglitz and other outlying neighborhoods , experts say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern berlin is popular in recent years , not only private homebuyers have been flocking to berlin but also increasingly private equity funds , such as new york-based cerberus capital management and goldman sachs group 's whitehall investment fund .
in 2004 , the two together bought 65,700 units of berlin 's public housing for 2.1 billion euros . in 2006 , other big investors included swedish insurance company akelius and ge real estate . " very attractive market " experts say the large-scale foreign purchases have begun to affect prices . " last year the price for residential properties in berlin increased by about 10 to 20 percent , " schick said .
but berlin still remained a " very attractive market , " he said , because it offered investors guaranteed returns . " today foreign investors are n't just looking for high yields and quick profits but are more interested in sustainability with a long-term commitment of 10 to 15 years , " schick said , adding that berlin 's home-ownership rate of just 13 percent also meant that the market still had potential to grow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic upswing is expected to attract more foreign investors experts point out that foreign investors are also emboldened by signs of an overall economic revival in germany as rising consumer confidence drives demand for housing .
the country 's economy is expected to increase by 2.5 percent this year , unemployment fell to the lowest in four years in november and business confidence surged to a 15-month high . most agree that berlin 's present property boom is here to stay as opposed to the upswing of the 1990s , which was marked by a spectacular crash when a state-owned bank had to be bailed out by the city as a result of failed real-estate investments . " in the long-term , berlin property investments will turn out to be very positive , " schick said .

" owning an apartment that 's really cheap in the middle of such a vibrant and culturally rich city is a dream come true , " said munch of her 100-square-meter -lrb- 1,080-square-feet -rrb- home located on the 19th floor of a prefabricated high-rise close to where the berlin wall once stood . the apartment , which offers sweeping views of the city , is five minutes away from a subway station in the city 's center . flood of foreign homebuyers notwithstanding berlin 's sluggish economy and high jobless rate , munch is among a wave of foreign buyers lured to the german capital in recent years by some of the lowest property prices in europe .
most of the investors are from britain , ireland and the us , followed by spain , norway , sweden and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the area around berlin 's new hauptbahnhof rail station might be the next big thing jürgen michael schick , vice president of the ivd real estate association of germany said that over 10 billion euros were spent on berlin properties in 2006 .
" foreign investors accounted for more than 66 percent of those transactions , " he said . the surge in interest is fuelled by coverage in the international media with british dailies such as the observer and the daily telegraph labeling berlin a good place to buy a second home and the property pages of newspapers in france , spain and ireland routinely advertising real estate in the german capital . " cheapest metropolis in europe " " berlin is the cheapest metropolis in europe .
real estate values are significantly lower than those in london , new york or even prague and moscow , " said philipp c. tabert , head of berlin-based real estate consultancy winters & hirsch , whose firm generated annual revenue of 220 million euros last year .
almost 95 percent of tabert 's clients are from britain , ireland , america , spain , italy and france . the dramatically low-cost nature of berlin 's property market is obvious when compared with other european cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tv tower in berlin 's mitte district according to statistics , real estate prices for berlin dropped every year from 1996 to 2004 .
for that same period , real estate values in london climbed 80 percent .
one estimate said a square meter for a renovated apartment in a prime area in berlin today costs around 1,500 euros , while in london it 's no less than 15,000 euros . it 's a difference that 's hard to ignore . gary savage , a teacher from london , said his 87-square-meter apartment in the heart of the coveted mitte district - for which he shelled out 145,000 euros - was a real bargain . " you could n't even buy a garage or a shed in london today for that price , " he said . eastern neighborhoods still popular foreign homebuyers are attracted to the neighborhoods of friedrichshain , prenzlauer berg and mitte in former communist-ruled east berlin - famed for their fashionable cafes , lively clubs and central locations . but investors are also increasingly shopping around in districts in western berlin such as zehlendorf and steglitz and other outlying neighborhoods , experts say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern berlin is popular in recent years , not only private homebuyers have been flocking to berlin but also increasingly private equity funds , such as new york-based cerberus capital management and goldman sachs group 's whitehall investment fund .
in 2004 , the two together bought 65,700 units of berlin 's public housing for 2.1 billion euros . in 2006 , other big investors included swedish insurance company akelius and ge real estate . " very attractive market " experts say the large-scale foreign purchases have begun to affect prices . " last year the price for residential properties in berlin increased by about 10 to 20 percent , " schick said .
but berlin still remained a " very attractive market , " he said , because it offered investors guaranteed returns . " today foreign investors are n't just looking for high yields and quick profits but are more interested in sustainability with a long-term commitment of 10 to 15 years , " schick said , adding that berlin 's home-ownership rate of just 13 percent also meant that the market still had potential to grow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic upswing is expected to attract more foreign investors experts point out that foreign investors are also emboldened by signs of an overall economic revival in germany as rising consumer confidence drives demand for housing .
the country 's economy is expected to increase by 2.5 percent this year , unemployment fell to the lowest in four years in november and business confidence surged to a 15-month high . most agree that berlin 's present property boom is here to stay as opposed to the upswing of the 1990s , which was marked by a spectacular crash when a state-owned bank had to be bailed out by the city as a result of failed real-estate investments .

11 accomplice may appeal to eu court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's lawyers are leaving no stone unturned in an attempt to clear him germany 's highest court on friday rejected attempts by a moroccan accomplice in the sept 11 , 2001 terror attacks in the united states to have his guilty verdict declared unconstitutional . the karlsruhe-based federal constitutional court said the attempt by mounir el motassadeq was inadmissible . motassadeq , who was friends with members of the hamburg-based terror cell involved in the suicide attacks , was found guilty in november of being an accessory to murder in the deaths of 246 passengers and crew on the four hijacked aircraft used in the attacks . he was sentenced to 15 years in prison by a court in hamburg on monday . but his five-year legal battle is set to continue as his lawyers turn to germany 's federal court of justice to appeal his sentence .
his lawyers have also said they may take the case to the european court of justice in luxembourg . " that will be the last appeal , " motassadeq 's lawyer udo jacob told news agency ap on friday . jacob added that friday 's decision by germany 's highest court had not impressed him . " i still think that basic rights have been violated , " jacob said . guilty of " immense wrong " motassadeq , 32 , has claimed throughout the legal saga , which saw him in and out of several courtrooms , he was friends with the hijackers but did not know about their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed atta and his friends are thought to have plotted the attacks in hamburg he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of the hamburg-based cell , including the presumed ringleader of the attacks , mohammed atta , and to have helped cover up their whereabouts . the sentencing hearing for motassadeq in hamburg this week was marked by delays as the moroccan 's lawyers filed a series of appeals to halt the process . eventually however the court followed the recommendation of state prosecutor walter hemberger who said motassadeq deserved the toughest sentence possible under german law because he had committed an " immense wrong . " transatlantic tensions german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . motassadeq 's case and the perceived failure of german courts to prosecute him swiftly and successfully have strained berlin 's ties with washington over recent years . motassadeq is only the second man to be convicted of a role in the sept .

" owning an apartment that 's really cheap in the middle of such a vibrant and culturally rich city is a dream come true , " said munch of her 100-square-meter -lrb- 1,080-square-feet -rrb- home located on the 19th floor of a prefabricated high-rise close to where the berlin wall once stood . the apartment , which offers sweeping views of the city , is five minutes away from a subway station in the city 's center . flood of foreign homebuyers notwithstanding berlin 's sluggish economy and high jobless rate , munch is among a wave of foreign buyers lured to the german capital in recent years by some of the lowest property prices in europe .
most of the investors are from britain , ireland and the us , followed by spain , norway , sweden and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the area around berlin 's new hauptbahnhof rail station might be the next big thing jürgen michael schick , vice president of the ivd real estate association of germany said that over 10 billion euros were spent on berlin properties in 2006 .
" foreign investors accounted for more than 66 percent of those transactions , " he said . the surge in interest is fuelled by coverage in the international media with british dailies such as the observer and the daily telegraph labeling berlin a good place to buy a second home and the property pages of newspapers in france , spain and ireland routinely advertising real estate in the german capital . " cheapest metropolis in europe " " berlin is the cheapest metropolis in europe .
real estate values are significantly lower than those in london , new york or even prague and moscow , " said philipp c. tabert , head of berlin-based real estate consultancy winters & hirsch , whose firm generated annual revenue of 220 million euros last year .
almost 95 percent of tabert 's clients are from britain , ireland , america , spain , italy and france . the dramatically low-cost nature of berlin 's property market is obvious when compared with other european cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tv tower in berlin 's mitte district according to statistics , real estate prices for berlin dropped every year from 1996 to 2004 .
for that same period , real estate values in london climbed 80 percent .
one estimate said a square meter for a renovated apartment in a prime area in berlin today costs around 1,500 euros , while in london it 's no less than 15,000 euros . it 's a difference that 's hard to ignore . gary savage , a teacher from london , said his 87-square-meter apartment in the heart of the coveted mitte district - for which he shelled out 145,000 euros - was a real bargain . " you could n't even buy a garage or a shed in london today for that price , " he said . eastern neighborhoods still popular foreign homebuyers are attracted to the neighborhoods of friedrichshain , prenzlauer berg and mitte in former communist-ruled east berlin - famed for their fashionable cafes , lively clubs and central locations . but investors are also increasingly shopping around in districts in western berlin such as zehlendorf and steglitz and other outlying neighborhoods , experts say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern berlin is popular in recent years , not only private homebuyers have been flocking to berlin but also increasingly private equity funds , such as new york-based cerberus capital management and goldman sachs group 's whitehall investment fund .
in 2004 , the two together bought 65,700 units of berlin 's public housing for 2.1 billion euros . in 2006 , other big investors included swedish insurance company akelius and ge real estate . " very attractive market " experts say the large-scale foreign purchases have begun to affect prices . " last year the price for residential properties in berlin increased by about 10 to 20 percent , " schick said .
but berlin still remained a " very attractive market , " he said , because it offered investors guaranteed returns . " today foreign investors are n't just looking for high yields and quick profits but are more interested in sustainability with a long-term commitment of 10 to 15 years , " schick said , adding that berlin 's home-ownership rate of just 13 percent also meant that the market still had potential to grow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic upswing is expected to attract more foreign investors experts point out that foreign investors are also emboldened by signs of an overall economic revival in germany as rising consumer confidence drives demand for housing .
the country 's economy is expected to increase by 2.5 percent this year , unemployment fell to the lowest in four years in november and business confidence surged to a 15-month high . most agree that berlin 's present property boom is here to stay as opposed to the upswing of the 1990s , which was marked by a spectacular crash when a state-owned bank had to be bailed out by the city as a result of failed real-estate investments . " in the long-term , berlin property investments will turn out to be very positive , " schick said .

" owning an apartment that 's really cheap in the middle of such a vibrant and culturally rich city is a dream come true , " said munch of her 100-square-meter -lrb- 1,080-square-feet -rrb- home located on the 19th floor of a prefabricated high-rise close to where the berlin wall once stood . the apartment , which offers sweeping views of the city , is five minutes away from a subway station in the city 's center . flood of foreign homebuyers notwithstanding berlin 's sluggish economy and high jobless rate , munch is among a wave of foreign buyers lured to the german capital in recent years by some of the lowest property prices in europe .
most of the investors are from britain , ireland and the us , followed by spain , norway , sweden and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the area around berlin 's new hauptbahnhof rail station might be the next big thing jürgen michael schick , vice president of the ivd real estate association of germany said that over 10 billion euros were spent on berlin properties in 2006 .

real estate values are significantly lower than those in london , new york or even prague and moscow , " said philipp c. tabert , head of berlin-based real estate consultancy winters & hirsch , whose firm generated annual revenue of 220 million euros last year .
almost 95 percent of tabert 's clients are from britain , ireland , america , spain , italy and france . the dramatically low-cost nature of berlin 's property market is obvious when compared with other european cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tv tower in berlin 's mitte district according to statistics , real estate prices for berlin dropped every year from 1996 to 2004 .

" today foreign investors are n't just looking for high yields and quick profits but are more interested in sustainability with a long-term commitment of 10 to 15 years , " schick said , adding that berlin 's home-ownership rate of just 13 percent also meant that the market still had potential to grow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic upswing is expected to attract more foreign investors experts point out that foreign investors are also emboldened by signs of an overall economic revival in germany as rising consumer confidence drives demand for housing .
the country 's economy is expected to increase by 2.5 percent this year , unemployment fell to the lowest in four years in november and business confidence surged to a 15-month high . most agree that berlin 's present property boom is here to stay as opposed to the upswing of the 1990s , which was marked by a spectacular crash when a state-owned bank had to be bailed out by the city as a result of failed real-estate investments .

11 accomplice may appeal to eu court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's lawyers are leaving no stone unturned in an attempt to clear him germany 's highest court on friday rejected attempts by a moroccan accomplice in the sept 11 , 2001 terror attacks in the united states to have his guilty verdict declared unconstitutional . the karlsruhe-based federal constitutional court said the attempt by mounir el motassadeq was inadmissible . motassadeq , who was friends with members of the hamburg-based terror cell involved in the suicide attacks , was found guilty in november of being an accessory to murder in the deaths of 246 passengers and crew on the four hijacked aircraft used in the attacks . he was sentenced to 15 years in prison by a court in hamburg on monday . but his five-year legal battle is set to continue as his lawyers turn to germany 's federal court of justice to appeal his sentence .
his lawyers have also said they may take the case to the european court of justice in luxembourg . " that will be the last appeal , " motassadeq 's lawyer udo jacob told news agency ap on friday . jacob added that friday 's decision by germany 's highest court had not impressed him . " i still think that basic rights have been violated , " jacob said . guilty of " immense wrong " motassadeq , 32 , has claimed throughout the legal saga , which saw him in and out of several courtrooms , he was friends with the hijackers but did not know about their plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed atta and his friends are thought to have plotted the attacks in hamburg he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of the hamburg-based cell , including the presumed ringleader of the attacks , mohammed atta , and to have helped cover up their whereabouts . the sentencing hearing for motassadeq in hamburg this week was marked by delays as the moroccan 's lawyers filed a series of appeals to halt the process . eventually however the court followed the recommendation of state prosecutor walter hemberger who said motassadeq deserved the toughest sentence possible under german law because he had committed an " immense wrong . " transatlantic tensions german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . motassadeq 's case and the perceived failure of german courts to prosecute him swiftly and successfully have strained berlin 's ties with washington over recent years . motassadeq is only the second man to be convicted of a role in the sept .

" if you take the third step before the first , you will stumble , " glos said . glos initially opposed to eu plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos has switched tracks on energy glos ' comments come days after the commission unveiled an ambitious energy policy aimed at cutting greenhouse emissions and liberalizing the bloc 's energy sector . at the time , glos joined germany 's big energy firms in criticizing proposals to dilute the big energy companies ' power .
the minister said germany would " not take any hasty steps " and first verify if the plan was compatible with the country 's constitution . glos 's comments to the financial times mark a sharp departure from his earlier stance . " we must first make sure that the decisions made so far , for instance the obligation legally to unbundle distribution and production , are implemented everywhere , " glos said in the interview friday .
" that 's a prerequisite . " the minister added that an independent operator could take over management of the distribution networks of integrated energy firms , according to the paper . the companies should only be broken up if that failed to boost competition , he said .
" if the independent operator model works , we will not need such a step . " " not enough competition in german market " glos also said in friday 's interview that europe should only establish an energy regulator if closer cooperation between existing national agencies failed to boost competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as current eu president , chancellor merkel wants to focus on energy " we used to defend the line that national regulators are all we need , but we must admit this is not sufficient , " glos said .
" we do not have enough competition in the german market . " we need to now discuss with the other member states about how much national competence we want to concede to europe , " he added . as head of the six-month rotating eu presidency , germany has made fighting climate change a priority .
chancellor angela merkel has signaled that she wants to forge consensus among the 27-member eu on a common , long-term energy policy based on proposals from the eu commission . germany is likely to deal with the issue of a common eu energy policy at a european summit in march . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wary about eu energy policy germany reacted cautiously wednesday to an eu plan to diversify energy sources , raising concerns about the new eu president 's ability to tackle the issue in the 27-member bloc .

his resignation is a part of a major restructuring at the automaking giant . europe 's biggest carmaker announced on thursday that the head of its flagship vw brand , wolfgang bernhard , will be leaving . the move is a part of a major reshuffling of the vw group led by new chief executive officer martin winterkorn , who was promoted after bernd pischetsrieder stepped down on jan .
1 . winterkorn , the former head of audi , will also assume responsibility for the vw brand and the carmaker 's research and development unit . in a brief statement released thursday , the wolfsburg-based company said that bernhard , " will leave the company by mutual agreement as of jan .
31 , 2007 as part of the reorganization of responsibilities within the volkswagen group . " bernhard has been chairman of the volkswagen brand group since may 2005 and spearheaded a series of cost-cutting measures including cutting its german workforce by 20,000 jobs and lengthening the work week . as part of the restructuring , the company also announced that vw 's other brands - skoda , bentley , bugatti , audi , seat and lamborghini - will operate independently instead of in two groups , with all brands reporting results separately this year . an auto maverick bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bernhard spearheaded changes at vw before being ousted wolfgang bernhard joined the vw group from daimlerchrysler after being credited with turning around the struggling chrysler brand and cutting 26,000 jobs . according to reports , bernhard handed in his resignation to the volkswagen supervisory board at a meeting thursday .
the move was highly anticipated after bernhard was passed over for the chief executive position . bernhard 's resignation has led to speculation that the former chrysler executive might be heading back to detroit to take over the struggling us carmaker .
however , he would have to negotiate out of a non-compete clause in his vw contract . known for his sometimes abrasive methods , bernhard is regarded as a tough executive who is willing to do what needs to be done in order to bring a company out of the red .
his appointment in 2005 was greeted warmly by financial analysts . throughout his tenure at vw , bernhard pushed hard to cut costs and increase productivity .
in the process he may have angered members of the vw board including chairman ferdinand piech . a power struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand piech has been fighting for greater control over vw by porsche this latest move is seen as part of a long-time power struggle behind the doors at volkswagen as luxury carmaker porsche has been fighting to gain greater control of the vw group . porsche , which is controlled by vw 's supervisory board chief ferdinand piech , now owns just over 21 percent of volkswagen and is pushing to increase its stake to 27.4 percent and perhaps extending that to 29.9 percent . according to german law , once porsche holds a 30 percent control , it would be forced into launching a takeover bid . all this assumes that a german court will overturn the so-called volkswagen law , which was enacted to prevent a hostile takeover of the carmaker and is preventing porsche from raising its current stake .
a decision is expected in february . in an interview with business week on wednesday , porsche chairman wendelin wiedeking said that as the major shareholder of vw , porsche would be able to share some of the product development costs and aggressively push for expansion into new markets like china .

" we shall study this request and take a decision in good time , " steinmeier told reporters in brussels , adding that he would discuss a nato request made in december for reconnaissance planes at an alliance meeting on jan .
26 . top official says deployment done deal earlier , germany 's former defense minister , the social democrats ' parliamentary group leader peter struck , told reporters in brussels that germany would deploy the six aircraft requested by nato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers have so far largely been based in kabul struck said the fighter-bombers would be based in the capital kabul but used in the south of the country , a bastion of taliban insurgents who surprised nato last year with fiercer than expected resistance . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said he would welcome such a move . " if the german government would announce , or has announced , the deployment of tornado aircraft in a reconnaissance role to afghanistan , i would highly welcome such a decision , " he told reporters . struck said it might be possible to send the fighter-bombers for two or three months but that a deployment of seven months , for example , " would surely not be covered by the current mandate . " politicians want parliament to approve struck 's comments , however , have sparked anger among some members of germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- as well as in the opposition . some have raised doubts about whether the sending of military aircraft is possible without an additional parliamentary mandate than the one that presently covers the deployment of some 3,000 german peacekeepers in the calmer north of the country . volker kauder , cdu parliamentary chief , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper the issue could only be solved once the government bared all the facts .

his resignation is a part of a major restructuring at the automaking giant . europe 's biggest carmaker announced on thursday that the head of its flagship vw brand , wolfgang bernhard , will be leaving . the move is a part of a major reshuffling of the vw group led by new chief executive officer martin winterkorn , who was promoted after bernd pischetsrieder stepped down on jan .
1 . winterkorn , the former head of audi , will also assume responsibility for the vw brand and the carmaker 's research and development unit . in a brief statement released thursday , the wolfsburg-based company said that bernhard , " will leave the company by mutual agreement as of jan .
31 , 2007 as part of the reorganization of responsibilities within the volkswagen group . " bernhard has been chairman of the volkswagen brand group since may 2005 and spearheaded a series of cost-cutting measures including cutting its german workforce by 20,000 jobs and lengthening the work week . as part of the restructuring , the company also announced that vw 's other brands - skoda , bentley , bugatti , audi , seat and lamborghini - will operate independently instead of in two groups , with all brands reporting results separately this year . an auto maverick bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bernhard spearheaded changes at vw before being ousted wolfgang bernhard joined the vw group from daimlerchrysler after being credited with turning around the struggling chrysler brand and cutting 26,000 jobs . according to reports , bernhard handed in his resignation to the volkswagen supervisory board at a meeting thursday .
the move was highly anticipated after bernhard was passed over for the chief executive position . bernhard 's resignation has led to speculation that the former chrysler executive might be heading back to detroit to take over the struggling us carmaker .
however , he would have to negotiate out of a non-compete clause in his vw contract . known for his sometimes abrasive methods , bernhard is regarded as a tough executive who is willing to do what needs to be done in order to bring a company out of the red .
his appointment in 2005 was greeted warmly by financial analysts . throughout his tenure at vw , bernhard pushed hard to cut costs and increase productivity .
in the process he may have angered members of the vw board including chairman ferdinand piech . a power struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand piech has been fighting for greater control over vw by porsche this latest move is seen as part of a long-time power struggle behind the doors at volkswagen as luxury carmaker porsche has been fighting to gain greater control of the vw group . porsche , which is controlled by vw 's supervisory board chief ferdinand piech , now owns just over 21 percent of volkswagen and is pushing to increase its stake to 27.4 percent and perhaps extending that to 29.9 percent . according to german law , once porsche holds a 30 percent control , it would be forced into launching a takeover bid . all this assumes that a german court will overturn the so-called volkswagen law , which was enacted to prevent a hostile takeover of the carmaker and is preventing porsche from raising its current stake .
a decision is expected in february . in an interview with business week on wednesday , porsche chairman wendelin wiedeking said that as the major shareholder of vw , porsche would be able to share some of the product development costs and aggressively push for expansion into new markets like china . " everybody knows that all the new technologies you have to use for the environment and safety are getting much more expensive .
you need partners willing to share technologies and thinking , " said wiedeking . ups and downs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche is trying to buy a controlling stake in vw the volkswagen board also announced thursday that it had rejected german truckmaker man 's hostile 10.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.3 billion -rrb- takeover bid for swedish rival scania . the board hoped that the two companies could work together to reach a " friendly " merger .
vw is the biggest shareholder in both groups . thursday 's board meeting follows a turbulent period for the northern germany-based company with several former senior executives facing court cases over a sex and bribery scandal that has badly shaken the group . on sunday , vw announced that its group vehicle sales across the globe rose 9.3 percent to 5.73 million units in 2006 , with the volkswagen brand rising by 10 percent . both totals were company records . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers expect record 2006 us sales german carmakers are projecting record sales of 900,000 vehicles for 2006 - a year that marked steady setbacks for us producers .

" owning an apartment that 's really cheap in the middle of such a vibrant and culturally rich city is a dream come true , " said munch of her 100-square-meter -lrb- 1,080-square-feet -rrb- home located on the 19th floor of a prefabricated high-rise close to where the berlin wall once stood . the apartment , which offers sweeping views of the city , is five minutes away from a subway station in the city 's center . flood of foreign homebuyers notwithstanding berlin 's sluggish economy and high jobless rate , munch is among a wave of foreign buyers lured to the german capital in recent years by some of the lowest property prices in europe .
most of the investors are from britain , ireland and the us , followed by spain , norway , sweden and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the area around berlin 's new hauptbahnhof rail station might be the next big thing jürgen michael schick , vice president of the ivd real estate association of germany said that over 10 billion euros were spent on berlin properties in 2006 .
" foreign investors accounted for more than 66 percent of those transactions , " he said . the surge in interest is fuelled by coverage in the international media with british dailies such as the observer and the daily telegraph labeling berlin a good place to buy a second home and the property pages of newspapers in france , spain and ireland routinely advertising real estate in the german capital . " cheapest metropolis in europe " " berlin is the cheapest metropolis in europe .
real estate values are significantly lower than those in london , new york or even prague and moscow , " said philipp c. tabert , head of berlin-based real estate consultancy winters & hirsch , whose firm generated annual revenue of 220 million euros last year .
almost 95 percent of tabert 's clients are from britain , ireland , america , spain , italy and france . the dramatically low-cost nature of berlin 's property market is obvious when compared with other european cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tv tower in berlin 's mitte district according to statistics , real estate prices for berlin dropped every year from 1996 to 2004 .
for that same period , real estate values in london climbed 80 percent .
one estimate said a square meter for a renovated apartment in a prime area in berlin today costs around 1,500 euros , while in london it 's no less than 15,000 euros . it 's a difference that 's hard to ignore . gary savage , a teacher from london , said his 87-square-meter apartment in the heart of the coveted mitte district - for which he shelled out 145,000 euros - was a real bargain . " you could n't even buy a garage or a shed in london today for that price , " he said . eastern neighborhoods still popular foreign homebuyers are attracted to the neighborhoods of friedrichshain , prenzlauer berg and mitte in former communist-ruled east berlin - famed for their fashionable cafes , lively clubs and central locations . but investors are also increasingly shopping around in districts in western berlin such as zehlendorf and steglitz and other outlying neighborhoods , experts say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern berlin is popular in recent years , not only private homebuyers have been flocking to berlin but also increasingly private equity funds , such as new york-based cerberus capital management and goldman sachs group 's whitehall investment fund .
in 2004 , the two together bought 65,700 units of berlin 's public housing for 2.1 billion euros . in 2006 , other big investors included swedish insurance company akelius and ge real estate . " very attractive market " experts say the large-scale foreign purchases have begun to affect prices . " last year the price for residential properties in berlin increased by about 10 to 20 percent , " schick said .
but berlin still remained a " very attractive market , " he said , because it offered investors guaranteed returns . " today foreign investors are n't just looking for high yields and quick profits but are more interested in sustainability with a long-term commitment of 10 to 15 years , " schick said , adding that berlin 's home-ownership rate of just 13 percent also meant that the market still had potential to grow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic upswing is expected to attract more foreign investors experts point out that foreign investors are also emboldened by signs of an overall economic revival in germany as rising consumer confidence drives demand for housing .
the country 's economy is expected to increase by 2.5 percent this year , unemployment fell to the lowest in four years in november and business confidence surged to a 15-month high . most agree that berlin 's present property boom is here to stay as opposed to the upswing of the 1990s , which was marked by a spectacular crash when a state-owned bank had to be bailed out by the city as a result of failed real-estate investments . " in the long-term , berlin property investments will turn out to be very positive , " schick said .

maria milz from blankeneim in der eifel - a picturesque town of 8,000 in the western state of north rhine-westphalia - waited exactly 100 years . these days , the lively centenarian is making headlines all over germany for her rebellious pride and loud dignity . six weeks after moving into a retirement home , she decided to move out because : " it was full of old people with gray hair .

" i got up at six a.m. , took a shower and made myself pretty , " milz said .
" then i sat on the bed and waited . " when a caretaker - whom milz graciously described as " that peasant klutz " - came into the room , she assumed that frau milz could n't have gotten ready on her own .

" ' devil is in the detail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some people , dogs are better companions than other people frau milz insisted she was ready to have her breakfast , but the heartless caretaker , who showed no appreciation of the fact that frau milz was a lady of quality who had already freshened up , told her she had sleep in her eyes . " sleep in my eyes ! "
frau milz said .
" who do you think you are ? ! " that was the drop that made the cup of frau milz 's discontent run over .
in justified indignation , she called her daughter , packed her bags and moved out .

democratic senator joseph biden called the move a " tragic mistake " , while republican senator chuck hagel said mr bush had committed a dangerous blunder .
the announcement was part of mr bush 's new strategy for tackling the conflict .
us defence secretary robert gates meanwhile will defend the plan before a hostile congressional committee later .
on thursday mr gates unveiled plans to boost troop numbers by 92,000 over five years , in an effort to increase the overall strength of the armed forces .
the defence secretary , who testified before a committee in the house of representatives on thursday , will appear before the senate armed services committee with the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , peter pace .
the bbc 's justin webb in washington says the two men will be pressed hard on the wisdom of sending extra troops to baghdad and gen pace is likely to be asked why he appears to have changed his mind about a policy he did not back in the past .
the democrats have promised a non-binding vote in both houses of congress on the strategy .
' too costly ' mr bush announced a " surge " force of 21,500 troops in a nationally televised speech on wednesday night .
i think this speech given last night by this president represents the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since vietnam if it 's carried out chuck hagel republican senator reaction to bush speech excerpts of bush speech but alongside criticism from democrats - who now control both houses of congress - several republicans publicly expressed their disappointment .
loyalist senator norm coleman said the cost in lives was " too great " to support mr bush 's plan .
another republican senator , george voinovich , told us secretary of state condoleezza rice at a committee hearing that he had finally lost faith in the president 's iraq policy .
" i 've gone along with the president on this and i 've bought into his dream and at this stage of the game i just do n't think its going to happen , " he said .
sen hagel said he thought the plan was a mistake .
our troops will have a well-defined mission president george w bush bush speech at a glance can new way forward work ?
iraqis react to bush speech " i think this speech given last night by this president represents the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since vietnam if it 's carried out , " he told the senate foreign relations committee .
mr gates said the " surge " would probably last " months , not 18 months or two years . "
he added that the us could revise its plan if iraqi leaders failed to keep to their commitments .
plan for baghdad in his tv address , mr bush said fresh troops in iraq would help to secure baghdad 's streets as part of the new strategy .
he said his country 's commitment to iraq was " not open-ended " , and that he expected the government in baghdad to fulfil its own promises .
mr bush said the situation in iraq was unacceptable , and that responsibility for mistakes rested with him .
but the new troops , most of whom would be sent to baghdad , would help secure neighbourhoods in the capital from insurgents , he said .
he said the effort would succeed where previous operations had failed , because this time troop levels would be sufficient to hold areas that had been cleared .

he said his country 's commitment to iraq was " not open-ended " , and that he expected the government in baghdad to fulfil its own promises .
mr bush said the situation in iraq was unacceptable , and that responsibility for mistakes rested with him .
but the new troops , most of whom would be sent to baghdad , would help secure neighbourhoods in the capital from insurgents , he said .
he said the effort would succeed where previous operations had failed , because this time troop levels would be sufficient to hold areas that had been cleared .

the grant , to the university of wales ' centre for advanced welsh and celtic studies , is for research on the works of 15th century poet guto 'r glyn .
the award is thought to be the largest of its kind to a welsh university .
glyn also fought in the hundred years war .
the five-year research on him will include a welsh medieval life website .
guto 'r glyn -lrb- c1435-c1493 -rrb- wrote poems of praise to nobles and fought on the yorkist side in the war of the roses .
he was believed to be from denbighshire and wrote during a period in welsh literature known as the " great century " because of the amount of poetry produced .
as a soldier , he fought in france during the hundred years war , supported the yorkist cause in the war of the roses , and received patronage from noble families throughout wales .
glyn 's welsh-language poetry provides insights into the lives of the nobility including descriptions of feasts , fine wines , costumes , military battles , domestic relations and animals .
' significant grant ' the £ 879,383 grant , from the arts and humanities research council -lrb- ahrc -rrb- , will allow a team of researchers at the centre to prepare a new bilingual edition - on the internet and in print - of his poetry .
the ahrc funds research and postgraduate study in the uk 's higher education institutions .
it enables the centre to bring together leading scholars to edit the work of one of the finest poets in late medieval britain dr ann parry owen geraint h jenkins , director of the centre for advanced welsh and celtic studies , based in aberystwyth , said the grant was " extremely large grant in uk terms so is very significant in welsh terms " .
prof jenkins added that the programme of research and publication would help increase knowledge of guto 'r glyn and his poetry .
he said : " there 's a very old edition of his work which is incomplete .
" but he is among the giants of welsh poetry and this new edition will bring him into the light .
" guto 'r glyn is an important historical figure - he fought in the hundred years war and was at bosworth field -lsb- where richard iii was defeated by henry tudor -rsb- .
" he is a witness to lots of things that were happening in 15th century britain . "
' leading scholars ' the project , which includes production of a new collection of guto 'r glyn 's poetry , a bilingual website featuring images of the original manuscripts and a second website concentrating on welsh life during the poet 's lifetime , will be led by ann parry owen .
dr parry owen , who specialises in medieval welsh poetry , said a new edition of guto 'r glyn 's work was long overdue .
she said : " i was delighted to receive this award because it enables the centre to bring together leading scholars to edit the work of one of the finest poets in late medieval britain . "
the project is due to begin in january 2008 and is expected to be completed five years later .

the violence involved thousands of rival protesters at odds over a regional governor 's call for a referendum on greater local autonomy .
supporters of president evo morales say manfred reyes villa is trying to undermine mr morales 's authority .
tension is increasing between mr morales and several elected governors who want more autonomy .
' a political tool ' the protests began four days ago when supporters of the president , the majority of them coca growers , converged on cochabamba 's streets , calling for the resignation of mr reyes villa .
police dressed in riot gear used tear gas to disperse rival protesters , who battled each other with guns , sticks and rocks .
many accuse mr reyes villa of working to undermine the authority of president morales - himself a former coca-grower and the nation 's first indigenous president .
the cochabamba governor - who was elected with 48 % of the vote in 2005 - maintains that he has no reason to resign and has every intention of pressing ahead with his plans for the referendum , regardless of the violence .
mr reyes villa is backed by five other governors , most from the country 's wealthiest eastern provinces , who are also seeking greater autonomy .
they oppose some of the plans of president morales who has nationalised the country 's energy sector and now hopes to have a new constitution approved and implement land reform .

the city was a centre to which poets , philosophers and artists flocked from all over the world .
today only a few intrepid tourists make it to isfahan if they can get a visa .
and the naqshe jahan square , where the king of persia once watched polo games , now has traffic running though one end , even though it is a unesco world heritage site .
" it 's been destroyed , really , really destroyed ; what remains are tiny , tiny pieces of a puzzle .
that just gives us a glimpse of the whole , " explains journalist hassan zuhoori of the cultural heritage news agency in tehran .
the " museum city " of isfahan is rapidly disappearing in the name of modernity and progress .
" you ca n't say isfahan is in danger because we 've already passed that point ; i do n't think there 's much left to destroy , " says mr zuhoori .
construction boom today isfahan is iran 's second biggest city .
migration into isfahan is high and land prices are sky rocketing .
fast profits can be made in construction .
everywhere 400-year-old buildings are being destroyed to make way for new roads or ugly shopping centres .
the local council , which refused to talk to us for this story , has no budget from the central government ; it has to make its money from selling construction licences .
on the banks of the zayandehrud river buildings are not supposed to exceed the tree level but if the construction companies pay a hefty penalty to the local council they can build higher .
the most well-known example of the city authorities spoiling the skyline of isfahan is jahan nama , a shopping and cultural centre .
so seriously did the construction damage the view from the city 's main naqshe jahan square that unesco insisted the top floors be removed .
not all have been destroyed .
the back part of the building is still too high .
but what many can not understand is why there was no attempt to build in a more traditional style here .
modern craftsmen can not match the quality of ancient tiles , experts say " the municipality does n't think at all about the problems that worry us , " says dr parvis najavand who was culture minister just after the revolution .
he believes iran 's national heritage organisation has been so weakened that the municipality no longer listens to what it has to say and it has no power to implement its conservation rules .
nuclear development dr najavand is also upset that iran decided to build one of its most important nuclear sites just seven kilometres -lrb- four miles -rrb- outside isfahan .
" no expert will let you construct a nuclear city so close to a city that is internationally known for its heritage , " he says , worrying what will happen to the city 's monuments if one day the us launches air strikes on the uranium conversion plant .
then there is isfahan 's controversial metro construction .
" speed , security and efficiency " is its motto , but the line runs under one of the most historic streets of isfahan - chahar bagh .
today everyone wants to build ...
they want to be able to drive their car right up to their house , they want parking spaces hassan zuhoori cultural heritage news agency heritage experts in isfahan , who were too fearful to speak on camera , told us six train stops are being built under these gardens that date back more than 100 years .
already many of the trees have been ripped up .
once the train tracks run underground , conservationists fear the vibrations from the trains running in both directions will cause irrevocable damage to buildings along the street .
buildings like the chaharbagh madrassah - according to some , the most beautiful religious school in iran .
the fear is the tile work will literally fall off the walls when it is shaken on a daily basis .
and conservation experts say today 's craftsmen simply can not reproduce the same quality and colour of tiles .
and when the government is doing it - why should individuals be different ?
" today everyone wants to build ...
they want to be able to drive their car right up to their house , they want parking spaces , they want to use today 's modern facilities , " explains mr zuhoori .
" they think they need to update their houses to have progress . "
' weak officials ' everywhere old houses are being knocked down and modern apartment blocks are going up in their place .
the ali qapu palace requires scaffolding support " the main culprit is the government and the national heritage organisation , " says fazlollah faiz , a local shopkeeper inside the naqshe jahan square .
" if an ordinary man has a historic house and wants to knock it down and build a 10-storey building , it 's only because he 's forced to do that to survive economically , " he explains , arguing that the authorities should buy the old houses from their owners so they can build for their children elsewhere .
" unfortunately our officials are weak , " mr faiz concludes .
soon there will be very few of the old safavid houses left in isfahan .
all that will remain are the main monuments - the palaces and mosques .
but even they are not being well cared for .
chehel soton is the pleasure palace of shah abbas - its name means 40 columns but in fact there are only 20 - the rest are reflected in the water pool .
although there is some restoration of the paintings inside going on , the roof of the veranda shows obvious signs of damp and decay .
one isfahani said he had seen with his own eyes water dripping through the exquisite 400-year-old roof .
there is scaffolding clearly holding up parts of the pavilion in the ali qapu palace in the naqshe jahan square as well as assisting the work of local contractors who have been brought in for conservation work .
' rotting wood ' local shopkeepers ask why it has taken so long to get round to preserving the ali qapu palace .
iranians say isfahan 's glory used to be equal to half the world " actually i have seen for myself that its columns have termites and the wood is rotting , " says a man selling souvenirs in the square " these are monuments that date back hundreds of years ; they are an asset for our city . "
and it is not as if the islamic buildings are any better cared for than the king 's palaces .
the friday mosque has damp that experts from the national heritage organisation told reporters came from a leak in the sewerage system underground .
while the imam 's mosque in the naqshe jahan square also has damp , according to local people .
" if they want to destroy it , fine .
they should just bring in a bulldozer .
but if they want to keep these buildings they should do something immediately , " says the souvenir seller .
the 21st century has not been kind to this city whose glory iranians say was once equal to half the world .
and the worry is it is not just isfahan .
" as a person who has spent most of my life trying to preserve iran 's national heritage , training students , writing books and articles , i can say not only in isfahan but in iran generally i believe destruction is underway , " says dr najavand .
" when facing the iranian people no generation can be as shameful as ours , " he concludes .

the city was a centre to which poets , philosophers and artists flocked from all over the world .
today only a few intrepid tourists make it to isfahan if they can get a visa .
and the naqshe jahan square , where the king of persia once watched polo games , now has traffic running though one end , even though it is a unesco world heritage site .
" it 's been destroyed , really , really destroyed ; what remains are tiny , tiny pieces of a puzzle .
that just gives us a glimpse of the whole , " explains journalist hassan zuhoori of the cultural heritage news agency in tehran .
the " museum city " of isfahan is rapidly disappearing in the name of modernity and progress .
" you ca n't say isfahan is in danger because we 've already passed that point ; i do n't think there 's much left to destroy , " says mr zuhoori .
construction boom today isfahan is iran 's second biggest city .
migration into isfahan is high and land prices are sky rocketing .
fast profits can be made in construction .
everywhere 400-year-old buildings are being destroyed to make way for new roads or ugly shopping centres .
the local council , which refused to talk to us for this story , has no budget from the central government ; it has to make its money from selling construction licences .
on the banks of the zayandehrud river buildings are not supposed to exceed the tree level but if the construction companies pay a hefty penalty to the local council they can build higher .
the most well-known example of the city authorities spoiling the skyline of isfahan is jahan nama , a shopping and cultural centre .
so seriously did the construction damage the view from the city 's main naqshe jahan square that unesco insisted the top floors be removed .
not all have been destroyed .
the back part of the building is still too high .
but what many can not understand is why there was no attempt to build in a more traditional style here .
modern craftsmen can not match the quality of ancient tiles , experts say " the municipality does n't think at all about the problems that worry us , " says dr parvis najavand who was culture minister just after the revolution .
he believes iran 's national heritage organisation has been so weakened that the municipality no longer listens to what it has to say and it has no power to implement its conservation rules .
nuclear development dr najavand is also upset that iran decided to build one of its most important nuclear sites just seven kilometres -lrb- four miles -rrb- outside isfahan .
" no expert will let you construct a nuclear city so close to a city that is internationally known for its heritage , " he says , worrying what will happen to the city 's monuments if one day the us launches air strikes on the uranium conversion plant .
then there is isfahan 's controversial metro construction .
" speed , security and efficiency " is its motto , but the line runs under one of the most historic streets of isfahan - chahar bagh .
today everyone wants to build ...
they want to be able to drive their car right up to their house , they want parking spaces hassan zuhoori cultural heritage news agency heritage experts in isfahan , who were too fearful to speak on camera , told us six train stops are being built under these gardens that date back more than 100 years .
already many of the trees have been ripped up .
once the train tracks run underground , conservationists fear the vibrations from the trains running in both directions will cause irrevocable damage to buildings along the street .
buildings like the chaharbagh madrassah - according to some , the most beautiful religious school in iran .
the fear is the tile work will literally fall off the walls when it is shaken on a daily basis .
and conservation experts say today 's craftsmen simply can not reproduce the same quality and colour of tiles .
and when the government is doing it - why should individuals be different ?
" today everyone wants to build ...
they want to be able to drive their car right up to their house , they want parking spaces , they want to use today 's modern facilities , " explains mr zuhoori .
" they think they need to update their houses to have progress . "
' weak officials ' everywhere old houses are being knocked down and modern apartment blocks are going up in their place .
the ali qapu palace requires scaffolding support " the main culprit is the government and the national heritage organisation , " says fazlollah faiz , a local shopkeeper inside the naqshe jahan square .
" if an ordinary man has a historic house and wants to knock it down and build a 10-storey building , it 's only because he 's forced to do that to survive economically , " he explains , arguing that the authorities should buy the old houses from their owners so they can build for their children elsewhere .
" unfortunately our officials are weak , " mr faiz concludes .
soon there will be very few of the old safavid houses left in isfahan .
all that will remain are the main monuments - the palaces and mosques .
but even they are not being well cared for .
chehel soton is the pleasure palace of shah abbas - its name means 40 columns but in fact there are only 20 - the rest are reflected in the water pool .
although there is some restoration of the paintings inside going on , the roof of the veranda shows obvious signs of damp and decay .
one isfahani said he had seen with his own eyes water dripping through the exquisite 400-year-old roof .
there is scaffolding clearly holding up parts of the pavilion in the ali qapu palace in the naqshe jahan square as well as assisting the work of local contractors who have been brought in for conservation work .
' rotting wood ' local shopkeepers ask why it has taken so long to get round to preserving the ali qapu palace .
iranians say isfahan 's glory used to be equal to half the world " actually i have seen for myself that its columns have termites and the wood is rotting , " says a man selling souvenirs in the square " these are monuments that date back hundreds of years ; they are an asset for our city . "
and it is not as if the islamic buildings are any better cared for than the king 's palaces .
the friday mosque has damp that experts from the national heritage organisation told reporters came from a leak in the sewerage system underground .
while the imam 's mosque in the naqshe jahan square also has damp , according to local people .
" if they want to destroy it , fine .
they should just bring in a bulldozer .
but if they want to keep these buildings they should do something immediately , " says the souvenir seller .
the 21st century has not been kind to this city whose glory iranians say was once equal to half the world .
and the worry is it is not just isfahan .
" as a person who has spent most of my life trying to preserve iran 's national heritage , training students , writing books and articles , i can say not only in isfahan but in iran generally i believe destruction is underway , " says dr najavand .

" no expert will let you construct a nuclear city so close to a city that is internationally known for its heritage , " he says , worrying what will happen to the city 's monuments if one day the us launches air strikes on the uranium conversion plant .
then there is isfahan 's controversial metro construction .
" speed , security and efficiency " is its motto , but the line runs under one of the most historic streets of isfahan - chahar bagh .
today everyone wants to build ...
they want to be able to drive their car right up to their house , they want parking spaces hassan zuhoori cultural heritage news agency heritage experts in isfahan , who were too fearful to speak on camera , told us six train stops are being built under these gardens that date back more than 100 years .
already many of the trees have been ripped up .
once the train tracks run underground , conservationists fear the vibrations from the trains running in both directions will cause irrevocable damage to buildings along the street .
buildings like the chaharbagh madrassah - according to some , the most beautiful religious school in iran .
the fear is the tile work will literally fall off the walls when it is shaken on a daily basis .
and conservation experts say today 's craftsmen simply can not reproduce the same quality and colour of tiles .
and when the government is doing it - why should individuals be different ?
" today everyone wants to build ...
they want to be able to drive their car right up to their house , they want parking spaces , they want to use today 's modern facilities , " explains mr zuhoori .
" they think they need to update their houses to have progress . "
' weak officials ' everywhere old houses are being knocked down and modern apartment blocks are going up in their place .
the ali qapu palace requires scaffolding support " the main culprit is the government and the national heritage organisation , " says fazlollah faiz , a local shopkeeper inside the naqshe jahan square .
" if an ordinary man has a historic house and wants to knock it down and build a 10-storey building , it 's only because he 's forced to do that to survive economically , " he explains , arguing that the authorities should buy the old houses from their owners so they can build for their children elsewhere .
" unfortunately our officials are weak , " mr faiz concludes .
soon there will be very few of the old safavid houses left in isfahan .
all that will remain are the main monuments - the palaces and mosques .
but even they are not being well cared for .
chehel soton is the pleasure palace of shah abbas - its name means 40 columns but in fact there are only 20 - the rest are reflected in the water pool .
although there is some restoration of the paintings inside going on , the roof of the veranda shows obvious signs of damp and decay .
one isfahani said he had seen with his own eyes water dripping through the exquisite 400-year-old roof .
there is scaffolding clearly holding up parts of the pavilion in the ali qapu palace in the naqshe jahan square as well as assisting the work of local contractors who have been brought in for conservation work .
' rotting wood ' local shopkeepers ask why it has taken so long to get round to preserving the ali qapu palace .
iranians say isfahan 's glory used to be equal to half the world " actually i have seen for myself that its columns have termites and the wood is rotting , " says a man selling souvenirs in the square " these are monuments that date back hundreds of years ; they are an asset for our city . "
and it is not as if the islamic buildings are any better cared for than the king 's palaces .
the friday mosque has damp that experts from the national heritage organisation told reporters came from a leak in the sewerage system underground .
while the imam 's mosque in the naqshe jahan square also has damp , according to local people .
" if they want to destroy it , fine .
they should just bring in a bulldozer .
but if they want to keep these buildings they should do something immediately , " says the souvenir seller .
the 21st century has not been kind to this city whose glory iranians say was once equal to half the world .
and the worry is it is not just isfahan .
" as a person who has spent most of my life trying to preserve iran 's national heritage , training students , writing books and articles , i can say not only in isfahan but in iran generally i believe destruction is underway , " says dr najavand .
" when facing the iranian people no generation can be as shameful as ours , " he concludes .

timberlake , 25 , and diaz , 34 , started dating after meeting at the kids choice awards in 2003 .
in a joint statement the couple said their relationship had ended " mutually and as friends , with continued love and respect for one another " .
they also said that " recent speculation " and " inaccuracies " had prompted them to issue the statement .
rumours of the couple 's separation have been circulating for many weeks but both had declined to be drawn on it until now .
privacy the pair had fiercely tried to protect their private lives during their relationship , pursuing newspapers that printed false stories about them .
timberlake accepted libel damages from the news of the world over a fabricated story that he had an affair with a british model .

tv maker sharp has demonstrated a television which can connect wirelessly so that it can access your music , video and photos on a pc that has intel 's viiv brand on it .
sony too has realised that digital entertainment means connected experiences and has released an internet video module that plugs into your broadband connection and your bravia tv and delivers content without the need for a pc .
other non-pc solutions include systems from cable and satellite firms who see set-top boxes as the doorway to entertainment , while iptv set-top boxes delivering video over the net could one day be the digital hub .

tech firm intel is hoping it will be have the solution to fit the digital jigsaw together and works with hardware manufacturers - pcs and set-top boxes - as well as with service providers wanting to delivering content .
merlin kister , director of consumer pc producer market at intel , said the company did not want to prescribe to the industry one method of delivering the seamless digital world .
he said : " what works in my home , may not work in yours .

" the nice thing about powerline is that there are multiple places in the room where there are outlets , " he added .

the tragedy , at sheffield wednesday 's ground during an fa cup semi-final , claimed the lives of 96 fans .
speaking on the bbc 's question time , mr mckenzie stood by the allegation that many fans turned up without tickets .
but he said he did not know if the suggestion that some fans picked the victims ' pockets was true .
he also said he was not sure if the claim that some fans urinated on rescue workers was true .
ninety-six people died in the hillsborough disaster he once again refused to apologise for running the story headlined " hillsborough : the truth " .
the statement came after mr mckenzie 's call for tony blair to apologise over the war in iraq .
presenter david dimbleby said : " do you stand by everything you said about liverpool , when you said you were forced to apologise by rupert murdoch ? "
mr mckenzie replied : " they -lsb- the liverpool fans -rsb- want to find somebody who actually caused the disaster .

in atlanta , you could be wrestled to the ground .
it is a cautionary tale for any traveller - distinguished historian felipe fernandez-armesto tried to cross the road while in atlanta for the conference of the american historical association , only to find himself in handcuffs and surrounded by armed police .
" i come from a country where you can cross the road where you like , " said the visiting professor of global environmental history at queen mary college , university of london .
" it had n't occurred to me that i was n't allowed to cross the road between the two main conference venues . "
the bespectacled professor says he did n't realise the " rather intrusive young man " shouting that he should n't cross there was a policeman .
" i thanked him for his advice and went on . "
the officer asked for identification .
the professor asked for his , after which officer leonpacher told him he was under arrest and , the professor claims , kicked his legs from under him , pinned him to the ground and confiscated his box of peppermints .
professor fernandez-armesto then spent eight hours in the cells before the charges were dropped .
he told the times that his colleagues now regard him as " as a combination of rambo , because it took five cops to pin me to the ground , and perry mason , because my eloquence before a judge obtained my immediate release " .
not every jaywalking brit abroad will be similarly blessed , nor enjoy the intervention of the city mayor .
culture clash just because you can do something in the uk does n't mean it 's ok in another country .
jaywalking is an offence in most urban areas in the united states - although enforcement varies between states - and canada , and in places such as singapore , spain , poland , slovenia and australia .
jaywalking pedestrian who crosses without regard to traffic regulations , who steps out anywhere other than a specified crossing , without a green light word originated in the us in early 20th century ' jay ' was slang for a newcomer unfamiliar with city ways in brisbane , police have begun doling out fines after complaints from motorists involved in near-misses with jaywalkers .
in beijing and shanghai , city officials have clamped down on jaywalkers in an attempt to improve public behaviour ahead of the 2008 olympics and 2010 world expo respectively .
but there is no such offence in the uk , where it is considered a personal responsibility to cross the road safely -lrb- although london mayor ken livingstone last summer proposed making jaywalking illegal -rrb- .
the highway code recommends that all pedestrians abide by the green cross code : " where there is a crossing nearby , use it .
otherwise choose a place where you can see clearly in all directions . "
in germany and the netherlands , the onus is more on the motorist .
not stopping for pedestrians on crossings is an offence , and a driver can be issued with a ticket even if they are waiting on the kerb -lrb- again , the expectation is that pedestrians should cross safely -rrb- .
stick to the path some road safety campaigners claim that with traffic heavier , where light phases are timed to allow as many vehicles through an intersection as possible , pedestrians are increasingly taking risks in order to cross the road .
at least prof fernandez-armesto can relax in the knowledge that it 's not just outsiders who commit such heinous offences as crossing the road where they please .
back in 1915 , the atlanta constitution reported that the practice of " jay walking " was all too commonplace .
" people cross the streets any and everywhere , without regard to traffic , darting in front of fast-moving motor vehicles , dodging horses and street cars , and even braving ambulances and fire apparatus with no satisfaction except the consciousness that ' they did it , ' and then having plenty of time to turn and contemplate the danger they have escaped . "
having been carted off in a " filthy , foetid paddy wagon " as the professor described it , that last observation was one denied to him .
some of your comments so far : i was in aachen for a conference and was returning to the station with 15 others to catch the last train of the evening back to our hotel .
the road outside the station was being resurfaced , and there was no obvious place to cross .
but , half way across the road , a whistle blew and two german policemen came running to stop us .
they gave us an on-the-spot fine of 10 euros each and told us to walk 100m up the road and round the corner , while they watched , to the nearest crossing .
we ran , and only just managed to catch the train .
simon , salford , uk there is some fascinating footage of a street scene in san francisco in 1905 illustrating the point -lrb- to watch it , click here -rrb- .
someone set a camera on a moving tram and simply let it run as it went down a busy street .
it shows that if anything behaviour has improved in the past century .
paul t horgan , bracknell , uk my wife and i were in poland once and we crossed a totally empty road .
the only vehicle in sight was a police van , which was not approaching us ... until we crossed .
the officers beckoned us over and began to give us a dressing down .
however , as soon as they realised we were johnny-foreigners , they eased off , explained that the rules were different and politely asked us to use designated crossing in future .
obviously the polish police are more courteous than their us colleagues .
tom , london , uk the very same thing happened to me in la in 2002 .
i was aware of the law but it was evening and unfortunately i did n't see that the car i had crossed in front of was a patrol car .
i foolishly approached the car with my hands in my pockets , something one must never do in la , and was commanded to stop immediately with my hands in the air .
the cantankerous american officers were bamboozled by my foreign id and whisked me off down to the station .
i played the ignorant british teenager and was released back into downtown la at 2am , unaware of my location and no means of getting home .
ben formela , bristol it should be noted that the netherlands legalised jaywalking in 1997 .
the effect on pedestrian fatalities was nil .
more , fatalities in germany and the netherlands are a fraction of what they are in the us , despite walking trips being much more frequent .
given the very strict protection of pedestrians in those countries , it seems that motorists should be held to be considerate of their less well-protected partners on the roads in order to ensure the safety of all sides .
oliver hauss , dortmund , germany moscow 1975 : dragged back to the pavement by students , so my wife and i were not arrested .
vienna , 1996 - occasional shouts , and fines for some friends walking across an empty intersection against a red man .
i became more sympathetic when a woman said i was setting a bad example to her children - i should think of them , not myself .
as a parent myself , touche !
budapest , 2007 - does n't matter whether it is green or red , the motor-idiots always accelerate across red lights - after they have changed - but then take forever to accelerate away on green .
police action ?
zero .
so ...
rule 1 : see a child ?
stop on red , go on green .
rule 2 : see a policeman ?
he should have better things to do than arrest you , unless rule 1 applies ...
alan , budapest , hungary reminds me of a " true story " of a couple of years ago when seconded to work in prague .
one unfortunate british colleague crossed at a pedestrian crossing - no traffic but against the red man light .
not understanding czech , he ignored the shouts of the local plod , who promptly shot him in the leg to catch his attention .
urban myth ?
maybe , but i always tell the tale to visitors to make them more cautious when crossing roads ... it usually works .
mollie , scotland it 's true to an extent .
the police out here do fine people for crossing against the red-light man -lrb- surely i 'm forgetting some correct terminology -rrb- .
i 've been pulled at 3am for crossing empty streets .
but you are n't likely to get shot .
aaron , prague , czech rep i was in honolulu recently and a cop called to me " hey you , no jaywalkin ' in future " .
i said ok and hurried off .
i asked my hotel desk clerk what it was all about and he said that because of the anti-gay , repressive local authorities , walking in an effeminate manner had been outlawed .
i spent the rest of my holiday walking like john wayne and escaped police harassment .
now i know the truth !
bet the clerk had a right old hoot at my expense .
rod gribbin , cambridge i remember being in luzern , switzerland , waiting at the crossing of a barely used access road by the train station , together with about 10 locals .
with not a car in sight , i strolled across - to the audible gasps of the people behind me .
i turned around and one young woman exclaimed " it 's red ! " in german , with a look of utter disbelief on her face .
matthew dear , milton keynes in japan it is mandatory to follow the traffic regulations at the crossings , but there are levels of priority ; a person walking is given a priority over the one using a bicycle , and a motorist usually stops for the walking person to cross .
sobia ahmed , tokyo , japan i 'm from california but have lived in costa rica , paris and barcelona , and i do understand the us 's jaywalking laws .
generally , the streets here are wider , so a saunter across 10m has a lot more risk than that of 4 .
in la , people hardly recognize a pedestrian , and while they 're babbling away on their cell phones , sipping starbucks , and driving with their knees , the jaywalker does n't have a chance .
it 's mostly about size .
you do n't see many native parisians jaywalking the etoile in paris to get to the other side , either .
david gorman , oakland , ca did they give him back his peppermints ?
beth , grand canyon , arizona i really object to the idea of not being allowed to cross the road where and when i deem it safe .
i lived in denmark and used to take great joy in crossing on a red light .
even when there was not a car in sight in any direction the danes would shout at you and point to the red man .
i object to not allowing jaywalking partly because the assumption is that the car is more important than the pedestrian - if the road is clear i should be able to cross .
now i live in saigon where people just wander across between the moving motorbikes .
jaywalking is an essential way of life here , you might die waiting to cross the road !
martin , hcmc , vietnam in the philippines , as part of the government 's effort to discourage jaywalking , they put up giant billboards at the centre of the road saying " bawal tumawid nakamamatay " -lrb- do not cross , it is deadly -rrb- .
prince cruz , metro manila , philippines ever tried crossing the main roads in cairo ?
it looks hairy , but is actually very civilised and easy .
do n't expect the traffic to slow down -lrb- it 's moving pretty slowly and at a steady speed -rrb- .
just walk steadily across the road between the cars .
the drivers are the best i 've seen anywhere , they know what you are going -lrb- and you know where they are going -rrb- .
i 'm sure it does sometimes happen , but in all my years going there , i 've never yet seen anyone hit by a car .
pete green , wymondham , uk i live in switzerland where jaywalking is also illegal , although not really controlled .
but if you get hit anywhere other than on a crossing , you would have no medical insurance .
visitors from the uk seem to think this is funny , and colloquial .
until they get the hospital bills .
i find myself being looked on rather as a village idiot , when i wait for the green man at a crossing in england .
but who is the real idiot ?
the biggest problem in the uk is the distance between crossings .
it is a simple fact of life that people are essentially lazy and will not walk an extra 500m if they do not perceive that they should .
peter , zurich i lived in milan for many years .
over there if a pedestrian even looks like he wants to cross the road at a pedestrian crossing , motorists will accelerate so as not to let him through .
once i visited moscow -lrb- in the old days of brezhnev -rrb- , and nearly got arrested for jaywalking .
i wonder if they are still so strict , i have not been back since .
laurence archer , sydney in sydney and melbourne you are almost fined for not jaywalking , whereas in brisbane , you can end up with a court appearance and almost a criminal conviction if caught jaywalking more than three times .
cars have too much control of the road , pedestrians are waiting longer and longer .
jason , canberra , australia the good professor should take a trip to boston !
he can cross anywhere he likes there , assuming he 's willing to tempt the massachusetts drivers .
aaron , harrisburg , pennsylvania in the us , enforcement of jaywalking laws - and customs - can vary greatly , depending on the city and region .
visit nyc and you 'll see that pedestrians can cross anywhere at anytime , regardless of traffic volume .
traffic tickets , forget jail , are as rare as the dodo bird .
travel 200 miles to washington dc , however , and you 'll find that stepping off the curb at an intersection , not to mention in the middle of a street , can result in honking and dirty stares from drivers .
larry , mt vernon , us as an english expat resident in hong kong , i find the road crossing system most annoying at times .
jaywalking is an offence punishable by a fine , however it is very frustrating to be waiting by a roadside for five minutes for the lights to change and a not a single car has passed by .
this is of course only true in the more rural areas of the city .
i follow the old saying " when in rome ... " which means i cross when i please , just as the locals do .
drs , hong kong you can always spot american tourists in london as they 're always the ones who hover nervously at the edge of the pavement , fearful to cross until the green man shows .
londoners of course just stride out purposefully regardless .
this just confuses the americans even more as they believe we 're all patient folk who like nothing better than to queue endlessly .
j jones , london your article is incorrect when it states " there is no such offence in the uk " .
jaywalking is an offence in northern ireland -lrb- part of the uk -rrb- , although it is rarely enforced .
the enforcing of such is at the discretion of the observing officer .
enforcement usually results in the issuing of a £ 30 non-endorsable fixed penalty notice , however , may result in arrest and court prosecution eg : for failing to provide a satisfactory name and / or address .
david mcinnes , belfast jaywalking is not the only area where us police react excessively .
i know of one colleague who found himself face down on the ground with a gun to his head after failing to come to a complete halt at a stop sign .
david burke , manchester jaywalking illegal in spain ?
i have yet to see any person , here , prosecuted for such an act .
in fact cars often park on pedestrian crossings without being prosecuted .
you also stated that a car in the netherlands has to stop for a pedestrian .
i would not want to ague with a car so i would wait .
ian , galicia , spain on my little island , pedestrians can jump out in front of your car - if you are unlucky enough to hit one , then it 's the car driver that will be arrested and charged .
the spanish police consider hitting a pedestrian -lrb- even if they 've jumped into the path of your car -rrb- a very serious offence .
god help any one that does it !
teri , fuerteventura , spain another example of how car is king in america .
it 's bad enough that cars do n't slow down much near pedestrian crossings anyway with out such a ridiculous law in force .
the car does n't own the road , it should share it with a bit more consideration for others .
kate , bristol so * that * is why the locals were honking their horns at me in san francisco last autumn .
i did wonder .
cheers beeb .
tom , cambridge , uk yet another victimless " crime " , another waste of police resources and time , and another way for the state / councils to extract money from us .
expect it to become law here .

not understanding czech , he ignored the shouts of the local plod , who promptly shot him in the leg to catch his attention .
urban myth ?
maybe , but i always tell the tale to visitors to make them more cautious when crossing roads ... it usually works .
mollie , scotland it 's true to an extent .
the police out here do fine people for crossing against the red-light man -lrb- surely i 'm forgetting some correct terminology -rrb- .
i 've been pulled at 3am for crossing empty streets .
but you are n't likely to get shot .
aaron , prague , czech rep i was in honolulu recently and a cop called to me " hey you , no jaywalkin ' in future " .
i said ok and hurried off .
i asked my hotel desk clerk what it was all about and he said that because of the anti-gay , repressive local authorities , walking in an effeminate manner had been outlawed .
i spent the rest of my holiday walking like john wayne and escaped police harassment .
now i know the truth !
bet the clerk had a right old hoot at my expense .
rod gribbin , cambridge i remember being in luzern , switzerland , waiting at the crossing of a barely used access road by the train station , together with about 10 locals .
with not a car in sight , i strolled across - to the audible gasps of the people behind me .
i turned around and one young woman exclaimed " it 's red ! " in german , with a look of utter disbelief on her face .
matthew dear , milton keynes in japan it is mandatory to follow the traffic regulations at the crossings , but there are levels of priority ; a person walking is given a priority over the one using a bicycle , and a motorist usually stops for the walking person to cross .
sobia ahmed , tokyo , japan i 'm from california but have lived in costa rica , paris and barcelona , and i do understand the us 's jaywalking laws .
generally , the streets here are wider , so a saunter across 10m has a lot more risk than that of 4 .
in la , people hardly recognize a pedestrian , and while they 're babbling away on their cell phones , sipping starbucks , and driving with their knees , the jaywalker does n't have a chance .
it 's mostly about size .
you do n't see many native parisians jaywalking the etoile in paris to get to the other side , either .
david gorman , oakland , ca did they give him back his peppermints ?
beth , grand canyon , arizona i really object to the idea of not being allowed to cross the road where and when i deem it safe .
i lived in denmark and used to take great joy in crossing on a red light .
even when there was not a car in sight in any direction the danes would shout at you and point to the red man .
i object to not allowing jaywalking partly because the assumption is that the car is more important than the pedestrian - if the road is clear i should be able to cross .
now i live in saigon where people just wander across between the moving motorbikes .
jaywalking is an essential way of life here , you might die waiting to cross the road !
martin , hcmc , vietnam in the philippines , as part of the government 's effort to discourage jaywalking , they put up giant billboards at the centre of the road saying " bawal tumawid nakamamatay " -lrb- do not cross , it is deadly -rrb- .
prince cruz , metro manila , philippines ever tried crossing the main roads in cairo ?
it looks hairy , but is actually very civilised and easy .
do n't expect the traffic to slow down -lrb- it 's moving pretty slowly and at a steady speed -rrb- .
just walk steadily across the road between the cars .
the drivers are the best i 've seen anywhere , they know what you are going -lrb- and you know where they are going -rrb- .
i 'm sure it does sometimes happen , but in all my years going there , i 've never yet seen anyone hit by a car .
pete green , wymondham , uk i live in switzerland where jaywalking is also illegal , although not really controlled .
but if you get hit anywhere other than on a crossing , you would have no medical insurance .
visitors from the uk seem to think this is funny , and colloquial .
until they get the hospital bills .
i find myself being looked on rather as a village idiot , when i wait for the green man at a crossing in england .
but who is the real idiot ?
the biggest problem in the uk is the distance between crossings .
it is a simple fact of life that people are essentially lazy and will not walk an extra 500m if they do not perceive that they should .
peter , zurich i lived in milan for many years .
over there if a pedestrian even looks like he wants to cross the road at a pedestrian crossing , motorists will accelerate so as not to let him through .
once i visited moscow -lrb- in the old days of brezhnev -rrb- , and nearly got arrested for jaywalking .
i wonder if they are still so strict , i have not been back since .
laurence archer , sydney in sydney and melbourne you are almost fined for not jaywalking , whereas in brisbane , you can end up with a court appearance and almost a criminal conviction if caught jaywalking more than three times .
cars have too much control of the road , pedestrians are waiting longer and longer .
jason , canberra , australia the good professor should take a trip to boston !
he can cross anywhere he likes there , assuming he 's willing to tempt the massachusetts drivers .
aaron , harrisburg , pennsylvania in the us , enforcement of jaywalking laws - and customs - can vary greatly , depending on the city and region .
visit nyc and you 'll see that pedestrians can cross anywhere at anytime , regardless of traffic volume .
traffic tickets , forget jail , are as rare as the dodo bird .
travel 200 miles to washington dc , however , and you 'll find that stepping off the curb at an intersection , not to mention in the middle of a street , can result in honking and dirty stares from drivers .
larry , mt vernon , us as an english expat resident in hong kong , i find the road crossing system most annoying at times .
jaywalking is an offence punishable by a fine , however it is very frustrating to be waiting by a roadside for five minutes for the lights to change and a not a single car has passed by .
this is of course only true in the more rural areas of the city .
i follow the old saying " when in rome ... " which means i cross when i please , just as the locals do .
drs , hong kong you can always spot american tourists in london as they 're always the ones who hover nervously at the edge of the pavement , fearful to cross until the green man shows .
londoners of course just stride out purposefully regardless .
this just confuses the americans even more as they believe we 're all patient folk who like nothing better than to queue endlessly .
j jones , london your article is incorrect when it states " there is no such offence in the uk " .
jaywalking is an offence in northern ireland -lrb- part of the uk -rrb- , although it is rarely enforced .
the enforcing of such is at the discretion of the observing officer .
enforcement usually results in the issuing of a £ 30 non-endorsable fixed penalty notice , however , may result in arrest and court prosecution eg : for failing to provide a satisfactory name and / or address .
david mcinnes , belfast jaywalking is not the only area where us police react excessively .
i know of one colleague who found himself face down on the ground with a gun to his head after failing to come to a complete halt at a stop sign .
david burke , manchester jaywalking illegal in spain ?
i have yet to see any person , here , prosecuted for such an act .
in fact cars often park on pedestrian crossings without being prosecuted .
you also stated that a car in the netherlands has to stop for a pedestrian .
i would not want to ague with a car so i would wait .
ian , galicia , spain on my little island , pedestrians can jump out in front of your car - if you are unlucky enough to hit one , then it 's the car driver that will be arrested and charged .
the spanish police consider hitting a pedestrian -lrb- even if they 've jumped into the path of your car -rrb- a very serious offence .
god help any one that does it !
teri , fuerteventura , spain another example of how car is king in america .
it 's bad enough that cars do n't slow down much near pedestrian crossings anyway with out such a ridiculous law in force .
the car does n't own the road , it should share it with a bit more consideration for others .
kate , bristol so * that * is why the locals were honking their horns at me in san francisco last autumn .
i did wonder .
cheers beeb .
tom , cambridge , uk yet another victimless " crime " , another waste of police resources and time , and another way for the state / councils to extract money from us .

in atlanta , you could be wrestled to the ground .
it is a cautionary tale for any traveller - distinguished historian felipe fernandez-armesto tried to cross the road while in atlanta for the conference of the american historical association , only to find himself in handcuffs and surrounded by armed police .
" i come from a country where you can cross the road where you like , " said the visiting professor of global environmental history at queen mary college , university of london .
" it had n't occurred to me that i was n't allowed to cross the road between the two main conference venues . "

professor fernandez-armesto then spent eight hours in the cells before the charges were dropped .
he told the times that his colleagues now regard him as " as a combination of rambo , because it took five cops to pin me to the ground , and perry mason , because my eloquence before a judge obtained my immediate release " .
not every jaywalking brit abroad will be similarly blessed , nor enjoy the intervention of the city mayor .
culture clash just because you can do something in the uk does n't mean it 's ok in another country .
jaywalking is an offence in most urban areas in the united states - although enforcement varies between states - and canada , and in places such as singapore , spain , poland , slovenia and australia .
jaywalking pedestrian who crosses without regard to traffic regulations , who steps out anywhere other than a specified crossing , without a green light word originated in the us in early 20th century ' jay ' was slang for a newcomer unfamiliar with city ways in brisbane , police have begun doling out fines after complaints from motorists involved in near-misses with jaywalkers .
in beijing and shanghai , city officials have clamped down on jaywalkers in an attempt to improve public behaviour ahead of the 2008 olympics and 2010 world expo respectively .
but there is no such offence in the uk , where it is considered a personal responsibility to cross the road safely -lrb- although london mayor ken livingstone last summer proposed making jaywalking illegal -rrb- .
the highway code recommends that all pedestrians abide by the green cross code : " where there is a crossing nearby , use it .
otherwise choose a place where you can see clearly in all directions . "
in germany and the netherlands , the onus is more on the motorist .
not stopping for pedestrians on crossings is an offence , and a driver can be issued with a ticket even if they are waiting on the kerb -lrb- again , the expectation is that pedestrians should cross safely -rrb- .
stick to the path some road safety campaigners claim that with traffic heavier , where light phases are timed to allow as many vehicles through an intersection as possible , pedestrians are increasingly taking risks in order to cross the road .
at least prof fernandez-armesto can relax in the knowledge that it 's not just outsiders who commit such heinous offences as crossing the road where they please .
back in 1915 , the atlanta constitution reported that the practice of " jay walking " was all too commonplace .
" people cross the streets any and everywhere , without regard to traffic , darting in front of fast-moving motor vehicles , dodging horses and street cars , and even braving ambulances and fire apparatus with no satisfaction except the consciousness that ' they did it , ' and then having plenty of time to turn and contemplate the danger they have escaped . "
having been carted off in a " filthy , foetid paddy wagon " as the professor described it , that last observation was one denied to him .
some of your comments so far : i was in aachen for a conference and was returning to the station with 15 others to catch the last train of the evening back to our hotel .
the road outside the station was being resurfaced , and there was no obvious place to cross .
but , half way across the road , a whistle blew and two german policemen came running to stop us .
they gave us an on-the-spot fine of 10 euros each and told us to walk 100m up the road and round the corner , while they watched , to the nearest crossing .
we ran , and only just managed to catch the train .
simon , salford , uk there is some fascinating footage of a street scene in san francisco in 1905 illustrating the point -lrb- to watch it , click here -rrb- .
someone set a camera on a moving tram and simply let it run as it went down a busy street .
it shows that if anything behaviour has improved in the past century .
paul t horgan , bracknell , uk my wife and i were in poland once and we crossed a totally empty road .
the only vehicle in sight was a police van , which was not approaching us ... until we crossed .
the officers beckoned us over and began to give us a dressing down .
however , as soon as they realised we were johnny-foreigners , they eased off , explained that the rules were different and politely asked us to use designated crossing in future .
obviously the polish police are more courteous than their us colleagues .
tom , london , uk the very same thing happened to me in la in 2002 .
i was aware of the law but it was evening and unfortunately i did n't see that the car i had crossed in front of was a patrol car .
i foolishly approached the car with my hands in my pockets , something one must never do in la , and was commanded to stop immediately with my hands in the air .
the cantankerous american officers were bamboozled by my foreign id and whisked me off down to the station .
i played the ignorant british teenager and was released back into downtown la at 2am , unaware of my location and no means of getting home .
ben formela , bristol it should be noted that the netherlands legalised jaywalking in 1997 .
the effect on pedestrian fatalities was nil .
more , fatalities in germany and the netherlands are a fraction of what they are in the us , despite walking trips being much more frequent .
given the very strict protection of pedestrians in those countries , it seems that motorists should be held to be considerate of their less well-protected partners on the roads in order to ensure the safety of all sides .
oliver hauss , dortmund , germany moscow 1975 : dragged back to the pavement by students , so my wife and i were not arrested .
vienna , 1996 - occasional shouts , and fines for some friends walking across an empty intersection against a red man .
i became more sympathetic when a woman said i was setting a bad example to her children - i should think of them , not myself .
as a parent myself , touche !
budapest , 2007 - does n't matter whether it is green or red , the motor-idiots always accelerate across red lights - after they have changed - but then take forever to accelerate away on green .
police action ?
zero .
so ...
rule 1 : see a child ?
stop on red , go on green .
rule 2 : see a policeman ?
he should have better things to do than arrest you , unless rule 1 applies ...

in atlanta , you could be wrestled to the ground .
it is a cautionary tale for any traveller - distinguished historian felipe fernandez-armesto tried to cross the road while in atlanta for the conference of the american historical association , only to find himself in handcuffs and surrounded by armed police .
" i come from a country where you can cross the road where you like , " said the visiting professor of global environmental history at queen mary college , university of london .
" it had n't occurred to me that i was n't allowed to cross the road between the two main conference venues . "
the bespectacled professor says he did n't realise the " rather intrusive young man " shouting that he should n't cross there was a policeman .
" i thanked him for his advice and went on . "
the officer asked for identification .
the professor asked for his , after which officer leonpacher told him he was under arrest and , the professor claims , kicked his legs from under him , pinned him to the ground and confiscated his box of peppermints .
professor fernandez-armesto then spent eight hours in the cells before the charges were dropped .
he told the times that his colleagues now regard him as " as a combination of rambo , because it took five cops to pin me to the ground , and perry mason , because my eloquence before a judge obtained my immediate release " .
not every jaywalking brit abroad will be similarly blessed , nor enjoy the intervention of the city mayor .
culture clash just because you can do something in the uk does n't mean it 's ok in another country .
jaywalking is an offence in most urban areas in the united states - although enforcement varies between states - and canada , and in places such as singapore , spain , poland , slovenia and australia .
jaywalking pedestrian who crosses without regard to traffic regulations , who steps out anywhere other than a specified crossing , without a green light word originated in the us in early 20th century ' jay ' was slang for a newcomer unfamiliar with city ways in brisbane , police have begun doling out fines after complaints from motorists involved in near-misses with jaywalkers .
in beijing and shanghai , city officials have clamped down on jaywalkers in an attempt to improve public behaviour ahead of the 2008 olympics and 2010 world expo respectively .
but there is no such offence in the uk , where it is considered a personal responsibility to cross the road safely -lrb- although london mayor ken livingstone last summer proposed making jaywalking illegal -rrb- .
the highway code recommends that all pedestrians abide by the green cross code : " where there is a crossing nearby , use it .
otherwise choose a place where you can see clearly in all directions . "
in germany and the netherlands , the onus is more on the motorist .
not stopping for pedestrians on crossings is an offence , and a driver can be issued with a ticket even if they are waiting on the kerb -lrb- again , the expectation is that pedestrians should cross safely -rrb- .
stick to the path some road safety campaigners claim that with traffic heavier , where light phases are timed to allow as many vehicles through an intersection as possible , pedestrians are increasingly taking risks in order to cross the road .
at least prof fernandez-armesto can relax in the knowledge that it 's not just outsiders who commit such heinous offences as crossing the road where they please .
back in 1915 , the atlanta constitution reported that the practice of " jay walking " was all too commonplace .
" people cross the streets any and everywhere , without regard to traffic , darting in front of fast-moving motor vehicles , dodging horses and street cars , and even braving ambulances and fire apparatus with no satisfaction except the consciousness that ' they did it , ' and then having plenty of time to turn and contemplate the danger they have escaped . "
having been carted off in a " filthy , foetid paddy wagon " as the professor described it , that last observation was one denied to him .
some of your comments so far : i was in aachen for a conference and was returning to the station with 15 others to catch the last train of the evening back to our hotel .
the road outside the station was being resurfaced , and there was no obvious place to cross .
but , half way across the road , a whistle blew and two german policemen came running to stop us .
they gave us an on-the-spot fine of 10 euros each and told us to walk 100m up the road and round the corner , while they watched , to the nearest crossing .
we ran , and only just managed to catch the train .

the eirjet flight in march 2006 should have touched down at city of derry , but instead landed at a former raf base at ballykelly now used by the army .
the 39 passengers and their bags were then taken by road to londonderry .
an air accidents investigation branch report said the pilot did not have charts showing the approach to derry .
the report says the crew of the airbus a320 - operating on behalf of ryanair - believed an instrument landing aid system at city of derry was malfunctioning as what they saw of the runway did not match the instrument readings .

the rocket , fired from street level into the front of the embassy , caused minor damage to the building but no-one was injured .
the us envoy condemned the " very serious attack " , as fire engines and police cordoned off the area .
greece 's public order minister vyron polydoras said it was " very likely " a domestic group was behind the attack .
he said police were investigating claims that a left-wing radical group , revolutionary struggle , was responsible .
' windows shattered ' the blast was reported in the early morning at the embassy , which is on one of the main boulevards in athens .
greek anti-americanism police said a rocket was fired at the us eagle emblem at the front of the building .
" a self-propelled explosive was fired at 0558 -lrb- 0358 gmt -rrb- from the surrounding area , causing minor damage to the front windows and the roof , " a statement from the greek public order ministry said .
the rocket landed in a toilet on the third floor of the building , which also houses ambassador charles ries 's office .
" i am treating this as a very serious attack , " mr ries said .
" the embassy was attacked in a senseless act of violence . "
mr ries said the reliability of any claims of responsibility would have to be assessed .
television pictures showed a mass of emergency vehicles and stationary traffic outside the embassy as the area was sealed off .
left-wing groups the us embassy is one of the most fortified and tightly guarded buildings in the region and is frequently the target of protests in a country brimming with potent anti-americanism , says the bbc 's malcolm brabant in athens .
in february 1996 , it suffered minor damage when unknown attackers - thought to be leftist radicals - fired a rocket at it .
in the past , the far-left november 17 group - now disbanded and whose leaders were jailed in 2003 - attacked greek , us and other foreign targets , killing more than 20 people .
revolutionary struggle - a group which emerged after november 17 disintegrated - is regarded by security experts as greece 's most active terrorist group , our correspondent says .
it has broadly the same left-wing , anarchic anti-capitalist agenda as november 17 and vigorously opposes america 's intervention in iraq and afghanistan , as well as the economic and social policies of the current conservative greek government .
it has carried out a number of bombings and attacks in recent years .

the rocket , fired from street level into the front of the embassy , caused minor damage to the building but no-one was injured .
the us envoy condemned the " very serious attack " , as fire engines and police cordoned off the area .
greece 's public order minister vyron polydoras said it was " very likely " a domestic group was behind the attack .
he said police were investigating claims that a left-wing radical group , revolutionary struggle , was responsible .
' windows shattered ' the blast was reported in the early morning at the embassy , which is on one of the main boulevards in athens .
greek anti-americanism police said a rocket was fired at the us eagle emblem at the front of the building .
" a self-propelled explosive was fired at 0558 -lrb- 0358 gmt -rrb- from the surrounding area , causing minor damage to the front windows and the roof , " a statement from the greek public order ministry said .
the rocket landed in a toilet on the third floor of the building , which also houses ambassador charles ries 's office .
" i am treating this as a very serious attack , " mr ries said .
" the embassy was attacked in a senseless act of violence . "
mr ries said the reliability of any claims of responsibility would have to be assessed .
television pictures showed a mass of emergency vehicles and stationary traffic outside the embassy as the area was sealed off .
left-wing groups the us embassy is one of the most fortified and tightly guarded buildings in the region and is frequently the target of protests in a country brimming with potent anti-americanism , says the bbc 's malcolm brabant in athens .
in february 1996 , it suffered minor damage when unknown attackers - thought to be leftist radicals - fired a rocket at it .
in the past , the far-left november 17 group - now disbanded and whose leaders were jailed in 2003 - attacked greek , us and other foreign targets , killing more than 20 people .
revolutionary struggle - a group which emerged after november 17 disintegrated - is regarded by security experts as greece 's most active terrorist group , our correspondent says .
it has broadly the same left-wing , anarchic anti-capitalist agenda as november 17 and vigorously opposes america 's intervention in iraq and afghanistan , as well as the economic and social policies of the current conservative greek government .
it has carried out a number of bombings and attacks in recent years .
