germany can help you find it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ben donald goes native jaded by the globalization of travel , writer ben donald wanted to go somewhere - anywhere - not yet colonized by the " distasteful hordes . "
his personal patch of paradise turns out to be closer than expected - germany . " this is the not so lonely planet we are living on , " explains a character in donald 's recently published travelogue , " springtime for germany - or how i learned to love lederhosen . " but discerning globetrotters need not despair . " there is a new frontier , " he goes on .
" a lost , or rather overlooked horizon ; a place that is remaining undiscovered , cloaked in poisonous myth and all but unvisited , as we speak , for over 60 years since it became obscured from the minds of most of the world . " is that really germany he 's talking about ? initiated readers may be puzzled to hear it described in such terms .
but wait , he has a point , does n't he ?
it is better than its reputation .
in fact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who could resist germany 's biooodiful fräuleins ? ... " it is a european shangri-la : a romantic , wooded place , a country of rivers , vineyards , forests , castles , poetry and music ... of fast cars , schöne ladies - ' ver ze girls are biooodiful . '
a country preserved by neglect ; ripe and waiting to be revealed again . " blimey .
so why does this much-maligned country get short shrift with travelers , or , in donald-speak , " chavelers " ?
determined to get to the bottom of it , he sets out to discover the real germany .
and guess what ?
contrary to popular belief - at least the one defined by tabloid britain - there 's more to deutschland than soccer coaches with mullets , disney castles and nude bathers .
and no , sturm und drang do n't make hi-fis , and fkk has nothing to do with the ku klux klan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red lights on the reeperbahn as he scuppers the clichés with the same doggedness he mocks the germans for , donald gets to grips with the concepts he feels best sum up the essence of germany and germans .
in the chapter headed gemütlichkeit , he snuggles up with the bavarians at the annual oktoberfest , heads to berlin to capture the zeitgeist , gets the measure of grossmansucht on hamburg 's reeperbahn and meets a german stand-up comedian in schadenfreude . it proves to be a journey of enlightenment . " i am inclined to judge the depth of a man 's civilization by his opinion of germany and her culture , " he concludes . dw-world.de spoke to ben donald and asked him why , if germany 's so great , does britain still harp on about men in socks and sandals , girls with hairy armpits , and of course , david hasselhof . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the definitive guide to the real germany ?
you decide .
ben donald : well , if you 're writing a book about germany you have to use the stereotypes simply because they provide so much material , and humor is a key way of attracting people to a subject .
the british do the same with other countries too .
the stereotypical battle over the sun loungers is an entirely anglo-german issue - italians wouldn ‘ t take a blind bit of notice of a towel on a sun lounger , they ‘ d just sit down and ignore it .
the thing is , the english and the germans are quite similar in their approach to staking out territory and personal privacy . ultimately , the book said as much about brits as it did about germany . good !
that ‘ s how it should be .
i wanted to pitch myself as a kind of everyman , and the idea was that the book would show some sort of development from my original position .
i couldn ‘ t start out being a germanophile .
and in the course of the journey , i as the narrator also reveal a great deal about the british . but there was the assumption that readers would recognize and agree with britain 's stereotypes about germany . to go back to the genesis of this book , there 's simply nothing in the travel bookshops about germany , nothing lighthearted , nothing extolling the delights of the german countryside and way of life .
why is that , when there are hundreds about italy and france and spain ?
there 's something stopping people in britain from seeing germany as a holiday destination and romanticizing a view of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen 's famous cliffs when i do radio interviews in britain , the first questions are invariably : is n't germany just about sausages and dodgy wine , v olksmusik and nena ?
so these stereotypes do still exist - but they 've become more playful , they 're not malicious at all .
and while german ambassadors to britain always get involved with debates with the uk tabloids about how they treat germany , it should be pointed out that the british do this with everyone !
we 're terrible when it comes to xenophobic tendencies . in the book i focus on how germans are extraordinarily introspective and self questioning , and perhaps they just need to see anglo-german attitudes in the context of british xenophobia towards other countries too . even when brits are telling you how much they love france , the wine , the chateaux , their gites and so on , they ca n't help saying it 's just a shame about all the frenchmen in it .
the english view of france , as you see in books such as " a year in the merde " by stephen clarke , is also very stereotypical . but germans might still find the stereotypes offensive ... but what the book does is take these clichés and explode them .
there are few nazi references in it , because i specifically did n't want to write a book only about the war .
when i refer to lebensraum , for example , i explain what it is .
i mention kraft durch freude and the prora resort on rügen as an example of the socialism aspect we rarely talk about in the context of national socialism . i tried to see where the stereotypes are rooted and then to supply a deeper cultural reading .
when i wanted to explore - albeit in a jocular fashion - where germany 's thing about nudism has its roots , i tied it together with the specifically german interpretation of the hippy movement , the second world war and germany 's tradition of the kur -lsb- spa -rsb- culture .
what i did was find plausible explanations as to why these stereotypes emerged in the first place . you could argue that germans , who are quite serious , are the antithesis of the brits , who tend to be relentlessly ironic and su per cilious .
is it basically a per sonality clash ? but they do get on in many areas .
doing business with germans is an utter pleasure and in many ways we have a lot in common .
we actually have many affinities and shared interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein castle - too much for some so might we eventually see a great bond between the two countries ? all the people i speak to one-on-one have brilliant experiences of germany .
but it ‘ s a question of changing perceptions within the media and the collective nation .
in a way , these stereotypes are just too good to give up .
a map was drawn in 1945 , which was when the media explosion happened , and things became hard to change . what is your per sonal favorite part of germany ? i really love the baltic coast , the island of rügen and also further inland , the mecklenburgische seenplatte .

germany can help you find it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ben donald goes native jaded by the globalization of travel , writer ben donald wanted to go somewhere - anywhere - not yet colonized by the " distasteful hordes . "
his personal patch of paradise turns out to be closer than expected - germany . " this is the not so lonely planet we are living on , " explains a character in donald 's recently published travelogue , " springtime for germany - or how i learned to love lederhosen . " but discerning globetrotters need not despair . " there is a new frontier , " he goes on .
" a lost , or rather overlooked horizon ; a place that is remaining undiscovered , cloaked in poisonous myth and all but unvisited , as we speak , for over 60 years since it became obscured from the minds of most of the world . " is that really germany he 's talking about ? initiated readers may be puzzled to hear it described in such terms .
but wait , he has a point , does n't he ?
it is better than its reputation .
in fact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who could resist germany 's biooodiful fräuleins ? ... " it is a european shangri-la : a romantic , wooded place , a country of rivers , vineyards , forests , castles , poetry and music ... of fast cars , schöne ladies - ' ver ze girls are biooodiful . '
a country preserved by neglect ; ripe and waiting to be revealed again . " blimey .
so why does this much-maligned country get short shrift with travelers , or , in donald-speak , " chavelers " ?
determined to get to the bottom of it , he sets out to discover the real germany .
and guess what ?
contrary to popular belief - at least the one defined by tabloid britain - there 's more to deutschland than soccer coaches with mullets , disney castles and nude bathers .
and no , sturm und drang do n't make hi-fis , and fkk has nothing to do with the ku klux klan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red lights on the reeperbahn as he scuppers the clichés with the same doggedness he mocks the germans for , donald gets to grips with the concepts he feels best sum up the essence of germany and germans .
in the chapter headed gemütlichkeit , he snuggles up with the bavarians at the annual oktoberfest , heads to berlin to capture the zeitgeist , gets the measure of grossmansucht on hamburg 's reeperbahn and meets a german stand-up comedian in schadenfreude . it proves to be a journey of enlightenment . " i am inclined to judge the depth of a man 's civilization by his opinion of germany and her culture , " he concludes . dw-world.de spoke to ben donald and asked him why , if germany 's so great , does britain still harp on about men in socks and sandals , girls with hairy armpits , and of course , david hasselhof . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the definitive guide to the real germany ?
you decide .
ben donald : well , if you 're writing a book about germany you have to use the stereotypes simply because they provide so much material , and humor is a key way of attracting people to a subject .
the british do the same with other countries too .
the stereotypical battle over the sun loungers is an entirely anglo-german issue - italians wouldn ‘ t take a blind bit of notice of a towel on a sun lounger , they ‘ d just sit down and ignore it .
the thing is , the english and the germans are quite similar in their approach to staking out territory and personal privacy . ultimately , the book said as much about brits as it did about germany . good !
that ‘ s how it should be .
i wanted to pitch myself as a kind of everyman , and the idea was that the book would show some sort of development from my original position .
i couldn ‘ t start out being a germanophile .
and in the course of the journey , i as the narrator also reveal a great deal about the british . but there was the assumption that readers would recognize and agree with britain 's stereotypes about germany . to go back to the genesis of this book , there 's simply nothing in the travel bookshops about germany , nothing lighthearted , nothing extolling the delights of the german countryside and way of life .
why is that , when there are hundreds about italy and france and spain ?
there 's something stopping people in britain from seeing germany as a holiday destination and romanticizing a view of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen 's famous cliffs when i do radio interviews in britain , the first questions are invariably : is n't germany just about sausages and dodgy wine , v olksmusik and nena ?
so these stereotypes do still exist - but they 've become more playful , they 're not malicious at all .
and while german ambassadors to britain always get involved with debates with the uk tabloids about how they treat germany , it should be pointed out that the british do this with everyone !
we 're terrible when it comes to xenophobic tendencies . in the book i focus on how germans are extraordinarily introspective and self questioning , and perhaps they just need to see anglo-german attitudes in the context of british xenophobia towards other countries too . even when brits are telling you how much they love france , the wine , the chateaux , their gites and so on , they ca n't help saying it 's just a shame about all the frenchmen in it .
the english view of france , as you see in books such as " a year in the merde " by stephen clarke , is also very stereotypical . but germans might still find the stereotypes offensive ... but what the book does is take these clichés and explode them .
there are few nazi references in it , because i specifically did n't want to write a book only about the war .
when i refer to lebensraum , for example , i explain what it is .
i mention kraft durch freude and the prora resort on rügen as an example of the socialism aspect we rarely talk about in the context of national socialism . i tried to see where the stereotypes are rooted and then to supply a deeper cultural reading .
when i wanted to explore - albeit in a jocular fashion - where germany 's thing about nudism has its roots , i tied it together with the specifically german interpretation of the hippy movement , the second world war and germany 's tradition of the kur -lsb- spa -rsb- culture .
what i did was find plausible explanations as to why these stereotypes emerged in the first place . you could argue that germans , who are quite serious , are the antithesis of the brits , who tend to be relentlessly ironic and su per cilious .
is it basically a per sonality clash ? but they do get on in many areas .
doing business with germans is an utter pleasure and in many ways we have a lot in common .
we actually have many affinities and shared interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein castle - too much for some so might we eventually see a great bond between the two countries ? all the people i speak to one-on-one have brilliant experiences of germany .
but it ‘ s a question of changing perceptions within the media and the collective nation .
in a way , these stereotypes are just too good to give up .
a map was drawn in 1945 , which was when the media explosion happened , and things became hard to change . what is your per sonal favorite part of germany ? i really love the baltic coast , the island of rügen and also further inland , the mecklenburgische seenplatte .
i 'd also love to go back to thuringia .

germany can help you find it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ben donald goes native jaded by the globalization of travel , writer ben donald wanted to go somewhere - anywhere - not yet colonized by the " distasteful hordes . "
his personal patch of paradise turns out to be closer than expected - germany . " this is the not so lonely planet we are living on , " explains a character in donald 's recently published travelogue , " springtime for germany - or how i learned to love lederhosen . " but discerning globetrotters need not despair . " there is a new frontier , " he goes on .
" a lost , or rather overlooked horizon ; a place that is remaining undiscovered , cloaked in poisonous myth and all but unvisited , as we speak , for over 60 years since it became obscured from the minds of most of the world . " is that really germany he 's talking about ? initiated readers may be puzzled to hear it described in such terms .
but wait , he has a point , does n't he ?
it is better than its reputation .
in fact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who could resist germany 's biooodiful fräuleins ? ... " it is a european shangri-la : a romantic , wooded place , a country of rivers , vineyards , forests , castles , poetry and music ... of fast cars , schöne ladies - ' ver ze girls are biooodiful . '
a country preserved by neglect ; ripe and waiting to be revealed again . " blimey .
so why does this much-maligned country get short shrift with travelers , or , in donald-speak , " chavelers " ?
determined to get to the bottom of it , he sets out to discover the real germany .
and guess what ?
contrary to popular belief - at least the one defined by tabloid britain - there 's more to deutschland than soccer coaches with mullets , disney castles and nude bathers .
and no , sturm und drang do n't make hi-fis , and fkk has nothing to do with the ku klux klan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red lights on the reeperbahn as he scuppers the clichés with the same doggedness he mocks the germans for , donald gets to grips with the concepts he feels best sum up the essence of germany and germans .
in the chapter headed gemütlichkeit , he snuggles up with the bavarians at the annual oktoberfest , heads to berlin to capture the zeitgeist , gets the measure of grossmansucht on hamburg 's reeperbahn and meets a german stand-up comedian in schadenfreude . it proves to be a journey of enlightenment . " i am inclined to judge the depth of a man 's civilization by his opinion of germany and her culture , " he concludes . dw-world.de spoke to ben donald and asked him why , if germany 's so great , does britain still harp on about men in socks and sandals , girls with hairy armpits , and of course , david hasselhof . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the definitive guide to the real germany ?
you decide .
ben donald : well , if you 're writing a book about germany you have to use the stereotypes simply because they provide so much material , and humor is a key way of attracting people to a subject .
the british do the same with other countries too .
the stereotypical battle over the sun loungers is an entirely anglo-german issue - italians wouldn ‘ t take a blind bit of notice of a towel on a sun lounger , they ‘ d just sit down and ignore it .
the thing is , the english and the germans are quite similar in their approach to staking out territory and personal privacy . ultimately , the book said as much about brits as it did about germany . good !
that ‘ s how it should be .
i wanted to pitch myself as a kind of everyman , and the idea was that the book would show some sort of development from my original position .
i couldn ‘ t start out being a germanophile .
and in the course of the journey , i as the narrator also reveal a great deal about the british . but there was the assumption that readers would recognize and agree with britain 's stereotypes about germany . to go back to the genesis of this book , there 's simply nothing in the travel bookshops about germany , nothing lighthearted , nothing extolling the delights of the german countryside and way of life .
why is that , when there are hundreds about italy and france and spain ?
there 's something stopping people in britain from seeing germany as a holiday destination and romanticizing a view of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen 's famous cliffs when i do radio interviews in britain , the first questions are invariably : is n't germany just about sausages and dodgy wine , v olksmusik and nena ?
so these stereotypes do still exist - but they 've become more playful , they 're not malicious at all .
and while german ambassadors to britain always get involved with debates with the uk tabloids about how they treat germany , it should be pointed out that the british do this with everyone !
we 're terrible when it comes to xenophobic tendencies . in the book i focus on how germans are extraordinarily introspective and self questioning , and perhaps they just need to see anglo-german attitudes in the context of british xenophobia towards other countries too . even when brits are telling you how much they love france , the wine , the chateaux , their gites and so on , they ca n't help saying it 's just a shame about all the frenchmen in it .
the english view of france , as you see in books such as " a year in the merde " by stephen clarke , is also very stereotypical . but germans might still find the stereotypes offensive ... but what the book does is take these clichés and explode them .
there are few nazi references in it , because i specifically did n't want to write a book only about the war .
when i refer to lebensraum , for example , i explain what it is .
i mention kraft durch freude and the prora resort on rügen as an example of the socialism aspect we rarely talk about in the context of national socialism . i tried to see where the stereotypes are rooted and then to supply a deeper cultural reading .
when i wanted to explore - albeit in a jocular fashion - where germany 's thing about nudism has its roots , i tied it together with the specifically german interpretation of the hippy movement , the second world war and germany 's tradition of the kur -lsb- spa -rsb- culture .
what i did was find plausible explanations as to why these stereotypes emerged in the first place . you could argue that germans , who are quite serious , are the antithesis of the brits , who tend to be relentlessly ironic and su per cilious .
is it basically a per sonality clash ? but they do get on in many areas .
doing business with germans is an utter pleasure and in many ways we have a lot in common .
we actually have many affinities and shared interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein castle - too much for some so might we eventually see a great bond between the two countries ? all the people i speak to one-on-one have brilliant experiences of germany .
but it ‘ s a question of changing perceptions within the media and the collective nation .
in a way , these stereotypes are just too good to give up .
a map was drawn in 1945 , which was when the media explosion happened , and things became hard to change . what is your per sonal favorite part of germany ? i really love the baltic coast , the island of rügen and also further inland , the mecklenburgische seenplatte .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 23.07.2007 germany 's steinmeier proposes troika solution for kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers under the un 's protectorate mandate have policed kosovo since 1999 an international troika of the european union , russia and the united states , should take charge of discussions on the final status of kosovo , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said monday . with time running out on a decision on the future of the serbian province , steinmeier said he wanted discussions on kosovo to be led by a small team rather than the six-nation contract group composed of the us , britain , germany , france , italy and russia .
" i favor the concept of an international troika , made up of the us , russia and eu , so with that we would have three international partners to negotiate with the serbs and the kosovars -lrb- ethnic albanians -rrb- , " steinmeier told reporters at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels .
he said that such a troika offered the " best chance " to secure a so far elusive deal on kosovo .
" i think that once russia and the united states sit at the table together , there will be a very real possibility that the kosovars and the serbs will start acting the way they should , " he said .
steinmeier 's proposal comes after russia last week threatened to veto yet another draft un security council resolution calling for supervised independence for kosovo .
steinmeier seeking alternative to contact group others , also seeking to avert a russian veto by putting preparations for the un resolution on hold , have said discussions on kosovo should be spearheaded by the contact group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier continues to push for supervised independence steinmeier said there was also a suggestion that un secretary-general ban ki-moon should appoint a new envoy to replace martti ahtisaari to mediate between serbs and kosovars .
however , the proposed troika discussions would continue to focus on ahtisaari 's plan for supervised independence for kosovo , steinmeier added .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn also said the eu wanted to move forward on the basis of ahtisaari 's recommendation that kosovo be granted " independence supervised by the international community . "
" if the contact group is going to have further negotiations we are of course ready to contribute to those , " rehn told reporters .
he warned that it is " essential that both parties including serbia take finally a constructive and realistic approach to these negotiations . "
eu officials , however , once again stated that if the troika proposal was rejected and the issue moved to the contact group , it would be a temporary solution and that the un security council would have the final say to the status of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia and kosovo came to the table - but agreed to nothing luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn also backed steinmeier 's proposal , saying it was important that serbs and kosovars came back to the negotiating table .
" if they are not able to talk together about their future , then others will take the decisions , " asselborn said .
steinmeier said he had discussed his troika proposal with ban , russian foreign minister sergi lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
" now that we all have to presume there will not be a security council resolution , i feel it is important that we do n't leave the ongoing process to its own devices , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister stated that stability in the western balkans was a key eu priority , adding , " the international community needs therefore to maintain its joint responsibility towards the region . "
eu 's credibility at stake over kosovo other eu foreign ministers at the brussels meeting emphasized that the eu 's credibility was on the line over the resolution of kosovo ’ s status .
" the stability of the balkans , the unity of the european union , the credibility of us versus the united states and russia is at stake , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt , a balkans expert within the eu , told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish balkan expert bildt sees kosovo as the eu 's problem bildt added that unity between the eu states over kosovo was " absolutely paramount " if the issue of kosovo was to move from the un security council to the international contact group .
british foreign secretary david miliband echoed bildt 's statement on eu unity .
" it 's probably important that we establish our own position and are clear about the need for strong european leadership and strong european unity in this area , " he said .
russian resistance scuppers un resolution the europeans and their us allies on friday postponed attempts to secure a security council resolution that would have granted kosovo " supervised independence , " in the face of a likely russian veto .
russia , a strong ally of serbia , had complained that recognizing an independent kosovo would send the wrong signal to other breakaway regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is being backed in its stance by its ally russia serbia has said such a move would be a breach of its national sovereignty but concedes it could give special autonomy to kosovo .
after talks with rice on monday , kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said the province would work with the united states and europe to coordinate its future and not unilaterally declare independence .
" for us it is critical that the process is coordinated and moves ahead in close cooperation with the international community , the us and the european union in the first place , " he told the afp news agency .
" of course , a formal announcement of independence will happen in due course , but in cooperation and in close partnership with the countries which are supportive of the kosovo independence . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when a nato campaign drove out serb forces after accusing them of committing atrocities against ethnic albanians .
in april this year , ahtisaari proposed independence under the supervision of the eu after 13 months of serb-albanian talks ended in deadlock . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 23.07.2007 exhibition dedicated to " forgotten " concentration camp opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flossenbürg gets a permament memorial exhibition some 60 years after liberation for years flossenbürg has been regarded as one of the " forgotten concentration camps " of world war ii .
now , a new exhibition has opened which tells the story of those who were incarcerated and who lost their lives there . a postcard in one of the first display rooms of the new museum reads : " greetings from flossenbürg . "
the friendly greeting is positioned under a picture of the historic castle ruins for which the small town on the german-czech border is still well known for .
in fact , while the postcard is from the 1920s , it could be from the present day .
what flossenbürg is less famous - or notorious - for is that it was the location for one of the nazis ' 12 largest concentration camps ; the camp where german theologian dietrich bonhoeffer died along with tens of thousands of other victims .
after the war , the camp and its history slowly slipped into oblivion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietrich bonhoeffer was one of the tens of thousands to be killed at flossenbürg but the new exhibition , which opened to the public on sunday , more than 60 years after the camp was liberated , aims to commemorate those who lost their lives at flossenbürg and its surrounding camps and return its role in the " final solution " to the modern history books .
after being liberated , the camp became the site of residential buildings and a toy factory moved into its empty warehouse .
only in the 1980s did a small exhibit about the camp first appear .
one of the main reasons it took so long for the camp to be remembered has much to do with the demographics of those who were imprisoned there .
" two thirds of the prisoners were eastern europeans , " said christian omonsky , the press coordinator of the flossenbürg exhibit , adding that the process of recounting the stories and compiling the evidence could only begin after the iron curtain fell and the former prisoners were able to visit the camp in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of its liberation .
since then - with the help of survivors , local people and historians - omonsky , museum director jörg skriebeleit and the rest of the museum 's staff have created a memorial for the concentration camp .
painstaking research to create memorial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family photos show lives about to be changed forever the exhibition is the result of four years of extensive research by skriebeleit and his team .
their research included hundreds of interviews with former prisoners to fill in the gaps of the camp 's history .
the work recreates an authentic snapshot of everyday life in the camp , one which not only shows the suffering of the prisoners but also the lives of those responsible for the suffering .
for example , photos of ss officers enjoying leisure time feature alongside pictures of emaciated inmates .
during world war ii , flossenbürg was an administrative center for 90 camps in bavaria , bohemia and saxony .
jews , sinti and roma were locked up in these camps along with political dissidents , prisoners of war , homosexuals and " professional criminals . "
in total , the camps held around16,000 women and 84,000 men .
in flossenbürg and its surrounding camps almost 30,000 prisoners died as a result of murder by ss officers , hard labor and accidents in the nearby stone quarry , frostbite or illnesses such as pneumonia and tuberculosis .
until recently , those who died were only numbers in a ledger .
" we would like to give these victims who had disappeared from the public consciousness for decades a human face , " said skriebeleit .
the central hall of the exhibition attempts to do just that with a selection of personal photographs from prisoners , taken before they were deported .
the images of families , holidays , young lovers , weddings and smiling youths give a clear indication of what was taken from these people when imprisioned within the confines of the camp .
ordinary lives swapped for horror and death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skriebeleit and a model of the war-time camp texts accompanying the photos explain the victims ' fates and artwork from survivors depict the horrors they may have experienced .
one drawing shows the execution of five prisoners in front of a christmas tree while the rest of the camp looks on .
while it has taken many years to bring flossenbürg out of the shadows of history , the survivors of the camp have visited regularly since they have been able to .
" for the survivors , returning always reminds us of the past , " said lisa mikova from prague .
" but we want to tell school children , for instance , about our history in the hope that we can warn them about the dangers of fascism . "
mikova was sent to the camp in 1942 because she was jewish .
her parents , her parents-in-law and a brother-in-law were killed in auschwitz .
she was sent to a camp in freiberg .
" there we had to work extremely hard in an airplane factory , for 12 hours a day , " mikova said .
" then we had to go through the town to get to the camp huts .
it was very cold , because we were dressed very poorly , without underwear and we only had clogs .
our heads were shaved bald .
and there was not a lot to eat - only a little bit of brown water that they called coffee as well as weak soup and a piece of bread . "
sunday 's opening attracted a number of prominent figures .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier attended along with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , whose father was a prisoner in flossenbürg .
charlotte knobloch of germany 's central council of jews , romani rose from the central council of the sinti and roma and israeli ambassador shimon stein were also there .
there were also 84 former prisoners among those viewing the exhibition , an experience that was difficult for many .
mikova , however , was one of those ready to face the past .
" of course there are things which remain with us , things that one can never forget or get over , " she said .

now , a new exhibition has opened which tells the story of those who were incarcerated and who lost their lives there . a postcard in one of the first display rooms of the new museum reads : " greetings from flossenbürg . "
the friendly greeting is positioned under a picture of the historic castle ruins for which the small town on the german-czech border is still well known for .
in fact , while the postcard is from the 1920s , it could be from the present day .
what flossenbürg is less famous - or notorious - for is that it was the location for one of the nazis ' 12 largest concentration camps ; the camp where german theologian dietrich bonhoeffer died along with tens of thousands of other victims .
after the war , the camp and its history slowly slipped into oblivion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietrich bonhoeffer was one of the tens of thousands to be killed at flossenbürg but the new exhibition , which opened to the public on sunday , more than 60 years after the camp was liberated , aims to commemorate those who lost their lives at flossenbürg and its surrounding camps and return its role in the " final solution " to the modern history books .
after being liberated , the camp became the site of residential buildings and a toy factory moved into its empty warehouse .
only in the 1980s did a small exhibit about the camp first appear .
one of the main reasons it took so long for the camp to be remembered has much to do with the demographics of those who were imprisoned there .
" two thirds of the prisoners were eastern europeans , " said christian omonsky , the press coordinator of the flossenbürg exhibit , adding that the process of recounting the stories and compiling the evidence could only begin after the iron curtain fell and the former prisoners were able to visit the camp in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of its liberation .
since then - with the help of survivors , local people and historians - omonsky , museum director jörg skriebeleit and the rest of the museum 's staff have created a memorial for the concentration camp .
painstaking research to create memorial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family photos show lives about to be changed forever the exhibition is the result of four years of extensive research by skriebeleit and his team .
their research included hundreds of interviews with former prisoners to fill in the gaps of the camp 's history .
the work recreates an authentic snapshot of everyday life in the camp , one which not only shows the suffering of the prisoners but also the lives of those responsible for the suffering .
for example , photos of ss officers enjoying leisure time feature alongside pictures of emaciated inmates .
during world war ii , flossenbürg was an administrative center for 90 camps in bavaria , bohemia and saxony .
jews , sinti and roma were locked up in these camps along with political dissidents , prisoners of war , homosexuals and " professional criminals . "
in total , the camps held around16,000 women and 84,000 men .
in flossenbürg and its surrounding camps almost 30,000 prisoners died as a result of murder by ss officers , hard labor and accidents in the nearby stone quarry , frostbite or illnesses such as pneumonia and tuberculosis .
until recently , those who died were only numbers in a ledger .
" we would like to give these victims who had disappeared from the public consciousness for decades a human face , " said skriebeleit .
the central hall of the exhibition attempts to do just that with a selection of personal photographs from prisoners , taken before they were deported .
the images of families , holidays , young lovers , weddings and smiling youths give a clear indication of what was taken from these people when imprisioned within the confines of the camp .
ordinary lives swapped for horror and death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skriebeleit and a model of the war-time camp texts accompanying the photos explain the victims ' fates and artwork from survivors depict the horrors they may have experienced .
one drawing shows the execution of five prisoners in front of a christmas tree while the rest of the camp looks on .
while it has taken many years to bring flossenbürg out of the shadows of history , the survivors of the camp have visited regularly since they have been able to .
" for the survivors , returning always reminds us of the past , " said lisa mikova from prague .
" but we want to tell school children , for instance , about our history in the hope that we can warn them about the dangers of fascism . "
mikova was sent to the camp in 1942 because she was jewish .
her parents , her parents-in-law and a brother-in-law were killed in auschwitz .
she was sent to a camp in freiberg .
" there we had to work extremely hard in an airplane factory , for 12 hours a day , " mikova said .
" then we had to go through the town to get to the camp huts .
it was very cold , because we were dressed very poorly , without underwear and we only had clogs .
our heads were shaved bald .
and there was not a lot to eat - only a little bit of brown water that they called coffee as well as weak soup and a piece of bread . "
sunday 's opening attracted a number of prominent figures .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier attended along with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , whose father was a prisoner in flossenbürg .
charlotte knobloch of germany 's central council of jews , romani rose from the central council of the sinti and roma and israeli ambassador shimon stein were also there .
there were also 84 former prisoners among those viewing the exhibition , an experience that was difficult for many .
mikova , however , was one of those ready to face the past .
" of course there are things which remain with us , things that one can never forget or get over , " she said .

" our democracy has successfully passed a test ...
our unity , democracy and the republic have emerged stronger from the ballot box , " erdogan said overnight outside akp headquarters as fireworks lit up the sky and hundreds of supporters cheered . the governing party , which has its roots in a now-banned islamist movement , won 46.3 percent of the vote , leading its closest rival by a wide margin , according to unofficial results after 99.9 percent of the ballots were counted . it was the largest support a turkish party has gained since the 1969 legislative election .
a comfortable lead the support the akp garnered should translate into 339 seats in the 550-member parliament , enough for it to once again form a government on its own . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks voted sunday for a new parliament that will face a host of challenges the party had 352 members in the outgoing house and despite support for it increasing by 12 percentage points compared to 2002 , the number of its seats will decline because more parties will be represented in parliament .

the right-wing nationalist action party -lrb- mhp -rrb- was third with 14.2 percent and 71 seats . no other party passed the 10-percent national threshold needed to enter parliament , but 28 independent candidates won seats , 24 of them kurds campaigning for broader rights for their sizeable community . populist policies with virtually no chance of actually winning government , the akp 's nearest rivals had campaigned on populist policies and waged a scare campaign that portrayed the government as being not only anti-secular but also of failing to adequately deal with rebels from the kurdish workers ' party , of whom around 3,500 are based in northern iraq . around 42.5 million people were eligible to vote in sunday 's election of 550 members of parliament .
ten people were injured in fighting at voting booths in the south-east , but in general voting was peaceful at 160,000 polling stations across the country .
erdogan was forced to call sunday 's election after a bungled attempt to place his right-hand man , foreign minister abdullah gül , in the presidential palace in ankara .
millions of people took to the streets to protest the prospect of gül becoming president .
they objected to gül 's past involvement in conservative islamist groups , the fact that his wife wears an islamic-style headscarf - no president 's wife in turkey has ever worn one - and also at the prospect of the akp controlling the government , the parliament and presidency .
the military stepped in in april effectively scuttling the presidential election process by declaring it would do whatever necessary to protect secularism . as soon as the new parliament opens , its first task will be to elect a new president . erdogan has said he will seek a compromise in the presidential election , but insists that the candidate must be from his party . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" after an initial scrutiny of the draft reform treaty we see that solutions proposed by ... the -lsb- eu -rsb- presidency are close to our expectations , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told a news conference after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
warsaw had initially insisted that groups of eu member states have the power to block contentious legislation for a two-year " period of scrutiny " but later dropped the demand .
" we will not insist on an initial requirement of two years , " fotyga said , adding that she still expected a period lasting a " reasonable time " to be incorporated in the final document .
eu observers have said that period of time would likely be a maximum of four months .
draft ready by october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel forged the compromise with her european counterparts in june portuguese foreign minister luis amado , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , welcomed the polish statements and said he expected a draft of the reform treaty to be hammered out and agreed to by october and ratified by mid-2009 .
" we should be able to have a new treaty as soon as possible , " said amado .
" we have a commitment from all ... to meet these requirements . "
the european commission president jose manuel barroso urged all eu states to show " loyal and active support " to the portuguese eu presidency , saying it was time the bloc stopped feuding over institutions and faced key challenges of today .
" we need to work quickly but carefully , " barroso said .
political debate still to come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amado said he expects the draft treaty to be ready for approval in october amado added that monday 's talks focused on technical aspects of the draft treaty and that its political dimensions would be debated later .
eu legal experts will open discussions on the treaty in brussels on tuesday and are set to meet regularly until the bloc 's summit in lisbon in october .
" i envisage the possibility of some level of political discussion but not at the moment , " he said .
" it is vital that the union should not allow itself to be paralysed once again on account of internal , institutional problems , so that is may respond to the real challenges that it must face . "
under german chancellor angela merkel 's leadership , eu members agreed in june to a deal that would streamline the bloc by giving more power to its foreign policy chief , electing a long-term eu president and instituting changes to the bloc 's voting system .
luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn predicted that the treaty details could be finalized at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in early september but warned : " the devil is in the detail . "
the new amended treaty will replace an eu draft constitution which was rejected by dutch and french voters two years ago , plunging the bloc into crisis .
eu governments are hoping the new rulebook will be ratified by their legislatures over the coming months and enter into force by summer 2009 , just ahead of elections to the european parliament . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 23.07.2007 germany 's steinmeier proposes troika solution for kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers under the un 's protectorate mandate have policed kosovo since 1999 an international troika of the european union , russia and the united states , should take charge of discussions on the final status of kosovo , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said monday . with time running out on a decision on the future of the serbian province , steinmeier said he wanted discussions on kosovo to be led by a small team rather than the six-nation contract group composed of the us , britain , germany , france , italy and russia .
" i favor the concept of an international troika , made up of the us , russia and eu , so with that we would have three international partners to negotiate with the serbs and the kosovars -lrb- ethnic albanians -rrb- , " steinmeier told reporters at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels .
he said that such a troika offered the " best chance " to secure a so far elusive deal on kosovo .
" i think that once russia and the united states sit at the table together , there will be a very real possibility that the kosovars and the serbs will start acting the way they should , " he said .
steinmeier 's proposal comes after russia last week threatened to veto yet another draft un security council resolution calling for supervised independence for kosovo .
steinmeier seeking alternative to contact group others , also seeking to avert a russian veto by putting preparations for the un resolution on hold , have said discussions on kosovo should be spearheaded by the contact group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier continues to push for supervised independence steinmeier said there was also a suggestion that un secretary-general ban ki-moon should appoint a new envoy to replace martti ahtisaari to mediate between serbs and kosovars .
however , the proposed troika discussions would continue to focus on ahtisaari 's plan for supervised independence for kosovo , steinmeier added .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn also said the eu wanted to move forward on the basis of ahtisaari 's recommendation that kosovo be granted " independence supervised by the international community . "
" if the contact group is going to have further negotiations we are of course ready to contribute to those , " rehn told reporters .
he warned that it is " essential that both parties including serbia take finally a constructive and realistic approach to these negotiations . "
eu officials , however , once again stated that if the troika proposal was rejected and the issue moved to the contact group , it would be a temporary solution and that the un security council would have the final say to the status of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia and kosovo came to the table - but agreed to nothing luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn also backed steinmeier 's proposal , saying it was important that serbs and kosovars came back to the negotiating table .
" if they are not able to talk together about their future , then others will take the decisions , " asselborn said .
steinmeier said he had discussed his troika proposal with ban , russian foreign minister sergi lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
" now that we all have to presume there will not be a security council resolution , i feel it is important that we do n't leave the ongoing process to its own devices , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister stated that stability in the western balkans was a key eu priority , adding , " the international community needs therefore to maintain its joint responsibility towards the region . "
eu 's credibility at stake over kosovo other eu foreign ministers at the brussels meeting emphasized that the eu 's credibility was on the line over the resolution of kosovo ’ s status .
" the stability of the balkans , the unity of the european union , the credibility of us versus the united states and russia is at stake , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt , a balkans expert within the eu , told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish balkan expert bildt sees kosovo as the eu 's problem bildt added that unity between the eu states over kosovo was " absolutely paramount " if the issue of kosovo was to move from the un security council to the international contact group .
british foreign secretary david miliband echoed bildt 's statement on eu unity .
" it 's probably important that we establish our own position and are clear about the need for strong european leadership and strong european unity in this area , " he said .
russian resistance scuppers un resolution the europeans and their us allies on friday postponed attempts to secure a security council resolution that would have granted kosovo " supervised independence , " in the face of a likely russian veto .
russia , a strong ally of serbia , had complained that recognizing an independent kosovo would send the wrong signal to other breakaway regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is being backed in its stance by its ally russia serbia has said such a move would be a breach of its national sovereignty but concedes it could give special autonomy to kosovo .
after talks with rice on monday , kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said the province would work with the united states and europe to coordinate its future and not unilaterally declare independence .
" for us it is critical that the process is coordinated and moves ahead in close cooperation with the international community , the us and the european union in the first place , " he told the afp news agency .
" of course , a formal announcement of independence will happen in due course , but in cooperation and in close partnership with the countries which are supportive of the kosovo independence . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when a nato campaign drove out serb forces after accusing them of committing atrocities against ethnic albanians .
in april this year , ahtisaari proposed independence under the supervision of the eu after 13 months of serb-albanian talks ended in deadlock . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said the german interior ministry knew about 14 islamists from germany who had been in pakistan or were still there .
it added that authorities were calculating that more individuals from germany would be trained in al qaeda-run terrorist camps .
" a new quality in threat to germany " the weekly said at least seven islamists from germany had been arrested in pakistan over the past months and that islamabad was likely in the next few weeks to deport the men .
" we must assume that those who have come back from pakistan are planning attacks , " august hanning , germany 's deputy interior minister , said in an interview with the paper .
" we need to do everything possible to find out who went to pakistan and was trained there . "
he added that " this is a new , specific threat and is a cause for concern .
there is a new quality in the threat to germany . "
hanning added there were several indications that al qaeda had germany and german installations abroad , such as embassies , in its sight .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble echoed the view , saying there was a threat that suicide bombers were now being sent to europe .

last month schäuble said authorities needed to increase vigilance due to the possibility that militants might carry out suicide attacks on german soil .
in april the us embassy in berlin announced it was boosting security at its facilities in germany in response to what it described as an increased threat of terrorism .
berlin has also said it believed there may be similar training camps in afghanistan , where germany has more than 3,000 troops stationed as part of a nato peacekeeping force .
the taliban has threatened to step up attacks on german troops . merkel supports online searches schäuble recently sparked controversy over comments that germany should clarify under what conditions the constitution permits the state to target and kill terrorists .
the tough-talking schäuble also pressed for changes in laws to allow pre-emptive detention of suspected militants and said authorities should have the right to prevent people they deem dangerous from using the internet and mobile phones .
the proposals have been criticized for eroding civil liberties .
but on sunday , schäuble received backing from german chancellor angela merkel for creating a legal framework to allow online searches of personal computers of suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has supported online searches of computers of suspected terrorists " we must look the threats in the eye and take them seriously , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .

the 39th session of the un committee of the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women -lrb- cedaw -rrb- begins monday .
dw-world.de talked to an expert about victims of human trafficking . katrin adams is the executive officer of kok – a german ngo working to combat exploitation and support women trafficked to germany .
dw-world.de : what does your organization do to fight trafficking of women ?
katrin adams : we have two main areas that we concentrate on .
firstly , combating trafficking in women and secondly , combating violence against women in the process of migration .
we are a network of 37 member organizations – women ’ s organizations and counseling centers .
we are a specialist lobby in berlin and we lobby for improvement of the individual situations of the victims of human trafficking .
what does the un convention say on human trafficking ?
they have a specialized article , which is article 6 , which says that state parties shall take all appropriate measures , including legislation , to suppress all forms of trafficking of women and exploitation by prostitution of women .
how useful is the convention in practice ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a survivor of trafficking in moscow the convention is very useful in that it has a reporting system .
that means that governments have to report on their specific improvements on their work when it comes to the implementation of the standards set in the convention .
with regards article 6 it means that states have to tell you something and they have to summarize what they have done to reach these objectives set out in article 6 .
for us as an ngo it is a good opportunity for us to lobby for our demands because normally the committee accepts the shadow reports .
a shadow report is prepared by ngos in which they give addition information and comment on the government reports .
do you prepare shadow reports ?
we , the kok , normally comment very specifically on article 6 in a shadow report .
we would comment on the report submitted by germany .
we work at a very national level .
that means we concentrate on the situation of victims of human trafficking here in germany .
this year the government released its report , including a section on article 6 .
at the moment we are critically reviewing what they have said and we will definitely comment critically on what the government says .
why will you be critical of the german government ?
because there has been some legislation passed this year by parliament which will enter into force in autumn .
that special legislation has , in our opinion , some flaws when it comes to an adequate treatment of victims of human trafficking .
we think germany should do better .
what is the extent of trafficking in women to germany ?
unfortunately i can ’ t give you as a definite answer on that because we think the numbers that are known about are only a fraction of what is actually happening .
the numbers that are most reliable are those published by the federal criminal office .
the number of victims officially known about in 2005 was 642 .
but we are working on the basis that the actual number is much higher .
what sort of cases are these ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demanding education to rebuild women 's lives we have a lot very different cases .
there is no single procedure .
normally women are brought into germany and they have been deceived or threatened .
they are promised that they will get work in restaurants or bars and then they discover they have to work as prostitutes .
some women do come to germany knowing that they might be working as prostitutes and then find the work conditions are exploitative , which they wouldn ’ t have been aware of before they came .
when it comes to trafficking in human beings , there is also the issue of being forced into labor or marriage , that ’ s an issue that has not really been dealt with a lot .
where are these women mostly coming from ?
mostly from countries in eastern europe , although the numbers of women that are being forced into prostitution that are germans and being trafficked within germany is rising too .
when your organization and the un cedaw committee are critical of the german government , how much notice do they take ?
normally , what the committee does is adopt concluding comments , and as far as i know they are being taken seriously .
that means that the government tries to consider what the committee says and act accordingly .
in some cases it ’ s just political goodwill and nothing actually happens but in some cases the observations and concluding comments are quite useful and there is actually change in the political environment .
what sort of changes would you like to see the government implement to protect women who have been trafficked to germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kok also campaigns on violence against women what we would like to see is women who have been trafficked become entitled to permanent residency in germany .
at the moment the legal conditions are quite strict when it comes to getting residency .
secondly , coverage of basic needs including medical treatment and psychological help is often not provided .
we would like them to have a legal right to this basic coverage .
another important point is access to further education , especially language courses , so that women who decide to stay here once they have been released have an opportunity to build a normal life .
we are lobbying too for access to the labor market .
is it possible to prevent women being trafficked to germany ?
this is more the work of ngos in the countries of origin .
we are in contact with networks of ngos in these countries .
if there is a need and if we can help by supporting these ngos in that specific countries then we do what we can , but it ’ s not one of our main activities . emma wynne interviewed katrin adams send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we are a network of 37 member organizations – women ’ s organizations and counseling centers .
we are a specialist lobby in berlin and we lobby for improvement of the individual situations of the victims of human trafficking .
what does the un convention say on human trafficking ?
they have a specialized article , which is article 6 , which says that state parties shall take all appropriate measures , including legislation , to suppress all forms of trafficking of women and exploitation by prostitution of women .
how useful is the convention in practice ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a survivor of trafficking in moscow the convention is very useful in that it has a reporting system .
that means that governments have to report on their specific improvements on their work when it comes to the implementation of the standards set in the convention .
with regards article 6 it means that states have to tell you something and they have to summarize what they have done to reach these objectives set out in article 6 .
for us as an ngo it is a good opportunity for us to lobby for our demands because normally the committee accepts the shadow reports .
a shadow report is prepared by ngos in which they give addition information and comment on the government reports .
do you prepare shadow reports ?
we , the kok , normally comment very specifically on article 6 in a shadow report .
we would comment on the report submitted by germany .
we work at a very national level .
that means we concentrate on the situation of victims of human trafficking here in germany .
this year the government released its report , including a section on article 6 .
at the moment we are critically reviewing what they have said and we will definitely comment critically on what the government says .
why will you be critical of the german government ?
because there has been some legislation passed this year by parliament which will enter into force in autumn .
that special legislation has , in our opinion , some flaws when it comes to an adequate treatment of victims of human trafficking .
we think germany should do better .
what is the extent of trafficking in women to germany ?
unfortunately i can ’ t give you as a definite answer on that because we think the numbers that are known about are only a fraction of what is actually happening .
the numbers that are most reliable are those published by the federal criminal office .
the number of victims officially known about in 2005 was 642 .
but we are working on the basis that the actual number is much higher .
what sort of cases are these ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demanding education to rebuild women 's lives we have a lot very different cases .
there is no single procedure .
normally women are brought into germany and they have been deceived or threatened .
they are promised that they will get work in restaurants or bars and then they discover they have to work as prostitutes .
some women do come to germany knowing that they might be working as prostitutes and then find the work conditions are exploitative , which they wouldn ’ t have been aware of before they came .
when it comes to trafficking in human beings , there is also the issue of being forced into labor or marriage , that ’ s an issue that has not really been dealt with a lot .
where are these women mostly coming from ?
mostly from countries in eastern europe , although the numbers of women that are being forced into prostitution that are germans and being trafficked within germany is rising too .
when your organization and the un cedaw committee are critical of the german government , how much notice do they take ?
normally , what the committee does is adopt concluding comments , and as far as i know they are being taken seriously .
that means that the government tries to consider what the committee says and act accordingly .
in some cases it ’ s just political goodwill and nothing actually happens but in some cases the observations and concluding comments are quite useful and there is actually change in the political environment .
what sort of changes would you like to see the government implement to protect women who have been trafficked to germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kok also campaigns on violence against women what we would like to see is women who have been trafficked become entitled to permanent residency in germany .
at the moment the legal conditions are quite strict when it comes to getting residency .
secondly , coverage of basic needs including medical treatment and psychological help is often not provided .
we would like them to have a legal right to this basic coverage .
another important point is access to further education , especially language courses , so that women who decide to stay here once they have been released have an opportunity to build a normal life .
we are lobbying too for access to the labor market .
is it possible to prevent women being trafficked to germany ?
this is more the work of ngos in the countries of origin .
we are in contact with networks of ngos in these countries .
if there is a need and if we can help by supporting these ngos in that specific countries then we do what we can , but it ’ s not one of our main activities . emma wynne interviewed katrin adams send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said the german interior ministry knew about 14 islamists from germany who had been in pakistan or were still there .
it added that authorities were calculating that more individuals from germany would be trained in al qaeda-run terrorist camps .
" a new quality in threat to germany " the weekly said at least seven islamists from germany had been arrested in pakistan over the past months and that islamabad was likely in the next few weeks to deport the men .
" we must assume that those who have come back from pakistan are planning attacks , " august hanning , germany 's deputy interior minister , said in an interview with the paper .
" we need to do everything possible to find out who went to pakistan and was trained there . "
he added that " this is a new , specific threat and is a cause for concern .
there is a new quality in the threat to germany . "
hanning added there were several indications that al qaeda had germany and german installations abroad , such as embassies , in its sight .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble echoed the view , saying there was a threat that suicide bombers were now being sent to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble says germany faces a new , concrete threat " there are a lot of concrete indications right up to the past few days that show that germany has increasingly moved into the crosshairs of international terrorism , " schäuble said in an interview with the bz am sonntag newspaper .
last month schäuble said authorities needed to increase vigilance due to the possibility that militants might carry out suicide attacks on german soil .
in april the us embassy in berlin announced it was boosting security at its facilities in germany in response to what it described as an increased threat of terrorism .
berlin has also said it believed there may be similar training camps in afghanistan , where germany has more than 3,000 troops stationed as part of a nato peacekeeping force .
the taliban has threatened to step up attacks on german troops . merkel supports online searches schäuble recently sparked controversy over comments that germany should clarify under what conditions the constitution permits the state to target and kill terrorists .
the tough-talking schäuble also pressed for changes in laws to allow pre-emptive detention of suspected militants and said authorities should have the right to prevent people they deem dangerous from using the internet and mobile phones .
the proposals have been criticized for eroding civil liberties .
but on sunday , schäuble received backing from german chancellor angela merkel for creating a legal framework to allow online searches of personal computers of suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has supported online searches of computers of suspected terrorists " we must look the threats in the eye and take them seriously , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .
" the interior minister has the freedom to think what needs to be done in the face of totally new threats . "
the issue has for weeks been a focus of heated debate between schäuble and german justice minister brigitte zypries .
on monday , members of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- urged zypries to expand the existing catalogue of anti-terrorism measures to include penalizing training in terrorism camps and the distribution of bomb-making manuals . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our democracy has successfully passed a test ...
our unity , democracy and the republic have emerged stronger from the ballot box , " erdogan said overnight outside akp headquarters as fireworks lit up the sky and hundreds of supporters cheered . the governing party , which has its roots in a now-banned islamist movement , won 46.3 percent of the vote , leading its closest rival by a wide margin , according to unofficial results after 99.9 percent of the ballots were counted . it was the largest support a turkish party has gained since the 1969 legislative election .
a comfortable lead the support the akp garnered should translate into 339 seats in the 550-member parliament , enough for it to once again form a government on its own . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks voted sunday for a new parliament that will face a host of challenges the party had 352 members in the outgoing house and despite support for it increasing by 12 percentage points compared to 2002 , the number of its seats will decline because more parties will be represented in parliament . " we will pursue economic and democracy reforms with determination , " erdogan said , pledging also commitment to the secular system and turkey 's eu membership bid . the secularist main opposition republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- finished second with 20.9 percent of vote and an estimated 112 seats , according to unofficial results .
the right-wing nationalist action party -lrb- mhp -rrb- was third with 14.2 percent and 71 seats . no other party passed the 10-percent national threshold needed to enter parliament , but 28 independent candidates won seats , 24 of them kurds campaigning for broader rights for their sizeable community . populist policies with virtually no chance of actually winning government , the akp 's nearest rivals had campaigned on populist policies and waged a scare campaign that portrayed the government as being not only anti-secular but also of failing to adequately deal with rebels from the kurdish workers ' party , of whom around 3,500 are based in northern iraq . around 42.5 million people were eligible to vote in sunday 's election of 550 members of parliament .
ten people were injured in fighting at voting booths in the south-east , but in general voting was peaceful at 160,000 polling stations across the country .
erdogan was forced to call sunday 's election after a bungled attempt to place his right-hand man , foreign minister abdullah gül , in the presidential palace in ankara .
millions of people took to the streets to protest the prospect of gül becoming president .
they objected to gül 's past involvement in conservative islamist groups , the fact that his wife wears an islamic-style headscarf - no president 's wife in turkey has ever worn one - and also at the prospect of the akp controlling the government , the parliament and presidency .
the military stepped in in april effectively scuttling the presidential election process by declaring it would do whatever necessary to protect secularism . as soon as the new parliament opens , its first task will be to elect a new president . erdogan has said he will seek a compromise in the presidential election , but insists that the candidate must be from his party . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 23.07.2007 germany 's steinmeier proposes troika solution for kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers under the un 's protectorate mandate have policed kosovo since 1999 an international troika of the european union , russia and the united states , should take charge of discussions on the final status of kosovo , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said monday . with time running out on a decision on the future of the serbian province , steinmeier said he wanted discussions on kosovo to be led by a small team rather than the six-nation contract group composed of the us , britain , germany , france , italy and russia .
" i favor the concept of an international troika , made up of the us , russia and eu , so with that we would have three international partners to negotiate with the serbs and the kosovars -lrb- ethnic albanians -rrb- , " steinmeier told reporters at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels .
he said that such a troika offered the " best chance " to secure a so far elusive deal on kosovo .
" i think that once russia and the united states sit at the table together , there will be a very real possibility that the kosovars and the serbs will start acting the way they should , " he said .
steinmeier 's proposal comes after russia last week threatened to veto yet another draft un security council resolution calling for supervised independence for kosovo .
steinmeier seeking alternative to contact group others , also seeking to avert a russian veto by putting preparations for the un resolution on hold , have said discussions on kosovo should be spearheaded by the contact group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier continues to push for supervised independence steinmeier said there was also a suggestion that un secretary-general ban ki-moon should appoint a new envoy to replace martti ahtisaari to mediate between serbs and kosovars .
however , the proposed troika discussions would continue to focus on ahtisaari 's plan for supervised independence for kosovo , steinmeier added .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn also said the eu wanted to move forward on the basis of ahtisaari 's recommendation that kosovo be granted " independence supervised by the international community . "
" if the contact group is going to have further negotiations we are of course ready to contribute to those , " rehn told reporters .
he warned that it is " essential that both parties including serbia take finally a constructive and realistic approach to these negotiations . "
eu officials , however , once again stated that if the troika proposal was rejected and the issue moved to the contact group , it would be a temporary solution and that the un security council would have the final say to the status of kosovo .

steinmeier said he had discussed his troika proposal with ban , russian foreign minister sergi lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice .

" i favor the concept of an international troika , made up of the us , russia and eu , so with that we would have three international partners to negotiate with the serbs and the kosovars -lrb- ethnic albanians -rrb- , " steinmeier told reporters at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels .
he said that such a troika offered the " best chance " to secure a so far elusive deal on kosovo .
" i think that once russia and the united states sit at the table together , there will be a very real possibility that the kosovars and the serbs will start acting the way they should , " he said .
steinmeier 's proposal comes after russia last week threatened to veto yet another draft un security council resolution calling for supervised independence for kosovo .
steinmeier seeking alternative to contact group others , also seeking to avert a russian veto by putting preparations for the un resolution on hold , have said discussions on kosovo should be spearheaded by the contact group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier continues to push for supervised independence steinmeier said there was also a suggestion that un secretary-general ban ki-moon should appoint a new envoy to replace martti ahtisaari to mediate between serbs and kosovars .
however , the proposed troika discussions would continue to focus on ahtisaari 's plan for supervised independence for kosovo , steinmeier added .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn also said the eu wanted to move forward on the basis of ahtisaari 's recommendation that kosovo be granted " independence supervised by the international community . "
" if the contact group is going to have further negotiations we are of course ready to contribute to those , " rehn told reporters .
he warned that it is " essential that both parties including serbia take finally a constructive and realistic approach to these negotiations . "

" after an initial scrutiny of the draft reform treaty we see that solutions proposed by ... the -lsb- eu -rsb- presidency are close to our expectations , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told a news conference after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
warsaw had initially insisted that groups of eu member states have the power to block contentious legislation for a two-year " period of scrutiny " but later dropped the demand .
" we will not insist on an initial requirement of two years , " fotyga said , adding that she still expected a period lasting a " reasonable time " to be incorporated in the final document .
eu observers have said that period of time would likely be a maximum of four months .
draft ready by october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel forged the compromise with her european counterparts in june portuguese foreign minister luis amado , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , welcomed the polish statements and said he expected a draft of the reform treaty to be hammered out and agreed to by october and ratified by mid-2009 .
" we should be able to have a new treaty as soon as possible , " said amado .
" we have a commitment from all ... to meet these requirements . "
the european commission president jose manuel barroso urged all eu states to show " loyal and active support " to the portuguese eu presidency , saying it was time the bloc stopped feuding over institutions and faced key challenges of today .
" we need to work quickly but carefully , " barroso said .
political debate still to come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amado said he expects the draft treaty to be ready for approval in october amado added that monday 's talks focused on technical aspects of the draft treaty and that its political dimensions would be debated later .
eu legal experts will open discussions on the treaty in brussels on tuesday and are set to meet regularly until the bloc 's summit in lisbon in october .
" i envisage the possibility of some level of political discussion but not at the moment , " he said .
" it is vital that the union should not allow itself to be paralysed once again on account of internal , institutional problems , so that is may respond to the real challenges that it must face . "
under german chancellor angela merkel 's leadership , eu members agreed in june to a deal that would streamline the bloc by giving more power to its foreign policy chief , electing a long-term eu president and instituting changes to the bloc 's voting system .
luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn predicted that the treaty details could be finalized at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in early september but warned : " the devil is in the detail . "
the new amended treaty will replace an eu draft constitution which was rejected by dutch and french voters two years ago , plunging the bloc into crisis .
eu governments are hoping the new rulebook will be ratified by their legislatures over the coming months and enter into force by summer 2009 , just ahead of elections to the european parliament . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" after an initial scrutiny of the draft reform treaty we see that solutions proposed by ... the -lsb- eu -rsb- presidency are close to our expectations , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told a news conference after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
warsaw had initially insisted that groups of eu member states have the power to block contentious legislation for a two-year " period of scrutiny " but later dropped the demand .
" we will not insist on an initial requirement of two years , " fotyga said , adding that she still expected a period lasting a " reasonable time " to be incorporated in the final document .
eu observers have said that period of time would likely be a maximum of four months .

" we should be able to have a new treaty as soon as possible , " said amado .
" we have a commitment from all ... to meet these requirements . "
the european commission president jose manuel barroso urged all eu states to show " loyal and active support " to the portuguese eu presidency , saying it was time the bloc stopped feuding over institutions and faced key challenges of today .

eu legal experts will open discussions on the treaty in brussels on tuesday and are set to meet regularly until the bloc 's summit in lisbon in october .
" i envisage the possibility of some level of political discussion but not at the moment , " he said .
" it is vital that the union should not allow itself to be paralysed once again on account of internal , institutional problems , so that is may respond to the real challenges that it must face . "
under german chancellor angela merkel 's leadership , eu members agreed in june to a deal that would streamline the bloc by giving more power to its foreign policy chief , electing a long-term eu president and instituting changes to the bloc 's voting system .

" the german national and four afghans we had reported to have killed are still alive , " qari mohammad yousuf , told reuters from an unknown location by telephone . in exchange for the hostages ' release , yousuf said the taliban demanded the release of 10 prisoners held by the afghan government and the withdrawal of germany 's 3,000 troops stationed in afghanistan . other news agencies reported similar statements and demands from taliban leaders on monday . the body of a second german found over the weekend was returned to germany for an autopsy on monday .
it remained unclear whether the man , identified as rüdiger b. , died of gunshot wounds or if his captors shot his body after his death .
the german government has said he was not executed . crisis team still at work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crisis team is still working to locate the german hostage in berlin , chancellor angela merkel said on sunday in a television interview that germany would not allow itself to be blackmailed by the taliban . " we are not going to respond to demands from the area of the taliban , " merkel told the ard public television .
" we can not be blackmailed . " she said she had " no new reliable information " regarding how the hostage died or on the whereabouts of the other man .
berlin has set up a crisis team to evaluate all information regarding the pair of germans kidnapped last week .
the two men were reported to be engineers working on a dam project south of kabul . though it is not a position shared by any of germany 's main political parties , a recent survey showed that some 60 percent of germans support pulling bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .

it 's the second 24-hour extension the militants have given the south korean government . " since the afghan government has not sincerely tried to solve the problem , this time we are giving another 24 hours to the korean government to solve the matter yousuf told the dpa news agency . afghan interior ministry spokesman zemarai bashary said earlier that authorities were " working on the issue constantly , around the clock . " " we have more hope of success for the release of both the south koreans and the german , " he said .
" we hope to win their release via talks rather than military operations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 23.07.2007 germany 's steinmeier proposes troika solution for kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers under the un 's protectorate mandate have policed kosovo since 1999 an international troika of the european union , russia and the united states , should take charge of discussions on the final status of kosovo , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said monday . with time running out on a decision on the future of the serbian province , steinmeier said he wanted discussions on kosovo to be led by a small team rather than the six-nation contract group composed of the us , britain , germany , france , italy and russia .
" i favor the concept of an international troika , made up of the us , russia and eu , so with that we would have three international partners to negotiate with the serbs and the kosovars -lrb- ethnic albanians -rrb- , " steinmeier told reporters at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels .
he said that such a troika offered the " best chance " to secure a so far elusive deal on kosovo .
" i think that once russia and the united states sit at the table together , there will be a very real possibility that the kosovars and the serbs will start acting the way they should , " he said .
steinmeier 's proposal comes after russia last week threatened to veto yet another draft un security council resolution calling for supervised independence for kosovo .
steinmeier seeking alternative to contact group others , also seeking to avert a russian veto by putting preparations for the un resolution on hold , have said discussions on kosovo should be spearheaded by the contact group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier continues to push for supervised independence steinmeier said there was also a suggestion that un secretary-general ban ki-moon should appoint a new envoy to replace martti ahtisaari to mediate between serbs and kosovars .
however , the proposed troika discussions would continue to focus on ahtisaari 's plan for supervised independence for kosovo , steinmeier added .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn also said the eu wanted to move forward on the basis of ahtisaari 's recommendation that kosovo be granted " independence supervised by the international community . "
" if the contact group is going to have further negotiations we are of course ready to contribute to those , " rehn told reporters .
he warned that it is " essential that both parties including serbia take finally a constructive and realistic approach to these negotiations . "
eu officials , however , once again stated that if the troika proposal was rejected and the issue moved to the contact group , it would be a temporary solution and that the un security council would have the final say to the status of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia and kosovo came to the table - but agreed to nothing luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn also backed steinmeier 's proposal , saying it was important that serbs and kosovars came back to the negotiating table .
" if they are not able to talk together about their future , then others will take the decisions , " asselborn said .
steinmeier said he had discussed his troika proposal with ban , russian foreign minister sergi lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
" now that we all have to presume there will not be a security council resolution , i feel it is important that we do n't leave the ongoing process to its own devices , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister stated that stability in the western balkans was a key eu priority , adding , " the international community needs therefore to maintain its joint responsibility towards the region . "
eu 's credibility at stake over kosovo other eu foreign ministers at the brussels meeting emphasized that the eu 's credibility was on the line over the resolution of kosovo ’ s status .
" the stability of the balkans , the unity of the european union , the credibility of us versus the united states and russia is at stake , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt , a balkans expert within the eu , told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish balkan expert bildt sees kosovo as the eu 's problem bildt added that unity between the eu states over kosovo was " absolutely paramount " if the issue of kosovo was to move from the un security council to the international contact group .
british foreign secretary david miliband echoed bildt 's statement on eu unity .
" it 's probably important that we establish our own position and are clear about the need for strong european leadership and strong european unity in this area , " he said .
russian resistance scuppers un resolution the europeans and their us allies on friday postponed attempts to secure a security council resolution that would have granted kosovo " supervised independence , " in the face of a likely russian veto .
russia , a strong ally of serbia , had complained that recognizing an independent kosovo would send the wrong signal to other breakaway regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is being backed in its stance by its ally russia serbia has said such a move would be a breach of its national sovereignty but concedes it could give special autonomy to kosovo .
after talks with rice on monday , kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said the province would work with the united states and europe to coordinate its future and not unilaterally declare independence .
" for us it is critical that the process is coordinated and moves ahead in close cooperation with the international community , the us and the european union in the first place , " he told the afp news agency .
" of course , a formal announcement of independence will happen in due course , but in cooperation and in close partnership with the countries which are supportive of the kosovo independence . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when a nato campaign drove out serb forces after accusing them of committing atrocities against ethnic albanians .
in april this year , ahtisaari proposed independence under the supervision of the eu after 13 months of serb-albanian talks ended in deadlock . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said the german interior ministry knew about 14 islamists from germany who had been in pakistan or were still there .
it added that authorities were calculating that more individuals from germany would be trained in al qaeda-run terrorist camps .
" a new quality in threat to germany " the weekly said at least seven islamists from germany had been arrested in pakistan over the past months and that islamabad was likely in the next few weeks to deport the men .
" we must assume that those who have come back from pakistan are planning attacks , " august hanning , germany 's deputy interior minister , said in an interview with the paper .
" we need to do everything possible to find out who went to pakistan and was trained there . "
he added that " this is a new , specific threat and is a cause for concern .
there is a new quality in the threat to germany . "
hanning added there were several indications that al qaeda had germany and german installations abroad , such as embassies , in its sight .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble echoed the view , saying there was a threat that suicide bombers were now being sent to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble says germany faces a new , concrete threat " there are a lot of concrete indications right up to the past few days that show that germany has increasingly moved into the crosshairs of international terrorism , " schäuble said in an interview with the bz am sonntag newspaper .
last month schäuble said authorities needed to increase vigilance due to the possibility that militants might carry out suicide attacks on german soil .
in april the us embassy in berlin announced it was boosting security at its facilities in germany in response to what it described as an increased threat of terrorism .
berlin has also said it believed there may be similar training camps in afghanistan , where germany has more than 3,000 troops stationed as part of a nato peacekeeping force .
the taliban has threatened to step up attacks on german troops . merkel supports online searches schäuble recently sparked controversy over comments that germany should clarify under what conditions the constitution permits the state to target and kill terrorists .
the tough-talking schäuble also pressed for changes in laws to allow pre-emptive detention of suspected militants and said authorities should have the right to prevent people they deem dangerous from using the internet and mobile phones .

the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said the german interior ministry knew about 14 islamists from germany who had been in pakistan or were still there .
it added that authorities were calculating that more individuals from germany would be trained in al qaeda-run terrorist camps .
" a new quality in threat to germany " the weekly said at least seven islamists from germany had been arrested in pakistan over the past months and that islamabad was likely in the next few weeks to deport the men .
" we must assume that those who have come back from pakistan are planning attacks , " august hanning , germany 's deputy interior minister , said in an interview with the paper .
" we need to do everything possible to find out who went to pakistan and was trained there . "
he added that " this is a new , specific threat and is a cause for concern .
there is a new quality in the threat to germany . "
hanning added there were several indications that al qaeda had germany and german installations abroad , such as embassies , in its sight .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble echoed the view , saying there was a threat that suicide bombers were now being sent to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble says germany faces a new , concrete threat " there are a lot of concrete indications right up to the past few days that show that germany has increasingly moved into the crosshairs of international terrorism , " schäuble said in an interview with the bz am sonntag newspaper .
last month schäuble said authorities needed to increase vigilance due to the possibility that militants might carry out suicide attacks on german soil .
in april the us embassy in berlin announced it was boosting security at its facilities in germany in response to what it described as an increased threat of terrorism .
berlin has also said it believed there may be similar training camps in afghanistan , where germany has more than 3,000 troops stationed as part of a nato peacekeeping force .
the taliban has threatened to step up attacks on german troops . merkel supports online searches schäuble recently sparked controversy over comments that germany should clarify under what conditions the constitution permits the state to target and kill terrorists .
the tough-talking schäuble also pressed for changes in laws to allow pre-emptive detention of suspected militants and said authorities should have the right to prevent people they deem dangerous from using the internet and mobile phones .
the proposals have been criticized for eroding civil liberties .
but on sunday , schäuble received backing from german chancellor angela merkel for creating a legal framework to allow online searches of personal computers of suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has supported online searches of computers of suspected terrorists " we must look the threats in the eye and take them seriously , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .

the 39th session of the un committee of the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women -lrb- cedaw -rrb- begins monday .
dw-world.de talked to an expert about victims of human trafficking . katrin adams is the executive officer of kok – a german ngo working to combat exploitation and support women trafficked to germany .
dw-world.de : what does your organization do to fight trafficking of women ?
katrin adams : we have two main areas that we concentrate on .
firstly , combating trafficking in women and secondly , combating violence against women in the process of migration .
we are a network of 37 member organizations – women ’ s organizations and counseling centers .
we are a specialist lobby in berlin and we lobby for improvement of the individual situations of the victims of human trafficking .
what does the un convention say on human trafficking ?
they have a specialized article , which is article 6 , which says that state parties shall take all appropriate measures , including legislation , to suppress all forms of trafficking of women and exploitation by prostitution of women .
how useful is the convention in practice ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a survivor of trafficking in moscow the convention is very useful in that it has a reporting system .
that means that governments have to report on their specific improvements on their work when it comes to the implementation of the standards set in the convention .
with regards article 6 it means that states have to tell you something and they have to summarize what they have done to reach these objectives set out in article 6 .
for us as an ngo it is a good opportunity for us to lobby for our demands because normally the committee accepts the shadow reports .
a shadow report is prepared by ngos in which they give addition information and comment on the government reports .
do you prepare shadow reports ?
we , the kok , normally comment very specifically on article 6 in a shadow report .
we would comment on the report submitted by germany .
we work at a very national level .
that means we concentrate on the situation of victims of human trafficking here in germany .
this year the government released its report , including a section on article 6 .
at the moment we are critically reviewing what they have said and we will definitely comment critically on what the government says .
why will you be critical of the german government ?
because there has been some legislation passed this year by parliament which will enter into force in autumn .
that special legislation has , in our opinion , some flaws when it comes to an adequate treatment of victims of human trafficking .
we think germany should do better .
what is the extent of trafficking in women to germany ?
unfortunately i can ’ t give you as a definite answer on that because we think the numbers that are known about are only a fraction of what is actually happening .
the numbers that are most reliable are those published by the federal criminal office .
the number of victims officially known about in 2005 was 642 .
but we are working on the basis that the actual number is much higher .
what sort of cases are these ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demanding education to rebuild women 's lives we have a lot very different cases .
there is no single procedure .
normally women are brought into germany and they have been deceived or threatened .
they are promised that they will get work in restaurants or bars and then they discover they have to work as prostitutes .
some women do come to germany knowing that they might be working as prostitutes and then find the work conditions are exploitative , which they wouldn ’ t have been aware of before they came .
when it comes to trafficking in human beings , there is also the issue of being forced into labor or marriage , that ’ s an issue that has not really been dealt with a lot .
where are these women mostly coming from ?
mostly from countries in eastern europe , although the numbers of women that are being forced into prostitution that are germans and being trafficked within germany is rising too .
when your organization and the un cedaw committee are critical of the german government , how much notice do they take ?
normally , what the committee does is adopt concluding comments , and as far as i know they are being taken seriously .
that means that the government tries to consider what the committee says and act accordingly .
in some cases it ’ s just political goodwill and nothing actually happens but in some cases the observations and concluding comments are quite useful and there is actually change in the political environment .
what sort of changes would you like to see the government implement to protect women who have been trafficked to germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kok also campaigns on violence against women what we would like to see is women who have been trafficked become entitled to permanent residency in germany .
at the moment the legal conditions are quite strict when it comes to getting residency .
secondly , coverage of basic needs including medical treatment and psychological help is often not provided .
we would like them to have a legal right to this basic coverage .
another important point is access to further education , especially language courses , so that women who decide to stay here once they have been released have an opportunity to build a normal life .
we are lobbying too for access to the labor market .
is it possible to prevent women being trafficked to germany ?
this is more the work of ngos in the countries of origin .
we are in contact with networks of ngos in these countries .
if there is a need and if we can help by supporting these ngos in that specific countries then we do what we can , but it ’ s not one of our main activities . emma wynne interviewed katrin adams send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" after an initial scrutiny of the draft reform treaty we see that solutions proposed by ... the -lsb- eu -rsb- presidency are close to our expectations , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told a news conference after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
warsaw had initially insisted that groups of eu member states have the power to block contentious legislation for a two-year " period of scrutiny " but later dropped the demand .

that makes the sports utility vehicle , which weighs more than two tons , one of the worst emitters of carbon dioxide , a greenhouse gas that 's considered a prime contributor to global warming .
porsche said its decision to develop the hybrid motor - which combines an electric motor and battery with a standard combustion engine in order to cut fuel consumption - is a reaction to the raging debate on climate change in europe and rising concerns among consumers about the environmental friendliness of their cars .
" in particular , a premium carmaker such as porsche must offer competitive drivetrain solutions with low consumption- and emission levels , " the company said in a statement .
german carmakers trail in green technology the move comes as automakers and legislators across europe tighten the screws on co2 emissions amid mounting qualms about the environment .
in february this year , german carmakers were hit by new emission limits - 130 grams -lrb- 1.038 ounces -rrb- of co2 per kilometer to be met by 2012 - proposed by the european commission .
only six german-made models within the bloc currently meet those requirements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche hopes to launch the hybrid drivetrain by 2009 though german carmakers rank among the best in the world , they are widely seen to have been slow in waking up to reality and developing an alternative to the fossil-fuel engine .
japanese carmaker toyota is considered the world leader in hybrid technology .
porsche , which is working together with audi and volkswagen on the project , said it plans to unveil its hybrid powertrain in 2009 .
the technology which combines an electric motor with a combustion engine is also slated to be used for porsche 's planned four-door sporting premium model , panamera . article based on wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" after an initial scrutiny of the draft reform treaty we see that solutions proposed by ... the -lsb- eu -rsb- presidency are close to our expectations , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told a news conference after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
warsaw had initially insisted that groups of eu member states have the power to block contentious legislation for a two-year " period of scrutiny " but later dropped the demand .
" we will not insist on an initial requirement of two years , " fotyga said , adding that she still expected a period lasting a " reasonable time " to be incorporated in the final document .
eu observers have said that period of time would likely be a maximum of four months .
draft ready by october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel forged the compromise with her european counterparts in june portuguese foreign minister luis amado , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , welcomed the polish statements and said he expected a draft of the reform treaty to be hammered out and agreed to by october and ratified by mid-2009 .
" we should be able to have a new treaty as soon as possible , " said amado .
" we have a commitment from all ... to meet these requirements . "
the european commission president jose manuel barroso urged all eu states to show " loyal and active support " to the portuguese eu presidency , saying it was time the bloc stopped feuding over institutions and faced key challenges of today .
" we need to work quickly but carefully , " barroso said .
political debate still to come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amado said he expects the draft treaty to be ready for approval in october amado added that monday 's talks focused on technical aspects of the draft treaty and that its political dimensions would be debated later .
eu legal experts will open discussions on the treaty in brussels on tuesday and are set to meet regularly until the bloc 's summit in lisbon in october .
" i envisage the possibility of some level of political discussion but not at the moment , " he said .
" it is vital that the union should not allow itself to be paralysed once again on account of internal , institutional problems , so that is may respond to the real challenges that it must face . "
under german chancellor angela merkel 's leadership , eu members agreed in june to a deal that would streamline the bloc by giving more power to its foreign policy chief , electing a long-term eu president and instituting changes to the bloc 's voting system .
luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn predicted that the treaty details could be finalized at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in early september but warned : " the devil is in the detail . "
the new amended treaty will replace an eu draft constitution which was rejected by dutch and french voters two years ago , plunging the bloc into crisis .
eu governments are hoping the new rulebook will be ratified by their legislatures over the coming months and enter into force by summer 2009 , just ahead of elections to the european parliament . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but discerning globetrotters need not despair . " there is a new frontier , " he goes on .
" a lost , or rather overlooked horizon ; a place that is remaining undiscovered , cloaked in poisonous myth and all but unvisited , as we speak , for over 60 years since it became obscured from the minds of most of the world . " is that really germany he 's talking about ? initiated readers may be puzzled to hear it described in such terms .
but wait , he has a point , does n't he ?
it is better than its reputation .

in the chapter headed gemütlichkeit , he snuggles up with the bavarians at the annual oktoberfest , heads to berlin to capture the zeitgeist , gets the measure of grossmansucht on hamburg 's reeperbahn and meets a german stand-up comedian in schadenfreude . it proves to be a journey of enlightenment . " i am inclined to judge the depth of a man 's civilization by his opinion of germany and her culture , " he concludes . dw-world.de spoke to ben donald and asked him why , if germany 's so great , does britain still harp on about men in socks and sandals , girls with hairy armpits , and of course , david hasselhof . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the definitive guide to the real germany ?
you decide .
ben donald : well , if you 're writing a book about germany you have to use the stereotypes simply because they provide so much material , and humor is a key way of attracting people to a subject .
the british do the same with other countries too .
the stereotypical battle over the sun loungers is an entirely anglo-german issue - italians wouldn ‘ t take a blind bit of notice of a towel on a sun lounger , they ‘ d just sit down and ignore it .
the thing is , the english and the germans are quite similar in their approach to staking out territory and personal privacy . ultimately , the book said as much about brits as it did about germany . good !
that ‘ s how it should be .
i wanted to pitch myself as a kind of everyman , and the idea was that the book would show some sort of development from my original position .
i couldn ‘ t start out being a germanophile .
and in the course of the journey , i as the narrator also reveal a great deal about the british . but there was the assumption that readers would recognize and agree with britain 's stereotypes about germany . to go back to the genesis of this book , there 's simply nothing in the travel bookshops about germany , nothing lighthearted , nothing extolling the delights of the german countryside and way of life .
why is that , when there are hundreds about italy and france and spain ?
there 's something stopping people in britain from seeing germany as a holiday destination and romanticizing a view of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen 's famous cliffs when i do radio interviews in britain , the first questions are invariably : is n't germany just about sausages and dodgy wine , v olksmusik and nena ?
so these stereotypes do still exist - but they 've become more playful , they 're not malicious at all .
and while german ambassadors to britain always get involved with debates with the uk tabloids about how they treat germany , it should be pointed out that the british do this with everyone !
we 're terrible when it comes to xenophobic tendencies . in the book i focus on how germans are extraordinarily introspective and self questioning , and perhaps they just need to see anglo-german attitudes in the context of british xenophobia towards other countries too . even when brits are telling you how much they love france , the wine , the chateaux , their gites and so on , they ca n't help saying it 's just a shame about all the frenchmen in it .
the english view of france , as you see in books such as " a year in the merde " by stephen clarke , is also very stereotypical . but germans might still find the stereotypes offensive ... but what the book does is take these clichés and explode them .
there are few nazi references in it , because i specifically did n't want to write a book only about the war .
when i refer to lebensraum , for example , i explain what it is .
i mention kraft durch freude and the prora resort on rügen as an example of the socialism aspect we rarely talk about in the context of national socialism . i tried to see where the stereotypes are rooted and then to supply a deeper cultural reading .
when i wanted to explore - albeit in a jocular fashion - where germany 's thing about nudism has its roots , i tied it together with the specifically german interpretation of the hippy movement , the second world war and germany 's tradition of the kur -lsb- spa -rsb- culture .
what i did was find plausible explanations as to why these stereotypes emerged in the first place . you could argue that germans , who are quite serious , are the antithesis of the brits , who tend to be relentlessly ironic and su per cilious .
is it basically a per sonality clash ? but they do get on in many areas .
doing business with germans is an utter pleasure and in many ways we have a lot in common .
we actually have many affinities and shared interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein castle - too much for some so might we eventually see a great bond between the two countries ? all the people i speak to one-on-one have brilliant experiences of germany .
but it ‘ s a question of changing perceptions within the media and the collective nation .
in a way , these stereotypes are just too good to give up .
a map was drawn in 1945 , which was when the media explosion happened , and things became hard to change . what is your per sonal favorite part of germany ? i really love the baltic coast , the island of rügen and also further inland , the mecklenburgische seenplatte .
i 'd also love to go back to thuringia .

the 39th session of the un committee of the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women -lrb- cedaw -rrb- begins monday .
dw-world.de talked to an expert about victims of human trafficking . katrin adams is the executive officer of kok – a german ngo working to combat exploitation and support women trafficked to germany .
dw-world.de : what does your organization do to fight trafficking of women ?
katrin adams : we have two main areas that we concentrate on .
firstly , combating trafficking in women and secondly , combating violence against women in the process of migration .
we are a network of 37 member organizations – women ’ s organizations and counseling centers .
we are a specialist lobby in berlin and we lobby for improvement of the individual situations of the victims of human trafficking .
what does the un convention say on human trafficking ?
they have a specialized article , which is article 6 , which says that state parties shall take all appropriate measures , including legislation , to suppress all forms of trafficking of women and exploitation by prostitution of women .
how useful is the convention in practice ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a survivor of trafficking in moscow the convention is very useful in that it has a reporting system .
that means that governments have to report on their specific improvements on their work when it comes to the implementation of the standards set in the convention .
with regards article 6 it means that states have to tell you something and they have to summarize what they have done to reach these objectives set out in article 6 .
for us as an ngo it is a good opportunity for us to lobby for our demands because normally the committee accepts the shadow reports .
a shadow report is prepared by ngos in which they give addition information and comment on the government reports .
do you prepare shadow reports ?
we , the kok , normally comment very specifically on article 6 in a shadow report .
we would comment on the report submitted by germany .
we work at a very national level .
that means we concentrate on the situation of victims of human trafficking here in germany .
this year the government released its report , including a section on article 6 .
at the moment we are critically reviewing what they have said and we will definitely comment critically on what the government says .
why will you be critical of the german government ?
because there has been some legislation passed this year by parliament which will enter into force in autumn .
that special legislation has , in our opinion , some flaws when it comes to an adequate treatment of victims of human trafficking .
we think germany should do better .
what is the extent of trafficking in women to germany ?
unfortunately i can ’ t give you as a definite answer on that because we think the numbers that are known about are only a fraction of what is actually happening .
the numbers that are most reliable are those published by the federal criminal office .
the number of victims officially known about in 2005 was 642 .
but we are working on the basis that the actual number is much higher .
what sort of cases are these ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demanding education to rebuild women 's lives we have a lot very different cases .
there is no single procedure .
normally women are brought into germany and they have been deceived or threatened .
they are promised that they will get work in restaurants or bars and then they discover they have to work as prostitutes .
some women do come to germany knowing that they might be working as prostitutes and then find the work conditions are exploitative , which they wouldn ’ t have been aware of before they came .
when it comes to trafficking in human beings , there is also the issue of being forced into labor or marriage , that ’ s an issue that has not really been dealt with a lot .
where are these women mostly coming from ?
mostly from countries in eastern europe , although the numbers of women that are being forced into prostitution that are germans and being trafficked within germany is rising too .
when your organization and the un cedaw committee are critical of the german government , how much notice do they take ?
normally , what the committee does is adopt concluding comments , and as far as i know they are being taken seriously .
that means that the government tries to consider what the committee says and act accordingly .
in some cases it ’ s just political goodwill and nothing actually happens but in some cases the observations and concluding comments are quite useful and there is actually change in the political environment .
what sort of changes would you like to see the government implement to protect women who have been trafficked to germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kok also campaigns on violence against women what we would like to see is women who have been trafficked become entitled to permanent residency in germany .
at the moment the legal conditions are quite strict when it comes to getting residency .
secondly , coverage of basic needs including medical treatment and psychological help is often not provided .
we would like them to have a legal right to this basic coverage .
another important point is access to further education , especially language courses , so that women who decide to stay here once they have been released have an opportunity to build a normal life .
we are lobbying too for access to the labor market .
is it possible to prevent women being trafficked to germany ?
this is more the work of ngos in the countries of origin .
we are in contact with networks of ngos in these countries .
if there is a need and if we can help by supporting these ngos in that specific countries then we do what we can , but it ’ s not one of our main activities . emma wynne interviewed katrin adams send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 23.07.2007 exhibition dedicated to " forgotten " concentration camp opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flossenbürg gets a permament memorial exhibition some 60 years after liberation for years flossenbürg has been regarded as one of the " forgotten concentration camps " of world war ii .
now , a new exhibition has opened which tells the story of those who were incarcerated and who lost their lives there . a postcard in one of the first display rooms of the new museum reads : " greetings from flossenbürg . "
the friendly greeting is positioned under a picture of the historic castle ruins for which the small town on the german-czech border is still well known for .
in fact , while the postcard is from the 1920s , it could be from the present day .
what flossenbürg is less famous - or notorious - for is that it was the location for one of the nazis ' 12 largest concentration camps ; the camp where german theologian dietrich bonhoeffer died along with tens of thousands of other victims .
after the war , the camp and its history slowly slipped into oblivion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietrich bonhoeffer was one of the tens of thousands to be killed at flossenbürg but the new exhibition , which opened to the public on sunday , more than 60 years after the camp was liberated , aims to commemorate those who lost their lives at flossenbürg and its surrounding camps and return its role in the " final solution " to the modern history books .
after being liberated , the camp became the site of residential buildings and a toy factory moved into its empty warehouse .
only in the 1980s did a small exhibit about the camp first appear .
one of the main reasons it took so long for the camp to be remembered has much to do with the demographics of those who were imprisoned there .
" two thirds of the prisoners were eastern europeans , " said christian omonsky , the press coordinator of the flossenbürg exhibit , adding that the process of recounting the stories and compiling the evidence could only begin after the iron curtain fell and the former prisoners were able to visit the camp in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of its liberation .
since then - with the help of survivors , local people and historians - omonsky , museum director jörg skriebeleit and the rest of the museum 's staff have created a memorial for the concentration camp .
painstaking research to create memorial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family photos show lives about to be changed forever the exhibition is the result of four years of extensive research by skriebeleit and his team .
their research included hundreds of interviews with former prisoners to fill in the gaps of the camp 's history .
the work recreates an authentic snapshot of everyday life in the camp , one which not only shows the suffering of the prisoners but also the lives of those responsible for the suffering .
for example , photos of ss officers enjoying leisure time feature alongside pictures of emaciated inmates .
during world war ii , flossenbürg was an administrative center for 90 camps in bavaria , bohemia and saxony .
jews , sinti and roma were locked up in these camps along with political dissidents , prisoners of war , homosexuals and " professional criminals . "
in total , the camps held around16,000 women and 84,000 men .
in flossenbürg and its surrounding camps almost 30,000 prisoners died as a result of murder by ss officers , hard labor and accidents in the nearby stone quarry , frostbite or illnesses such as pneumonia and tuberculosis .
until recently , those who died were only numbers in a ledger .
" we would like to give these victims who had disappeared from the public consciousness for decades a human face , " said skriebeleit .
the central hall of the exhibition attempts to do just that with a selection of personal photographs from prisoners , taken before they were deported .
the images of families , holidays , young lovers , weddings and smiling youths give a clear indication of what was taken from these people when imprisioned within the confines of the camp .
ordinary lives swapped for horror and death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skriebeleit and a model of the war-time camp texts accompanying the photos explain the victims ' fates and artwork from survivors depict the horrors they may have experienced .
one drawing shows the execution of five prisoners in front of a christmas tree while the rest of the camp looks on .
while it has taken many years to bring flossenbürg out of the shadows of history , the survivors of the camp have visited regularly since they have been able to .
" for the survivors , returning always reminds us of the past , " said lisa mikova from prague .
" but we want to tell school children , for instance , about our history in the hope that we can warn them about the dangers of fascism . "
mikova was sent to the camp in 1942 because she was jewish .
her parents , her parents-in-law and a brother-in-law were killed in auschwitz .
she was sent to a camp in freiberg .
" there we had to work extremely hard in an airplane factory , for 12 hours a day , " mikova said .
" then we had to go through the town to get to the camp huts .
it was very cold , because we were dressed very poorly , without underwear and we only had clogs .
our heads were shaved bald .
and there was not a lot to eat - only a little bit of brown water that they called coffee as well as weak soup and a piece of bread . "
sunday 's opening attracted a number of prominent figures .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier attended along with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , whose father was a prisoner in flossenbürg .
charlotte knobloch of germany 's central council of jews , romani rose from the central council of the sinti and roma and israeli ambassador shimon stein were also there .
there were also 84 former prisoners among those viewing the exhibition , an experience that was difficult for many .
mikova , however , was one of those ready to face the past .

" we are not going to respond to demands from the area of the taliban , " merkel told the ard public television .
" we can not be blackmailed . " she said she had " no new reliable information " regarding how the hostage died or on the whereabouts of the other man .
berlin has set up a crisis team to evaluate all information regarding the pair of germans kidnapped last week .
the two men were reported to be engineers working on a dam project south of kabul . though it is not a position shared by any of germany 's main political parties , a recent survey showed that some 60 percent of germans support pulling bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .

the 39th session of the un committee of the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women -lrb- cedaw -rrb- begins monday .
dw-world.de talked to an expert about victims of human trafficking . katrin adams is the executive officer of kok – a german ngo working to combat exploitation and support women trafficked to germany .
dw-world.de : what does your organization do to fight trafficking of women ?
katrin adams : we have two main areas that we concentrate on .
firstly , combating trafficking in women and secondly , combating violence against women in the process of migration .
we are a network of 37 member organizations – women ’ s organizations and counseling centers .
we are a specialist lobby in berlin and we lobby for improvement of the individual situations of the victims of human trafficking .
what does the un convention say on human trafficking ?
they have a specialized article , which is article 6 , which says that state parties shall take all appropriate measures , including legislation , to suppress all forms of trafficking of women and exploitation by prostitution of women .
how useful is the convention in practice ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a survivor of trafficking in moscow the convention is very useful in that it has a reporting system .
that means that governments have to report on their specific improvements on their work when it comes to the implementation of the standards set in the convention .
with regards article 6 it means that states have to tell you something and they have to summarize what they have done to reach these objectives set out in article 6 .
for us as an ngo it is a good opportunity for us to lobby for our demands because normally the committee accepts the shadow reports .
a shadow report is prepared by ngos in which they give addition information and comment on the government reports .
do you prepare shadow reports ?
we , the kok , normally comment very specifically on article 6 in a shadow report .
we would comment on the report submitted by germany .
we work at a very national level .
that means we concentrate on the situation of victims of human trafficking here in germany .
this year the government released its report , including a section on article 6 .
at the moment we are critically reviewing what they have said and we will definitely comment critically on what the government says .
why will you be critical of the german government ?
because there has been some legislation passed this year by parliament which will enter into force in autumn .
that special legislation has , in our opinion , some flaws when it comes to an adequate treatment of victims of human trafficking .
we think germany should do better .
what is the extent of trafficking in women to germany ?
unfortunately i can ’ t give you as a definite answer on that because we think the numbers that are known about are only a fraction of what is actually happening .
the numbers that are most reliable are those published by the federal criminal office .
the number of victims officially known about in 2005 was 642 .
but we are working on the basis that the actual number is much higher .
what sort of cases are these ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demanding education to rebuild women 's lives we have a lot very different cases .
there is no single procedure .
normally women are brought into germany and they have been deceived or threatened .
they are promised that they will get work in restaurants or bars and then they discover they have to work as prostitutes .
some women do come to germany knowing that they might be working as prostitutes and then find the work conditions are exploitative , which they wouldn ’ t have been aware of before they came .
when it comes to trafficking in human beings , there is also the issue of being forced into labor or marriage , that ’ s an issue that has not really been dealt with a lot .
where are these women mostly coming from ?
mostly from countries in eastern europe , although the numbers of women that are being forced into prostitution that are germans and being trafficked within germany is rising too .
when your organization and the un cedaw committee are critical of the german government , how much notice do they take ?
normally , what the committee does is adopt concluding comments , and as far as i know they are being taken seriously .
that means that the government tries to consider what the committee says and act accordingly .
in some cases it ’ s just political goodwill and nothing actually happens but in some cases the observations and concluding comments are quite useful and there is actually change in the political environment .
what sort of changes would you like to see the government implement to protect women who have been trafficked to germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kok also campaigns on violence against women what we would like to see is women who have been trafficked become entitled to permanent residency in germany .
at the moment the legal conditions are quite strict when it comes to getting residency .
secondly , coverage of basic needs including medical treatment and psychological help is often not provided .
we would like them to have a legal right to this basic coverage .
another important point is access to further education , especially language courses , so that women who decide to stay here once they have been released have an opportunity to build a normal life .
we are lobbying too for access to the labor market .
is it possible to prevent women being trafficked to germany ?
this is more the work of ngos in the countries of origin .
we are in contact with networks of ngos in these countries .
if there is a need and if we can help by supporting these ngos in that specific countries then we do what we can , but it ’ s not one of our main activities . emma wynne interviewed katrin adams send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany can help you find it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ben donald goes native jaded by the globalization of travel , writer ben donald wanted to go somewhere - anywhere - not yet colonized by the " distasteful hordes . "
his personal patch of paradise turns out to be closer than expected - germany . " this is the not so lonely planet we are living on , " explains a character in donald 's recently published travelogue , " springtime for germany - or how i learned to love lederhosen . " but discerning globetrotters need not despair . " there is a new frontier , " he goes on .
" a lost , or rather overlooked horizon ; a place that is remaining undiscovered , cloaked in poisonous myth and all but unvisited , as we speak , for over 60 years since it became obscured from the minds of most of the world . " is that really germany he 's talking about ? initiated readers may be puzzled to hear it described in such terms .
but wait , he has a point , does n't he ?
it is better than its reputation .
in fact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who could resist germany 's biooodiful fräuleins ? ... " it is a european shangri-la : a romantic , wooded place , a country of rivers , vineyards , forests , castles , poetry and music ... of fast cars , schöne ladies - ' ver ze girls are biooodiful . '
a country preserved by neglect ; ripe and waiting to be revealed again . " blimey .
so why does this much-maligned country get short shrift with travelers , or , in donald-speak , " chavelers " ?
determined to get to the bottom of it , he sets out to discover the real germany .
and guess what ?
contrary to popular belief - at least the one defined by tabloid britain - there 's more to deutschland than soccer coaches with mullets , disney castles and nude bathers .
and no , sturm und drang do n't make hi-fis , and fkk has nothing to do with the ku klux klan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red lights on the reeperbahn as he scuppers the clichés with the same doggedness he mocks the germans for , donald gets to grips with the concepts he feels best sum up the essence of germany and germans .
in the chapter headed gemütlichkeit , he snuggles up with the bavarians at the annual oktoberfest , heads to berlin to capture the zeitgeist , gets the measure of grossmansucht on hamburg 's reeperbahn and meets a german stand-up comedian in schadenfreude . it proves to be a journey of enlightenment . " i am inclined to judge the depth of a man 's civilization by his opinion of germany and her culture , " he concludes . dw-world.de spoke to ben donald and asked him why , if germany 's so great , does britain still harp on about men in socks and sandals , girls with hairy armpits , and of course , david hasselhof . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the definitive guide to the real germany ?
you decide .
ben donald : well , if you 're writing a book about germany you have to use the stereotypes simply because they provide so much material , and humor is a key way of attracting people to a subject .
the british do the same with other countries too .
the stereotypical battle over the sun loungers is an entirely anglo-german issue - italians wouldn ‘ t take a blind bit of notice of a towel on a sun lounger , they ‘ d just sit down and ignore it .
the thing is , the english and the germans are quite similar in their approach to staking out territory and personal privacy . ultimately , the book said as much about brits as it did about germany . good !
that ‘ s how it should be .
i wanted to pitch myself as a kind of everyman , and the idea was that the book would show some sort of development from my original position .
i couldn ‘ t start out being a germanophile .
and in the course of the journey , i as the narrator also reveal a great deal about the british . but there was the assumption that readers would recognize and agree with britain 's stereotypes about germany . to go back to the genesis of this book , there 's simply nothing in the travel bookshops about germany , nothing lighthearted , nothing extolling the delights of the german countryside and way of life .
why is that , when there are hundreds about italy and france and spain ?
there 's something stopping people in britain from seeing germany as a holiday destination and romanticizing a view of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen 's famous cliffs when i do radio interviews in britain , the first questions are invariably : is n't germany just about sausages and dodgy wine , v olksmusik and nena ?
so these stereotypes do still exist - but they 've become more playful , they 're not malicious at all .
and while german ambassadors to britain always get involved with debates with the uk tabloids about how they treat germany , it should be pointed out that the british do this with everyone !
we 're terrible when it comes to xenophobic tendencies . in the book i focus on how germans are extraordinarily introspective and self questioning , and perhaps they just need to see anglo-german attitudes in the context of british xenophobia towards other countries too . even when brits are telling you how much they love france , the wine , the chateaux , their gites and so on , they ca n't help saying it 's just a shame about all the frenchmen in it .
the english view of france , as you see in books such as " a year in the merde " by stephen clarke , is also very stereotypical . but germans might still find the stereotypes offensive ... but what the book does is take these clichés and explode them .
there are few nazi references in it , because i specifically did n't want to write a book only about the war .
when i refer to lebensraum , for example , i explain what it is .
i mention kraft durch freude and the prora resort on rügen as an example of the socialism aspect we rarely talk about in the context of national socialism . i tried to see where the stereotypes are rooted and then to supply a deeper cultural reading .
when i wanted to explore - albeit in a jocular fashion - where germany 's thing about nudism has its roots , i tied it together with the specifically german interpretation of the hippy movement , the second world war and germany 's tradition of the kur -lsb- spa -rsb- culture .
what i did was find plausible explanations as to why these stereotypes emerged in the first place . you could argue that germans , who are quite serious , are the antithesis of the brits , who tend to be relentlessly ironic and su per cilious .
is it basically a per sonality clash ? but they do get on in many areas .
doing business with germans is an utter pleasure and in many ways we have a lot in common .
we actually have many affinities and shared interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein castle - too much for some so might we eventually see a great bond between the two countries ? all the people i speak to one-on-one have brilliant experiences of germany .
but it ‘ s a question of changing perceptions within the media and the collective nation .
in a way , these stereotypes are just too good to give up .
a map was drawn in 1945 , which was when the media explosion happened , and things became hard to change . what is your per sonal favorite part of germany ? i really love the baltic coast , the island of rügen and also further inland , the mecklenburgische seenplatte .
i 'd also love to go back to thuringia .
bavaria is probably too overpowering a stereotype for me . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" after an initial scrutiny of the draft reform treaty we see that solutions proposed by ... the -lsb- eu -rsb- presidency are close to our expectations , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told a news conference after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
warsaw had initially insisted that groups of eu member states have the power to block contentious legislation for a two-year " period of scrutiny " but later dropped the demand .
" we will not insist on an initial requirement of two years , " fotyga said , adding that she still expected a period lasting a " reasonable time " to be incorporated in the final document .
eu observers have said that period of time would likely be a maximum of four months .
draft ready by october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel forged the compromise with her european counterparts in june portuguese foreign minister luis amado , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , welcomed the polish statements and said he expected a draft of the reform treaty to be hammered out and agreed to by october and ratified by mid-2009 .
" we should be able to have a new treaty as soon as possible , " said amado .
" we have a commitment from all ... to meet these requirements . "
the european commission president jose manuel barroso urged all eu states to show " loyal and active support " to the portuguese eu presidency , saying it was time the bloc stopped feuding over institutions and faced key challenges of today .
" we need to work quickly but carefully , " barroso said .
political debate still to come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amado said he expects the draft treaty to be ready for approval in october amado added that monday 's talks focused on technical aspects of the draft treaty and that its political dimensions would be debated later .
eu legal experts will open discussions on the treaty in brussels on tuesday and are set to meet regularly until the bloc 's summit in lisbon in october .
" i envisage the possibility of some level of political discussion but not at the moment , " he said .
" it is vital that the union should not allow itself to be paralysed once again on account of internal , institutional problems , so that is may respond to the real challenges that it must face . "
under german chancellor angela merkel 's leadership , eu members agreed in june to a deal that would streamline the bloc by giving more power to its foreign policy chief , electing a long-term eu president and instituting changes to the bloc 's voting system .
luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn predicted that the treaty details could be finalized at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in early september but warned : " the devil is in the detail . "
the new amended treaty will replace an eu draft constitution which was rejected by dutch and french voters two years ago , plunging the bloc into crisis .
eu governments are hoping the new rulebook will be ratified by their legislatures over the coming months and enter into force by summer 2009 , just ahead of elections to the european parliament . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

you decide .
ben donald : well , if you 're writing a book about germany you have to use the stereotypes simply because they provide so much material , and humor is a key way of attracting people to a subject .
the british do the same with other countries too .
the stereotypical battle over the sun loungers is an entirely anglo-german issue - italians wouldn ‘ t take a blind bit of notice of a towel on a sun lounger , they ‘ d just sit down and ignore it .
the thing is , the english and the germans are quite similar in their approach to staking out territory and personal privacy . ultimately , the book said as much about brits as it did about germany . good !
that ‘ s how it should be .
i wanted to pitch myself as a kind of everyman , and the idea was that the book would show some sort of development from my original position .
i couldn ‘ t start out being a germanophile .
and in the course of the journey , i as the narrator also reveal a great deal about the british . but there was the assumption that readers would recognize and agree with britain 's stereotypes about germany . to go back to the genesis of this book , there 's simply nothing in the travel bookshops about germany , nothing lighthearted , nothing extolling the delights of the german countryside and way of life .
why is that , when there are hundreds about italy and france and spain ?
there 's something stopping people in britain from seeing germany as a holiday destination and romanticizing a view of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen 's famous cliffs when i do radio interviews in britain , the first questions are invariably : is n't germany just about sausages and dodgy wine , v olksmusik and nena ?
so these stereotypes do still exist - but they 've become more playful , they 're not malicious at all .
and while german ambassadors to britain always get involved with debates with the uk tabloids about how they treat germany , it should be pointed out that the british do this with everyone !
we 're terrible when it comes to xenophobic tendencies . in the book i focus on how germans are extraordinarily introspective and self questioning , and perhaps they just need to see anglo-german attitudes in the context of british xenophobia towards other countries too . even when brits are telling you how much they love france , the wine , the chateaux , their gites and so on , they ca n't help saying it 's just a shame about all the frenchmen in it .
the english view of france , as you see in books such as " a year in the merde " by stephen clarke , is also very stereotypical . but germans might still find the stereotypes offensive ... but what the book does is take these clichés and explode them .
there are few nazi references in it , because i specifically did n't want to write a book only about the war .
when i refer to lebensraum , for example , i explain what it is .
i mention kraft durch freude and the prora resort on rügen as an example of the socialism aspect we rarely talk about in the context of national socialism . i tried to see where the stereotypes are rooted and then to supply a deeper cultural reading .
when i wanted to explore - albeit in a jocular fashion - where germany 's thing about nudism has its roots , i tied it together with the specifically german interpretation of the hippy movement , the second world war and germany 's tradition of the kur -lsb- spa -rsb- culture .
what i did was find plausible explanations as to why these stereotypes emerged in the first place . you could argue that germans , who are quite serious , are the antithesis of the brits , who tend to be relentlessly ironic and su per cilious .
is it basically a per sonality clash ? but they do get on in many areas .
doing business with germans is an utter pleasure and in many ways we have a lot in common .
we actually have many affinities and shared interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein castle - too much for some so might we eventually see a great bond between the two countries ? all the people i speak to one-on-one have brilliant experiences of germany .
but it ‘ s a question of changing perceptions within the media and the collective nation .
in a way , these stereotypes are just too good to give up .
a map was drawn in 1945 , which was when the media explosion happened , and things became hard to change . what is your per sonal favorite part of germany ? i really love the baltic coast , the island of rügen and also further inland , the mecklenburgische seenplatte .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 23.07.2007 exhibition dedicated to " forgotten " concentration camp opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flossenbürg gets a permament memorial exhibition some 60 years after liberation for years flossenbürg has been regarded as one of the " forgotten concentration camps " of world war ii .
now , a new exhibition has opened which tells the story of those who were incarcerated and who lost their lives there . a postcard in one of the first display rooms of the new museum reads : " greetings from flossenbürg . "
the friendly greeting is positioned under a picture of the historic castle ruins for which the small town on the german-czech border is still well known for .
in fact , while the postcard is from the 1920s , it could be from the present day .
what flossenbürg is less famous - or notorious - for is that it was the location for one of the nazis ' 12 largest concentration camps ; the camp where german theologian dietrich bonhoeffer died along with tens of thousands of other victims .
after the war , the camp and its history slowly slipped into oblivion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietrich bonhoeffer was one of the tens of thousands to be killed at flossenbürg but the new exhibition , which opened to the public on sunday , more than 60 years after the camp was liberated , aims to commemorate those who lost their lives at flossenbürg and its surrounding camps and return its role in the " final solution " to the modern history books .
after being liberated , the camp became the site of residential buildings and a toy factory moved into its empty warehouse .
only in the 1980s did a small exhibit about the camp first appear .
one of the main reasons it took so long for the camp to be remembered has much to do with the demographics of those who were imprisoned there .
" two thirds of the prisoners were eastern europeans , " said christian omonsky , the press coordinator of the flossenbürg exhibit , adding that the process of recounting the stories and compiling the evidence could only begin after the iron curtain fell and the former prisoners were able to visit the camp in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of its liberation .
since then - with the help of survivors , local people and historians - omonsky , museum director jörg skriebeleit and the rest of the museum 's staff have created a memorial for the concentration camp .
painstaking research to create memorial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family photos show lives about to be changed forever the exhibition is the result of four years of extensive research by skriebeleit and his team .
their research included hundreds of interviews with former prisoners to fill in the gaps of the camp 's history .
the work recreates an authentic snapshot of everyday life in the camp , one which not only shows the suffering of the prisoners but also the lives of those responsible for the suffering .
for example , photos of ss officers enjoying leisure time feature alongside pictures of emaciated inmates .
during world war ii , flossenbürg was an administrative center for 90 camps in bavaria , bohemia and saxony .
jews , sinti and roma were locked up in these camps along with political dissidents , prisoners of war , homosexuals and " professional criminals . "
in total , the camps held around16,000 women and 84,000 men .
in flossenbürg and its surrounding camps almost 30,000 prisoners died as a result of murder by ss officers , hard labor and accidents in the nearby stone quarry , frostbite or illnesses such as pneumonia and tuberculosis .
until recently , those who died were only numbers in a ledger .
" we would like to give these victims who had disappeared from the public consciousness for decades a human face , " said skriebeleit .
the central hall of the exhibition attempts to do just that with a selection of personal photographs from prisoners , taken before they were deported .
the images of families , holidays , young lovers , weddings and smiling youths give a clear indication of what was taken from these people when imprisioned within the confines of the camp .
ordinary lives swapped for horror and death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skriebeleit and a model of the war-time camp texts accompanying the photos explain the victims ' fates and artwork from survivors depict the horrors they may have experienced .
one drawing shows the execution of five prisoners in front of a christmas tree while the rest of the camp looks on .
while it has taken many years to bring flossenbürg out of the shadows of history , the survivors of the camp have visited regularly since they have been able to .
" for the survivors , returning always reminds us of the past , " said lisa mikova from prague .
" but we want to tell school children , for instance , about our history in the hope that we can warn them about the dangers of fascism . "
mikova was sent to the camp in 1942 because she was jewish .
her parents , her parents-in-law and a brother-in-law were killed in auschwitz .
she was sent to a camp in freiberg .
" there we had to work extremely hard in an airplane factory , for 12 hours a day , " mikova said .
" then we had to go through the town to get to the camp huts .
it was very cold , because we were dressed very poorly , without underwear and we only had clogs .
our heads were shaved bald .
and there was not a lot to eat - only a little bit of brown water that they called coffee as well as weak soup and a piece of bread . "
sunday 's opening attracted a number of prominent figures .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier attended along with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , whose father was a prisoner in flossenbürg .
charlotte knobloch of germany 's central council of jews , romani rose from the central council of the sinti and roma and israeli ambassador shimon stein were also there .
there were also 84 former prisoners among those viewing the exhibition , an experience that was difficult for many .
mikova , however , was one of those ready to face the past .
" of course there are things which remain with us , things that one can never forget or get over , " she said .

what flossenbürg is less famous - or notorious - for is that it was the location for one of the nazis ' 12 largest concentration camps ; the camp where german theologian dietrich bonhoeffer died along with tens of thousands of other victims .
after the war , the camp and its history slowly slipped into oblivion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietrich bonhoeffer was one of the tens of thousands to be killed at flossenbürg but the new exhibition , which opened to the public on sunday , more than 60 years after the camp was liberated , aims to commemorate those who lost their lives at flossenbürg and its surrounding camps and return its role in the " final solution " to the modern history books .
after being liberated , the camp became the site of residential buildings and a toy factory moved into its empty warehouse .
only in the 1980s did a small exhibit about the camp first appear .
one of the main reasons it took so long for the camp to be remembered has much to do with the demographics of those who were imprisoned there .
" two thirds of the prisoners were eastern europeans , " said christian omonsky , the press coordinator of the flossenbürg exhibit , adding that the process of recounting the stories and compiling the evidence could only begin after the iron curtain fell and the former prisoners were able to visit the camp in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of its liberation .
since then - with the help of survivors , local people and historians - omonsky , museum director jörg skriebeleit and the rest of the museum 's staff have created a memorial for the concentration camp .
painstaking research to create memorial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family photos show lives about to be changed forever the exhibition is the result of four years of extensive research by skriebeleit and his team .
their research included hundreds of interviews with former prisoners to fill in the gaps of the camp 's history .
the work recreates an authentic snapshot of everyday life in the camp , one which not only shows the suffering of the prisoners but also the lives of those responsible for the suffering .
for example , photos of ss officers enjoying leisure time feature alongside pictures of emaciated inmates .
during world war ii , flossenbürg was an administrative center for 90 camps in bavaria , bohemia and saxony .
jews , sinti and roma were locked up in these camps along with political dissidents , prisoners of war , homosexuals and " professional criminals . "
in total , the camps held around16,000 women and 84,000 men .
in flossenbürg and its surrounding camps almost 30,000 prisoners died as a result of murder by ss officers , hard labor and accidents in the nearby stone quarry , frostbite or illnesses such as pneumonia and tuberculosis .
until recently , those who died were only numbers in a ledger .
" we would like to give these victims who had disappeared from the public consciousness for decades a human face , " said skriebeleit .
the central hall of the exhibition attempts to do just that with a selection of personal photographs from prisoners , taken before they were deported .
the images of families , holidays , young lovers , weddings and smiling youths give a clear indication of what was taken from these people when imprisioned within the confines of the camp .
ordinary lives swapped for horror and death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skriebeleit and a model of the war-time camp texts accompanying the photos explain the victims ' fates and artwork from survivors depict the horrors they may have experienced .
one drawing shows the execution of five prisoners in front of a christmas tree while the rest of the camp looks on .
while it has taken many years to bring flossenbürg out of the shadows of history , the survivors of the camp have visited regularly since they have been able to .
" for the survivors , returning always reminds us of the past , " said lisa mikova from prague .
" but we want to tell school children , for instance , about our history in the hope that we can warn them about the dangers of fascism . "
mikova was sent to the camp in 1942 because she was jewish .
her parents , her parents-in-law and a brother-in-law were killed in auschwitz .
she was sent to a camp in freiberg .
" there we had to work extremely hard in an airplane factory , for 12 hours a day , " mikova said .
" then we had to go through the town to get to the camp huts .
it was very cold , because we were dressed very poorly , without underwear and we only had clogs .
our heads were shaved bald .
and there was not a lot to eat - only a little bit of brown water that they called coffee as well as weak soup and a piece of bread . "
sunday 's opening attracted a number of prominent figures .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier attended along with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , whose father was a prisoner in flossenbürg .
charlotte knobloch of germany 's central council of jews , romani rose from the central council of the sinti and roma and israeli ambassador shimon stein were also there .
there were also 84 former prisoners among those viewing the exhibition , an experience that was difficult for many .
mikova , however , was one of those ready to face the past .
" of course there are things which remain with us , things that one can never forget or get over , " she said .

" our democracy has successfully passed a test ...
our unity , democracy and the republic have emerged stronger from the ballot box , " erdogan said overnight outside akp headquarters as fireworks lit up the sky and hundreds of supporters cheered . the governing party , which has its roots in a now-banned islamist movement , won 46.3 percent of the vote , leading its closest rival by a wide margin , according to unofficial results after 99.9 percent of the ballots were counted . it was the largest support a turkish party has gained since the 1969 legislative election .
a comfortable lead the support the akp garnered should translate into 339 seats in the 550-member parliament , enough for it to once again form a government on its own . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks voted sunday for a new parliament that will face a host of challenges the party had 352 members in the outgoing house and despite support for it increasing by 12 percentage points compared to 2002 , the number of its seats will decline because more parties will be represented in parliament . " we will pursue economic and democracy reforms with determination , " erdogan said , pledging also commitment to the secular system and turkey 's eu membership bid . the secularist main opposition republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- finished second with 20.9 percent of vote and an estimated 112 seats , according to unofficial results .
the right-wing nationalist action party -lrb- mhp -rrb- was third with 14.2 percent and 71 seats . no other party passed the 10-percent national threshold needed to enter parliament , but 28 independent candidates won seats , 24 of them kurds campaigning for broader rights for their sizeable community . populist policies with virtually no chance of actually winning government , the akp 's nearest rivals had campaigned on populist policies and waged a scare campaign that portrayed the government as being not only anti-secular but also of failing to adequately deal with rebels from the kurdish workers ' party , of whom around 3,500 are based in northern iraq . around 42.5 million people were eligible to vote in sunday 's election of 550 members of parliament .
ten people were injured in fighting at voting booths in the south-east , but in general voting was peaceful at 160,000 polling stations across the country .
erdogan was forced to call sunday 's election after a bungled attempt to place his right-hand man , foreign minister abdullah gül , in the presidential palace in ankara .
millions of people took to the streets to protest the prospect of gül becoming president .
they objected to gül 's past involvement in conservative islamist groups , the fact that his wife wears an islamic-style headscarf - no president 's wife in turkey has ever worn one - and also at the prospect of the akp controlling the government , the parliament and presidency .
the military stepped in in april effectively scuttling the presidential election process by declaring it would do whatever necessary to protect secularism . as soon as the new parliament opens , its first task will be to elect a new president . erdogan has said he will seek a compromise in the presidential election , but insists that the candidate must be from his party . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany can help you find it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ben donald goes native jaded by the globalization of travel , writer ben donald wanted to go somewhere - anywhere - not yet colonized by the " distasteful hordes . "
his personal patch of paradise turns out to be closer than expected - germany . " this is the not so lonely planet we are living on , " explains a character in donald 's recently published travelogue , " springtime for germany - or how i learned to love lederhosen . " but discerning globetrotters need not despair . " there is a new frontier , " he goes on .
" a lost , or rather overlooked horizon ; a place that is remaining undiscovered , cloaked in poisonous myth and all but unvisited , as we speak , for over 60 years since it became obscured from the minds of most of the world . " is that really germany he 's talking about ? initiated readers may be puzzled to hear it described in such terms .

you decide .
ben donald : well , if you 're writing a book about germany you have to use the stereotypes simply because they provide so much material , and humor is a key way of attracting people to a subject .
the british do the same with other countries too .
the stereotypical battle over the sun loungers is an entirely anglo-german issue - italians wouldn ‘ t take a blind bit of notice of a towel on a sun lounger , they ‘ d just sit down and ignore it .
the thing is , the english and the germans are quite similar in their approach to staking out territory and personal privacy . ultimately , the book said as much about brits as it did about germany . good !

i wanted to pitch myself as a kind of everyman , and the idea was that the book would show some sort of development from my original position .
i couldn ‘ t start out being a germanophile .
and in the course of the journey , i as the narrator also reveal a great deal about the british . but there was the assumption that readers would recognize and agree with britain 's stereotypes about germany . to go back to the genesis of this book , there 's simply nothing in the travel bookshops about germany , nothing lighthearted , nothing extolling the delights of the german countryside and way of life .
why is that , when there are hundreds about italy and france and spain ?
there 's something stopping people in britain from seeing germany as a holiday destination and romanticizing a view of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen 's famous cliffs when i do radio interviews in britain , the first questions are invariably : is n't germany just about sausages and dodgy wine , v olksmusik and nena ?
so these stereotypes do still exist - but they 've become more playful , they 're not malicious at all .
and while german ambassadors to britain always get involved with debates with the uk tabloids about how they treat germany , it should be pointed out that the british do this with everyone !
we 're terrible when it comes to xenophobic tendencies . in the book i focus on how germans are extraordinarily introspective and self questioning , and perhaps they just need to see anglo-german attitudes in the context of british xenophobia towards other countries too . even when brits are telling you how much they love france , the wine , the chateaux , their gites and so on , they ca n't help saying it 's just a shame about all the frenchmen in it .
the english view of france , as you see in books such as " a year in the merde " by stephen clarke , is also very stereotypical . but germans might still find the stereotypes offensive ... but what the book does is take these clichés and explode them .
there are few nazi references in it , because i specifically did n't want to write a book only about the war .
when i refer to lebensraum , for example , i explain what it is .
i mention kraft durch freude and the prora resort on rügen as an example of the socialism aspect we rarely talk about in the context of national socialism . i tried to see where the stereotypes are rooted and then to supply a deeper cultural reading .
when i wanted to explore - albeit in a jocular fashion - where germany 's thing about nudism has its roots , i tied it together with the specifically german interpretation of the hippy movement , the second world war and germany 's tradition of the kur -lsb- spa -rsb- culture .
what i did was find plausible explanations as to why these stereotypes emerged in the first place . you could argue that germans , who are quite serious , are the antithesis of the brits , who tend to be relentlessly ironic and su per cilious .

the 39th session of the un committee of the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women -lrb- cedaw -rrb- begins monday .
dw-world.de talked to an expert about victims of human trafficking . katrin adams is the executive officer of kok – a german ngo working to combat exploitation and support women trafficked to germany .
dw-world.de : what does your organization do to fight trafficking of women ?
katrin adams : we have two main areas that we concentrate on .
firstly , combating trafficking in women and secondly , combating violence against women in the process of migration .
we are a network of 37 member organizations – women ’ s organizations and counseling centers .
we are a specialist lobby in berlin and we lobby for improvement of the individual situations of the victims of human trafficking .
what does the un convention say on human trafficking ?
they have a specialized article , which is article 6 , which says that state parties shall take all appropriate measures , including legislation , to suppress all forms of trafficking of women and exploitation by prostitution of women .
how useful is the convention in practice ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a survivor of trafficking in moscow the convention is very useful in that it has a reporting system .
that means that governments have to report on their specific improvements on their work when it comes to the implementation of the standards set in the convention .
with regards article 6 it means that states have to tell you something and they have to summarize what they have done to reach these objectives set out in article 6 .
for us as an ngo it is a good opportunity for us to lobby for our demands because normally the committee accepts the shadow reports .
a shadow report is prepared by ngos in which they give addition information and comment on the government reports .
do you prepare shadow reports ?
we , the kok , normally comment very specifically on article 6 in a shadow report .
we would comment on the report submitted by germany .
we work at a very national level .
that means we concentrate on the situation of victims of human trafficking here in germany .
this year the government released its report , including a section on article 6 .
at the moment we are critically reviewing what they have said and we will definitely comment critically on what the government says .
why will you be critical of the german government ?
because there has been some legislation passed this year by parliament which will enter into force in autumn .
that special legislation has , in our opinion , some flaws when it comes to an adequate treatment of victims of human trafficking .
we think germany should do better .
what is the extent of trafficking in women to germany ?
unfortunately i can ’ t give you as a definite answer on that because we think the numbers that are known about are only a fraction of what is actually happening .
the numbers that are most reliable are those published by the federal criminal office .
the number of victims officially known about in 2005 was 642 .
but we are working on the basis that the actual number is much higher .
what sort of cases are these ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demanding education to rebuild women 's lives we have a lot very different cases .
there is no single procedure .
normally women are brought into germany and they have been deceived or threatened .
they are promised that they will get work in restaurants or bars and then they discover they have to work as prostitutes .
some women do come to germany knowing that they might be working as prostitutes and then find the work conditions are exploitative , which they wouldn ’ t have been aware of before they came .
when it comes to trafficking in human beings , there is also the issue of being forced into labor or marriage , that ’ s an issue that has not really been dealt with a lot .
where are these women mostly coming from ?
mostly from countries in eastern europe , although the numbers of women that are being forced into prostitution that are germans and being trafficked within germany is rising too .
when your organization and the un cedaw committee are critical of the german government , how much notice do they take ?
normally , what the committee does is adopt concluding comments , and as far as i know they are being taken seriously .
that means that the government tries to consider what the committee says and act accordingly .
in some cases it ’ s just political goodwill and nothing actually happens but in some cases the observations and concluding comments are quite useful and there is actually change in the political environment .
what sort of changes would you like to see the government implement to protect women who have been trafficked to germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kok also campaigns on violence against women what we would like to see is women who have been trafficked become entitled to permanent residency in germany .
at the moment the legal conditions are quite strict when it comes to getting residency .
secondly , coverage of basic needs including medical treatment and psychological help is often not provided .
we would like them to have a legal right to this basic coverage .
another important point is access to further education , especially language courses , so that women who decide to stay here once they have been released have an opportunity to build a normal life .
we are lobbying too for access to the labor market .
is it possible to prevent women being trafficked to germany ?
this is more the work of ngos in the countries of origin .
we are in contact with networks of ngos in these countries .
if there is a need and if we can help by supporting these ngos in that specific countries then we do what we can , but it ’ s not one of our main activities . emma wynne interviewed katrin adams send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said the german interior ministry knew about 14 islamists from germany who had been in pakistan or were still there .
it added that authorities were calculating that more individuals from germany would be trained in al qaeda-run terrorist camps .
" a new quality in threat to germany " the weekly said at least seven islamists from germany had been arrested in pakistan over the past months and that islamabad was likely in the next few weeks to deport the men .
" we must assume that those who have come back from pakistan are planning attacks , " august hanning , germany 's deputy interior minister , said in an interview with the paper .
" we need to do everything possible to find out who went to pakistan and was trained there . "
he added that " this is a new , specific threat and is a cause for concern .
there is a new quality in the threat to germany . "
hanning added there were several indications that al qaeda had germany and german installations abroad , such as embassies , in its sight .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble echoed the view , saying there was a threat that suicide bombers were now being sent to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble says germany faces a new , concrete threat " there are a lot of concrete indications right up to the past few days that show that germany has increasingly moved into the crosshairs of international terrorism , " schäuble said in an interview with the bz am sonntag newspaper .
last month schäuble said authorities needed to increase vigilance due to the possibility that militants might carry out suicide attacks on german soil .
in april the us embassy in berlin announced it was boosting security at its facilities in germany in response to what it described as an increased threat of terrorism .
berlin has also said it believed there may be similar training camps in afghanistan , where germany has more than 3,000 troops stationed as part of a nato peacekeeping force .
the taliban has threatened to step up attacks on german troops . merkel supports online searches schäuble recently sparked controversy over comments that germany should clarify under what conditions the constitution permits the state to target and kill terrorists .
the tough-talking schäuble also pressed for changes in laws to allow pre-emptive detention of suspected militants and said authorities should have the right to prevent people they deem dangerous from using the internet and mobile phones .
the proposals have been criticized for eroding civil liberties .
but on sunday , schäuble received backing from german chancellor angela merkel for creating a legal framework to allow online searches of personal computers of suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has supported online searches of computers of suspected terrorists " we must look the threats in the eye and take them seriously , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .

the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said the german interior ministry knew about 14 islamists from germany who had been in pakistan or were still there .
it added that authorities were calculating that more individuals from germany would be trained in al qaeda-run terrorist camps .
" a new quality in threat to germany " the weekly said at least seven islamists from germany had been arrested in pakistan over the past months and that islamabad was likely in the next few weeks to deport the men .
" we must assume that those who have come back from pakistan are planning attacks , " august hanning , germany 's deputy interior minister , said in an interview with the paper .
" we need to do everything possible to find out who went to pakistan and was trained there . "
he added that " this is a new , specific threat and is a cause for concern .
there is a new quality in the threat to germany . "
hanning added there were several indications that al qaeda had germany and german installations abroad , such as embassies , in its sight .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble echoed the view , saying there was a threat that suicide bombers were now being sent to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble says germany faces a new , concrete threat " there are a lot of concrete indications right up to the past few days that show that germany has increasingly moved into the crosshairs of international terrorism , " schäuble said in an interview with the bz am sonntag newspaper .
last month schäuble said authorities needed to increase vigilance due to the possibility that militants might carry out suicide attacks on german soil .
in april the us embassy in berlin announced it was boosting security at its facilities in germany in response to what it described as an increased threat of terrorism .
berlin has also said it believed there may be similar training camps in afghanistan , where germany has more than 3,000 troops stationed as part of a nato peacekeeping force .
the taliban has threatened to step up attacks on german troops . merkel supports online searches schäuble recently sparked controversy over comments that germany should clarify under what conditions the constitution permits the state to target and kill terrorists .
the tough-talking schäuble also pressed for changes in laws to allow pre-emptive detention of suspected militants and said authorities should have the right to prevent people they deem dangerous from using the internet and mobile phones .
the proposals have been criticized for eroding civil liberties .
but on sunday , schäuble received backing from german chancellor angela merkel for creating a legal framework to allow online searches of personal computers of suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has supported online searches of computers of suspected terrorists " we must look the threats in the eye and take them seriously , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .
" the interior minister has the freedom to think what needs to be done in the face of totally new threats . "
the issue has for weeks been a focus of heated debate between schäuble and german justice minister brigitte zypries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 23.07.2007 germany 's steinmeier proposes troika solution for kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers under the un 's protectorate mandate have policed kosovo since 1999 an international troika of the european union , russia and the united states , should take charge of discussions on the final status of kosovo , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said monday . with time running out on a decision on the future of the serbian province , steinmeier said he wanted discussions on kosovo to be led by a small team rather than the six-nation contract group composed of the us , britain , germany , france , italy and russia .
" i favor the concept of an international troika , made up of the us , russia and eu , so with that we would have three international partners to negotiate with the serbs and the kosovars -lrb- ethnic albanians -rrb- , " steinmeier told reporters at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels .
he said that such a troika offered the " best chance " to secure a so far elusive deal on kosovo .
" i think that once russia and the united states sit at the table together , there will be a very real possibility that the kosovars and the serbs will start acting the way they should , " he said .
steinmeier 's proposal comes after russia last week threatened to veto yet another draft un security council resolution calling for supervised independence for kosovo .
steinmeier seeking alternative to contact group others , also seeking to avert a russian veto by putting preparations for the un resolution on hold , have said discussions on kosovo should be spearheaded by the contact group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier continues to push for supervised independence steinmeier said there was also a suggestion that un secretary-general ban ki-moon should appoint a new envoy to replace martti ahtisaari to mediate between serbs and kosovars .
however , the proposed troika discussions would continue to focus on ahtisaari 's plan for supervised independence for kosovo , steinmeier added .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn also said the eu wanted to move forward on the basis of ahtisaari 's recommendation that kosovo be granted " independence supervised by the international community . "
" if the contact group is going to have further negotiations we are of course ready to contribute to those , " rehn told reporters .
he warned that it is " essential that both parties including serbia take finally a constructive and realistic approach to these negotiations . "
eu officials , however , once again stated that if the troika proposal was rejected and the issue moved to the contact group , it would be a temporary solution and that the un security council would have the final say to the status of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia and kosovo came to the table - but agreed to nothing luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn also backed steinmeier 's proposal , saying it was important that serbs and kosovars came back to the negotiating table .
" if they are not able to talk together about their future , then others will take the decisions , " asselborn said .
steinmeier said he had discussed his troika proposal with ban , russian foreign minister sergi lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
" now that we all have to presume there will not be a security council resolution , i feel it is important that we do n't leave the ongoing process to its own devices , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister stated that stability in the western balkans was a key eu priority , adding , " the international community needs therefore to maintain its joint responsibility towards the region . "
eu 's credibility at stake over kosovo other eu foreign ministers at the brussels meeting emphasized that the eu 's credibility was on the line over the resolution of kosovo ’ s status .
" the stability of the balkans , the unity of the european union , the credibility of us versus the united states and russia is at stake , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt , a balkans expert within the eu , told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish balkan expert bildt sees kosovo as the eu 's problem bildt added that unity between the eu states over kosovo was " absolutely paramount " if the issue of kosovo was to move from the un security council to the international contact group .
british foreign secretary david miliband echoed bildt 's statement on eu unity .
" it 's probably important that we establish our own position and are clear about the need for strong european leadership and strong european unity in this area , " he said .
russian resistance scuppers un resolution the europeans and their us allies on friday postponed attempts to secure a security council resolution that would have granted kosovo " supervised independence , " in the face of a likely russian veto .
russia , a strong ally of serbia , had complained that recognizing an independent kosovo would send the wrong signal to other breakaway regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is being backed in its stance by its ally russia serbia has said such a move would be a breach of its national sovereignty but concedes it could give special autonomy to kosovo .
after talks with rice on monday , kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said the province would work with the united states and europe to coordinate its future and not unilaterally declare independence .
" for us it is critical that the process is coordinated and moves ahead in close cooperation with the international community , the us and the european union in the first place , " he told the afp news agency .
" of course , a formal announcement of independence will happen in due course , but in cooperation and in close partnership with the countries which are supportive of the kosovo independence . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when a nato campaign drove out serb forces after accusing them of committing atrocities against ethnic albanians .

" our democracy has successfully passed a test ...
our unity , democracy and the republic have emerged stronger from the ballot box , " erdogan said overnight outside akp headquarters as fireworks lit up the sky and hundreds of supporters cheered . the governing party , which has its roots in a now-banned islamist movement , won 46.3 percent of the vote , leading its closest rival by a wide margin , according to unofficial results after 99.9 percent of the ballots were counted . it was the largest support a turkish party has gained since the 1969 legislative election .
a comfortable lead the support the akp garnered should translate into 339 seats in the 550-member parliament , enough for it to once again form a government on its own . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks voted sunday for a new parliament that will face a host of challenges the party had 352 members in the outgoing house and despite support for it increasing by 12 percentage points compared to 2002 , the number of its seats will decline because more parties will be represented in parliament . " we will pursue economic and democracy reforms with determination , " erdogan said , pledging also commitment to the secular system and turkey 's eu membership bid . the secularist main opposition republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- finished second with 20.9 percent of vote and an estimated 112 seats , according to unofficial results .
the right-wing nationalist action party -lrb- mhp -rrb- was third with 14.2 percent and 71 seats . no other party passed the 10-percent national threshold needed to enter parliament , but 28 independent candidates won seats , 24 of them kurds campaigning for broader rights for their sizeable community . populist policies with virtually no chance of actually winning government , the akp 's nearest rivals had campaigned on populist policies and waged a scare campaign that portrayed the government as being not only anti-secular but also of failing to adequately deal with rebels from the kurdish workers ' party , of whom around 3,500 are based in northern iraq . around 42.5 million people were eligible to vote in sunday 's election of 550 members of parliament .
ten people were injured in fighting at voting booths in the south-east , but in general voting was peaceful at 160,000 polling stations across the country .
erdogan was forced to call sunday 's election after a bungled attempt to place his right-hand man , foreign minister abdullah gül , in the presidential palace in ankara .
millions of people took to the streets to protest the prospect of gül becoming president .
they objected to gül 's past involvement in conservative islamist groups , the fact that his wife wears an islamic-style headscarf - no president 's wife in turkey has ever worn one - and also at the prospect of the akp controlling the government , the parliament and presidency .
the military stepped in in april effectively scuttling the presidential election process by declaring it would do whatever necessary to protect secularism . as soon as the new parliament opens , its first task will be to elect a new president . erdogan has said he will seek a compromise in the presidential election , but insists that the candidate must be from his party . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our democracy has successfully passed a test ...
our unity , democracy and the republic have emerged stronger from the ballot box , " erdogan said overnight outside akp headquarters as fireworks lit up the sky and hundreds of supporters cheered . the governing party , which has its roots in a now-banned islamist movement , won 46.3 percent of the vote , leading its closest rival by a wide margin , according to unofficial results after 99.9 percent of the ballots were counted . it was the largest support a turkish party has gained since the 1969 legislative election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 23.07.2007 germany 's steinmeier proposes troika solution for kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers under the un 's protectorate mandate have policed kosovo since 1999 an international troika of the european union , russia and the united states , should take charge of discussions on the final status of kosovo , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said monday . with time running out on a decision on the future of the serbian province , steinmeier said he wanted discussions on kosovo to be led by a small team rather than the six-nation contract group composed of the us , britain , germany , france , italy and russia .
" i favor the concept of an international troika , made up of the us , russia and eu , so with that we would have three international partners to negotiate with the serbs and the kosovars -lrb- ethnic albanians -rrb- , " steinmeier told reporters at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels .
he said that such a troika offered the " best chance " to secure a so far elusive deal on kosovo .
" i think that once russia and the united states sit at the table together , there will be a very real possibility that the kosovars and the serbs will start acting the way they should , " he said .
steinmeier 's proposal comes after russia last week threatened to veto yet another draft un security council resolution calling for supervised independence for kosovo .
steinmeier seeking alternative to contact group others , also seeking to avert a russian veto by putting preparations for the un resolution on hold , have said discussions on kosovo should be spearheaded by the contact group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier continues to push for supervised independence steinmeier said there was also a suggestion that un secretary-general ban ki-moon should appoint a new envoy to replace martti ahtisaari to mediate between serbs and kosovars .
however , the proposed troika discussions would continue to focus on ahtisaari 's plan for supervised independence for kosovo , steinmeier added .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn also said the eu wanted to move forward on the basis of ahtisaari 's recommendation that kosovo be granted " independence supervised by the international community . "
" if the contact group is going to have further negotiations we are of course ready to contribute to those , " rehn told reporters .
he warned that it is " essential that both parties including serbia take finally a constructive and realistic approach to these negotiations . "
eu officials , however , once again stated that if the troika proposal was rejected and the issue moved to the contact group , it would be a temporary solution and that the un security council would have the final say to the status of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia and kosovo came to the table - but agreed to nothing luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn also backed steinmeier 's proposal , saying it was important that serbs and kosovars came back to the negotiating table .
" if they are not able to talk together about their future , then others will take the decisions , " asselborn said .
steinmeier said he had discussed his troika proposal with ban , russian foreign minister sergi lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
" now that we all have to presume there will not be a security council resolution , i feel it is important that we do n't leave the ongoing process to its own devices , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister stated that stability in the western balkans was a key eu priority , adding , " the international community needs therefore to maintain its joint responsibility towards the region . "
eu 's credibility at stake over kosovo other eu foreign ministers at the brussels meeting emphasized that the eu 's credibility was on the line over the resolution of kosovo ’ s status .
" the stability of the balkans , the unity of the european union , the credibility of us versus the united states and russia is at stake , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt , a balkans expert within the eu , told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish balkan expert bildt sees kosovo as the eu 's problem bildt added that unity between the eu states over kosovo was " absolutely paramount " if the issue of kosovo was to move from the un security council to the international contact group .
british foreign secretary david miliband echoed bildt 's statement on eu unity .
" it 's probably important that we establish our own position and are clear about the need for strong european leadership and strong european unity in this area , " he said .
russian resistance scuppers un resolution the europeans and their us allies on friday postponed attempts to secure a security council resolution that would have granted kosovo " supervised independence , " in the face of a likely russian veto .
russia , a strong ally of serbia , had complained that recognizing an independent kosovo would send the wrong signal to other breakaway regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is being backed in its stance by its ally russia serbia has said such a move would be a breach of its national sovereignty but concedes it could give special autonomy to kosovo .
after talks with rice on monday , kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said the province would work with the united states and europe to coordinate its future and not unilaterally declare independence .
" for us it is critical that the process is coordinated and moves ahead in close cooperation with the international community , the us and the european union in the first place , " he told the afp news agency .
" of course , a formal announcement of independence will happen in due course , but in cooperation and in close partnership with the countries which are supportive of the kosovo independence . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when a nato campaign drove out serb forces after accusing them of committing atrocities against ethnic albanians .
in april this year , ahtisaari proposed independence under the supervision of the eu after 13 months of serb-albanian talks ended in deadlock . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" after an initial scrutiny of the draft reform treaty we see that solutions proposed by ... the -lsb- eu -rsb- presidency are close to our expectations , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told a news conference after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
warsaw had initially insisted that groups of eu member states have the power to block contentious legislation for a two-year " period of scrutiny " but later dropped the demand .
" we will not insist on an initial requirement of two years , " fotyga said , adding that she still expected a period lasting a " reasonable time " to be incorporated in the final document .
eu observers have said that period of time would likely be a maximum of four months .
draft ready by october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel forged the compromise with her european counterparts in june portuguese foreign minister luis amado , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , welcomed the polish statements and said he expected a draft of the reform treaty to be hammered out and agreed to by october and ratified by mid-2009 .
" we should be able to have a new treaty as soon as possible , " said amado .
" we have a commitment from all ... to meet these requirements . "
the european commission president jose manuel barroso urged all eu states to show " loyal and active support " to the portuguese eu presidency , saying it was time the bloc stopped feuding over institutions and faced key challenges of today .
" we need to work quickly but carefully , " barroso said .
political debate still to come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amado said he expects the draft treaty to be ready for approval in october amado added that monday 's talks focused on technical aspects of the draft treaty and that its political dimensions would be debated later .
eu legal experts will open discussions on the treaty in brussels on tuesday and are set to meet regularly until the bloc 's summit in lisbon in october .
" i envisage the possibility of some level of political discussion but not at the moment , " he said .
" it is vital that the union should not allow itself to be paralysed once again on account of internal , institutional problems , so that is may respond to the real challenges that it must face . "
under german chancellor angela merkel 's leadership , eu members agreed in june to a deal that would streamline the bloc by giving more power to its foreign policy chief , electing a long-term eu president and instituting changes to the bloc 's voting system .
luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn predicted that the treaty details could be finalized at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in early september but warned : " the devil is in the detail . "
the new amended treaty will replace an eu draft constitution which was rejected by dutch and french voters two years ago , plunging the bloc into crisis .
eu governments are hoping the new rulebook will be ratified by their legislatures over the coming months and enter into force by summer 2009 , just ahead of elections to the european parliament . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i favor the concept of an international troika , made up of the us , russia and eu , so with that we would have three international partners to negotiate with the serbs and the kosovars -lrb- ethnic albanians -rrb- , " steinmeier told reporters at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels .
he said that such a troika offered the " best chance " to secure a so far elusive deal on kosovo .
" i think that once russia and the united states sit at the table together , there will be a very real possibility that the kosovars and the serbs will start acting the way they should , " he said .
steinmeier 's proposal comes after russia last week threatened to veto yet another draft un security council resolution calling for supervised independence for kosovo .
steinmeier seeking alternative to contact group others , also seeking to avert a russian veto by putting preparations for the un resolution on hold , have said discussions on kosovo should be spearheaded by the contact group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier continues to push for supervised independence steinmeier said there was also a suggestion that un secretary-general ban ki-moon should appoint a new envoy to replace martti ahtisaari to mediate between serbs and kosovars .
however , the proposed troika discussions would continue to focus on ahtisaari 's plan for supervised independence for kosovo , steinmeier added .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn also said the eu wanted to move forward on the basis of ahtisaari 's recommendation that kosovo be granted " independence supervised by the international community . "
" if the contact group is going to have further negotiations we are of course ready to contribute to those , " rehn told reporters .
he warned that it is " essential that both parties including serbia take finally a constructive and realistic approach to these negotiations . "
eu officials , however , once again stated that if the troika proposal was rejected and the issue moved to the contact group , it would be a temporary solution and that the un security council would have the final say to the status of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia and kosovo came to the table - but agreed to nothing luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn also backed steinmeier 's proposal , saying it was important that serbs and kosovars came back to the negotiating table .
" if they are not able to talk together about their future , then others will take the decisions , " asselborn said .
steinmeier said he had discussed his troika proposal with ban , russian foreign minister sergi lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
" now that we all have to presume there will not be a security council resolution , i feel it is important that we do n't leave the ongoing process to its own devices , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister stated that stability in the western balkans was a key eu priority , adding , " the international community needs therefore to maintain its joint responsibility towards the region . "
eu 's credibility at stake over kosovo other eu foreign ministers at the brussels meeting emphasized that the eu 's credibility was on the line over the resolution of kosovo ’ s status .
" the stability of the balkans , the unity of the european union , the credibility of us versus the united states and russia is at stake , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt , a balkans expert within the eu , told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish balkan expert bildt sees kosovo as the eu 's problem bildt added that unity between the eu states over kosovo was " absolutely paramount " if the issue of kosovo was to move from the un security council to the international contact group .
british foreign secretary david miliband echoed bildt 's statement on eu unity .
" it 's probably important that we establish our own position and are clear about the need for strong european leadership and strong european unity in this area , " he said .
russian resistance scuppers un resolution the europeans and their us allies on friday postponed attempts to secure a security council resolution that would have granted kosovo " supervised independence , " in the face of a likely russian veto .
russia , a strong ally of serbia , had complained that recognizing an independent kosovo would send the wrong signal to other breakaway regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is being backed in its stance by its ally russia serbia has said such a move would be a breach of its national sovereignty but concedes it could give special autonomy to kosovo .
after talks with rice on monday , kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said the province would work with the united states and europe to coordinate its future and not unilaterally declare independence .
" for us it is critical that the process is coordinated and moves ahead in close cooperation with the international community , the us and the european union in the first place , " he told the afp news agency .
" of course , a formal announcement of independence will happen in due course , but in cooperation and in close partnership with the countries which are supportive of the kosovo independence . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when a nato campaign drove out serb forces after accusing them of committing atrocities against ethnic albanians .
in april this year , ahtisaari proposed independence under the supervision of the eu after 13 months of serb-albanian talks ended in deadlock . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the german national and four afghans we had reported to have killed are still alive , " qari mohammad yousuf , told reuters from an unknown location by telephone . in exchange for the hostages ' release , yousuf said the taliban demanded the release of 10 prisoners held by the afghan government and the withdrawal of germany 's 3,000 troops stationed in afghanistan . other news agencies reported similar statements and demands from taliban leaders on monday . the body of a second german found over the weekend was returned to germany for an autopsy on monday .
it remained unclear whether the man , identified as rüdiger b. , died of gunshot wounds or if his captors shot his body after his death .
the german government has said he was not executed . crisis team still at work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crisis team is still working to locate the german hostage in berlin , chancellor angela merkel said on sunday in a television interview that germany would not allow itself to be blackmailed by the taliban . " we are not going to respond to demands from the area of the taliban , " merkel told the ard public television .
" we can not be blackmailed . " she said she had " no new reliable information " regarding how the hostage died or on the whereabouts of the other man .
berlin has set up a crisis team to evaluate all information regarding the pair of germans kidnapped last week .
the two men were reported to be engineers working on a dam project south of kabul . though it is not a position shared by any of germany 's main political parties , a recent survey showed that some 60 percent of germans support pulling bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .

" since the afghan government has not sincerely tried to solve the problem , this time we are giving another 24 hours to the korean government to solve the matter yousuf told the dpa news agency . afghan interior ministry spokesman zemarai bashary said earlier that authorities were " working on the issue constantly , around the clock . " " we have more hope of success for the release of both the south koreans and the german , " he said .

the 39th session of the un committee of the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women -lrb- cedaw -rrb- begins monday .
dw-world.de talked to an expert about victims of human trafficking . katrin adams is the executive officer of kok – a german ngo working to combat exploitation and support women trafficked to germany .
dw-world.de : what does your organization do to fight trafficking of women ?
katrin adams : we have two main areas that we concentrate on .
firstly , combating trafficking in women and secondly , combating violence against women in the process of migration .
we are a network of 37 member organizations – women ’ s organizations and counseling centers .
we are a specialist lobby in berlin and we lobby for improvement of the individual situations of the victims of human trafficking .
what does the un convention say on human trafficking ?
they have a specialized article , which is article 6 , which says that state parties shall take all appropriate measures , including legislation , to suppress all forms of trafficking of women and exploitation by prostitution of women .
how useful is the convention in practice ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a survivor of trafficking in moscow the convention is very useful in that it has a reporting system .
that means that governments have to report on their specific improvements on their work when it comes to the implementation of the standards set in the convention .
with regards article 6 it means that states have to tell you something and they have to summarize what they have done to reach these objectives set out in article 6 .
for us as an ngo it is a good opportunity for us to lobby for our demands because normally the committee accepts the shadow reports .
a shadow report is prepared by ngos in which they give addition information and comment on the government reports .
do you prepare shadow reports ?
we , the kok , normally comment very specifically on article 6 in a shadow report .
we would comment on the report submitted by germany .
we work at a very national level .
that means we concentrate on the situation of victims of human trafficking here in germany .
this year the government released its report , including a section on article 6 .
at the moment we are critically reviewing what they have said and we will definitely comment critically on what the government says .
why will you be critical of the german government ?
because there has been some legislation passed this year by parliament which will enter into force in autumn .
that special legislation has , in our opinion , some flaws when it comes to an adequate treatment of victims of human trafficking .
we think germany should do better .
what is the extent of trafficking in women to germany ?
unfortunately i can ’ t give you as a definite answer on that because we think the numbers that are known about are only a fraction of what is actually happening .
the numbers that are most reliable are those published by the federal criminal office .
the number of victims officially known about in 2005 was 642 .
but we are working on the basis that the actual number is much higher .
what sort of cases are these ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demanding education to rebuild women 's lives we have a lot very different cases .
there is no single procedure .
normally women are brought into germany and they have been deceived or threatened .
they are promised that they will get work in restaurants or bars and then they discover they have to work as prostitutes .
some women do come to germany knowing that they might be working as prostitutes and then find the work conditions are exploitative , which they wouldn ’ t have been aware of before they came .
when it comes to trafficking in human beings , there is also the issue of being forced into labor or marriage , that ’ s an issue that has not really been dealt with a lot .
where are these women mostly coming from ?
mostly from countries in eastern europe , although the numbers of women that are being forced into prostitution that are germans and being trafficked within germany is rising too .
when your organization and the un cedaw committee are critical of the german government , how much notice do they take ?
normally , what the committee does is adopt concluding comments , and as far as i know they are being taken seriously .
that means that the government tries to consider what the committee says and act accordingly .
in some cases it ’ s just political goodwill and nothing actually happens but in some cases the observations and concluding comments are quite useful and there is actually change in the political environment .
what sort of changes would you like to see the government implement to protect women who have been trafficked to germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kok also campaigns on violence against women what we would like to see is women who have been trafficked become entitled to permanent residency in germany .
at the moment the legal conditions are quite strict when it comes to getting residency .
secondly , coverage of basic needs including medical treatment and psychological help is often not provided .
we would like them to have a legal right to this basic coverage .
another important point is access to further education , especially language courses , so that women who decide to stay here once they have been released have an opportunity to build a normal life .
we are lobbying too for access to the labor market .
is it possible to prevent women being trafficked to germany ?
this is more the work of ngos in the countries of origin .
we are in contact with networks of ngos in these countries .
if there is a need and if we can help by supporting these ngos in that specific countries then we do what we can , but it ’ s not one of our main activities . emma wynne interviewed katrin adams send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said the german interior ministry knew about 14 islamists from germany who had been in pakistan or were still there .
it added that authorities were calculating that more individuals from germany would be trained in al qaeda-run terrorist camps .
" a new quality in threat to germany " the weekly said at least seven islamists from germany had been arrested in pakistan over the past months and that islamabad was likely in the next few weeks to deport the men .
" we must assume that those who have come back from pakistan are planning attacks , " august hanning , germany 's deputy interior minister , said in an interview with the paper .
" we need to do everything possible to find out who went to pakistan and was trained there . "
he added that " this is a new , specific threat and is a cause for concern .
there is a new quality in the threat to germany . "
hanning added there were several indications that al qaeda had germany and german installations abroad , such as embassies , in its sight .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble echoed the view , saying there was a threat that suicide bombers were now being sent to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble says germany faces a new , concrete threat " there are a lot of concrete indications right up to the past few days that show that germany has increasingly moved into the crosshairs of international terrorism , " schäuble said in an interview with the bz am sonntag newspaper .
last month schäuble said authorities needed to increase vigilance due to the possibility that militants might carry out suicide attacks on german soil .
in april the us embassy in berlin announced it was boosting security at its facilities in germany in response to what it described as an increased threat of terrorism .
berlin has also said it believed there may be similar training camps in afghanistan , where germany has more than 3,000 troops stationed as part of a nato peacekeeping force .
the taliban has threatened to step up attacks on german troops . merkel supports online searches schäuble recently sparked controversy over comments that germany should clarify under what conditions the constitution permits the state to target and kill terrorists .
the tough-talking schäuble also pressed for changes in laws to allow pre-emptive detention of suspected militants and said authorities should have the right to prevent people they deem dangerous from using the internet and mobile phones .
the proposals have been criticized for eroding civil liberties .
but on sunday , schäuble received backing from german chancellor angela merkel for creating a legal framework to allow online searches of personal computers of suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has supported online searches of computers of suspected terrorists " we must look the threats in the eye and take them seriously , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .
" the interior minister has the freedom to think what needs to be done in the face of totally new threats . "
the issue has for weeks been a focus of heated debate between schäuble and german justice minister brigitte zypries .
on monday , members of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- urged zypries to expand the existing catalogue of anti-terrorism measures to include penalizing training in terrorism camps and the distribution of bomb-making manuals . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

steinmeier 's proposal comes after russia last week threatened to veto yet another draft un security council resolution calling for supervised independence for kosovo .
steinmeier seeking alternative to contact group others , also seeking to avert a russian veto by putting preparations for the un resolution on hold , have said discussions on kosovo should be spearheaded by the contact group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier continues to push for supervised independence steinmeier said there was also a suggestion that un secretary-general ban ki-moon should appoint a new envoy to replace martti ahtisaari to mediate between serbs and kosovars .
however , the proposed troika discussions would continue to focus on ahtisaari 's plan for supervised independence for kosovo , steinmeier added .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn also said the eu wanted to move forward on the basis of ahtisaari 's recommendation that kosovo be granted " independence supervised by the international community . "
" if the contact group is going to have further negotiations we are of course ready to contribute to those , " rehn told reporters .
he warned that it is " essential that both parties including serbia take finally a constructive and realistic approach to these negotiations . "
eu officials , however , once again stated that if the troika proposal was rejected and the issue moved to the contact group , it would be a temporary solution and that the un security council would have the final say to the status of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia and kosovo came to the table - but agreed to nothing luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn also backed steinmeier 's proposal , saying it was important that serbs and kosovars came back to the negotiating table .
" if they are not able to talk together about their future , then others will take the decisions , " asselborn said .
steinmeier said he had discussed his troika proposal with ban , russian foreign minister sergi lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
" now that we all have to presume there will not be a security council resolution , i feel it is important that we do n't leave the ongoing process to its own devices , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister stated that stability in the western balkans was a key eu priority , adding , " the international community needs therefore to maintain its joint responsibility towards the region . "
eu 's credibility at stake over kosovo other eu foreign ministers at the brussels meeting emphasized that the eu 's credibility was on the line over the resolution of kosovo ’ s status .
" the stability of the balkans , the unity of the european union , the credibility of us versus the united states and russia is at stake , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt , a balkans expert within the eu , told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish balkan expert bildt sees kosovo as the eu 's problem bildt added that unity between the eu states over kosovo was " absolutely paramount " if the issue of kosovo was to move from the un security council to the international contact group .
british foreign secretary david miliband echoed bildt 's statement on eu unity .
" it 's probably important that we establish our own position and are clear about the need for strong european leadership and strong european unity in this area , " he said .
russian resistance scuppers un resolution the europeans and their us allies on friday postponed attempts to secure a security council resolution that would have granted kosovo " supervised independence , " in the face of a likely russian veto .
russia , a strong ally of serbia , had complained that recognizing an independent kosovo would send the wrong signal to other breakaway regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is being backed in its stance by its ally russia serbia has said such a move would be a breach of its national sovereignty but concedes it could give special autonomy to kosovo .
after talks with rice on monday , kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said the province would work with the united states and europe to coordinate its future and not unilaterally declare independence .
" for us it is critical that the process is coordinated and moves ahead in close cooperation with the international community , the us and the european union in the first place , " he told the afp news agency .
" of course , a formal announcement of independence will happen in due course , but in cooperation and in close partnership with the countries which are supportive of the kosovo independence . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when a nato campaign drove out serb forces after accusing them of committing atrocities against ethnic albanians .
in april this year , ahtisaari proposed independence under the supervision of the eu after 13 months of serb-albanian talks ended in deadlock . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , a new exhibition has opened which tells the story of those who were incarcerated and who lost their lives there . a postcard in one of the first display rooms of the new museum reads : " greetings from flossenbürg . "
the friendly greeting is positioned under a picture of the historic castle ruins for which the small town on the german-czech border is still well known for .
in fact , while the postcard is from the 1920s , it could be from the present day .
what flossenbürg is less famous - or notorious - for is that it was the location for one of the nazis ' 12 largest concentration camps ; the camp where german theologian dietrich bonhoeffer died along with tens of thousands of other victims .
after the war , the camp and its history slowly slipped into oblivion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietrich bonhoeffer was one of the tens of thousands to be killed at flossenbürg but the new exhibition , which opened to the public on sunday , more than 60 years after the camp was liberated , aims to commemorate those who lost their lives at flossenbürg and its surrounding camps and return its role in the " final solution " to the modern history books .
after being liberated , the camp became the site of residential buildings and a toy factory moved into its empty warehouse .
only in the 1980s did a small exhibit about the camp first appear .
one of the main reasons it took so long for the camp to be remembered has much to do with the demographics of those who were imprisoned there .
" two thirds of the prisoners were eastern europeans , " said christian omonsky , the press coordinator of the flossenbürg exhibit , adding that the process of recounting the stories and compiling the evidence could only begin after the iron curtain fell and the former prisoners were able to visit the camp in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of its liberation .
since then - with the help of survivors , local people and historians - omonsky , museum director jörg skriebeleit and the rest of the museum 's staff have created a memorial for the concentration camp .
painstaking research to create memorial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family photos show lives about to be changed forever the exhibition is the result of four years of extensive research by skriebeleit and his team .
their research included hundreds of interviews with former prisoners to fill in the gaps of the camp 's history .
the work recreates an authentic snapshot of everyday life in the camp , one which not only shows the suffering of the prisoners but also the lives of those responsible for the suffering .
for example , photos of ss officers enjoying leisure time feature alongside pictures of emaciated inmates .
during world war ii , flossenbürg was an administrative center for 90 camps in bavaria , bohemia and saxony .
jews , sinti and roma were locked up in these camps along with political dissidents , prisoners of war , homosexuals and " professional criminals . "
in total , the camps held around16,000 women and 84,000 men .
in flossenbürg and its surrounding camps almost 30,000 prisoners died as a result of murder by ss officers , hard labor and accidents in the nearby stone quarry , frostbite or illnesses such as pneumonia and tuberculosis .
until recently , those who died were only numbers in a ledger .
" we would like to give these victims who had disappeared from the public consciousness for decades a human face , " said skriebeleit .
the central hall of the exhibition attempts to do just that with a selection of personal photographs from prisoners , taken before they were deported .
the images of families , holidays , young lovers , weddings and smiling youths give a clear indication of what was taken from these people when imprisioned within the confines of the camp .
ordinary lives swapped for horror and death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skriebeleit and a model of the war-time camp texts accompanying the photos explain the victims ' fates and artwork from survivors depict the horrors they may have experienced .
one drawing shows the execution of five prisoners in front of a christmas tree while the rest of the camp looks on .
while it has taken many years to bring flossenbürg out of the shadows of history , the survivors of the camp have visited regularly since they have been able to .
" for the survivors , returning always reminds us of the past , " said lisa mikova from prague .
" but we want to tell school children , for instance , about our history in the hope that we can warn them about the dangers of fascism . "
mikova was sent to the camp in 1942 because she was jewish .
her parents , her parents-in-law and a brother-in-law were killed in auschwitz .
she was sent to a camp in freiberg .
" there we had to work extremely hard in an airplane factory , for 12 hours a day , " mikova said .
" then we had to go through the town to get to the camp huts .
it was very cold , because we were dressed very poorly , without underwear and we only had clogs .
our heads were shaved bald .
and there was not a lot to eat - only a little bit of brown water that they called coffee as well as weak soup and a piece of bread . "
sunday 's opening attracted a number of prominent figures .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier attended along with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , whose father was a prisoner in flossenbürg .
charlotte knobloch of germany 's central council of jews , romani rose from the central council of the sinti and roma and israeli ambassador shimon stein were also there .
there were also 84 former prisoners among those viewing the exhibition , an experience that was difficult for many .
mikova , however , was one of those ready to face the past .
" of course there are things which remain with us , things that one can never forget or get over , " she said .

since then - with the help of survivors , local people and historians - omonsky , museum director jörg skriebeleit and the rest of the museum 's staff have created a memorial for the concentration camp .
painstaking research to create memorial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family photos show lives about to be changed forever the exhibition is the result of four years of extensive research by skriebeleit and his team .
their research included hundreds of interviews with former prisoners to fill in the gaps of the camp 's history .
the work recreates an authentic snapshot of everyday life in the camp , one which not only shows the suffering of the prisoners but also the lives of those responsible for the suffering .
for example , photos of ss officers enjoying leisure time feature alongside pictures of emaciated inmates .
during world war ii , flossenbürg was an administrative center for 90 camps in bavaria , bohemia and saxony .
jews , sinti and roma were locked up in these camps along with political dissidents , prisoners of war , homosexuals and " professional criminals . "
in total , the camps held around16,000 women and 84,000 men .
in flossenbürg and its surrounding camps almost 30,000 prisoners died as a result of murder by ss officers , hard labor and accidents in the nearby stone quarry , frostbite or illnesses such as pneumonia and tuberculosis .
until recently , those who died were only numbers in a ledger .
" we would like to give these victims who had disappeared from the public consciousness for decades a human face , " said skriebeleit .
the central hall of the exhibition attempts to do just that with a selection of personal photographs from prisoners , taken before they were deported .
the images of families , holidays , young lovers , weddings and smiling youths give a clear indication of what was taken from these people when imprisioned within the confines of the camp .
ordinary lives swapped for horror and death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skriebeleit and a model of the war-time camp texts accompanying the photos explain the victims ' fates and artwork from survivors depict the horrors they may have experienced .
one drawing shows the execution of five prisoners in front of a christmas tree while the rest of the camp looks on .
while it has taken many years to bring flossenbürg out of the shadows of history , the survivors of the camp have visited regularly since they have been able to .
" for the survivors , returning always reminds us of the past , " said lisa mikova from prague .
" but we want to tell school children , for instance , about our history in the hope that we can warn them about the dangers of fascism . "
mikova was sent to the camp in 1942 because she was jewish .
her parents , her parents-in-law and a brother-in-law were killed in auschwitz .
she was sent to a camp in freiberg .
" there we had to work extremely hard in an airplane factory , for 12 hours a day , " mikova said .
" then we had to go through the town to get to the camp huts .
it was very cold , because we were dressed very poorly , without underwear and we only had clogs .
our heads were shaved bald .
and there was not a lot to eat - only a little bit of brown water that they called coffee as well as weak soup and a piece of bread . "
sunday 's opening attracted a number of prominent figures .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier attended along with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , whose father was a prisoner in flossenbürg .
charlotte knobloch of germany 's central council of jews , romani rose from the central council of the sinti and roma and israeli ambassador shimon stein were also there .
there were also 84 former prisoners among those viewing the exhibition , an experience that was difficult for many .
mikova , however , was one of those ready to face the past .

now , a new exhibition has opened which tells the story of those who were incarcerated and who lost their lives there . a postcard in one of the first display rooms of the new museum reads : " greetings from flossenbürg . "
the friendly greeting is positioned under a picture of the historic castle ruins for which the small town on the german-czech border is still well known for .
in fact , while the postcard is from the 1920s , it could be from the present day .
what flossenbürg is less famous - or notorious - for is that it was the location for one of the nazis ' 12 largest concentration camps ; the camp where german theologian dietrich bonhoeffer died along with tens of thousands of other victims .
after the war , the camp and its history slowly slipped into oblivion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietrich bonhoeffer was one of the tens of thousands to be killed at flossenbürg but the new exhibition , which opened to the public on sunday , more than 60 years after the camp was liberated , aims to commemorate those who lost their lives at flossenbürg and its surrounding camps and return its role in the " final solution " to the modern history books .
after being liberated , the camp became the site of residential buildings and a toy factory moved into its empty warehouse .
only in the 1980s did a small exhibit about the camp first appear .
one of the main reasons it took so long for the camp to be remembered has much to do with the demographics of those who were imprisoned there .
" two thirds of the prisoners were eastern europeans , " said christian omonsky , the press coordinator of the flossenbürg exhibit , adding that the process of recounting the stories and compiling the evidence could only begin after the iron curtain fell and the former prisoners were able to visit the camp in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of its liberation .

" i favor the concept of an international troika , made up of the us , russia and eu , so with that we would have three international partners to negotiate with the serbs and the kosovars -lrb- ethnic albanians -rrb- , " steinmeier told reporters at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels .
he said that such a troika offered the " best chance " to secure a so far elusive deal on kosovo .
" i think that once russia and the united states sit at the table together , there will be a very real possibility that the kosovars and the serbs will start acting the way they should , " he said .
steinmeier 's proposal comes after russia last week threatened to veto yet another draft un security council resolution calling for supervised independence for kosovo .
steinmeier seeking alternative to contact group others , also seeking to avert a russian veto by putting preparations for the un resolution on hold , have said discussions on kosovo should be spearheaded by the contact group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier continues to push for supervised independence steinmeier said there was also a suggestion that un secretary-general ban ki-moon should appoint a new envoy to replace martti ahtisaari to mediate between serbs and kosovars .
however , the proposed troika discussions would continue to focus on ahtisaari 's plan for supervised independence for kosovo , steinmeier added .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn also said the eu wanted to move forward on the basis of ahtisaari 's recommendation that kosovo be granted " independence supervised by the international community . "
" if the contact group is going to have further negotiations we are of course ready to contribute to those , " rehn told reporters .
he warned that it is " essential that both parties including serbia take finally a constructive and realistic approach to these negotiations . "
eu officials , however , once again stated that if the troika proposal was rejected and the issue moved to the contact group , it would be a temporary solution and that the un security council would have the final say to the status of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia and kosovo came to the table - but agreed to nothing luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn also backed steinmeier 's proposal , saying it was important that serbs and kosovars came back to the negotiating table .
" if they are not able to talk together about their future , then others will take the decisions , " asselborn said .
steinmeier said he had discussed his troika proposal with ban , russian foreign minister sergi lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
" now that we all have to presume there will not be a security council resolution , i feel it is important that we do n't leave the ongoing process to its own devices , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister stated that stability in the western balkans was a key eu priority , adding , " the international community needs therefore to maintain its joint responsibility towards the region . "
eu 's credibility at stake over kosovo other eu foreign ministers at the brussels meeting emphasized that the eu 's credibility was on the line over the resolution of kosovo ’ s status .
" the stability of the balkans , the unity of the european union , the credibility of us versus the united states and russia is at stake , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt , a balkans expert within the eu , told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish balkan expert bildt sees kosovo as the eu 's problem bildt added that unity between the eu states over kosovo was " absolutely paramount " if the issue of kosovo was to move from the un security council to the international contact group .
british foreign secretary david miliband echoed bildt 's statement on eu unity .
" it 's probably important that we establish our own position and are clear about the need for strong european leadership and strong european unity in this area , " he said .
russian resistance scuppers un resolution the europeans and their us allies on friday postponed attempts to secure a security council resolution that would have granted kosovo " supervised independence , " in the face of a likely russian veto .
russia , a strong ally of serbia , had complained that recognizing an independent kosovo would send the wrong signal to other breakaway regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is being backed in its stance by its ally russia serbia has said such a move would be a breach of its national sovereignty but concedes it could give special autonomy to kosovo .
after talks with rice on monday , kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said the province would work with the united states and europe to coordinate its future and not unilaterally declare independence .
" for us it is critical that the process is coordinated and moves ahead in close cooperation with the international community , the us and the european union in the first place , " he told the afp news agency .
" of course , a formal announcement of independence will happen in due course , but in cooperation and in close partnership with the countries which are supportive of the kosovo independence . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when a nato campaign drove out serb forces after accusing them of committing atrocities against ethnic albanians .

" after an initial scrutiny of the draft reform treaty we see that solutions proposed by ... the -lsb- eu -rsb- presidency are close to our expectations , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told a news conference after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
warsaw had initially insisted that groups of eu member states have the power to block contentious legislation for a two-year " period of scrutiny " but later dropped the demand .
" we will not insist on an initial requirement of two years , " fotyga said , adding that she still expected a period lasting a " reasonable time " to be incorporated in the final document .
eu observers have said that period of time would likely be a maximum of four months .
draft ready by october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel forged the compromise with her european counterparts in june portuguese foreign minister luis amado , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , welcomed the polish statements and said he expected a draft of the reform treaty to be hammered out and agreed to by october and ratified by mid-2009 .
" we should be able to have a new treaty as soon as possible , " said amado .
" we have a commitment from all ... to meet these requirements . "
the european commission president jose manuel barroso urged all eu states to show " loyal and active support " to the portuguese eu presidency , saying it was time the bloc stopped feuding over institutions and faced key challenges of today .
" we need to work quickly but carefully , " barroso said .
political debate still to come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amado said he expects the draft treaty to be ready for approval in october amado added that monday 's talks focused on technical aspects of the draft treaty and that its political dimensions would be debated later .
eu legal experts will open discussions on the treaty in brussels on tuesday and are set to meet regularly until the bloc 's summit in lisbon in october .
" i envisage the possibility of some level of political discussion but not at the moment , " he said .
" it is vital that the union should not allow itself to be paralysed once again on account of internal , institutional problems , so that is may respond to the real challenges that it must face . "
under german chancellor angela merkel 's leadership , eu members agreed in june to a deal that would streamline the bloc by giving more power to its foreign policy chief , electing a long-term eu president and instituting changes to the bloc 's voting system .
luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn predicted that the treaty details could be finalized at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in early september but warned : " the devil is in the detail . "
the new amended treaty will replace an eu draft constitution which was rejected by dutch and french voters two years ago , plunging the bloc into crisis .
eu governments are hoping the new rulebook will be ratified by their legislatures over the coming months and enter into force by summer 2009 , just ahead of elections to the european parliament . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our democracy has successfully passed a test ...
our unity , democracy and the republic have emerged stronger from the ballot box , " erdogan said overnight outside akp headquarters as fireworks lit up the sky and hundreds of supporters cheered . the governing party , which has its roots in a now-banned islamist movement , won 46.3 percent of the vote , leading its closest rival by a wide margin , according to unofficial results after 99.9 percent of the ballots were counted . it was the largest support a turkish party has gained since the 1969 legislative election .
a comfortable lead the support the akp garnered should translate into 339 seats in the 550-member parliament , enough for it to once again form a government on its own . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks voted sunday for a new parliament that will face a host of challenges the party had 352 members in the outgoing house and despite support for it increasing by 12 percentage points compared to 2002 , the number of its seats will decline because more parties will be represented in parliament .

the right-wing nationalist action party -lrb- mhp -rrb- was third with 14.2 percent and 71 seats . no other party passed the 10-percent national threshold needed to enter parliament , but 28 independent candidates won seats , 24 of them kurds campaigning for broader rights for their sizeable community . populist policies with virtually no chance of actually winning government , the akp 's nearest rivals had campaigned on populist policies and waged a scare campaign that portrayed the government as being not only anti-secular but also of failing to adequately deal with rebels from the kurdish workers ' party , of whom around 3,500 are based in northern iraq . around 42.5 million people were eligible to vote in sunday 's election of 550 members of parliament .
ten people were injured in fighting at voting booths in the south-east , but in general voting was peaceful at 160,000 polling stations across the country .
erdogan was forced to call sunday 's election after a bungled attempt to place his right-hand man , foreign minister abdullah gül , in the presidential palace in ankara .
millions of people took to the streets to protest the prospect of gül becoming president .
they objected to gül 's past involvement in conservative islamist groups , the fact that his wife wears an islamic-style headscarf - no president 's wife in turkey has ever worn one - and also at the prospect of the akp controlling the government , the parliament and presidency .
the military stepped in in april effectively scuttling the presidential election process by declaring it would do whatever necessary to protect secularism . as soon as the new parliament opens , its first task will be to elect a new president . erdogan has said he will seek a compromise in the presidential election , but insists that the candidate must be from his party . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our democracy has successfully passed a test ...
our unity , democracy and the republic have emerged stronger from the ballot box , " erdogan said overnight outside akp headquarters as fireworks lit up the sky and hundreds of supporters cheered . the governing party , which has its roots in a now-banned islamist movement , won 46.3 percent of the vote , leading its closest rival by a wide margin , according to unofficial results after 99.9 percent of the ballots were counted . it was the largest support a turkish party has gained since the 1969 legislative election .

" after an initial scrutiny of the draft reform treaty we see that solutions proposed by ... the -lsb- eu -rsb- presidency are close to our expectations , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told a news conference after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
warsaw had initially insisted that groups of eu member states have the power to block contentious legislation for a two-year " period of scrutiny " but later dropped the demand .
" we will not insist on an initial requirement of two years , " fotyga said , adding that she still expected a period lasting a " reasonable time " to be incorporated in the final document .
eu observers have said that period of time would likely be a maximum of four months .
draft ready by october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel forged the compromise with her european counterparts in june portuguese foreign minister luis amado , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , welcomed the polish statements and said he expected a draft of the reform treaty to be hammered out and agreed to by october and ratified by mid-2009 .
" we should be able to have a new treaty as soon as possible , " said amado .
" we have a commitment from all ... to meet these requirements . "
the european commission president jose manuel barroso urged all eu states to show " loyal and active support " to the portuguese eu presidency , saying it was time the bloc stopped feuding over institutions and faced key challenges of today .
" we need to work quickly but carefully , " barroso said .
political debate still to come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amado said he expects the draft treaty to be ready for approval in october amado added that monday 's talks focused on technical aspects of the draft treaty and that its political dimensions would be debated later .
eu legal experts will open discussions on the treaty in brussels on tuesday and are set to meet regularly until the bloc 's summit in lisbon in october .
" i envisage the possibility of some level of political discussion but not at the moment , " he said .
" it is vital that the union should not allow itself to be paralysed once again on account of internal , institutional problems , so that is may respond to the real challenges that it must face . "
under german chancellor angela merkel 's leadership , eu members agreed in june to a deal that would streamline the bloc by giving more power to its foreign policy chief , electing a long-term eu president and instituting changes to the bloc 's voting system .
luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn predicted that the treaty details could be finalized at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in early september but warned : " the devil is in the detail . "
the new amended treaty will replace an eu draft constitution which was rejected by dutch and french voters two years ago , plunging the bloc into crisis .
eu governments are hoping the new rulebook will be ratified by their legislatures over the coming months and enter into force by summer 2009 , just ahead of elections to the european parliament . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 39th session of the un committee of the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women -lrb- cedaw -rrb- begins monday .
dw-world.de talked to an expert about victims of human trafficking . katrin adams is the executive officer of kok – a german ngo working to combat exploitation and support women trafficked to germany .
dw-world.de : what does your organization do to fight trafficking of women ?
katrin adams : we have two main areas that we concentrate on .
firstly , combating trafficking in women and secondly , combating violence against women in the process of migration .
we are a network of 37 member organizations – women ’ s organizations and counseling centers .
we are a specialist lobby in berlin and we lobby for improvement of the individual situations of the victims of human trafficking .
what does the un convention say on human trafficking ?
they have a specialized article , which is article 6 , which says that state parties shall take all appropriate measures , including legislation , to suppress all forms of trafficking of women and exploitation by prostitution of women .
how useful is the convention in practice ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a survivor of trafficking in moscow the convention is very useful in that it has a reporting system .
that means that governments have to report on their specific improvements on their work when it comes to the implementation of the standards set in the convention .
with regards article 6 it means that states have to tell you something and they have to summarize what they have done to reach these objectives set out in article 6 .
for us as an ngo it is a good opportunity for us to lobby for our demands because normally the committee accepts the shadow reports .
a shadow report is prepared by ngos in which they give addition information and comment on the government reports .
do you prepare shadow reports ?
we , the kok , normally comment very specifically on article 6 in a shadow report .
we would comment on the report submitted by germany .
we work at a very national level .
that means we concentrate on the situation of victims of human trafficking here in germany .
this year the government released its report , including a section on article 6 .
at the moment we are critically reviewing what they have said and we will definitely comment critically on what the government says .
why will you be critical of the german government ?
because there has been some legislation passed this year by parliament which will enter into force in autumn .
that special legislation has , in our opinion , some flaws when it comes to an adequate treatment of victims of human trafficking .
we think germany should do better .
what is the extent of trafficking in women to germany ?
unfortunately i can ’ t give you as a definite answer on that because we think the numbers that are known about are only a fraction of what is actually happening .
the numbers that are most reliable are those published by the federal criminal office .
the number of victims officially known about in 2005 was 642 .
but we are working on the basis that the actual number is much higher .
what sort of cases are these ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demanding education to rebuild women 's lives we have a lot very different cases .
there is no single procedure .
normally women are brought into germany and they have been deceived or threatened .
they are promised that they will get work in restaurants or bars and then they discover they have to work as prostitutes .
some women do come to germany knowing that they might be working as prostitutes and then find the work conditions are exploitative , which they wouldn ’ t have been aware of before they came .
when it comes to trafficking in human beings , there is also the issue of being forced into labor or marriage , that ’ s an issue that has not really been dealt with a lot .
where are these women mostly coming from ?
mostly from countries in eastern europe , although the numbers of women that are being forced into prostitution that are germans and being trafficked within germany is rising too .
when your organization and the un cedaw committee are critical of the german government , how much notice do they take ?
normally , what the committee does is adopt concluding comments , and as far as i know they are being taken seriously .
that means that the government tries to consider what the committee says and act accordingly .
in some cases it ’ s just political goodwill and nothing actually happens but in some cases the observations and concluding comments are quite useful and there is actually change in the political environment .
what sort of changes would you like to see the government implement to protect women who have been trafficked to germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kok also campaigns on violence against women what we would like to see is women who have been trafficked become entitled to permanent residency in germany .
at the moment the legal conditions are quite strict when it comes to getting residency .
secondly , coverage of basic needs including medical treatment and psychological help is often not provided .
we would like them to have a legal right to this basic coverage .
another important point is access to further education , especially language courses , so that women who decide to stay here once they have been released have an opportunity to build a normal life .
we are lobbying too for access to the labor market .
is it possible to prevent women being trafficked to germany ?
this is more the work of ngos in the countries of origin .
we are in contact with networks of ngos in these countries .
if there is a need and if we can help by supporting these ngos in that specific countries then we do what we can , but it ’ s not one of our main activities . emma wynne interviewed katrin adams send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 39th session of the un committee of the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women -lrb- cedaw -rrb- begins monday .
dw-world.de talked to an expert about victims of human trafficking . katrin adams is the executive officer of kok – a german ngo working to combat exploitation and support women trafficked to germany .
dw-world.de : what does your organization do to fight trafficking of women ?
katrin adams : we have two main areas that we concentrate on .
firstly , combating trafficking in women and secondly , combating violence against women in the process of migration .
we are a network of 37 member organizations – women ’ s organizations and counseling centers .
we are a specialist lobby in berlin and we lobby for improvement of the individual situations of the victims of human trafficking .
what does the un convention say on human trafficking ?
they have a specialized article , which is article 6 , which says that state parties shall take all appropriate measures , including legislation , to suppress all forms of trafficking of women and exploitation by prostitution of women .
how useful is the convention in practice ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a survivor of trafficking in moscow the convention is very useful in that it has a reporting system .
that means that governments have to report on their specific improvements on their work when it comes to the implementation of the standards set in the convention .
with regards article 6 it means that states have to tell you something and they have to summarize what they have done to reach these objectives set out in article 6 .
for us as an ngo it is a good opportunity for us to lobby for our demands because normally the committee accepts the shadow reports .
a shadow report is prepared by ngos in which they give addition information and comment on the government reports .
do you prepare shadow reports ?
we , the kok , normally comment very specifically on article 6 in a shadow report .
we would comment on the report submitted by germany .
we work at a very national level .
that means we concentrate on the situation of victims of human trafficking here in germany .
this year the government released its report , including a section on article 6 .
at the moment we are critically reviewing what they have said and we will definitely comment critically on what the government says .
why will you be critical of the german government ?
because there has been some legislation passed this year by parliament which will enter into force in autumn .
that special legislation has , in our opinion , some flaws when it comes to an adequate treatment of victims of human trafficking .
we think germany should do better .
what is the extent of trafficking in women to germany ?
unfortunately i can ’ t give you as a definite answer on that because we think the numbers that are known about are only a fraction of what is actually happening .
the numbers that are most reliable are those published by the federal criminal office .
the number of victims officially known about in 2005 was 642 .
but we are working on the basis that the actual number is much higher .
what sort of cases are these ?

the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said the german interior ministry knew about 14 islamists from germany who had been in pakistan or were still there .
it added that authorities were calculating that more individuals from germany would be trained in al qaeda-run terrorist camps .
" a new quality in threat to germany " the weekly said at least seven islamists from germany had been arrested in pakistan over the past months and that islamabad was likely in the next few weeks to deport the men .
" we must assume that those who have come back from pakistan are planning attacks , " august hanning , germany 's deputy interior minister , said in an interview with the paper .
" we need to do everything possible to find out who went to pakistan and was trained there . "
he added that " this is a new , specific threat and is a cause for concern .
there is a new quality in the threat to germany . "
hanning added there were several indications that al qaeda had germany and german installations abroad , such as embassies , in its sight .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble echoed the view , saying there was a threat that suicide bombers were now being sent to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble says germany faces a new , concrete threat " there are a lot of concrete indications right up to the past few days that show that germany has increasingly moved into the crosshairs of international terrorism , " schäuble said in an interview with the bz am sonntag newspaper .
last month schäuble said authorities needed to increase vigilance due to the possibility that militants might carry out suicide attacks on german soil .
in april the us embassy in berlin announced it was boosting security at its facilities in germany in response to what it described as an increased threat of terrorism .
berlin has also said it believed there may be similar training camps in afghanistan , where germany has more than 3,000 troops stationed as part of a nato peacekeeping force .
the taliban has threatened to step up attacks on german troops . merkel supports online searches schäuble recently sparked controversy over comments that germany should clarify under what conditions the constitution permits the state to target and kill terrorists .
the tough-talking schäuble also pressed for changes in laws to allow pre-emptive detention of suspected militants and said authorities should have the right to prevent people they deem dangerous from using the internet and mobile phones .
the proposals have been criticized for eroding civil liberties .
but on sunday , schäuble received backing from german chancellor angela merkel for creating a legal framework to allow online searches of personal computers of suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has supported online searches of computers of suspected terrorists " we must look the threats in the eye and take them seriously , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .
" the interior minister has the freedom to think what needs to be done in the face of totally new threats . "
the issue has for weeks been a focus of heated debate between schäuble and german justice minister brigitte zypries .
on monday , members of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- urged zypries to expand the existing catalogue of anti-terrorism measures to include penalizing training in terrorism camps and the distribution of bomb-making manuals . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said the german interior ministry knew about 14 islamists from germany who had been in pakistan or were still there .
it added that authorities were calculating that more individuals from germany would be trained in al qaeda-run terrorist camps .
" a new quality in threat to germany " the weekly said at least seven islamists from germany had been arrested in pakistan over the past months and that islamabad was likely in the next few weeks to deport the men .

hanning added there were several indications that al qaeda had germany and german installations abroad , such as embassies , in its sight .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble echoed the view , saying there was a threat that suicide bombers were now being sent to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble says germany faces a new , concrete threat " there are a lot of concrete indications right up to the past few days that show that germany has increasingly moved into the crosshairs of international terrorism , " schäuble said in an interview with the bz am sonntag newspaper .
last month schäuble said authorities needed to increase vigilance due to the possibility that militants might carry out suicide attacks on german soil .
in april the us embassy in berlin announced it was boosting security at its facilities in germany in response to what it described as an increased threat of terrorism .
berlin has also said it believed there may be similar training camps in afghanistan , where germany has more than 3,000 troops stationed as part of a nato peacekeeping force .
the taliban has threatened to step up attacks on german troops . merkel supports online searches schäuble recently sparked controversy over comments that germany should clarify under what conditions the constitution permits the state to target and kill terrorists .
the tough-talking schäuble also pressed for changes in laws to allow pre-emptive detention of suspected militants and said authorities should have the right to prevent people they deem dangerous from using the internet and mobile phones .
the proposals have been criticized for eroding civil liberties .
but on sunday , schäuble received backing from german chancellor angela merkel for creating a legal framework to allow online searches of personal computers of suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has supported online searches of computers of suspected terrorists " we must look the threats in the eye and take them seriously , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .
" the interior minister has the freedom to think what needs to be done in the face of totally new threats . "
the issue has for weeks been a focus of heated debate between schäuble and german justice minister brigitte zypries .
on monday , members of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- urged zypries to expand the existing catalogue of anti-terrorism measures to include penalizing training in terrorism camps and the distribution of bomb-making manuals . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 23.07.2007 germany 's steinmeier proposes troika solution for kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers under the un 's protectorate mandate have policed kosovo since 1999 an international troika of the european union , russia and the united states , should take charge of discussions on the final status of kosovo , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said monday . with time running out on a decision on the future of the serbian province , steinmeier said he wanted discussions on kosovo to be led by a small team rather than the six-nation contract group composed of the us , britain , germany , france , italy and russia .
" i favor the concept of an international troika , made up of the us , russia and eu , so with that we would have three international partners to negotiate with the serbs and the kosovars -lrb- ethnic albanians -rrb- , " steinmeier told reporters at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels .
he said that such a troika offered the " best chance " to secure a so far elusive deal on kosovo .
" i think that once russia and the united states sit at the table together , there will be a very real possibility that the kosovars and the serbs will start acting the way they should , " he said .
steinmeier 's proposal comes after russia last week threatened to veto yet another draft un security council resolution calling for supervised independence for kosovo .
steinmeier seeking alternative to contact group others , also seeking to avert a russian veto by putting preparations for the un resolution on hold , have said discussions on kosovo should be spearheaded by the contact group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier continues to push for supervised independence steinmeier said there was also a suggestion that un secretary-general ban ki-moon should appoint a new envoy to replace martti ahtisaari to mediate between serbs and kosovars .
however , the proposed troika discussions would continue to focus on ahtisaari 's plan for supervised independence for kosovo , steinmeier added .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn also said the eu wanted to move forward on the basis of ahtisaari 's recommendation that kosovo be granted " independence supervised by the international community . "
" if the contact group is going to have further negotiations we are of course ready to contribute to those , " rehn told reporters .
he warned that it is " essential that both parties including serbia take finally a constructive and realistic approach to these negotiations . "
eu officials , however , once again stated that if the troika proposal was rejected and the issue moved to the contact group , it would be a temporary solution and that the un security council would have the final say to the status of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia and kosovo came to the table - but agreed to nothing luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn also backed steinmeier 's proposal , saying it was important that serbs and kosovars came back to the negotiating table .
" if they are not able to talk together about their future , then others will take the decisions , " asselborn said .
steinmeier said he had discussed his troika proposal with ban , russian foreign minister sergi lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
" now that we all have to presume there will not be a security council resolution , i feel it is important that we do n't leave the ongoing process to its own devices , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister stated that stability in the western balkans was a key eu priority , adding , " the international community needs therefore to maintain its joint responsibility towards the region . "
eu 's credibility at stake over kosovo other eu foreign ministers at the brussels meeting emphasized that the eu 's credibility was on the line over the resolution of kosovo ’ s status .
" the stability of the balkans , the unity of the european union , the credibility of us versus the united states and russia is at stake , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt , a balkans expert within the eu , told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish balkan expert bildt sees kosovo as the eu 's problem bildt added that unity between the eu states over kosovo was " absolutely paramount " if the issue of kosovo was to move from the un security council to the international contact group .
british foreign secretary david miliband echoed bildt 's statement on eu unity .
" it 's probably important that we establish our own position and are clear about the need for strong european leadership and strong european unity in this area , " he said .
russian resistance scuppers un resolution the europeans and their us allies on friday postponed attempts to secure a security council resolution that would have granted kosovo " supervised independence , " in the face of a likely russian veto .
russia , a strong ally of serbia , had complained that recognizing an independent kosovo would send the wrong signal to other breakaway regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is being backed in its stance by its ally russia serbia has said such a move would be a breach of its national sovereignty but concedes it could give special autonomy to kosovo .
after talks with rice on monday , kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said the province would work with the united states and europe to coordinate its future and not unilaterally declare independence .
" for us it is critical that the process is coordinated and moves ahead in close cooperation with the international community , the us and the european union in the first place , " he told the afp news agency .
" of course , a formal announcement of independence will happen in due course , but in cooperation and in close partnership with the countries which are supportive of the kosovo independence . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when a nato campaign drove out serb forces after accusing them of committing atrocities against ethnic albanians .

" now that we all have to presume there will not be a security council resolution , i feel it is important that we do n't leave the ongoing process to its own devices , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister stated that stability in the western balkans was a key eu priority , adding , " the international community needs therefore to maintain its joint responsibility towards the region . "
eu 's credibility at stake over kosovo other eu foreign ministers at the brussels meeting emphasized that the eu 's credibility was on the line over the resolution of kosovo ’ s status .
" the stability of the balkans , the unity of the european union , the credibility of us versus the united states and russia is at stake , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt , a balkans expert within the eu , told reporters .

british foreign secretary david miliband echoed bildt 's statement on eu unity .
" it 's probably important that we establish our own position and are clear about the need for strong european leadership and strong european unity in this area , " he said .
russian resistance scuppers un resolution the europeans and their us allies on friday postponed attempts to secure a security council resolution that would have granted kosovo " supervised independence , " in the face of a likely russian veto .
russia , a strong ally of serbia , had complained that recognizing an independent kosovo would send the wrong signal to other breakaway regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is being backed in its stance by its ally russia serbia has said such a move would be a breach of its national sovereignty but concedes it could give special autonomy to kosovo .
after talks with rice on monday , kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said the province would work with the united states and europe to coordinate its future and not unilaterally declare independence .
" for us it is critical that the process is coordinated and moves ahead in close cooperation with the international community , the us and the european union in the first place , " he told the afp news agency .
" of course , a formal announcement of independence will happen in due course , but in cooperation and in close partnership with the countries which are supportive of the kosovo independence . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when a nato campaign drove out serb forces after accusing them of committing atrocities against ethnic albanians .
in april this year , ahtisaari proposed independence under the supervision of the eu after 13 months of serb-albanian talks ended in deadlock . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , a new exhibition has opened which tells the story of those who were incarcerated and who lost their lives there . a postcard in one of the first display rooms of the new museum reads : " greetings from flossenbürg . "
the friendly greeting is positioned under a picture of the historic castle ruins for which the small town on the german-czech border is still well known for .
in fact , while the postcard is from the 1920s , it could be from the present day .
what flossenbürg is less famous - or notorious - for is that it was the location for one of the nazis ' 12 largest concentration camps ; the camp where german theologian dietrich bonhoeffer died along with tens of thousands of other victims .
after the war , the camp and its history slowly slipped into oblivion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietrich bonhoeffer was one of the tens of thousands to be killed at flossenbürg but the new exhibition , which opened to the public on sunday , more than 60 years after the camp was liberated , aims to commemorate those who lost their lives at flossenbürg and its surrounding camps and return its role in the " final solution " to the modern history books .
after being liberated , the camp became the site of residential buildings and a toy factory moved into its empty warehouse .
only in the 1980s did a small exhibit about the camp first appear .
one of the main reasons it took so long for the camp to be remembered has much to do with the demographics of those who were imprisoned there .
" two thirds of the prisoners were eastern europeans , " said christian omonsky , the press coordinator of the flossenbürg exhibit , adding that the process of recounting the stories and compiling the evidence could only begin after the iron curtain fell and the former prisoners were able to visit the camp in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of its liberation .
since then - with the help of survivors , local people and historians - omonsky , museum director jörg skriebeleit and the rest of the museum 's staff have created a memorial for the concentration camp .
painstaking research to create memorial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family photos show lives about to be changed forever the exhibition is the result of four years of extensive research by skriebeleit and his team .
their research included hundreds of interviews with former prisoners to fill in the gaps of the camp 's history .
the work recreates an authentic snapshot of everyday life in the camp , one which not only shows the suffering of the prisoners but also the lives of those responsible for the suffering .
for example , photos of ss officers enjoying leisure time feature alongside pictures of emaciated inmates .
during world war ii , flossenbürg was an administrative center for 90 camps in bavaria , bohemia and saxony .
jews , sinti and roma were locked up in these camps along with political dissidents , prisoners of war , homosexuals and " professional criminals . "
in total , the camps held around16,000 women and 84,000 men .
in flossenbürg and its surrounding camps almost 30,000 prisoners died as a result of murder by ss officers , hard labor and accidents in the nearby stone quarry , frostbite or illnesses such as pneumonia and tuberculosis .
until recently , those who died were only numbers in a ledger .
" we would like to give these victims who had disappeared from the public consciousness for decades a human face , " said skriebeleit .
the central hall of the exhibition attempts to do just that with a selection of personal photographs from prisoners , taken before they were deported .
the images of families , holidays , young lovers , weddings and smiling youths give a clear indication of what was taken from these people when imprisioned within the confines of the camp .
ordinary lives swapped for horror and death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skriebeleit and a model of the war-time camp texts accompanying the photos explain the victims ' fates and artwork from survivors depict the horrors they may have experienced .
one drawing shows the execution of five prisoners in front of a christmas tree while the rest of the camp looks on .
while it has taken many years to bring flossenbürg out of the shadows of history , the survivors of the camp have visited regularly since they have been able to .
" for the survivors , returning always reminds us of the past , " said lisa mikova from prague .
" but we want to tell school children , for instance , about our history in the hope that we can warn them about the dangers of fascism . "
mikova was sent to the camp in 1942 because she was jewish .
her parents , her parents-in-law and a brother-in-law were killed in auschwitz .
she was sent to a camp in freiberg .
" there we had to work extremely hard in an airplane factory , for 12 hours a day , " mikova said .
" then we had to go through the town to get to the camp huts .
it was very cold , because we were dressed very poorly , without underwear and we only had clogs .
our heads were shaved bald .
and there was not a lot to eat - only a little bit of brown water that they called coffee as well as weak soup and a piece of bread . "
sunday 's opening attracted a number of prominent figures .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier attended along with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , whose father was a prisoner in flossenbürg .
charlotte knobloch of germany 's central council of jews , romani rose from the central council of the sinti and roma and israeli ambassador shimon stein were also there .
there were also 84 former prisoners among those viewing the exhibition , an experience that was difficult for many .
mikova , however , was one of those ready to face the past .
" of course there are things which remain with us , things that one can never forget or get over , " she said .

the 39th session of the un committee of the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women -lrb- cedaw -rrb- begins monday .
dw-world.de talked to an expert about victims of human trafficking . katrin adams is the executive officer of kok – a german ngo working to combat exploitation and support women trafficked to germany .
dw-world.de : what does your organization do to fight trafficking of women ?
katrin adams : we have two main areas that we concentrate on .
firstly , combating trafficking in women and secondly , combating violence against women in the process of migration .
we are a network of 37 member organizations – women ’ s organizations and counseling centers .
we are a specialist lobby in berlin and we lobby for improvement of the individual situations of the victims of human trafficking .
what does the un convention say on human trafficking ?
they have a specialized article , which is article 6 , which says that state parties shall take all appropriate measures , including legislation , to suppress all forms of trafficking of women and exploitation by prostitution of women .
how useful is the convention in practice ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a survivor of trafficking in moscow the convention is very useful in that it has a reporting system .
that means that governments have to report on their specific improvements on their work when it comes to the implementation of the standards set in the convention .
with regards article 6 it means that states have to tell you something and they have to summarize what they have done to reach these objectives set out in article 6 .
for us as an ngo it is a good opportunity for us to lobby for our demands because normally the committee accepts the shadow reports .
a shadow report is prepared by ngos in which they give addition information and comment on the government reports .
do you prepare shadow reports ?
we , the kok , normally comment very specifically on article 6 in a shadow report .
we would comment on the report submitted by germany .
we work at a very national level .
that means we concentrate on the situation of victims of human trafficking here in germany .
this year the government released its report , including a section on article 6 .
at the moment we are critically reviewing what they have said and we will definitely comment critically on what the government says .
why will you be critical of the german government ?
because there has been some legislation passed this year by parliament which will enter into force in autumn .
that special legislation has , in our opinion , some flaws when it comes to an adequate treatment of victims of human trafficking .
we think germany should do better .
what is the extent of trafficking in women to germany ?
unfortunately i can ’ t give you as a definite answer on that because we think the numbers that are known about are only a fraction of what is actually happening .
the numbers that are most reliable are those published by the federal criminal office .
the number of victims officially known about in 2005 was 642 .
but we are working on the basis that the actual number is much higher .
what sort of cases are these ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demanding education to rebuild women 's lives we have a lot very different cases .
there is no single procedure .
normally women are brought into germany and they have been deceived or threatened .
they are promised that they will get work in restaurants or bars and then they discover they have to work as prostitutes .
some women do come to germany knowing that they might be working as prostitutes and then find the work conditions are exploitative , which they wouldn ’ t have been aware of before they came .
when it comes to trafficking in human beings , there is also the issue of being forced into labor or marriage , that ’ s an issue that has not really been dealt with a lot .
where are these women mostly coming from ?
mostly from countries in eastern europe , although the numbers of women that are being forced into prostitution that are germans and being trafficked within germany is rising too .
when your organization and the un cedaw committee are critical of the german government , how much notice do they take ?
normally , what the committee does is adopt concluding comments , and as far as i know they are being taken seriously .
that means that the government tries to consider what the committee says and act accordingly .
in some cases it ’ s just political goodwill and nothing actually happens but in some cases the observations and concluding comments are quite useful and there is actually change in the political environment .
what sort of changes would you like to see the government implement to protect women who have been trafficked to germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kok also campaigns on violence against women what we would like to see is women who have been trafficked become entitled to permanent residency in germany .
at the moment the legal conditions are quite strict when it comes to getting residency .
secondly , coverage of basic needs including medical treatment and psychological help is often not provided .
we would like them to have a legal right to this basic coverage .
another important point is access to further education , especially language courses , so that women who decide to stay here once they have been released have an opportunity to build a normal life .
we are lobbying too for access to the labor market .
is it possible to prevent women being trafficked to germany ?
this is more the work of ngos in the countries of origin .
we are in contact with networks of ngos in these countries .
if there is a need and if we can help by supporting these ngos in that specific countries then we do what we can , but it ’ s not one of our main activities . emma wynne interviewed katrin adams send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our democracy has successfully passed a test ...
our unity , democracy and the republic have emerged stronger from the ballot box , " erdogan said overnight outside akp headquarters as fireworks lit up the sky and hundreds of supporters cheered . the governing party , which has its roots in a now-banned islamist movement , won 46.3 percent of the vote , leading its closest rival by a wide margin , according to unofficial results after 99.9 percent of the ballots were counted . it was the largest support a turkish party has gained since the 1969 legislative election .
a comfortable lead the support the akp garnered should translate into 339 seats in the 550-member parliament , enough for it to once again form a government on its own . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks voted sunday for a new parliament that will face a host of challenges the party had 352 members in the outgoing house and despite support for it increasing by 12 percentage points compared to 2002 , the number of its seats will decline because more parties will be represented in parliament . " we will pursue economic and democracy reforms with determination , " erdogan said , pledging also commitment to the secular system and turkey 's eu membership bid . the secularist main opposition republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- finished second with 20.9 percent of vote and an estimated 112 seats , according to unofficial results .
the right-wing nationalist action party -lrb- mhp -rrb- was third with 14.2 percent and 71 seats . no other party passed the 10-percent national threshold needed to enter parliament , but 28 independent candidates won seats , 24 of them kurds campaigning for broader rights for their sizeable community . populist policies with virtually no chance of actually winning government , the akp 's nearest rivals had campaigned on populist policies and waged a scare campaign that portrayed the government as being not only anti-secular but also of failing to adequately deal with rebels from the kurdish workers ' party , of whom around 3,500 are based in northern iraq . around 42.5 million people were eligible to vote in sunday 's election of 550 members of parliament .
ten people were injured in fighting at voting booths in the south-east , but in general voting was peaceful at 160,000 polling stations across the country .
erdogan was forced to call sunday 's election after a bungled attempt to place his right-hand man , foreign minister abdullah gül , in the presidential palace in ankara .
millions of people took to the streets to protest the prospect of gül becoming president .
they objected to gül 's past involvement in conservative islamist groups , the fact that his wife wears an islamic-style headscarf - no president 's wife in turkey has ever worn one - and also at the prospect of the akp controlling the government , the parliament and presidency .
the military stepped in in april effectively scuttling the presidential election process by declaring it would do whatever necessary to protect secularism . as soon as the new parliament opens , its first task will be to elect a new president . erdogan has said he will seek a compromise in the presidential election , but insists that the candidate must be from his party . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " we have more hope of success for the release of both the south koreans and the german , " he said .

that makes the sports utility vehicle , which weighs more than two tons , one of the worst emitters of carbon dioxide , a greenhouse gas that 's considered a prime contributor to global warming .
porsche said its decision to develop the hybrid motor - which combines an electric motor and battery with a standard combustion engine in order to cut fuel consumption - is a reaction to the raging debate on climate change in europe and rising concerns among consumers about the environmental friendliness of their cars .
" in particular , a premium carmaker such as porsche must offer competitive drivetrain solutions with low consumption- and emission levels , " the company said in a statement .
german carmakers trail in green technology the move comes as automakers and legislators across europe tighten the screws on co2 emissions amid mounting qualms about the environment .
in february this year , german carmakers were hit by new emission limits - 130 grams -lrb- 1.038 ounces -rrb- of co2 per kilometer to be met by 2012 - proposed by the european commission .
only six german-made models within the bloc currently meet those requirements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche hopes to launch the hybrid drivetrain by 2009 though german carmakers rank among the best in the world , they are widely seen to have been slow in waking up to reality and developing an alternative to the fossil-fuel engine .
japanese carmaker toyota is considered the world leader in hybrid technology .
porsche , which is working together with audi and volkswagen on the project , said it plans to unveil its hybrid powertrain in 2009 .
the technology which combines an electric motor with a combustion engine is also slated to be used for porsche 's planned four-door sporting premium model , panamera . article based on wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " we have more hope of success for the release of both the south koreans and the german , " he said .

the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said the german interior ministry knew about 14 islamists from germany who had been in pakistan or were still there .
it added that authorities were calculating that more individuals from germany would be trained in al qaeda-run terrorist camps .
" a new quality in threat to germany " the weekly said at least seven islamists from germany had been arrested in pakistan over the past months and that islamabad was likely in the next few weeks to deport the men .
" we must assume that those who have come back from pakistan are planning attacks , " august hanning , germany 's deputy interior minister , said in an interview with the paper .
" we need to do everything possible to find out who went to pakistan and was trained there . "
he added that " this is a new , specific threat and is a cause for concern .

the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said the german interior ministry knew about 14 islamists from germany who had been in pakistan or were still there .
it added that authorities were calculating that more individuals from germany would be trained in al qaeda-run terrorist camps .
" a new quality in threat to germany " the weekly said at least seven islamists from germany had been arrested in pakistan over the past months and that islamabad was likely in the next few weeks to deport the men .
" we must assume that those who have come back from pakistan are planning attacks , " august hanning , germany 's deputy interior minister , said in an interview with the paper .
" we need to do everything possible to find out who went to pakistan and was trained there . "
he added that " this is a new , specific threat and is a cause for concern .
there is a new quality in the threat to germany . "
hanning added there were several indications that al qaeda had germany and german installations abroad , such as embassies , in its sight .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble echoed the view , saying there was a threat that suicide bombers were now being sent to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble says germany faces a new , concrete threat " there are a lot of concrete indications right up to the past few days that show that germany has increasingly moved into the crosshairs of international terrorism , " schäuble said in an interview with the bz am sonntag newspaper .
last month schäuble said authorities needed to increase vigilance due to the possibility that militants might carry out suicide attacks on german soil .
in april the us embassy in berlin announced it was boosting security at its facilities in germany in response to what it described as an increased threat of terrorism .
berlin has also said it believed there may be similar training camps in afghanistan , where germany has more than 3,000 troops stationed as part of a nato peacekeeping force .
the taliban has threatened to step up attacks on german troops . merkel supports online searches schäuble recently sparked controversy over comments that germany should clarify under what conditions the constitution permits the state to target and kill terrorists .
the tough-talking schäuble also pressed for changes in laws to allow pre-emptive detention of suspected militants and said authorities should have the right to prevent people they deem dangerous from using the internet and mobile phones .
the proposals have been criticized for eroding civil liberties .
but on sunday , schäuble received backing from german chancellor angela merkel for creating a legal framework to allow online searches of personal computers of suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has supported online searches of computers of suspected terrorists " we must look the threats in the eye and take them seriously , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .
" the interior minister has the freedom to think what needs to be done in the face of totally new threats . "
the issue has for weeks been a focus of heated debate between schäuble and german justice minister brigitte zypries .
on monday , members of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- urged zypries to expand the existing catalogue of anti-terrorism measures to include penalizing training in terrorism camps and the distribution of bomb-making manuals . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i favor the concept of an international troika , made up of the us , russia and eu , so with that we would have three international partners to negotiate with the serbs and the kosovars -lrb- ethnic albanians -rrb- , " steinmeier told reporters at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels .
he said that such a troika offered the " best chance " to secure a so far elusive deal on kosovo .
" i think that once russia and the united states sit at the table together , there will be a very real possibility that the kosovars and the serbs will start acting the way they should , " he said .
steinmeier 's proposal comes after russia last week threatened to veto yet another draft un security council resolution calling for supervised independence for kosovo .
steinmeier seeking alternative to contact group others , also seeking to avert a russian veto by putting preparations for the un resolution on hold , have said discussions on kosovo should be spearheaded by the contact group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier continues to push for supervised independence steinmeier said there was also a suggestion that un secretary-general ban ki-moon should appoint a new envoy to replace martti ahtisaari to mediate between serbs and kosovars .
however , the proposed troika discussions would continue to focus on ahtisaari 's plan for supervised independence for kosovo , steinmeier added .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn also said the eu wanted to move forward on the basis of ahtisaari 's recommendation that kosovo be granted " independence supervised by the international community . "
" if the contact group is going to have further negotiations we are of course ready to contribute to those , " rehn told reporters .
he warned that it is " essential that both parties including serbia take finally a constructive and realistic approach to these negotiations . "
eu officials , however , once again stated that if the troika proposal was rejected and the issue moved to the contact group , it would be a temporary solution and that the un security council would have the final say to the status of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia and kosovo came to the table - but agreed to nothing luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn also backed steinmeier 's proposal , saying it was important that serbs and kosovars came back to the negotiating table .
" if they are not able to talk together about their future , then others will take the decisions , " asselborn said .
steinmeier said he had discussed his troika proposal with ban , russian foreign minister sergi lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
" now that we all have to presume there will not be a security council resolution , i feel it is important that we do n't leave the ongoing process to its own devices , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister stated that stability in the western balkans was a key eu priority , adding , " the international community needs therefore to maintain its joint responsibility towards the region . "
eu 's credibility at stake over kosovo other eu foreign ministers at the brussels meeting emphasized that the eu 's credibility was on the line over the resolution of kosovo ’ s status .
" the stability of the balkans , the unity of the european union , the credibility of us versus the united states and russia is at stake , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt , a balkans expert within the eu , told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish balkan expert bildt sees kosovo as the eu 's problem bildt added that unity between the eu states over kosovo was " absolutely paramount " if the issue of kosovo was to move from the un security council to the international contact group .
british foreign secretary david miliband echoed bildt 's statement on eu unity .
" it 's probably important that we establish our own position and are clear about the need for strong european leadership and strong european unity in this area , " he said .
russian resistance scuppers un resolution the europeans and their us allies on friday postponed attempts to secure a security council resolution that would have granted kosovo " supervised independence , " in the face of a likely russian veto .
russia , a strong ally of serbia , had complained that recognizing an independent kosovo would send the wrong signal to other breakaway regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is being backed in its stance by its ally russia serbia has said such a move would be a breach of its national sovereignty but concedes it could give special autonomy to kosovo .
after talks with rice on monday , kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said the province would work with the united states and europe to coordinate its future and not unilaterally declare independence .
" for us it is critical that the process is coordinated and moves ahead in close cooperation with the international community , the us and the european union in the first place , " he told the afp news agency .
" of course , a formal announcement of independence will happen in due course , but in cooperation and in close partnership with the countries which are supportive of the kosovo independence . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when a nato campaign drove out serb forces after accusing them of committing atrocities against ethnic albanians .

" i favor the concept of an international troika , made up of the us , russia and eu , so with that we would have three international partners to negotiate with the serbs and the kosovars -lrb- ethnic albanians -rrb- , " steinmeier told reporters at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels .
he said that such a troika offered the " best chance " to secure a so far elusive deal on kosovo .
" i think that once russia and the united states sit at the table together , there will be a very real possibility that the kosovars and the serbs will start acting the way they should , " he said .
steinmeier 's proposal comes after russia last week threatened to veto yet another draft un security council resolution calling for supervised independence for kosovo .
steinmeier seeking alternative to contact group others , also seeking to avert a russian veto by putting preparations for the un resolution on hold , have said discussions on kosovo should be spearheaded by the contact group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier continues to push for supervised independence steinmeier said there was also a suggestion that un secretary-general ban ki-moon should appoint a new envoy to replace martti ahtisaari to mediate between serbs and kosovars .
however , the proposed troika discussions would continue to focus on ahtisaari 's plan for supervised independence for kosovo , steinmeier added .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn also said the eu wanted to move forward on the basis of ahtisaari 's recommendation that kosovo be granted " independence supervised by the international community . "
" if the contact group is going to have further negotiations we are of course ready to contribute to those , " rehn told reporters .
he warned that it is " essential that both parties including serbia take finally a constructive and realistic approach to these negotiations . "
eu officials , however , once again stated that if the troika proposal was rejected and the issue moved to the contact group , it would be a temporary solution and that the un security council would have the final say to the status of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia and kosovo came to the table - but agreed to nothing luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn also backed steinmeier 's proposal , saying it was important that serbs and kosovars came back to the negotiating table .
" if they are not able to talk together about their future , then others will take the decisions , " asselborn said .
steinmeier said he had discussed his troika proposal with ban , russian foreign minister sergi lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice .

that makes the sports utility vehicle , which weighs more than two tons , one of the worst emitters of carbon dioxide , a greenhouse gas that 's considered a prime contributor to global warming .
porsche said its decision to develop the hybrid motor - which combines an electric motor and battery with a standard combustion engine in order to cut fuel consumption - is a reaction to the raging debate on climate change in europe and rising concerns among consumers about the environmental friendliness of their cars .
" in particular , a premium carmaker such as porsche must offer competitive drivetrain solutions with low consumption- and emission levels , " the company said in a statement .
german carmakers trail in green technology the move comes as automakers and legislators across europe tighten the screws on co2 emissions amid mounting qualms about the environment .
in february this year , german carmakers were hit by new emission limits - 130 grams -lrb- 1.038 ounces -rrb- of co2 per kilometer to be met by 2012 - proposed by the european commission .
only six german-made models within the bloc currently meet those requirements .

japanese carmaker toyota is considered the world leader in hybrid technology .
porsche , which is working together with audi and volkswagen on the project , said it plans to unveil its hybrid powertrain in 2009 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 23.07.2007 expert : germany can do more for victims of human trafficking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany meeting its un obligations to women ?
the 39th session of the un committee of the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women -lrb- cedaw -rrb- begins monday .
dw-world.de talked to an expert about victims of human trafficking . katrin adams is the executive officer of kok – a german ngo working to combat exploitation and support women trafficked to germany .
dw-world.de : what does your organization do to fight trafficking of women ?
katrin adams : we have two main areas that we concentrate on .
firstly , combating trafficking in women and secondly , combating violence against women in the process of migration .
we are a network of 37 member organizations – women ’ s organizations and counseling centers .
we are a specialist lobby in berlin and we lobby for improvement of the individual situations of the victims of human trafficking .
what does the un convention say on human trafficking ?
they have a specialized article , which is article 6 , which says that state parties shall take all appropriate measures , including legislation , to suppress all forms of trafficking of women and exploitation by prostitution of women .
how useful is the convention in practice ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a survivor of trafficking in moscow the convention is very useful in that it has a reporting system .
that means that governments have to report on their specific improvements on their work when it comes to the implementation of the standards set in the convention .
with regards article 6 it means that states have to tell you something and they have to summarize what they have done to reach these objectives set out in article 6 .
for us as an ngo it is a good opportunity for us to lobby for our demands because normally the committee accepts the shadow reports .
a shadow report is prepared by ngos in which they give addition information and comment on the government reports .
do you prepare shadow reports ?
we , the kok , normally comment very specifically on article 6 in a shadow report .
we would comment on the report submitted by germany .
we work at a very national level .
that means we concentrate on the situation of victims of human trafficking here in germany .
this year the government released its report , including a section on article 6 .
at the moment we are critically reviewing what they have said and we will definitely comment critically on what the government says .
why will you be critical of the german government ?
because there has been some legislation passed this year by parliament which will enter into force in autumn .
that special legislation has , in our opinion , some flaws when it comes to an adequate treatment of victims of human trafficking .
we think germany should do better .
what is the extent of trafficking in women to germany ?
unfortunately i can ’ t give you as a definite answer on that because we think the numbers that are known about are only a fraction of what is actually happening .
the numbers that are most reliable are those published by the federal criminal office .
the number of victims officially known about in 2005 was 642 .
but we are working on the basis that the actual number is much higher .
what sort of cases are these ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demanding education to rebuild women 's lives we have a lot very different cases .
there is no single procedure .
normally women are brought into germany and they have been deceived or threatened .
they are promised that they will get work in restaurants or bars and then they discover they have to work as prostitutes .
some women do come to germany knowing that they might be working as prostitutes and then find the work conditions are exploitative , which they wouldn ’ t have been aware of before they came .
when it comes to trafficking in human beings , there is also the issue of being forced into labor or marriage , that ’ s an issue that has not really been dealt with a lot .
where are these women mostly coming from ?
mostly from countries in eastern europe , although the numbers of women that are being forced into prostitution that are germans and being trafficked within germany is rising too .
when your organization and the un cedaw committee are critical of the german government , how much notice do they take ?
normally , what the committee does is adopt concluding comments , and as far as i know they are being taken seriously .
that means that the government tries to consider what the committee says and act accordingly .
in some cases it ’ s just political goodwill and nothing actually happens but in some cases the observations and concluding comments are quite useful and there is actually change in the political environment .
what sort of changes would you like to see the government implement to protect women who have been trafficked to germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kok also campaigns on violence against women what we would like to see is women who have been trafficked become entitled to permanent residency in germany .
at the moment the legal conditions are quite strict when it comes to getting residency .
secondly , coverage of basic needs including medical treatment and psychological help is often not provided .
we would like them to have a legal right to this basic coverage .
another important point is access to further education , especially language courses , so that women who decide to stay here once they have been released have an opportunity to build a normal life .
we are lobbying too for access to the labor market .
is it possible to prevent women being trafficked to germany ?
this is more the work of ngos in the countries of origin .
we are in contact with networks of ngos in these countries .
if there is a need and if we can help by supporting these ngos in that specific countries then we do what we can , but it ’ s not one of our main activities . emma wynne interviewed katrin adams send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i favor the concept of an international troika , made up of the us , russia and eu , so with that we would have three international partners to negotiate with the serbs and the kosovars -lrb- ethnic albanians -rrb- , " steinmeier told reporters at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels .
he said that such a troika offered the " best chance " to secure a so far elusive deal on kosovo .
" i think that once russia and the united states sit at the table together , there will be a very real possibility that the kosovars and the serbs will start acting the way they should , " he said .
steinmeier 's proposal comes after russia last week threatened to veto yet another draft un security council resolution calling for supervised independence for kosovo .
steinmeier seeking alternative to contact group others , also seeking to avert a russian veto by putting preparations for the un resolution on hold , have said discussions on kosovo should be spearheaded by the contact group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier continues to push for supervised independence steinmeier said there was also a suggestion that un secretary-general ban ki-moon should appoint a new envoy to replace martti ahtisaari to mediate between serbs and kosovars .
however , the proposed troika discussions would continue to focus on ahtisaari 's plan for supervised independence for kosovo , steinmeier added .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn also said the eu wanted to move forward on the basis of ahtisaari 's recommendation that kosovo be granted " independence supervised by the international community . "
" if the contact group is going to have further negotiations we are of course ready to contribute to those , " rehn told reporters .
he warned that it is " essential that both parties including serbia take finally a constructive and realistic approach to these negotiations . "
eu officials , however , once again stated that if the troika proposal was rejected and the issue moved to the contact group , it would be a temporary solution and that the un security council would have the final say to the status of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia and kosovo came to the table - but agreed to nothing luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn also backed steinmeier 's proposal , saying it was important that serbs and kosovars came back to the negotiating table .
" if they are not able to talk together about their future , then others will take the decisions , " asselborn said .
steinmeier said he had discussed his troika proposal with ban , russian foreign minister sergi lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
" now that we all have to presume there will not be a security council resolution , i feel it is important that we do n't leave the ongoing process to its own devices , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister stated that stability in the western balkans was a key eu priority , adding , " the international community needs therefore to maintain its joint responsibility towards the region . "
eu 's credibility at stake over kosovo other eu foreign ministers at the brussels meeting emphasized that the eu 's credibility was on the line over the resolution of kosovo ’ s status .
" the stability of the balkans , the unity of the european union , the credibility of us versus the united states and russia is at stake , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt , a balkans expert within the eu , told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish balkan expert bildt sees kosovo as the eu 's problem bildt added that unity between the eu states over kosovo was " absolutely paramount " if the issue of kosovo was to move from the un security council to the international contact group .
british foreign secretary david miliband echoed bildt 's statement on eu unity .
" it 's probably important that we establish our own position and are clear about the need for strong european leadership and strong european unity in this area , " he said .
russian resistance scuppers un resolution the europeans and their us allies on friday postponed attempts to secure a security council resolution that would have granted kosovo " supervised independence , " in the face of a likely russian veto .
russia , a strong ally of serbia , had complained that recognizing an independent kosovo would send the wrong signal to other breakaway regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is being backed in its stance by its ally russia serbia has said such a move would be a breach of its national sovereignty but concedes it could give special autonomy to kosovo .
after talks with rice on monday , kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said the province would work with the united states and europe to coordinate its future and not unilaterally declare independence .
" for us it is critical that the process is coordinated and moves ahead in close cooperation with the international community , the us and the european union in the first place , " he told the afp news agency .
" of course , a formal announcement of independence will happen in due course , but in cooperation and in close partnership with the countries which are supportive of the kosovo independence . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when a nato campaign drove out serb forces after accusing them of committing atrocities against ethnic albanians .
in april this year , ahtisaari proposed independence under the supervision of the eu after 13 months of serb-albanian talks ended in deadlock . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said the german interior ministry knew about 14 islamists from germany who had been in pakistan or were still there .
it added that authorities were calculating that more individuals from germany would be trained in al qaeda-run terrorist camps .
" a new quality in threat to germany " the weekly said at least seven islamists from germany had been arrested in pakistan over the past months and that islamabad was likely in the next few weeks to deport the men .
" we must assume that those who have come back from pakistan are planning attacks , " august hanning , germany 's deputy interior minister , said in an interview with the paper .
" we need to do everything possible to find out who went to pakistan and was trained there . "
he added that " this is a new , specific threat and is a cause for concern .
there is a new quality in the threat to germany . "
hanning added there were several indications that al qaeda had germany and german installations abroad , such as embassies , in its sight .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble echoed the view , saying there was a threat that suicide bombers were now being sent to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble says germany faces a new , concrete threat " there are a lot of concrete indications right up to the past few days that show that germany has increasingly moved into the crosshairs of international terrorism , " schäuble said in an interview with the bz am sonntag newspaper .
last month schäuble said authorities needed to increase vigilance due to the possibility that militants might carry out suicide attacks on german soil .
in april the us embassy in berlin announced it was boosting security at its facilities in germany in response to what it described as an increased threat of terrorism .
berlin has also said it believed there may be similar training camps in afghanistan , where germany has more than 3,000 troops stationed as part of a nato peacekeeping force .
the taliban has threatened to step up attacks on german troops . merkel supports online searches schäuble recently sparked controversy over comments that germany should clarify under what conditions the constitution permits the state to target and kill terrorists .
the tough-talking schäuble also pressed for changes in laws to allow pre-emptive detention of suspected militants and said authorities should have the right to prevent people they deem dangerous from using the internet and mobile phones .
the proposals have been criticized for eroding civil liberties .
but on sunday , schäuble received backing from german chancellor angela merkel for creating a legal framework to allow online searches of personal computers of suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has supported online searches of computers of suspected terrorists " we must look the threats in the eye and take them seriously , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .
" the interior minister has the freedom to think what needs to be done in the face of totally new threats . "
the issue has for weeks been a focus of heated debate between schäuble and german justice minister brigitte zypries .
on monday , members of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- urged zypries to expand the existing catalogue of anti-terrorism measures to include penalizing training in terrorism camps and the distribution of bomb-making manuals . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that makes the sports utility vehicle , which weighs more than two tons , one of the worst emitters of carbon dioxide , a greenhouse gas that 's considered a prime contributor to global warming .
porsche said its decision to develop the hybrid motor - which combines an electric motor and battery with a standard combustion engine in order to cut fuel consumption - is a reaction to the raging debate on climate change in europe and rising concerns among consumers about the environmental friendliness of their cars .
" in particular , a premium carmaker such as porsche must offer competitive drivetrain solutions with low consumption- and emission levels , " the company said in a statement .
german carmakers trail in green technology the move comes as automakers and legislators across europe tighten the screws on co2 emissions amid mounting qualms about the environment .
in february this year , german carmakers were hit by new emission limits - 130 grams -lrb- 1.038 ounces -rrb- of co2 per kilometer to be met by 2012 - proposed by the european commission .
only six german-made models within the bloc currently meet those requirements .

japanese carmaker toyota is considered the world leader in hybrid technology .
porsche , which is working together with audi and volkswagen on the project , said it plans to unveil its hybrid powertrain in 2009 .

now , a new exhibition has opened which tells the story of those who were incarcerated and who lost their lives there . a postcard in one of the first display rooms of the new museum reads : " greetings from flossenbürg . "
the friendly greeting is positioned under a picture of the historic castle ruins for which the small town on the german-czech border is still well known for .
in fact , while the postcard is from the 1920s , it could be from the present day .
what flossenbürg is less famous - or notorious - for is that it was the location for one of the nazis ' 12 largest concentration camps ; the camp where german theologian dietrich bonhoeffer died along with tens of thousands of other victims .
after the war , the camp and its history slowly slipped into oblivion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietrich bonhoeffer was one of the tens of thousands to be killed at flossenbürg but the new exhibition , which opened to the public on sunday , more than 60 years after the camp was liberated , aims to commemorate those who lost their lives at flossenbürg and its surrounding camps and return its role in the " final solution " to the modern history books .
after being liberated , the camp became the site of residential buildings and a toy factory moved into its empty warehouse .
only in the 1980s did a small exhibit about the camp first appear .
one of the main reasons it took so long for the camp to be remembered has much to do with the demographics of those who were imprisoned there .
" two thirds of the prisoners were eastern europeans , " said christian omonsky , the press coordinator of the flossenbürg exhibit , adding that the process of recounting the stories and compiling the evidence could only begin after the iron curtain fell and the former prisoners were able to visit the camp in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of its liberation .
since then - with the help of survivors , local people and historians - omonsky , museum director jörg skriebeleit and the rest of the museum 's staff have created a memorial for the concentration camp .
painstaking research to create memorial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family photos show lives about to be changed forever the exhibition is the result of four years of extensive research by skriebeleit and his team .
their research included hundreds of interviews with former prisoners to fill in the gaps of the camp 's history .
the work recreates an authentic snapshot of everyday life in the camp , one which not only shows the suffering of the prisoners but also the lives of those responsible for the suffering .
for example , photos of ss officers enjoying leisure time feature alongside pictures of emaciated inmates .
during world war ii , flossenbürg was an administrative center for 90 camps in bavaria , bohemia and saxony .
jews , sinti and roma were locked up in these camps along with political dissidents , prisoners of war , homosexuals and " professional criminals . "
in total , the camps held around16,000 women and 84,000 men .
in flossenbürg and its surrounding camps almost 30,000 prisoners died as a result of murder by ss officers , hard labor and accidents in the nearby stone quarry , frostbite or illnesses such as pneumonia and tuberculosis .
until recently , those who died were only numbers in a ledger .
" we would like to give these victims who had disappeared from the public consciousness for decades a human face , " said skriebeleit .
the central hall of the exhibition attempts to do just that with a selection of personal photographs from prisoners , taken before they were deported .
the images of families , holidays , young lovers , weddings and smiling youths give a clear indication of what was taken from these people when imprisioned within the confines of the camp .
ordinary lives swapped for horror and death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skriebeleit and a model of the war-time camp texts accompanying the photos explain the victims ' fates and artwork from survivors depict the horrors they may have experienced .
one drawing shows the execution of five prisoners in front of a christmas tree while the rest of the camp looks on .
while it has taken many years to bring flossenbürg out of the shadows of history , the survivors of the camp have visited regularly since they have been able to .
" for the survivors , returning always reminds us of the past , " said lisa mikova from prague .
" but we want to tell school children , for instance , about our history in the hope that we can warn them about the dangers of fascism . "
mikova was sent to the camp in 1942 because she was jewish .
her parents , her parents-in-law and a brother-in-law were killed in auschwitz .
she was sent to a camp in freiberg .
" there we had to work extremely hard in an airplane factory , for 12 hours a day , " mikova said .
" then we had to go through the town to get to the camp huts .
it was very cold , because we were dressed very poorly , without underwear and we only had clogs .
our heads were shaved bald .
and there was not a lot to eat - only a little bit of brown water that they called coffee as well as weak soup and a piece of bread . "
sunday 's opening attracted a number of prominent figures .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier attended along with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , whose father was a prisoner in flossenbürg .
charlotte knobloch of germany 's central council of jews , romani rose from the central council of the sinti and roma and israeli ambassador shimon stein were also there .
there were also 84 former prisoners among those viewing the exhibition , an experience that was difficult for many .
mikova , however , was one of those ready to face the past .
" of course there are things which remain with us , things that one can never forget or get over , " she said .

now , a new exhibition has opened which tells the story of those who were incarcerated and who lost their lives there . a postcard in one of the first display rooms of the new museum reads : " greetings from flossenbürg . "
the friendly greeting is positioned under a picture of the historic castle ruins for which the small town on the german-czech border is still well known for .
in fact , while the postcard is from the 1920s , it could be from the present day .
what flossenbürg is less famous - or notorious - for is that it was the location for one of the nazis ' 12 largest concentration camps ; the camp where german theologian dietrich bonhoeffer died along with tens of thousands of other victims .
after the war , the camp and its history slowly slipped into oblivion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietrich bonhoeffer was one of the tens of thousands to be killed at flossenbürg but the new exhibition , which opened to the public on sunday , more than 60 years after the camp was liberated , aims to commemorate those who lost their lives at flossenbürg and its surrounding camps and return its role in the " final solution " to the modern history books .
after being liberated , the camp became the site of residential buildings and a toy factory moved into its empty warehouse .
only in the 1980s did a small exhibit about the camp first appear .
one of the main reasons it took so long for the camp to be remembered has much to do with the demographics of those who were imprisoned there .
" two thirds of the prisoners were eastern europeans , " said christian omonsky , the press coordinator of the flossenbürg exhibit , adding that the process of recounting the stories and compiling the evidence could only begin after the iron curtain fell and the former prisoners were able to visit the camp in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of its liberation .
since then - with the help of survivors , local people and historians - omonsky , museum director jörg skriebeleit and the rest of the museum 's staff have created a memorial for the concentration camp .
painstaking research to create memorial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family photos show lives about to be changed forever the exhibition is the result of four years of extensive research by skriebeleit and his team .
their research included hundreds of interviews with former prisoners to fill in the gaps of the camp 's history .
the work recreates an authentic snapshot of everyday life in the camp , one which not only shows the suffering of the prisoners but also the lives of those responsible for the suffering .
for example , photos of ss officers enjoying leisure time feature alongside pictures of emaciated inmates .
during world war ii , flossenbürg was an administrative center for 90 camps in bavaria , bohemia and saxony .
jews , sinti and roma were locked up in these camps along with political dissidents , prisoners of war , homosexuals and " professional criminals . "
in total , the camps held around16,000 women and 84,000 men .
in flossenbürg and its surrounding camps almost 30,000 prisoners died as a result of murder by ss officers , hard labor and accidents in the nearby stone quarry , frostbite or illnesses such as pneumonia and tuberculosis .
until recently , those who died were only numbers in a ledger .
" we would like to give these victims who had disappeared from the public consciousness for decades a human face , " said skriebeleit .
the central hall of the exhibition attempts to do just that with a selection of personal photographs from prisoners , taken before they were deported .
the images of families , holidays , young lovers , weddings and smiling youths give a clear indication of what was taken from these people when imprisioned within the confines of the camp .
ordinary lives swapped for horror and death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skriebeleit and a model of the war-time camp texts accompanying the photos explain the victims ' fates and artwork from survivors depict the horrors they may have experienced .
one drawing shows the execution of five prisoners in front of a christmas tree while the rest of the camp looks on .
while it has taken many years to bring flossenbürg out of the shadows of history , the survivors of the camp have visited regularly since they have been able to .
" for the survivors , returning always reminds us of the past , " said lisa mikova from prague .
" but we want to tell school children , for instance , about our history in the hope that we can warn them about the dangers of fascism . "
mikova was sent to the camp in 1942 because she was jewish .
her parents , her parents-in-law and a brother-in-law were killed in auschwitz .
she was sent to a camp in freiberg .
" there we had to work extremely hard in an airplane factory , for 12 hours a day , " mikova said .
" then we had to go through the town to get to the camp huts .
it was very cold , because we were dressed very poorly , without underwear and we only had clogs .
our heads were shaved bald .
and there was not a lot to eat - only a little bit of brown water that they called coffee as well as weak soup and a piece of bread . "
sunday 's opening attracted a number of prominent figures .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier attended along with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , whose father was a prisoner in flossenbürg .
charlotte knobloch of germany 's central council of jews , romani rose from the central council of the sinti and roma and israeli ambassador shimon stein were also there .
there were also 84 former prisoners among those viewing the exhibition , an experience that was difficult for many .
mikova , however , was one of those ready to face the past .
" of course there are things which remain with us , things that one can never forget or get over , " she said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietrich bonhoeffer was one of the tens of thousands to be killed at flossenbürg but the new exhibition , which opened to the public on sunday , more than 60 years after the camp was liberated , aims to commemorate those who lost their lives at flossenbürg and its surrounding camps and return its role in the " final solution " to the modern history books .
after being liberated , the camp became the site of residential buildings and a toy factory moved into its empty warehouse .
only in the 1980s did a small exhibit about the camp first appear .
one of the main reasons it took so long for the camp to be remembered has much to do with the demographics of those who were imprisoned there .
" two thirds of the prisoners were eastern europeans , " said christian omonsky , the press coordinator of the flossenbürg exhibit , adding that the process of recounting the stories and compiling the evidence could only begin after the iron curtain fell and the former prisoners were able to visit the camp in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of its liberation .
since then - with the help of survivors , local people and historians - omonsky , museum director jörg skriebeleit and the rest of the museum 's staff have created a memorial for the concentration camp .
painstaking research to create memorial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family photos show lives about to be changed forever the exhibition is the result of four years of extensive research by skriebeleit and his team .
their research included hundreds of interviews with former prisoners to fill in the gaps of the camp 's history .
the work recreates an authentic snapshot of everyday life in the camp , one which not only shows the suffering of the prisoners but also the lives of those responsible for the suffering .
for example , photos of ss officers enjoying leisure time feature alongside pictures of emaciated inmates .
during world war ii , flossenbürg was an administrative center for 90 camps in bavaria , bohemia and saxony .
jews , sinti and roma were locked up in these camps along with political dissidents , prisoners of war , homosexuals and " professional criminals . "
in total , the camps held around16,000 women and 84,000 men .
in flossenbürg and its surrounding camps almost 30,000 prisoners died as a result of murder by ss officers , hard labor and accidents in the nearby stone quarry , frostbite or illnesses such as pneumonia and tuberculosis .
until recently , those who died were only numbers in a ledger .
" we would like to give these victims who had disappeared from the public consciousness for decades a human face , " said skriebeleit .
the central hall of the exhibition attempts to do just that with a selection of personal photographs from prisoners , taken before they were deported .
the images of families , holidays , young lovers , weddings and smiling youths give a clear indication of what was taken from these people when imprisioned within the confines of the camp .
ordinary lives swapped for horror and death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skriebeleit and a model of the war-time camp texts accompanying the photos explain the victims ' fates and artwork from survivors depict the horrors they may have experienced .
one drawing shows the execution of five prisoners in front of a christmas tree while the rest of the camp looks on .
while it has taken many years to bring flossenbürg out of the shadows of history , the survivors of the camp have visited regularly since they have been able to .
" for the survivors , returning always reminds us of the past , " said lisa mikova from prague .
" but we want to tell school children , for instance , about our history in the hope that we can warn them about the dangers of fascism . "
mikova was sent to the camp in 1942 because she was jewish .
her parents , her parents-in-law and a brother-in-law were killed in auschwitz .
she was sent to a camp in freiberg .
" there we had to work extremely hard in an airplane factory , for 12 hours a day , " mikova said .
" then we had to go through the town to get to the camp huts .
it was very cold , because we were dressed very poorly , without underwear and we only had clogs .
our heads were shaved bald .
and there was not a lot to eat - only a little bit of brown water that they called coffee as well as weak soup and a piece of bread . "
sunday 's opening attracted a number of prominent figures .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier attended along with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , whose father was a prisoner in flossenbürg .
charlotte knobloch of germany 's central council of jews , romani rose from the central council of the sinti and roma and israeli ambassador shimon stein were also there .
there were also 84 former prisoners among those viewing the exhibition , an experience that was difficult for many .
mikova , however , was one of those ready to face the past .
" of course there are things which remain with us , things that one can never forget or get over , " she said .

that makes the sports utility vehicle , which weighs more than two tons , one of the worst emitters of carbon dioxide , a greenhouse gas that 's considered a prime contributor to global warming .
porsche said its decision to develop the hybrid motor - which combines an electric motor and battery with a standard combustion engine in order to cut fuel consumption - is a reaction to the raging debate on climate change in europe and rising concerns among consumers about the environmental friendliness of their cars .
" in particular , a premium carmaker such as porsche must offer competitive drivetrain solutions with low consumption- and emission levels , " the company said in a statement .
german carmakers trail in green technology the move comes as automakers and legislators across europe tighten the screws on co2 emissions amid mounting qualms about the environment .
in february this year , german carmakers were hit by new emission limits - 130 grams -lrb- 1.038 ounces -rrb- of co2 per kilometer to be met by 2012 - proposed by the european commission .
only six german-made models within the bloc currently meet those requirements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche hopes to launch the hybrid drivetrain by 2009 though german carmakers rank among the best in the world , they are widely seen to have been slow in waking up to reality and developing an alternative to the fossil-fuel engine .
japanese carmaker toyota is considered the world leader in hybrid technology .
porsche , which is working together with audi and volkswagen on the project , said it plans to unveil its hybrid powertrain in 2009 .

the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said the german interior ministry knew about 14 islamists from germany who had been in pakistan or were still there .
it added that authorities were calculating that more individuals from germany would be trained in al qaeda-run terrorist camps .
" a new quality in threat to germany " the weekly said at least seven islamists from germany had been arrested in pakistan over the past months and that islamabad was likely in the next few weeks to deport the men .
" we must assume that those who have come back from pakistan are planning attacks , " august hanning , germany 's deputy interior minister , said in an interview with the paper .
" we need to do everything possible to find out who went to pakistan and was trained there . "
he added that " this is a new , specific threat and is a cause for concern .
there is a new quality in the threat to germany . "
hanning added there were several indications that al qaeda had germany and german installations abroad , such as embassies , in its sight .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble echoed the view , saying there was a threat that suicide bombers were now being sent to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble says germany faces a new , concrete threat " there are a lot of concrete indications right up to the past few days that show that germany has increasingly moved into the crosshairs of international terrorism , " schäuble said in an interview with the bz am sonntag newspaper .
last month schäuble said authorities needed to increase vigilance due to the possibility that militants might carry out suicide attacks on german soil .
in april the us embassy in berlin announced it was boosting security at its facilities in germany in response to what it described as an increased threat of terrorism .
berlin has also said it believed there may be similar training camps in afghanistan , where germany has more than 3,000 troops stationed as part of a nato peacekeeping force .
the taliban has threatened to step up attacks on german troops . merkel supports online searches schäuble recently sparked controversy over comments that germany should clarify under what conditions the constitution permits the state to target and kill terrorists .
the tough-talking schäuble also pressed for changes in laws to allow pre-emptive detention of suspected militants and said authorities should have the right to prevent people they deem dangerous from using the internet and mobile phones .
the proposals have been criticized for eroding civil liberties .
but on sunday , schäuble received backing from german chancellor angela merkel for creating a legal framework to allow online searches of personal computers of suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has supported online searches of computers of suspected terrorists " we must look the threats in the eye and take them seriously , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .
" the interior minister has the freedom to think what needs to be done in the face of totally new threats . "
the issue has for weeks been a focus of heated debate between schäuble and german justice minister brigitte zypries .
on monday , members of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- urged zypries to expand the existing catalogue of anti-terrorism measures to include penalizing training in terrorism camps and the distribution of bomb-making manuals . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany can help you find it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ben donald goes native jaded by the globalization of travel , writer ben donald wanted to go somewhere - anywhere - not yet colonized by the " distasteful hordes . "
his personal patch of paradise turns out to be closer than expected - germany . " this is the not so lonely planet we are living on , " explains a character in donald 's recently published travelogue , " springtime for germany - or how i learned to love lederhosen . " but discerning globetrotters need not despair . " there is a new frontier , " he goes on .
" a lost , or rather overlooked horizon ; a place that is remaining undiscovered , cloaked in poisonous myth and all but unvisited , as we speak , for over 60 years since it became obscured from the minds of most of the world . " is that really germany he 's talking about ? initiated readers may be puzzled to hear it described in such terms .
but wait , he has a point , does n't he ?
it is better than its reputation .
in fact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who could resist germany 's biooodiful fräuleins ? ... " it is a european shangri-la : a romantic , wooded place , a country of rivers , vineyards , forests , castles , poetry and music ... of fast cars , schöne ladies - ' ver ze girls are biooodiful . '
a country preserved by neglect ; ripe and waiting to be revealed again . " blimey .
so why does this much-maligned country get short shrift with travelers , or , in donald-speak , " chavelers " ?
determined to get to the bottom of it , he sets out to discover the real germany .
and guess what ?
contrary to popular belief - at least the one defined by tabloid britain - there 's more to deutschland than soccer coaches with mullets , disney castles and nude bathers .
and no , sturm und drang do n't make hi-fis , and fkk has nothing to do with the ku klux klan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red lights on the reeperbahn as he scuppers the clichés with the same doggedness he mocks the germans for , donald gets to grips with the concepts he feels best sum up the essence of germany and germans .
in the chapter headed gemütlichkeit , he snuggles up with the bavarians at the annual oktoberfest , heads to berlin to capture the zeitgeist , gets the measure of grossmansucht on hamburg 's reeperbahn and meets a german stand-up comedian in schadenfreude . it proves to be a journey of enlightenment . " i am inclined to judge the depth of a man 's civilization by his opinion of germany and her culture , " he concludes . dw-world.de spoke to ben donald and asked him why , if germany 's so great , does britain still harp on about men in socks and sandals , girls with hairy armpits , and of course , david hasselhof . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the definitive guide to the real germany ?
you decide .
ben donald : well , if you 're writing a book about germany you have to use the stereotypes simply because they provide so much material , and humor is a key way of attracting people to a subject .
the british do the same with other countries too .
the stereotypical battle over the sun loungers is an entirely anglo-german issue - italians wouldn ‘ t take a blind bit of notice of a towel on a sun lounger , they ‘ d just sit down and ignore it .
the thing is , the english and the germans are quite similar in their approach to staking out territory and personal privacy . ultimately , the book said as much about brits as it did about germany . good !
that ‘ s how it should be .
i wanted to pitch myself as a kind of everyman , and the idea was that the book would show some sort of development from my original position .
i couldn ‘ t start out being a germanophile .
and in the course of the journey , i as the narrator also reveal a great deal about the british . but there was the assumption that readers would recognize and agree with britain 's stereotypes about germany . to go back to the genesis of this book , there 's simply nothing in the travel bookshops about germany , nothing lighthearted , nothing extolling the delights of the german countryside and way of life .
why is that , when there are hundreds about italy and france and spain ?
there 's something stopping people in britain from seeing germany as a holiday destination and romanticizing a view of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen 's famous cliffs when i do radio interviews in britain , the first questions are invariably : is n't germany just about sausages and dodgy wine , v olksmusik and nena ?
so these stereotypes do still exist - but they 've become more playful , they 're not malicious at all .
and while german ambassadors to britain always get involved with debates with the uk tabloids about how they treat germany , it should be pointed out that the british do this with everyone !
we 're terrible when it comes to xenophobic tendencies . in the book i focus on how germans are extraordinarily introspective and self questioning , and perhaps they just need to see anglo-german attitudes in the context of british xenophobia towards other countries too . even when brits are telling you how much they love france , the wine , the chateaux , their gites and so on , they ca n't help saying it 's just a shame about all the frenchmen in it .
the english view of france , as you see in books such as " a year in the merde " by stephen clarke , is also very stereotypical . but germans might still find the stereotypes offensive ... but what the book does is take these clichés and explode them .
there are few nazi references in it , because i specifically did n't want to write a book only about the war .
when i refer to lebensraum , for example , i explain what it is .
i mention kraft durch freude and the prora resort on rügen as an example of the socialism aspect we rarely talk about in the context of national socialism . i tried to see where the stereotypes are rooted and then to supply a deeper cultural reading .
when i wanted to explore - albeit in a jocular fashion - where germany 's thing about nudism has its roots , i tied it together with the specifically german interpretation of the hippy movement , the second world war and germany 's tradition of the kur -lsb- spa -rsb- culture .
what i did was find plausible explanations as to why these stereotypes emerged in the first place . you could argue that germans , who are quite serious , are the antithesis of the brits , who tend to be relentlessly ironic and su per cilious .
is it basically a per sonality clash ? but they do get on in many areas .
doing business with germans is an utter pleasure and in many ways we have a lot in common .
we actually have many affinities and shared interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein castle - too much for some so might we eventually see a great bond between the two countries ? all the people i speak to one-on-one have brilliant experiences of germany .
but it ‘ s a question of changing perceptions within the media and the collective nation .
in a way , these stereotypes are just too good to give up .
a map was drawn in 1945 , which was when the media explosion happened , and things became hard to change . what is your per sonal favorite part of germany ? i really love the baltic coast , the island of rügen and also further inland , the mecklenburgische seenplatte .
i 'd also love to go back to thuringia .

germany can help you find it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ben donald goes native jaded by the globalization of travel , writer ben donald wanted to go somewhere - anywhere - not yet colonized by the " distasteful hordes . "
his personal patch of paradise turns out to be closer than expected - germany . " this is the not so lonely planet we are living on , " explains a character in donald 's recently published travelogue , " springtime for germany - or how i learned to love lederhosen . " but discerning globetrotters need not despair . " there is a new frontier , " he goes on .
" a lost , or rather overlooked horizon ; a place that is remaining undiscovered , cloaked in poisonous myth and all but unvisited , as we speak , for over 60 years since it became obscured from the minds of most of the world . " is that really germany he 's talking about ? initiated readers may be puzzled to hear it described in such terms .
but wait , he has a point , does n't he ?
it is better than its reputation .
in fact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who could resist germany 's biooodiful fräuleins ? ... " it is a european shangri-la : a romantic , wooded place , a country of rivers , vineyards , forests , castles , poetry and music ... of fast cars , schöne ladies - ' ver ze girls are biooodiful . '
a country preserved by neglect ; ripe and waiting to be revealed again . " blimey .
so why does this much-maligned country get short shrift with travelers , or , in donald-speak , " chavelers " ?
determined to get to the bottom of it , he sets out to discover the real germany .
and guess what ?
contrary to popular belief - at least the one defined by tabloid britain - there 's more to deutschland than soccer coaches with mullets , disney castles and nude bathers .
and no , sturm und drang do n't make hi-fis , and fkk has nothing to do with the ku klux klan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red lights on the reeperbahn as he scuppers the clichés with the same doggedness he mocks the germans for , donald gets to grips with the concepts he feels best sum up the essence of germany and germans .
in the chapter headed gemütlichkeit , he snuggles up with the bavarians at the annual oktoberfest , heads to berlin to capture the zeitgeist , gets the measure of grossmansucht on hamburg 's reeperbahn and meets a german stand-up comedian in schadenfreude . it proves to be a journey of enlightenment . " i am inclined to judge the depth of a man 's civilization by his opinion of germany and her culture , " he concludes . dw-world.de spoke to ben donald and asked him why , if germany 's so great , does britain still harp on about men in socks and sandals , girls with hairy armpits , and of course , david hasselhof . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the definitive guide to the real germany ?
you decide .
ben donald : well , if you 're writing a book about germany you have to use the stereotypes simply because they provide so much material , and humor is a key way of attracting people to a subject .
the british do the same with other countries too .
the stereotypical battle over the sun loungers is an entirely anglo-german issue - italians wouldn ‘ t take a blind bit of notice of a towel on a sun lounger , they ‘ d just sit down and ignore it .
the thing is , the english and the germans are quite similar in their approach to staking out territory and personal privacy . ultimately , the book said as much about brits as it did about germany . good !
that ‘ s how it should be .
i wanted to pitch myself as a kind of everyman , and the idea was that the book would show some sort of development from my original position .
i couldn ‘ t start out being a germanophile .
and in the course of the journey , i as the narrator also reveal a great deal about the british . but there was the assumption that readers would recognize and agree with britain 's stereotypes about germany . to go back to the genesis of this book , there 's simply nothing in the travel bookshops about germany , nothing lighthearted , nothing extolling the delights of the german countryside and way of life .
why is that , when there are hundreds about italy and france and spain ?
there 's something stopping people in britain from seeing germany as a holiday destination and romanticizing a view of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen 's famous cliffs when i do radio interviews in britain , the first questions are invariably : is n't germany just about sausages and dodgy wine , v olksmusik and nena ?
so these stereotypes do still exist - but they 've become more playful , they 're not malicious at all .
and while german ambassadors to britain always get involved with debates with the uk tabloids about how they treat germany , it should be pointed out that the british do this with everyone !
we 're terrible when it comes to xenophobic tendencies . in the book i focus on how germans are extraordinarily introspective and self questioning , and perhaps they just need to see anglo-german attitudes in the context of british xenophobia towards other countries too . even when brits are telling you how much they love france , the wine , the chateaux , their gites and so on , they ca n't help saying it 's just a shame about all the frenchmen in it .
the english view of france , as you see in books such as " a year in the merde " by stephen clarke , is also very stereotypical . but germans might still find the stereotypes offensive ... but what the book does is take these clichés and explode them .
there are few nazi references in it , because i specifically did n't want to write a book only about the war .
when i refer to lebensraum , for example , i explain what it is .
i mention kraft durch freude and the prora resort on rügen as an example of the socialism aspect we rarely talk about in the context of national socialism . i tried to see where the stereotypes are rooted and then to supply a deeper cultural reading .
when i wanted to explore - albeit in a jocular fashion - where germany 's thing about nudism has its roots , i tied it together with the specifically german interpretation of the hippy movement , the second world war and germany 's tradition of the kur -lsb- spa -rsb- culture .
what i did was find plausible explanations as to why these stereotypes emerged in the first place . you could argue that germans , who are quite serious , are the antithesis of the brits , who tend to be relentlessly ironic and su per cilious .
is it basically a per sonality clash ? but they do get on in many areas .
doing business with germans is an utter pleasure and in many ways we have a lot in common .
we actually have many affinities and shared interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein castle - too much for some so might we eventually see a great bond between the two countries ? all the people i speak to one-on-one have brilliant experiences of germany .
but it ‘ s a question of changing perceptions within the media and the collective nation .
in a way , these stereotypes are just too good to give up .
a map was drawn in 1945 , which was when the media explosion happened , and things became hard to change . what is your per sonal favorite part of germany ? i really love the baltic coast , the island of rügen and also further inland , the mecklenburgische seenplatte .
i 'd also love to go back to thuringia .

" our democracy has successfully passed a test ...
our unity , democracy and the republic have emerged stronger from the ballot box , " erdogan said overnight outside akp headquarters as fireworks lit up the sky and hundreds of supporters cheered . the governing party , which has its roots in a now-banned islamist movement , won 46.3 percent of the vote , leading its closest rival by a wide margin , according to unofficial results after 99.9 percent of the ballots were counted . it was the largest support a turkish party has gained since the 1969 legislative election .
a comfortable lead the support the akp garnered should translate into 339 seats in the 550-member parliament , enough for it to once again form a government on its own . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks voted sunday for a new parliament that will face a host of challenges the party had 352 members in the outgoing house and despite support for it increasing by 12 percentage points compared to 2002 , the number of its seats will decline because more parties will be represented in parliament . " we will pursue economic and democracy reforms with determination , " erdogan said , pledging also commitment to the secular system and turkey 's eu membership bid . the secularist main opposition republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- finished second with 20.9 percent of vote and an estimated 112 seats , according to unofficial results .
the right-wing nationalist action party -lrb- mhp -rrb- was third with 14.2 percent and 71 seats . no other party passed the 10-percent national threshold needed to enter parliament , but 28 independent candidates won seats , 24 of them kurds campaigning for broader rights for their sizeable community . populist policies with virtually no chance of actually winning government , the akp 's nearest rivals had campaigned on populist policies and waged a scare campaign that portrayed the government as being not only anti-secular but also of failing to adequately deal with rebels from the kurdish workers ' party , of whom around 3,500 are based in northern iraq . around 42.5 million people were eligible to vote in sunday 's election of 550 members of parliament .
ten people were injured in fighting at voting booths in the south-east , but in general voting was peaceful at 160,000 polling stations across the country .
erdogan was forced to call sunday 's election after a bungled attempt to place his right-hand man , foreign minister abdullah gül , in the presidential palace in ankara .
millions of people took to the streets to protest the prospect of gül becoming president .
they objected to gül 's past involvement in conservative islamist groups , the fact that his wife wears an islamic-style headscarf - no president 's wife in turkey has ever worn one - and also at the prospect of the akp controlling the government , the parliament and presidency .
the military stepped in in april effectively scuttling the presidential election process by declaring it would do whatever necessary to protect secularism . as soon as the new parliament opens , its first task will be to elect a new president . erdogan has said he will seek a compromise in the presidential election , but insists that the candidate must be from his party . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 23.07.2007 expert : germany can do more for victims of human trafficking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany meeting its un obligations to women ?
the 39th session of the un committee of the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women -lrb- cedaw -rrb- begins monday .
dw-world.de talked to an expert about victims of human trafficking . katrin adams is the executive officer of kok – a german ngo working to combat exploitation and support women trafficked to germany .
dw-world.de : what does your organization do to fight trafficking of women ?
katrin adams : we have two main areas that we concentrate on .
firstly , combating trafficking in women and secondly , combating violence against women in the process of migration .
we are a network of 37 member organizations – women ’ s organizations and counseling centers .
we are a specialist lobby in berlin and we lobby for improvement of the individual situations of the victims of human trafficking .
what does the un convention say on human trafficking ?
they have a specialized article , which is article 6 , which says that state parties shall take all appropriate measures , including legislation , to suppress all forms of trafficking of women and exploitation by prostitution of women .
how useful is the convention in practice ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a survivor of trafficking in moscow the convention is very useful in that it has a reporting system .
that means that governments have to report on their specific improvements on their work when it comes to the implementation of the standards set in the convention .
with regards article 6 it means that states have to tell you something and they have to summarize what they have done to reach these objectives set out in article 6 .
for us as an ngo it is a good opportunity for us to lobby for our demands because normally the committee accepts the shadow reports .
a shadow report is prepared by ngos in which they give addition information and comment on the government reports .
do you prepare shadow reports ?
we , the kok , normally comment very specifically on article 6 in a shadow report .
we would comment on the report submitted by germany .
we work at a very national level .
that means we concentrate on the situation of victims of human trafficking here in germany .
this year the government released its report , including a section on article 6 .
at the moment we are critically reviewing what they have said and we will definitely comment critically on what the government says .
why will you be critical of the german government ?
because there has been some legislation passed this year by parliament which will enter into force in autumn .
that special legislation has , in our opinion , some flaws when it comes to an adequate treatment of victims of human trafficking .

the 39th session of the un committee of the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women -lrb- cedaw -rrb- begins monday .
dw-world.de talked to an expert about victims of human trafficking . katrin adams is the executive officer of kok – a german ngo working to combat exploitation and support women trafficked to germany .
dw-world.de : what does your organization do to fight trafficking of women ?
katrin adams : we have two main areas that we concentrate on .
firstly , combating trafficking in women and secondly , combating violence against women in the process of migration .
we are a network of 37 member organizations – women ’ s organizations and counseling centers .
we are a specialist lobby in berlin and we lobby for improvement of the individual situations of the victims of human trafficking .
what does the un convention say on human trafficking ?
they have a specialized article , which is article 6 , which says that state parties shall take all appropriate measures , including legislation , to suppress all forms of trafficking of women and exploitation by prostitution of women .
how useful is the convention in practice ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a survivor of trafficking in moscow the convention is very useful in that it has a reporting system .
that means that governments have to report on their specific improvements on their work when it comes to the implementation of the standards set in the convention .
with regards article 6 it means that states have to tell you something and they have to summarize what they have done to reach these objectives set out in article 6 .
for us as an ngo it is a good opportunity for us to lobby for our demands because normally the committee accepts the shadow reports .
a shadow report is prepared by ngos in which they give addition information and comment on the government reports .
do you prepare shadow reports ?
we , the kok , normally comment very specifically on article 6 in a shadow report .
we would comment on the report submitted by germany .
we work at a very national level .
that means we concentrate on the situation of victims of human trafficking here in germany .
this year the government released its report , including a section on article 6 .
at the moment we are critically reviewing what they have said and we will definitely comment critically on what the government says .
why will you be critical of the german government ?
because there has been some legislation passed this year by parliament which will enter into force in autumn .
that special legislation has , in our opinion , some flaws when it comes to an adequate treatment of victims of human trafficking .
we think germany should do better .
what is the extent of trafficking in women to germany ?
unfortunately i can ’ t give you as a definite answer on that because we think the numbers that are known about are only a fraction of what is actually happening .
the numbers that are most reliable are those published by the federal criminal office .

the friendly greeting is positioned under a picture of the historic castle ruins for which the small town on the german-czech border is still well known for .
in fact , while the postcard is from the 1920s , it could be from the present day .
what flossenbürg is less famous - or notorious - for is that it was the location for one of the nazis ' 12 largest concentration camps ; the camp where german theologian dietrich bonhoeffer died along with tens of thousands of other victims .
after the war , the camp and its history slowly slipped into oblivion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietrich bonhoeffer was one of the tens of thousands to be killed at flossenbürg but the new exhibition , which opened to the public on sunday , more than 60 years after the camp was liberated , aims to commemorate those who lost their lives at flossenbürg and its surrounding camps and return its role in the " final solution " to the modern history books .
after being liberated , the camp became the site of residential buildings and a toy factory moved into its empty warehouse .
only in the 1980s did a small exhibit about the camp first appear .
one of the main reasons it took so long for the camp to be remembered has much to do with the demographics of those who were imprisoned there .
" two thirds of the prisoners were eastern europeans , " said christian omonsky , the press coordinator of the flossenbürg exhibit , adding that the process of recounting the stories and compiling the evidence could only begin after the iron curtain fell and the former prisoners were able to visit the camp in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of its liberation .
since then - with the help of survivors , local people and historians - omonsky , museum director jörg skriebeleit and the rest of the museum 's staff have created a memorial for the concentration camp .
painstaking research to create memorial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family photos show lives about to be changed forever the exhibition is the result of four years of extensive research by skriebeleit and his team .
their research included hundreds of interviews with former prisoners to fill in the gaps of the camp 's history .
the work recreates an authentic snapshot of everyday life in the camp , one which not only shows the suffering of the prisoners but also the lives of those responsible for the suffering .
for example , photos of ss officers enjoying leisure time feature alongside pictures of emaciated inmates .
during world war ii , flossenbürg was an administrative center for 90 camps in bavaria , bohemia and saxony .
jews , sinti and roma were locked up in these camps along with political dissidents , prisoners of war , homosexuals and " professional criminals . "
in total , the camps held around16,000 women and 84,000 men .
in flossenbürg and its surrounding camps almost 30,000 prisoners died as a result of murder by ss officers , hard labor and accidents in the nearby stone quarry , frostbite or illnesses such as pneumonia and tuberculosis .
until recently , those who died were only numbers in a ledger .
" we would like to give these victims who had disappeared from the public consciousness for decades a human face , " said skriebeleit .
the central hall of the exhibition attempts to do just that with a selection of personal photographs from prisoners , taken before they were deported .
the images of families , holidays , young lovers , weddings and smiling youths give a clear indication of what was taken from these people when imprisioned within the confines of the camp .
ordinary lives swapped for horror and death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skriebeleit and a model of the war-time camp texts accompanying the photos explain the victims ' fates and artwork from survivors depict the horrors they may have experienced .
one drawing shows the execution of five prisoners in front of a christmas tree while the rest of the camp looks on .
while it has taken many years to bring flossenbürg out of the shadows of history , the survivors of the camp have visited regularly since they have been able to .
" for the survivors , returning always reminds us of the past , " said lisa mikova from prague .
" but we want to tell school children , for instance , about our history in the hope that we can warn them about the dangers of fascism . "
mikova was sent to the camp in 1942 because she was jewish .
her parents , her parents-in-law and a brother-in-law were killed in auschwitz .
she was sent to a camp in freiberg .
" there we had to work extremely hard in an airplane factory , for 12 hours a day , " mikova said .
" then we had to go through the town to get to the camp huts .
it was very cold , because we were dressed very poorly , without underwear and we only had clogs .
our heads were shaved bald .
and there was not a lot to eat - only a little bit of brown water that they called coffee as well as weak soup and a piece of bread . "
sunday 's opening attracted a number of prominent figures .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier attended along with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , whose father was a prisoner in flossenbürg .
charlotte knobloch of germany 's central council of jews , romani rose from the central council of the sinti and roma and israeli ambassador shimon stein were also there .
there were also 84 former prisoners among those viewing the exhibition , an experience that was difficult for many .
mikova , however , was one of those ready to face the past .
" of course there are things which remain with us , things that one can never forget or get over , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 23.07.2007 germany worried about increased terrorism threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is uneasy about islamists being trained in camps on the afghan-pakistan border concerned about reports of german islamists being trained in terrorist camps in pakistan and an increased danger level , security officials and politicians are pushing to expand the catalogue of anti-terrorism measures . security officials voiced concern over the weekend about a growing terrorism threat after a newspaper reported that german islamists , who had been trained in camps in pakistan , had returned to germany in june .
the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said the german interior ministry knew about 14 islamists from germany who had been in pakistan or were still there .
it added that authorities were calculating that more individuals from germany would be trained in al qaeda-run terrorist camps .
" a new quality in threat to germany " the weekly said at least seven islamists from germany had been arrested in pakistan over the past months and that islamabad was likely in the next few weeks to deport the men .
" we must assume that those who have come back from pakistan are planning attacks , " august hanning , germany 's deputy interior minister , said in an interview with the paper .
" we need to do everything possible to find out who went to pakistan and was trained there . "
he added that " this is a new , specific threat and is a cause for concern .
there is a new quality in the threat to germany . "
hanning added there were several indications that al qaeda had germany and german installations abroad , such as embassies , in its sight .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble echoed the view , saying there was a threat that suicide bombers were now being sent to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble says germany faces a new , concrete threat " there are a lot of concrete indications right up to the past few days that show that germany has increasingly moved into the crosshairs of international terrorism , " schäuble said in an interview with the bz am sonntag newspaper .
last month schäuble said authorities needed to increase vigilance due to the possibility that militants might carry out suicide attacks on german soil .
in april the us embassy in berlin announced it was boosting security at its facilities in germany in response to what it described as an increased threat of terrorism .
berlin has also said it believed there may be similar training camps in afghanistan , where germany has more than 3,000 troops stationed as part of a nato peacekeeping force .
the taliban has threatened to step up attacks on german troops . merkel supports online searches schäuble recently sparked controversy over comments that germany should clarify under what conditions the constitution permits the state to target and kill terrorists .
the tough-talking schäuble also pressed for changes in laws to allow pre-emptive detention of suspected militants and said authorities should have the right to prevent people they deem dangerous from using the internet and mobile phones .
the proposals have been criticized for eroding civil liberties .
but on sunday , schäuble received backing from german chancellor angela merkel for creating a legal framework to allow online searches of personal computers of suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has supported online searches of computers of suspected terrorists " we must look the threats in the eye and take them seriously , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .

the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said the german interior ministry knew about 14 islamists from germany who had been in pakistan or were still there .
it added that authorities were calculating that more individuals from germany would be trained in al qaeda-run terrorist camps .
" a new quality in threat to germany " the weekly said at least seven islamists from germany had been arrested in pakistan over the past months and that islamabad was likely in the next few weeks to deport the men .
" we must assume that those who have come back from pakistan are planning attacks , " august hanning , germany 's deputy interior minister , said in an interview with the paper .
" we need to do everything possible to find out who went to pakistan and was trained there . "
he added that " this is a new , specific threat and is a cause for concern .
there is a new quality in the threat to germany . "
hanning added there were several indications that al qaeda had germany and german installations abroad , such as embassies , in its sight .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble echoed the view , saying there was a threat that suicide bombers were now being sent to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble says germany faces a new , concrete threat " there are a lot of concrete indications right up to the past few days that show that germany has increasingly moved into the crosshairs of international terrorism , " schäuble said in an interview with the bz am sonntag newspaper .
last month schäuble said authorities needed to increase vigilance due to the possibility that militants might carry out suicide attacks on german soil .
in april the us embassy in berlin announced it was boosting security at its facilities in germany in response to what it described as an increased threat of terrorism .
berlin has also said it believed there may be similar training camps in afghanistan , where germany has more than 3,000 troops stationed as part of a nato peacekeeping force .
the taliban has threatened to step up attacks on german troops . merkel supports online searches schäuble recently sparked controversy over comments that germany should clarify under what conditions the constitution permits the state to target and kill terrorists .
the tough-talking schäuble also pressed for changes in laws to allow pre-emptive detention of suspected militants and said authorities should have the right to prevent people they deem dangerous from using the internet and mobile phones .
the proposals have been criticized for eroding civil liberties .
but on sunday , schäuble received backing from german chancellor angela merkel for creating a legal framework to allow online searches of personal computers of suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has supported online searches of computers of suspected terrorists " we must look the threats in the eye and take them seriously , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .

the issue has for weeks been a focus of heated debate between schäuble and german justice minister brigitte zypries .

only six german-made models within the bloc currently meet those requirements .

japanese carmaker toyota is considered the world leader in hybrid technology .
porsche , which is working together with audi and volkswagen on the project , said it plans to unveil its hybrid powertrain in 2009 .

the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said the german interior ministry knew about 14 islamists from germany who had been in pakistan or were still there .
it added that authorities were calculating that more individuals from germany would be trained in al qaeda-run terrorist camps .
" a new quality in threat to germany " the weekly said at least seven islamists from germany had been arrested in pakistan over the past months and that islamabad was likely in the next few weeks to deport the men .
" we must assume that those who have come back from pakistan are planning attacks , " august hanning , germany 's deputy interior minister , said in an interview with the paper .
" we need to do everything possible to find out who went to pakistan and was trained there . "
he added that " this is a new , specific threat and is a cause for concern .
there is a new quality in the threat to germany . "

in april the us embassy in berlin announced it was boosting security at its facilities in germany in response to what it described as an increased threat of terrorism .

the tough-talking schäuble also pressed for changes in laws to allow pre-emptive detention of suspected militants and said authorities should have the right to prevent people they deem dangerous from using the internet and mobile phones .
the proposals have been criticized for eroding civil liberties .
but on sunday , schäuble received backing from german chancellor angela merkel for creating a legal framework to allow online searches of personal computers of suspected terrorists .

the 39th session of the un committee of the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women -lrb- cedaw -rrb- begins monday .
dw-world.de talked to an expert about victims of human trafficking . katrin adams is the executive officer of kok – a german ngo working to combat exploitation and support women trafficked to germany .
dw-world.de : what does your organization do to fight trafficking of women ?
katrin adams : we have two main areas that we concentrate on .
firstly , combating trafficking in women and secondly , combating violence against women in the process of migration .
we are a network of 37 member organizations – women ’ s organizations and counseling centers .
we are a specialist lobby in berlin and we lobby for improvement of the individual situations of the victims of human trafficking .
what does the un convention say on human trafficking ?
they have a specialized article , which is article 6 , which says that state parties shall take all appropriate measures , including legislation , to suppress all forms of trafficking of women and exploitation by prostitution of women .
how useful is the convention in practice ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a survivor of trafficking in moscow the convention is very useful in that it has a reporting system .
that means that governments have to report on their specific improvements on their work when it comes to the implementation of the standards set in the convention .
with regards article 6 it means that states have to tell you something and they have to summarize what they have done to reach these objectives set out in article 6 .
for us as an ngo it is a good opportunity for us to lobby for our demands because normally the committee accepts the shadow reports .
a shadow report is prepared by ngos in which they give addition information and comment on the government reports .
do you prepare shadow reports ?
we , the kok , normally comment very specifically on article 6 in a shadow report .
we would comment on the report submitted by germany .
we work at a very national level .
that means we concentrate on the situation of victims of human trafficking here in germany .
this year the government released its report , including a section on article 6 .
at the moment we are critically reviewing what they have said and we will definitely comment critically on what the government says .
why will you be critical of the german government ?
because there has been some legislation passed this year by parliament which will enter into force in autumn .
that special legislation has , in our opinion , some flaws when it comes to an adequate treatment of victims of human trafficking .
we think germany should do better .
what is the extent of trafficking in women to germany ?
unfortunately i can ’ t give you as a definite answer on that because we think the numbers that are known about are only a fraction of what is actually happening .
the numbers that are most reliable are those published by the federal criminal office .
the number of victims officially known about in 2005 was 642 .
but we are working on the basis that the actual number is much higher .
what sort of cases are these ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demanding education to rebuild women 's lives we have a lot very different cases .
there is no single procedure .
normally women are brought into germany and they have been deceived or threatened .
they are promised that they will get work in restaurants or bars and then they discover they have to work as prostitutes .
some women do come to germany knowing that they might be working as prostitutes and then find the work conditions are exploitative , which they wouldn ’ t have been aware of before they came .
when it comes to trafficking in human beings , there is also the issue of being forced into labor or marriage , that ’ s an issue that has not really been dealt with a lot .
where are these women mostly coming from ?
mostly from countries in eastern europe , although the numbers of women that are being forced into prostitution that are germans and being trafficked within germany is rising too .
when your organization and the un cedaw committee are critical of the german government , how much notice do they take ?
normally , what the committee does is adopt concluding comments , and as far as i know they are being taken seriously .
that means that the government tries to consider what the committee says and act accordingly .
in some cases it ’ s just political goodwill and nothing actually happens but in some cases the observations and concluding comments are quite useful and there is actually change in the political environment .
what sort of changes would you like to see the government implement to protect women who have been trafficked to germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kok also campaigns on violence against women what we would like to see is women who have been trafficked become entitled to permanent residency in germany .
at the moment the legal conditions are quite strict when it comes to getting residency .
secondly , coverage of basic needs including medical treatment and psychological help is often not provided .
we would like them to have a legal right to this basic coverage .
another important point is access to further education , especially language courses , so that women who decide to stay here once they have been released have an opportunity to build a normal life .
we are lobbying too for access to the labor market .
is it possible to prevent women being trafficked to germany ?
this is more the work of ngos in the countries of origin .
we are in contact with networks of ngos in these countries .
if there is a need and if we can help by supporting these ngos in that specific countries then we do what we can , but it ’ s not one of our main activities . emma wynne interviewed katrin adams send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 39th session of the un committee of the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women -lrb- cedaw -rrb- begins monday .
dw-world.de talked to an expert about victims of human trafficking . katrin adams is the executive officer of kok – a german ngo working to combat exploitation and support women trafficked to germany .
dw-world.de : what does your organization do to fight trafficking of women ?
katrin adams : we have two main areas that we concentrate on .
firstly , combating trafficking in women and secondly , combating violence against women in the process of migration .
we are a network of 37 member organizations – women ’ s organizations and counseling centers .
we are a specialist lobby in berlin and we lobby for improvement of the individual situations of the victims of human trafficking .
what does the un convention say on human trafficking ?
they have a specialized article , which is article 6 , which says that state parties shall take all appropriate measures , including legislation , to suppress all forms of trafficking of women and exploitation by prostitution of women .
how useful is the convention in practice ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a survivor of trafficking in moscow the convention is very useful in that it has a reporting system .
that means that governments have to report on their specific improvements on their work when it comes to the implementation of the standards set in the convention .
with regards article 6 it means that states have to tell you something and they have to summarize what they have done to reach these objectives set out in article 6 .
for us as an ngo it is a good opportunity for us to lobby for our demands because normally the committee accepts the shadow reports .
a shadow report is prepared by ngos in which they give addition information and comment on the government reports .
do you prepare shadow reports ?
we , the kok , normally comment very specifically on article 6 in a shadow report .
we would comment on the report submitted by germany .
we work at a very national level .
that means we concentrate on the situation of victims of human trafficking here in germany .
this year the government released its report , including a section on article 6 .
at the moment we are critically reviewing what they have said and we will definitely comment critically on what the government says .
why will you be critical of the german government ?
because there has been some legislation passed this year by parliament which will enter into force in autumn .
that special legislation has , in our opinion , some flaws when it comes to an adequate treatment of victims of human trafficking .
we think germany should do better .
what is the extent of trafficking in women to germany ?
unfortunately i can ’ t give you as a definite answer on that because we think the numbers that are known about are only a fraction of what is actually happening .
the numbers that are most reliable are those published by the federal criminal office .
the number of victims officially known about in 2005 was 642 .
but we are working on the basis that the actual number is much higher .
what sort of cases are these ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demanding education to rebuild women 's lives we have a lot very different cases .
there is no single procedure .
normally women are brought into germany and they have been deceived or threatened .
they are promised that they will get work in restaurants or bars and then they discover they have to work as prostitutes .
some women do come to germany knowing that they might be working as prostitutes and then find the work conditions are exploitative , which they wouldn ’ t have been aware of before they came .
when it comes to trafficking in human beings , there is also the issue of being forced into labor or marriage , that ’ s an issue that has not really been dealt with a lot .
where are these women mostly coming from ?
mostly from countries in eastern europe , although the numbers of women that are being forced into prostitution that are germans and being trafficked within germany is rising too .
when your organization and the un cedaw committee are critical of the german government , how much notice do they take ?
normally , what the committee does is adopt concluding comments , and as far as i know they are being taken seriously .
that means that the government tries to consider what the committee says and act accordingly .
in some cases it ’ s just political goodwill and nothing actually happens but in some cases the observations and concluding comments are quite useful and there is actually change in the political environment .
what sort of changes would you like to see the government implement to protect women who have been trafficked to germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kok also campaigns on violence against women what we would like to see is women who have been trafficked become entitled to permanent residency in germany .
at the moment the legal conditions are quite strict when it comes to getting residency .
secondly , coverage of basic needs including medical treatment and psychological help is often not provided .
we would like them to have a legal right to this basic coverage .
another important point is access to further education , especially language courses , so that women who decide to stay here once they have been released have an opportunity to build a normal life .
we are lobbying too for access to the labor market .
is it possible to prevent women being trafficked to germany ?
this is more the work of ngos in the countries of origin .
we are in contact with networks of ngos in these countries .
if there is a need and if we can help by supporting these ngos in that specific countries then we do what we can , but it ’ s not one of our main activities . emma wynne interviewed katrin adams send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , a new exhibition has opened which tells the story of those who were incarcerated and who lost their lives there . a postcard in one of the first display rooms of the new museum reads : " greetings from flossenbürg . "
the friendly greeting is positioned under a picture of the historic castle ruins for which the small town on the german-czech border is still well known for .
in fact , while the postcard is from the 1920s , it could be from the present day .
what flossenbürg is less famous - or notorious - for is that it was the location for one of the nazis ' 12 largest concentration camps ; the camp where german theologian dietrich bonhoeffer died along with tens of thousands of other victims .
after the war , the camp and its history slowly slipped into oblivion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietrich bonhoeffer was one of the tens of thousands to be killed at flossenbürg but the new exhibition , which opened to the public on sunday , more than 60 years after the camp was liberated , aims to commemorate those who lost their lives at flossenbürg and its surrounding camps and return its role in the " final solution " to the modern history books .
after being liberated , the camp became the site of residential buildings and a toy factory moved into its empty warehouse .
only in the 1980s did a small exhibit about the camp first appear .
one of the main reasons it took so long for the camp to be remembered has much to do with the demographics of those who were imprisoned there .
" two thirds of the prisoners were eastern europeans , " said christian omonsky , the press coordinator of the flossenbürg exhibit , adding that the process of recounting the stories and compiling the evidence could only begin after the iron curtain fell and the former prisoners were able to visit the camp in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of its liberation .
since then - with the help of survivors , local people and historians - omonsky , museum director jörg skriebeleit and the rest of the museum 's staff have created a memorial for the concentration camp .
painstaking research to create memorial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family photos show lives about to be changed forever the exhibition is the result of four years of extensive research by skriebeleit and his team .
their research included hundreds of interviews with former prisoners to fill in the gaps of the camp 's history .
the work recreates an authentic snapshot of everyday life in the camp , one which not only shows the suffering of the prisoners but also the lives of those responsible for the suffering .
for example , photos of ss officers enjoying leisure time feature alongside pictures of emaciated inmates .
during world war ii , flossenbürg was an administrative center for 90 camps in bavaria , bohemia and saxony .
jews , sinti and roma were locked up in these camps along with political dissidents , prisoners of war , homosexuals and " professional criminals . "
in total , the camps held around16,000 women and 84,000 men .
in flossenbürg and its surrounding camps almost 30,000 prisoners died as a result of murder by ss officers , hard labor and accidents in the nearby stone quarry , frostbite or illnesses such as pneumonia and tuberculosis .
until recently , those who died were only numbers in a ledger .
" we would like to give these victims who had disappeared from the public consciousness for decades a human face , " said skriebeleit .
the central hall of the exhibition attempts to do just that with a selection of personal photographs from prisoners , taken before they were deported .
the images of families , holidays , young lovers , weddings and smiling youths give a clear indication of what was taken from these people when imprisioned within the confines of the camp .
ordinary lives swapped for horror and death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skriebeleit and a model of the war-time camp texts accompanying the photos explain the victims ' fates and artwork from survivors depict the horrors they may have experienced .
one drawing shows the execution of five prisoners in front of a christmas tree while the rest of the camp looks on .
while it has taken many years to bring flossenbürg out of the shadows of history , the survivors of the camp have visited regularly since they have been able to .
" for the survivors , returning always reminds us of the past , " said lisa mikova from prague .
" but we want to tell school children , for instance , about our history in the hope that we can warn them about the dangers of fascism . "
mikova was sent to the camp in 1942 because she was jewish .
her parents , her parents-in-law and a brother-in-law were killed in auschwitz .
she was sent to a camp in freiberg .
" there we had to work extremely hard in an airplane factory , for 12 hours a day , " mikova said .
" then we had to go through the town to get to the camp huts .
it was very cold , because we were dressed very poorly , without underwear and we only had clogs .
our heads were shaved bald .
and there was not a lot to eat - only a little bit of brown water that they called coffee as well as weak soup and a piece of bread . "
sunday 's opening attracted a number of prominent figures .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier attended along with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , whose father was a prisoner in flossenbürg .
charlotte knobloch of germany 's central council of jews , romani rose from the central council of the sinti and roma and israeli ambassador shimon stein were also there .
there were also 84 former prisoners among those viewing the exhibition , an experience that was difficult for many .
mikova , however , was one of those ready to face the past .
" of course there are things which remain with us , things that one can never forget or get over , " she said .

now , a new exhibition has opened which tells the story of those who were incarcerated and who lost their lives there . a postcard in one of the first display rooms of the new museum reads : " greetings from flossenbürg . "
the friendly greeting is positioned under a picture of the historic castle ruins for which the small town on the german-czech border is still well known for .
in fact , while the postcard is from the 1920s , it could be from the present day .
what flossenbürg is less famous - or notorious - for is that it was the location for one of the nazis ' 12 largest concentration camps ; the camp where german theologian dietrich bonhoeffer died along with tens of thousands of other victims .
after the war , the camp and its history slowly slipped into oblivion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietrich bonhoeffer was one of the tens of thousands to be killed at flossenbürg but the new exhibition , which opened to the public on sunday , more than 60 years after the camp was liberated , aims to commemorate those who lost their lives at flossenbürg and its surrounding camps and return its role in the " final solution " to the modern history books .
after being liberated , the camp became the site of residential buildings and a toy factory moved into its empty warehouse .
only in the 1980s did a small exhibit about the camp first appear .
one of the main reasons it took so long for the camp to be remembered has much to do with the demographics of those who were imprisoned there .
" two thirds of the prisoners were eastern europeans , " said christian omonsky , the press coordinator of the flossenbürg exhibit , adding that the process of recounting the stories and compiling the evidence could only begin after the iron curtain fell and the former prisoners were able to visit the camp in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of its liberation .
since then - with the help of survivors , local people and historians - omonsky , museum director jörg skriebeleit and the rest of the museum 's staff have created a memorial for the concentration camp .
painstaking research to create memorial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family photos show lives about to be changed forever the exhibition is the result of four years of extensive research by skriebeleit and his team .
their research included hundreds of interviews with former prisoners to fill in the gaps of the camp 's history .
the work recreates an authentic snapshot of everyday life in the camp , one which not only shows the suffering of the prisoners but also the lives of those responsible for the suffering .
for example , photos of ss officers enjoying leisure time feature alongside pictures of emaciated inmates .
during world war ii , flossenbürg was an administrative center for 90 camps in bavaria , bohemia and saxony .
jews , sinti and roma were locked up in these camps along with political dissidents , prisoners of war , homosexuals and " professional criminals . "
in total , the camps held around16,000 women and 84,000 men .
in flossenbürg and its surrounding camps almost 30,000 prisoners died as a result of murder by ss officers , hard labor and accidents in the nearby stone quarry , frostbite or illnesses such as pneumonia and tuberculosis .
until recently , those who died were only numbers in a ledger .
" we would like to give these victims who had disappeared from the public consciousness for decades a human face , " said skriebeleit .
the central hall of the exhibition attempts to do just that with a selection of personal photographs from prisoners , taken before they were deported .
the images of families , holidays , young lovers , weddings and smiling youths give a clear indication of what was taken from these people when imprisioned within the confines of the camp .
ordinary lives swapped for horror and death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skriebeleit and a model of the war-time camp texts accompanying the photos explain the victims ' fates and artwork from survivors depict the horrors they may have experienced .
one drawing shows the execution of five prisoners in front of a christmas tree while the rest of the camp looks on .
while it has taken many years to bring flossenbürg out of the shadows of history , the survivors of the camp have visited regularly since they have been able to .
" for the survivors , returning always reminds us of the past , " said lisa mikova from prague .
" but we want to tell school children , for instance , about our history in the hope that we can warn them about the dangers of fascism . "
mikova was sent to the camp in 1942 because she was jewish .
her parents , her parents-in-law and a brother-in-law were killed in auschwitz .
she was sent to a camp in freiberg .
" there we had to work extremely hard in an airplane factory , for 12 hours a day , " mikova said .

the 39th session of the un committee of the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women -lrb- cedaw -rrb- begins monday .
dw-world.de talked to an expert about victims of human trafficking . katrin adams is the executive officer of kok – a german ngo working to combat exploitation and support women trafficked to germany .
dw-world.de : what does your organization do to fight trafficking of women ?
katrin adams : we have two main areas that we concentrate on .
firstly , combating trafficking in women and secondly , combating violence against women in the process of migration .
we are a network of 37 member organizations – women ’ s organizations and counseling centers .
we are a specialist lobby in berlin and we lobby for improvement of the individual situations of the victims of human trafficking .
what does the un convention say on human trafficking ?
they have a specialized article , which is article 6 , which says that state parties shall take all appropriate measures , including legislation , to suppress all forms of trafficking of women and exploitation by prostitution of women .
how useful is the convention in practice ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a survivor of trafficking in moscow the convention is very useful in that it has a reporting system .
that means that governments have to report on their specific improvements on their work when it comes to the implementation of the standards set in the convention .
with regards article 6 it means that states have to tell you something and they have to summarize what they have done to reach these objectives set out in article 6 .
for us as an ngo it is a good opportunity for us to lobby for our demands because normally the committee accepts the shadow reports .
a shadow report is prepared by ngos in which they give addition information and comment on the government reports .
do you prepare shadow reports ?
we , the kok , normally comment very specifically on article 6 in a shadow report .
we would comment on the report submitted by germany .
we work at a very national level .
that means we concentrate on the situation of victims of human trafficking here in germany .
this year the government released its report , including a section on article 6 .
at the moment we are critically reviewing what they have said and we will definitely comment critically on what the government says .
why will you be critical of the german government ?
because there has been some legislation passed this year by parliament which will enter into force in autumn .
that special legislation has , in our opinion , some flaws when it comes to an adequate treatment of victims of human trafficking .
we think germany should do better .
what is the extent of trafficking in women to germany ?
unfortunately i can ’ t give you as a definite answer on that because we think the numbers that are known about are only a fraction of what is actually happening .
the numbers that are most reliable are those published by the federal criminal office .
the number of victims officially known about in 2005 was 642 .
but we are working on the basis that the actual number is much higher .
what sort of cases are these ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demanding education to rebuild women 's lives we have a lot very different cases .
there is no single procedure .
normally women are brought into germany and they have been deceived or threatened .
they are promised that they will get work in restaurants or bars and then they discover they have to work as prostitutes .
some women do come to germany knowing that they might be working as prostitutes and then find the work conditions are exploitative , which they wouldn ’ t have been aware of before they came .
when it comes to trafficking in human beings , there is also the issue of being forced into labor or marriage , that ’ s an issue that has not really been dealt with a lot .
where are these women mostly coming from ?
mostly from countries in eastern europe , although the numbers of women that are being forced into prostitution that are germans and being trafficked within germany is rising too .
when your organization and the un cedaw committee are critical of the german government , how much notice do they take ?
normally , what the committee does is adopt concluding comments , and as far as i know they are being taken seriously .
that means that the government tries to consider what the committee says and act accordingly .
in some cases it ’ s just political goodwill and nothing actually happens but in some cases the observations and concluding comments are quite useful and there is actually change in the political environment .
what sort of changes would you like to see the government implement to protect women who have been trafficked to germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kok also campaigns on violence against women what we would like to see is women who have been trafficked become entitled to permanent residency in germany .
at the moment the legal conditions are quite strict when it comes to getting residency .
secondly , coverage of basic needs including medical treatment and psychological help is often not provided .
we would like them to have a legal right to this basic coverage .
another important point is access to further education , especially language courses , so that women who decide to stay here once they have been released have an opportunity to build a normal life .
we are lobbying too for access to the labor market .
is it possible to prevent women being trafficked to germany ?
this is more the work of ngos in the countries of origin .
we are in contact with networks of ngos in these countries .
if there is a need and if we can help by supporting these ngos in that specific countries then we do what we can , but it ’ s not one of our main activities . emma wynne interviewed katrin adams send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think that once russia and the united states sit at the table together , there will be a very real possibility that the kosovars and the serbs will start acting the way they should , " he said .
steinmeier 's proposal comes after russia last week threatened to veto yet another draft un security council resolution calling for supervised independence for kosovo .

he warned that it is " essential that both parties including serbia take finally a constructive and realistic approach to these negotiations . "

" i favor the concept of an international troika , made up of the us , russia and eu , so with that we would have three international partners to negotiate with the serbs and the kosovars -lrb- ethnic albanians -rrb- , " steinmeier told reporters at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels .
he said that such a troika offered the " best chance " to secure a so far elusive deal on kosovo .
" i think that once russia and the united states sit at the table together , there will be a very real possibility that the kosovars and the serbs will start acting the way they should , " he said .
steinmeier 's proposal comes after russia last week threatened to veto yet another draft un security council resolution calling for supervised independence for kosovo .
steinmeier seeking alternative to contact group others , also seeking to avert a russian veto by putting preparations for the un resolution on hold , have said discussions on kosovo should be spearheaded by the contact group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier continues to push for supervised independence steinmeier said there was also a suggestion that un secretary-general ban ki-moon should appoint a new envoy to replace martti ahtisaari to mediate between serbs and kosovars .
however , the proposed troika discussions would continue to focus on ahtisaari 's plan for supervised independence for kosovo , steinmeier added .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn also said the eu wanted to move forward on the basis of ahtisaari 's recommendation that kosovo be granted " independence supervised by the international community . "
" if the contact group is going to have further negotiations we are of course ready to contribute to those , " rehn told reporters .
he warned that it is " essential that both parties including serbia take finally a constructive and realistic approach to these negotiations . "
eu officials , however , once again stated that if the troika proposal was rejected and the issue moved to the contact group , it would be a temporary solution and that the un security council would have the final say to the status of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia and kosovo came to the table - but agreed to nothing luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn also backed steinmeier 's proposal , saying it was important that serbs and kosovars came back to the negotiating table .
" if they are not able to talk together about their future , then others will take the decisions , " asselborn said .
steinmeier said he had discussed his troika proposal with ban , russian foreign minister sergi lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
" now that we all have to presume there will not be a security council resolution , i feel it is important that we do n't leave the ongoing process to its own devices , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister stated that stability in the western balkans was a key eu priority , adding , " the international community needs therefore to maintain its joint responsibility towards the region . "
eu 's credibility at stake over kosovo other eu foreign ministers at the brussels meeting emphasized that the eu 's credibility was on the line over the resolution of kosovo ’ s status .
" the stability of the balkans , the unity of the european union , the credibility of us versus the united states and russia is at stake , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt , a balkans expert within the eu , told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish balkan expert bildt sees kosovo as the eu 's problem bildt added that unity between the eu states over kosovo was " absolutely paramount " if the issue of kosovo was to move from the un security council to the international contact group .
british foreign secretary david miliband echoed bildt 's statement on eu unity .
" it 's probably important that we establish our own position and are clear about the need for strong european leadership and strong european unity in this area , " he said .
russian resistance scuppers un resolution the europeans and their us allies on friday postponed attempts to secure a security council resolution that would have granted kosovo " supervised independence , " in the face of a likely russian veto .
russia , a strong ally of serbia , had complained that recognizing an independent kosovo would send the wrong signal to other breakaway regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is being backed in its stance by its ally russia serbia has said such a move would be a breach of its national sovereignty but concedes it could give special autonomy to kosovo .
after talks with rice on monday , kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said the province would work with the united states and europe to coordinate its future and not unilaterally declare independence .
" for us it is critical that the process is coordinated and moves ahead in close cooperation with the international community , the us and the european union in the first place , " he told the afp news agency .
" of course , a formal announcement of independence will happen in due course , but in cooperation and in close partnership with the countries which are supportive of the kosovo independence . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when a nato campaign drove out serb forces after accusing them of committing atrocities against ethnic albanians .
in april this year , ahtisaari proposed independence under the supervision of the eu after 13 months of serb-albanian talks ended in deadlock . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 23.07.2007 ruling party wins turkish elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier erdogan -lrb- right -rrb- and his wife on sunday turkey 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- on monday prepared for its second five-year term in power after winning a landslide victory in legislative elections . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan had called sunday 's early election after his party was blocked from electing one of its own as president in april amid a secularist campaign accusing his akp party of seeking to erode turkey 's fiercely-guarded secular system . " our democracy has successfully passed a test ...
our unity , democracy and the republic have emerged stronger from the ballot box , " erdogan said overnight outside akp headquarters as fireworks lit up the sky and hundreds of supporters cheered . the governing party , which has its roots in a now-banned islamist movement , won 46.3 percent of the vote , leading its closest rival by a wide margin , according to unofficial results after 99.9 percent of the ballots were counted . it was the largest support a turkish party has gained since the 1969 legislative election .
a comfortable lead the support the akp garnered should translate into 339 seats in the 550-member parliament , enough for it to once again form a government on its own . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks voted sunday for a new parliament that will face a host of challenges the party had 352 members in the outgoing house and despite support for it increasing by 12 percentage points compared to 2002 , the number of its seats will decline because more parties will be represented in parliament . " we will pursue economic and democracy reforms with determination , " erdogan said , pledging also commitment to the secular system and turkey 's eu membership bid . the secularist main opposition republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- finished second with 20.9 percent of vote and an estimated 112 seats , according to unofficial results .
the right-wing nationalist action party -lrb- mhp -rrb- was third with 14.2 percent and 71 seats . no other party passed the 10-percent national threshold needed to enter parliament , but 28 independent candidates won seats , 24 of them kurds campaigning for broader rights for their sizeable community . populist policies with virtually no chance of actually winning government , the akp 's nearest rivals had campaigned on populist policies and waged a scare campaign that portrayed the government as being not only anti-secular but also of failing to adequately deal with rebels from the kurdish workers ' party , of whom around 3,500 are based in northern iraq . around 42.5 million people were eligible to vote in sunday 's election of 550 members of parliament .
ten people were injured in fighting at voting booths in the south-east , but in general voting was peaceful at 160,000 polling stations across the country .
erdogan was forced to call sunday 's election after a bungled attempt to place his right-hand man , foreign minister abdullah gül , in the presidential palace in ankara .
millions of people took to the streets to protest the prospect of gül becoming president .
they objected to gül 's past involvement in conservative islamist groups , the fact that his wife wears an islamic-style headscarf - no president 's wife in turkey has ever worn one - and also at the prospect of the akp controlling the government , the parliament and presidency .
the military stepped in in april effectively scuttling the presidential election process by declaring it would do whatever necessary to protect secularism . as soon as the new parliament opens , its first task will be to elect a new president . erdogan has said he will seek a compromise in the presidential election , but insists that the candidate must be from his party . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will not insist on an initial requirement of two years , " fotyga said , adding that she still expected a period lasting a " reasonable time " to be incorporated in the final document .
eu observers have said that period of time would likely be a maximum of four months .
draft ready by october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel forged the compromise with her european counterparts in june portuguese foreign minister luis amado , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , welcomed the polish statements and said he expected a draft of the reform treaty to be hammered out and agreed to by october and ratified by mid-2009 .
" we should be able to have a new treaty as soon as possible , " said amado .
" we have a commitment from all ... to meet these requirements . "
the european commission president jose manuel barroso urged all eu states to show " loyal and active support " to the portuguese eu presidency , saying it was time the bloc stopped feuding over institutions and faced key challenges of today .
" we need to work quickly but carefully , " barroso said .
political debate still to come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amado said he expects the draft treaty to be ready for approval in october amado added that monday 's talks focused on technical aspects of the draft treaty and that its political dimensions would be debated later .
eu legal experts will open discussions on the treaty in brussels on tuesday and are set to meet regularly until the bloc 's summit in lisbon in october .
" i envisage the possibility of some level of political discussion but not at the moment , " he said .
" it is vital that the union should not allow itself to be paralysed once again on account of internal , institutional problems , so that is may respond to the real challenges that it must face . "
under german chancellor angela merkel 's leadership , eu members agreed in june to a deal that would streamline the bloc by giving more power to its foreign policy chief , electing a long-term eu president and instituting changes to the bloc 's voting system .
luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn predicted that the treaty details could be finalized at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in early september but warned : " the devil is in the detail . "
the new amended treaty will replace an eu draft constitution which was rejected by dutch and french voters two years ago , plunging the bloc into crisis .

" after an initial scrutiny of the draft reform treaty we see that solutions proposed by ... the -lsb- eu -rsb- presidency are close to our expectations , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told a news conference after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
warsaw had initially insisted that groups of eu member states have the power to block contentious legislation for a two-year " period of scrutiny " but later dropped the demand .

" i favor the concept of an international troika , made up of the us , russia and eu , so with that we would have three international partners to negotiate with the serbs and the kosovars -lrb- ethnic albanians -rrb- , " steinmeier told reporters at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels .
he said that such a troika offered the " best chance " to secure a so far elusive deal on kosovo .
" i think that once russia and the united states sit at the table together , there will be a very real possibility that the kosovars and the serbs will start acting the way they should , " he said .
steinmeier 's proposal comes after russia last week threatened to veto yet another draft un security council resolution calling for supervised independence for kosovo .
steinmeier seeking alternative to contact group others , also seeking to avert a russian veto by putting preparations for the un resolution on hold , have said discussions on kosovo should be spearheaded by the contact group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier continues to push for supervised independence steinmeier said there was also a suggestion that un secretary-general ban ki-moon should appoint a new envoy to replace martti ahtisaari to mediate between serbs and kosovars .
however , the proposed troika discussions would continue to focus on ahtisaari 's plan for supervised independence for kosovo , steinmeier added .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn also said the eu wanted to move forward on the basis of ahtisaari 's recommendation that kosovo be granted " independence supervised by the international community . "
" if the contact group is going to have further negotiations we are of course ready to contribute to those , " rehn told reporters .
he warned that it is " essential that both parties including serbia take finally a constructive and realistic approach to these negotiations . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia and kosovo came to the table - but agreed to nothing luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn also backed steinmeier 's proposal , saying it was important that serbs and kosovars came back to the negotiating table .
" if they are not able to talk together about their future , then others will take the decisions , " asselborn said .
steinmeier said he had discussed his troika proposal with ban , russian foreign minister sergi lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
" now that we all have to presume there will not be a security council resolution , i feel it is important that we do n't leave the ongoing process to its own devices , " steinmeier said .

" it 's probably important that we establish our own position and are clear about the need for strong european leadership and strong european unity in this area , " he said .
russian resistance scuppers un resolution the europeans and their us allies on friday postponed attempts to secure a security council resolution that would have granted kosovo " supervised independence , " in the face of a likely russian veto .

" i think that once russia and the united states sit at the table together , there will be a very real possibility that the kosovars and the serbs will start acting the way they should , " he said .
steinmeier 's proposal comes after russia last week threatened to veto yet another draft un security council resolution calling for supervised independence for kosovo .
steinmeier seeking alternative to contact group others , also seeking to avert a russian veto by putting preparations for the un resolution on hold , have said discussions on kosovo should be spearheaded by the contact group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier continues to push for supervised independence steinmeier said there was also a suggestion that un secretary-general ban ki-moon should appoint a new envoy to replace martti ahtisaari to mediate between serbs and kosovars .
however , the proposed troika discussions would continue to focus on ahtisaari 's plan for supervised independence for kosovo , steinmeier added .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn also said the eu wanted to move forward on the basis of ahtisaari 's recommendation that kosovo be granted " independence supervised by the international community . "
" if the contact group is going to have further negotiations we are of course ready to contribute to those , " rehn told reporters .
he warned that it is " essential that both parties including serbia take finally a constructive and realistic approach to these negotiations . "
eu officials , however , once again stated that if the troika proposal was rejected and the issue moved to the contact group , it would be a temporary solution and that the un security council would have the final say to the status of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia and kosovo came to the table - but agreed to nothing luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn also backed steinmeier 's proposal , saying it was important that serbs and kosovars came back to the negotiating table .
" if they are not able to talk together about their future , then others will take the decisions , " asselborn said .
steinmeier said he had discussed his troika proposal with ban , russian foreign minister sergi lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
" now that we all have to presume there will not be a security council resolution , i feel it is important that we do n't leave the ongoing process to its own devices , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister stated that stability in the western balkans was a key eu priority , adding , " the international community needs therefore to maintain its joint responsibility towards the region . "
eu 's credibility at stake over kosovo other eu foreign ministers at the brussels meeting emphasized that the eu 's credibility was on the line over the resolution of kosovo ’ s status .
" the stability of the balkans , the unity of the european union , the credibility of us versus the united states and russia is at stake , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt , a balkans expert within the eu , told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish balkan expert bildt sees kosovo as the eu 's problem bildt added that unity between the eu states over kosovo was " absolutely paramount " if the issue of kosovo was to move from the un security council to the international contact group .
british foreign secretary david miliband echoed bildt 's statement on eu unity .
" it 's probably important that we establish our own position and are clear about the need for strong european leadership and strong european unity in this area , " he said .
russian resistance scuppers un resolution the europeans and their us allies on friday postponed attempts to secure a security council resolution that would have granted kosovo " supervised independence , " in the face of a likely russian veto .
russia , a strong ally of serbia , had complained that recognizing an independent kosovo would send the wrong signal to other breakaway regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is being backed in its stance by its ally russia serbia has said such a move would be a breach of its national sovereignty but concedes it could give special autonomy to kosovo .
after talks with rice on monday , kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said the province would work with the united states and europe to coordinate its future and not unilaterally declare independence .
" for us it is critical that the process is coordinated and moves ahead in close cooperation with the international community , the us and the european union in the first place , " he told the afp news agency .
" of course , a formal announcement of independence will happen in due course , but in cooperation and in close partnership with the countries which are supportive of the kosovo independence . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when a nato campaign drove out serb forces after accusing them of committing atrocities against ethnic albanians .

" our democracy has successfully passed a test ...
our unity , democracy and the republic have emerged stronger from the ballot box , " erdogan said overnight outside akp headquarters as fireworks lit up the sky and hundreds of supporters cheered . the governing party , which has its roots in a now-banned islamist movement , won 46.3 percent of the vote , leading its closest rival by a wide margin , according to unofficial results after 99.9 percent of the ballots were counted . it was the largest support a turkish party has gained since the 1969 legislative election .

" we can not be blackmailed . " she said she had " no new reliable information " regarding how the hostage died or on the whereabouts of the other man .
berlin has set up a crisis team to evaluate all information regarding the pair of germans kidnapped last week .
the two men were reported to be engineers working on a dam project south of kabul . though it is not a position shared by any of germany 's main political parties , a recent survey showed that some 60 percent of germans support pulling bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .

" " we have more hope of success for the release of both the south koreans and the german , " he said .

the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said the german interior ministry knew about 14 islamists from germany who had been in pakistan or were still there .
it added that authorities were calculating that more individuals from germany would be trained in al qaeda-run terrorist camps .
" a new quality in threat to germany " the weekly said at least seven islamists from germany had been arrested in pakistan over the past months and that islamabad was likely in the next few weeks to deport the men .
" we must assume that those who have come back from pakistan are planning attacks , " august hanning , germany 's deputy interior minister , said in an interview with the paper .
" we need to do everything possible to find out who went to pakistan and was trained there . "
he added that " this is a new , specific threat and is a cause for concern .
there is a new quality in the threat to germany . "
hanning added there were several indications that al qaeda had germany and german installations abroad , such as embassies , in its sight .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble echoed the view , saying there was a threat that suicide bombers were now being sent to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble says germany faces a new , concrete threat " there are a lot of concrete indications right up to the past few days that show that germany has increasingly moved into the crosshairs of international terrorism , " schäuble said in an interview with the bz am sonntag newspaper .
last month schäuble said authorities needed to increase vigilance due to the possibility that militants might carry out suicide attacks on german soil .
in april the us embassy in berlin announced it was boosting security at its facilities in germany in response to what it described as an increased threat of terrorism .
berlin has also said it believed there may be similar training camps in afghanistan , where germany has more than 3,000 troops stationed as part of a nato peacekeeping force .
the taliban has threatened to step up attacks on german troops . merkel supports online searches schäuble recently sparked controversy over comments that germany should clarify under what conditions the constitution permits the state to target and kill terrorists .
the tough-talking schäuble also pressed for changes in laws to allow pre-emptive detention of suspected militants and said authorities should have the right to prevent people they deem dangerous from using the internet and mobile phones .
the proposals have been criticized for eroding civil liberties .
but on sunday , schäuble received backing from german chancellor angela merkel for creating a legal framework to allow online searches of personal computers of suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has supported online searches of computers of suspected terrorists " we must look the threats in the eye and take them seriously , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .
" the interior minister has the freedom to think what needs to be done in the face of totally new threats . "
the issue has for weeks been a focus of heated debate between schäuble and german justice minister brigitte zypries .
on monday , members of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- urged zypries to expand the existing catalogue of anti-terrorism measures to include penalizing training in terrorism camps and the distribution of bomb-making manuals . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said the german interior ministry knew about 14 islamists from germany who had been in pakistan or were still there .
it added that authorities were calculating that more individuals from germany would be trained in al qaeda-run terrorist camps .
" a new quality in threat to germany " the weekly said at least seven islamists from germany had been arrested in pakistan over the past months and that islamabad was likely in the next few weeks to deport the men .
" we must assume that those who have come back from pakistan are planning attacks , " august hanning , germany 's deputy interior minister , said in an interview with the paper .
" we need to do everything possible to find out who went to pakistan and was trained there . "
he added that " this is a new , specific threat and is a cause for concern .
there is a new quality in the threat to germany . "
hanning added there were several indications that al qaeda had germany and german installations abroad , such as embassies , in its sight .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble echoed the view , saying there was a threat that suicide bombers were now being sent to europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble says germany faces a new , concrete threat " there are a lot of concrete indications right up to the past few days that show that germany has increasingly moved into the crosshairs of international terrorism , " schäuble said in an interview with the bz am sonntag newspaper .
last month schäuble said authorities needed to increase vigilance due to the possibility that militants might carry out suicide attacks on german soil .
in april the us embassy in berlin announced it was boosting security at its facilities in germany in response to what it described as an increased threat of terrorism .
berlin has also said it believed there may be similar training camps in afghanistan , where germany has more than 3,000 troops stationed as part of a nato peacekeeping force .
the taliban has threatened to step up attacks on german troops . merkel supports online searches schäuble recently sparked controversy over comments that germany should clarify under what conditions the constitution permits the state to target and kill terrorists .
the tough-talking schäuble also pressed for changes in laws to allow pre-emptive detention of suspected militants and said authorities should have the right to prevent people they deem dangerous from using the internet and mobile phones .
the proposals have been criticized for eroding civil liberties .
but on sunday , schäuble received backing from german chancellor angela merkel for creating a legal framework to allow online searches of personal computers of suspected terrorists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has supported online searches of computers of suspected terrorists " we must look the threats in the eye and take them seriously , " merkel said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .
" the interior minister has the freedom to think what needs to be done in the face of totally new threats . "
the issue has for weeks been a focus of heated debate between schäuble and german justice minister brigitte zypries .
on monday , members of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- urged zypries to expand the existing catalogue of anti-terrorism measures to include penalizing training in terrorism camps and the distribution of bomb-making manuals . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , a new exhibition has opened which tells the story of those who were incarcerated and who lost their lives there . a postcard in one of the first display rooms of the new museum reads : " greetings from flossenbürg . "
the friendly greeting is positioned under a picture of the historic castle ruins for which the small town on the german-czech border is still well known for .
in fact , while the postcard is from the 1920s , it could be from the present day .
what flossenbürg is less famous - or notorious - for is that it was the location for one of the nazis ' 12 largest concentration camps ; the camp where german theologian dietrich bonhoeffer died along with tens of thousands of other victims .
after the war , the camp and its history slowly slipped into oblivion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietrich bonhoeffer was one of the tens of thousands to be killed at flossenbürg but the new exhibition , which opened to the public on sunday , more than 60 years after the camp was liberated , aims to commemorate those who lost their lives at flossenbürg and its surrounding camps and return its role in the " final solution " to the modern history books .
after being liberated , the camp became the site of residential buildings and a toy factory moved into its empty warehouse .
only in the 1980s did a small exhibit about the camp first appear .
one of the main reasons it took so long for the camp to be remembered has much to do with the demographics of those who were imprisoned there .
" two thirds of the prisoners were eastern europeans , " said christian omonsky , the press coordinator of the flossenbürg exhibit , adding that the process of recounting the stories and compiling the evidence could only begin after the iron curtain fell and the former prisoners were able to visit the camp in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of its liberation .
since then - with the help of survivors , local people and historians - omonsky , museum director jörg skriebeleit and the rest of the museum 's staff have created a memorial for the concentration camp .
painstaking research to create memorial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family photos show lives about to be changed forever the exhibition is the result of four years of extensive research by skriebeleit and his team .
their research included hundreds of interviews with former prisoners to fill in the gaps of the camp 's history .
the work recreates an authentic snapshot of everyday life in the camp , one which not only shows the suffering of the prisoners but also the lives of those responsible for the suffering .
for example , photos of ss officers enjoying leisure time feature alongside pictures of emaciated inmates .
during world war ii , flossenbürg was an administrative center for 90 camps in bavaria , bohemia and saxony .
jews , sinti and roma were locked up in these camps along with political dissidents , prisoners of war , homosexuals and " professional criminals . "
in total , the camps held around16,000 women and 84,000 men .
in flossenbürg and its surrounding camps almost 30,000 prisoners died as a result of murder by ss officers , hard labor and accidents in the nearby stone quarry , frostbite or illnesses such as pneumonia and tuberculosis .
until recently , those who died were only numbers in a ledger .
" we would like to give these victims who had disappeared from the public consciousness for decades a human face , " said skriebeleit .
the central hall of the exhibition attempts to do just that with a selection of personal photographs from prisoners , taken before they were deported .
the images of families , holidays , young lovers , weddings and smiling youths give a clear indication of what was taken from these people when imprisioned within the confines of the camp .
ordinary lives swapped for horror and death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skriebeleit and a model of the war-time camp texts accompanying the photos explain the victims ' fates and artwork from survivors depict the horrors they may have experienced .
one drawing shows the execution of five prisoners in front of a christmas tree while the rest of the camp looks on .
while it has taken many years to bring flossenbürg out of the shadows of history , the survivors of the camp have visited regularly since they have been able to .
" for the survivors , returning always reminds us of the past , " said lisa mikova from prague .
" but we want to tell school children , for instance , about our history in the hope that we can warn them about the dangers of fascism . "
mikova was sent to the camp in 1942 because she was jewish .
her parents , her parents-in-law and a brother-in-law were killed in auschwitz .
she was sent to a camp in freiberg .
" there we had to work extremely hard in an airplane factory , for 12 hours a day , " mikova said .
" then we had to go through the town to get to the camp huts .
it was very cold , because we were dressed very poorly , without underwear and we only had clogs .
our heads were shaved bald .
and there was not a lot to eat - only a little bit of brown water that they called coffee as well as weak soup and a piece of bread . "
sunday 's opening attracted a number of prominent figures .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier attended along with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , whose father was a prisoner in flossenbürg .
charlotte knobloch of germany 's central council of jews , romani rose from the central council of the sinti and roma and israeli ambassador shimon stein were also there .
there were also 84 former prisoners among those viewing the exhibition , an experience that was difficult for many .
mikova , however , was one of those ready to face the past .
" of course there are things which remain with us , things that one can never forget or get over , " she said .

the 39th session of the un committee of the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women -lrb- cedaw -rrb- begins monday .
dw-world.de talked to an expert about victims of human trafficking . katrin adams is the executive officer of kok – a german ngo working to combat exploitation and support women trafficked to germany .
dw-world.de : what does your organization do to fight trafficking of women ?
katrin adams : we have two main areas that we concentrate on .
firstly , combating trafficking in women and secondly , combating violence against women in the process of migration .
we are a network of 37 member organizations – women ’ s organizations and counseling centers .
we are a specialist lobby in berlin and we lobby for improvement of the individual situations of the victims of human trafficking .
what does the un convention say on human trafficking ?
they have a specialized article , which is article 6 , which says that state parties shall take all appropriate measures , including legislation , to suppress all forms of trafficking of women and exploitation by prostitution of women .
how useful is the convention in practice ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a survivor of trafficking in moscow the convention is very useful in that it has a reporting system .
that means that governments have to report on their specific improvements on their work when it comes to the implementation of the standards set in the convention .
with regards article 6 it means that states have to tell you something and they have to summarize what they have done to reach these objectives set out in article 6 .
for us as an ngo it is a good opportunity for us to lobby for our demands because normally the committee accepts the shadow reports .
a shadow report is prepared by ngos in which they give addition information and comment on the government reports .
do you prepare shadow reports ?
we , the kok , normally comment very specifically on article 6 in a shadow report .
we would comment on the report submitted by germany .
we work at a very national level .
that means we concentrate on the situation of victims of human trafficking here in germany .
this year the government released its report , including a section on article 6 .
at the moment we are critically reviewing what they have said and we will definitely comment critically on what the government says .
why will you be critical of the german government ?
because there has been some legislation passed this year by parliament which will enter into force in autumn .
that special legislation has , in our opinion , some flaws when it comes to an adequate treatment of victims of human trafficking .
we think germany should do better .
what is the extent of trafficking in women to germany ?
unfortunately i can ’ t give you as a definite answer on that because we think the numbers that are known about are only a fraction of what is actually happening .
the numbers that are most reliable are those published by the federal criminal office .
the number of victims officially known about in 2005 was 642 .
but we are working on the basis that the actual number is much higher .
what sort of cases are these ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demanding education to rebuild women 's lives we have a lot very different cases .
there is no single procedure .
normally women are brought into germany and they have been deceived or threatened .
they are promised that they will get work in restaurants or bars and then they discover they have to work as prostitutes .
some women do come to germany knowing that they might be working as prostitutes and then find the work conditions are exploitative , which they wouldn ’ t have been aware of before they came .
when it comes to trafficking in human beings , there is also the issue of being forced into labor or marriage , that ’ s an issue that has not really been dealt with a lot .
where are these women mostly coming from ?
mostly from countries in eastern europe , although the numbers of women that are being forced into prostitution that are germans and being trafficked within germany is rising too .
when your organization and the un cedaw committee are critical of the german government , how much notice do they take ?
normally , what the committee does is adopt concluding comments , and as far as i know they are being taken seriously .
that means that the government tries to consider what the committee says and act accordingly .
in some cases it ’ s just political goodwill and nothing actually happens but in some cases the observations and concluding comments are quite useful and there is actually change in the political environment .
what sort of changes would you like to see the government implement to protect women who have been trafficked to germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kok also campaigns on violence against women what we would like to see is women who have been trafficked become entitled to permanent residency in germany .
at the moment the legal conditions are quite strict when it comes to getting residency .

the 39th session of the un committee of the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women -lrb- cedaw -rrb- begins monday .
dw-world.de talked to an expert about victims of human trafficking . katrin adams is the executive officer of kok – a german ngo working to combat exploitation and support women trafficked to germany .
dw-world.de : what does your organization do to fight trafficking of women ?
katrin adams : we have two main areas that we concentrate on .
firstly , combating trafficking in women and secondly , combating violence against women in the process of migration .
we are a network of 37 member organizations – women ’ s organizations and counseling centers .
we are a specialist lobby in berlin and we lobby for improvement of the individual situations of the victims of human trafficking .
what does the un convention say on human trafficking ?
they have a specialized article , which is article 6 , which says that state parties shall take all appropriate measures , including legislation , to suppress all forms of trafficking of women and exploitation by prostitution of women .
how useful is the convention in practice ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a survivor of trafficking in moscow the convention is very useful in that it has a reporting system .
that means that governments have to report on their specific improvements on their work when it comes to the implementation of the standards set in the convention .
with regards article 6 it means that states have to tell you something and they have to summarize what they have done to reach these objectives set out in article 6 .
for us as an ngo it is a good opportunity for us to lobby for our demands because normally the committee accepts the shadow reports .
a shadow report is prepared by ngos in which they give addition information and comment on the government reports .
do you prepare shadow reports ?
we , the kok , normally comment very specifically on article 6 in a shadow report .
we would comment on the report submitted by germany .
we work at a very national level .
that means we concentrate on the situation of victims of human trafficking here in germany .
this year the government released its report , including a section on article 6 .
at the moment we are critically reviewing what they have said and we will definitely comment critically on what the government says .
why will you be critical of the german government ?
because there has been some legislation passed this year by parliament which will enter into force in autumn .
that special legislation has , in our opinion , some flaws when it comes to an adequate treatment of victims of human trafficking .
we think germany should do better .
what is the extent of trafficking in women to germany ?
unfortunately i can ’ t give you as a definite answer on that because we think the numbers that are known about are only a fraction of what is actually happening .
the numbers that are most reliable are those published by the federal criminal office .
the number of victims officially known about in 2005 was 642 .

the two men were reported to be engineers working on a dam project south of kabul . though it is not a position shared by any of germany 's main political parties , a recent survey showed that some 60 percent of germans support pulling bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .

it 's the second 24-hour extension the militants have given the south korean government . " since the afghan government has not sincerely tried to solve the problem , this time we are giving another 24 hours to the korean government to solve the matter yousuf told the dpa news agency . afghan interior ministry spokesman zemarai bashary said earlier that authorities were " working on the issue constantly , around the clock . " " we have more hope of success for the release of both the south koreans and the german , " he said .
" we hope to win their release via talks rather than military operations . " taliban leaders said the hostages would be killed if the troops mounted a raid to free the prisoners . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 39th session of the un committee of the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women -lrb- cedaw -rrb- begins monday .
dw-world.de talked to an expert about victims of human trafficking . katrin adams is the executive officer of kok – a german ngo working to combat exploitation and support women trafficked to germany .
dw-world.de : what does your organization do to fight trafficking of women ?
katrin adams : we have two main areas that we concentrate on .
firstly , combating trafficking in women and secondly , combating violence against women in the process of migration .
we are a network of 37 member organizations – women ’ s organizations and counseling centers .
we are a specialist lobby in berlin and we lobby for improvement of the individual situations of the victims of human trafficking .
what does the un convention say on human trafficking ?
they have a specialized article , which is article 6 , which says that state parties shall take all appropriate measures , including legislation , to suppress all forms of trafficking of women and exploitation by prostitution of women .
how useful is the convention in practice ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a survivor of trafficking in moscow the convention is very useful in that it has a reporting system .
that means that governments have to report on their specific improvements on their work when it comes to the implementation of the standards set in the convention .
with regards article 6 it means that states have to tell you something and they have to summarize what they have done to reach these objectives set out in article 6 .
for us as an ngo it is a good opportunity for us to lobby for our demands because normally the committee accepts the shadow reports .
a shadow report is prepared by ngos in which they give addition information and comment on the government reports .
do you prepare shadow reports ?
we , the kok , normally comment very specifically on article 6 in a shadow report .
we would comment on the report submitted by germany .
we work at a very national level .
that means we concentrate on the situation of victims of human trafficking here in germany .
this year the government released its report , including a section on article 6 .
at the moment we are critically reviewing what they have said and we will definitely comment critically on what the government says .
why will you be critical of the german government ?
because there has been some legislation passed this year by parliament which will enter into force in autumn .
that special legislation has , in our opinion , some flaws when it comes to an adequate treatment of victims of human trafficking .
we think germany should do better .
what is the extent of trafficking in women to germany ?
unfortunately i can ’ t give you as a definite answer on that because we think the numbers that are known about are only a fraction of what is actually happening .
the numbers that are most reliable are those published by the federal criminal office .
the number of victims officially known about in 2005 was 642 .
but we are working on the basis that the actual number is much higher .
what sort of cases are these ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demanding education to rebuild women 's lives we have a lot very different cases .
there is no single procedure .
normally women are brought into germany and they have been deceived or threatened .
they are promised that they will get work in restaurants or bars and then they discover they have to work as prostitutes .
some women do come to germany knowing that they might be working as prostitutes and then find the work conditions are exploitative , which they wouldn ’ t have been aware of before they came .
when it comes to trafficking in human beings , there is also the issue of being forced into labor or marriage , that ’ s an issue that has not really been dealt with a lot .
where are these women mostly coming from ?
mostly from countries in eastern europe , although the numbers of women that are being forced into prostitution that are germans and being trafficked within germany is rising too .
when your organization and the un cedaw committee are critical of the german government , how much notice do they take ?
normally , what the committee does is adopt concluding comments , and as far as i know they are being taken seriously .
that means that the government tries to consider what the committee says and act accordingly .
in some cases it ’ s just political goodwill and nothing actually happens but in some cases the observations and concluding comments are quite useful and there is actually change in the political environment .
what sort of changes would you like to see the government implement to protect women who have been trafficked to germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kok also campaigns on violence against women what we would like to see is women who have been trafficked become entitled to permanent residency in germany .
at the moment the legal conditions are quite strict when it comes to getting residency .
secondly , coverage of basic needs including medical treatment and psychological help is often not provided .
we would like them to have a legal right to this basic coverage .
another important point is access to further education , especially language courses , so that women who decide to stay here once they have been released have an opportunity to build a normal life .
we are lobbying too for access to the labor market .
is it possible to prevent women being trafficked to germany ?
this is more the work of ngos in the countries of origin .
we are in contact with networks of ngos in these countries .
if there is a need and if we can help by supporting these ngos in that specific countries then we do what we can , but it ’ s not one of our main activities . emma wynne interviewed katrin adams send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , a new exhibition has opened which tells the story of those who were incarcerated and who lost their lives there . a postcard in one of the first display rooms of the new museum reads : " greetings from flossenbürg . "
the friendly greeting is positioned under a picture of the historic castle ruins for which the small town on the german-czech border is still well known for .
in fact , while the postcard is from the 1920s , it could be from the present day .
what flossenbürg is less famous - or notorious - for is that it was the location for one of the nazis ' 12 largest concentration camps ; the camp where german theologian dietrich bonhoeffer died along with tens of thousands of other victims .
after the war , the camp and its history slowly slipped into oblivion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietrich bonhoeffer was one of the tens of thousands to be killed at flossenbürg but the new exhibition , which opened to the public on sunday , more than 60 years after the camp was liberated , aims to commemorate those who lost their lives at flossenbürg and its surrounding camps and return its role in the " final solution " to the modern history books .
after being liberated , the camp became the site of residential buildings and a toy factory moved into its empty warehouse .
only in the 1980s did a small exhibit about the camp first appear .
one of the main reasons it took so long for the camp to be remembered has much to do with the demographics of those who were imprisoned there .
" two thirds of the prisoners were eastern europeans , " said christian omonsky , the press coordinator of the flossenbürg exhibit , adding that the process of recounting the stories and compiling the evidence could only begin after the iron curtain fell and the former prisoners were able to visit the camp in 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of its liberation .
since then - with the help of survivors , local people and historians - omonsky , museum director jörg skriebeleit and the rest of the museum 's staff have created a memorial for the concentration camp .
painstaking research to create memorial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family photos show lives about to be changed forever the exhibition is the result of four years of extensive research by skriebeleit and his team .
their research included hundreds of interviews with former prisoners to fill in the gaps of the camp 's history .
the work recreates an authentic snapshot of everyday life in the camp , one which not only shows the suffering of the prisoners but also the lives of those responsible for the suffering .
for example , photos of ss officers enjoying leisure time feature alongside pictures of emaciated inmates .
during world war ii , flossenbürg was an administrative center for 90 camps in bavaria , bohemia and saxony .
jews , sinti and roma were locked up in these camps along with political dissidents , prisoners of war , homosexuals and " professional criminals . "
in total , the camps held around16,000 women and 84,000 men .
in flossenbürg and its surrounding camps almost 30,000 prisoners died as a result of murder by ss officers , hard labor and accidents in the nearby stone quarry , frostbite or illnesses such as pneumonia and tuberculosis .
until recently , those who died were only numbers in a ledger .
" we would like to give these victims who had disappeared from the public consciousness for decades a human face , " said skriebeleit .
the central hall of the exhibition attempts to do just that with a selection of personal photographs from prisoners , taken before they were deported .
the images of families , holidays , young lovers , weddings and smiling youths give a clear indication of what was taken from these people when imprisioned within the confines of the camp .
ordinary lives swapped for horror and death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skriebeleit and a model of the war-time camp texts accompanying the photos explain the victims ' fates and artwork from survivors depict the horrors they may have experienced .
one drawing shows the execution of five prisoners in front of a christmas tree while the rest of the camp looks on .
while it has taken many years to bring flossenbürg out of the shadows of history , the survivors of the camp have visited regularly since they have been able to .
" for the survivors , returning always reminds us of the past , " said lisa mikova from prague .
" but we want to tell school children , for instance , about our history in the hope that we can warn them about the dangers of fascism . "
mikova was sent to the camp in 1942 because she was jewish .
her parents , her parents-in-law and a brother-in-law were killed in auschwitz .
she was sent to a camp in freiberg .
" there we had to work extremely hard in an airplane factory , for 12 hours a day , " mikova said .
" then we had to go through the town to get to the camp huts .
it was very cold , because we were dressed very poorly , without underwear and we only had clogs .
our heads were shaved bald .
and there was not a lot to eat - only a little bit of brown water that they called coffee as well as weak soup and a piece of bread . "
sunday 's opening attracted a number of prominent figures .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier attended along with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , whose father was a prisoner in flossenbürg .
charlotte knobloch of germany 's central council of jews , romani rose from the central council of the sinti and roma and israeli ambassador shimon stein were also there .
there were also 84 former prisoners among those viewing the exhibition , an experience that was difficult for many .
mikova , however , was one of those ready to face the past .
" of course there are things which remain with us , things that one can never forget or get over , " she said .

warsaw had initially insisted that groups of eu member states have the power to block contentious legislation for a two-year " period of scrutiny " but later dropped the demand .

" after an initial scrutiny of the draft reform treaty we see that solutions proposed by ... the -lsb- eu -rsb- presidency are close to our expectations , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told a news conference after a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
warsaw had initially insisted that groups of eu member states have the power to block contentious legislation for a two-year " period of scrutiny " but later dropped the demand .
" we will not insist on an initial requirement of two years , " fotyga said , adding that she still expected a period lasting a " reasonable time " to be incorporated in the final document .
eu observers have said that period of time would likely be a maximum of four months .
draft ready by october bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel forged the compromise with her european counterparts in june portuguese foreign minister luis amado , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , welcomed the polish statements and said he expected a draft of the reform treaty to be hammered out and agreed to by october and ratified by mid-2009 .
" we should be able to have a new treaty as soon as possible , " said amado .
" we have a commitment from all ... to meet these requirements . "
the european commission president jose manuel barroso urged all eu states to show " loyal and active support " to the portuguese eu presidency , saying it was time the bloc stopped feuding over institutions and faced key challenges of today .
" we need to work quickly but carefully , " barroso said .
political debate still to come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amado said he expects the draft treaty to be ready for approval in october amado added that monday 's talks focused on technical aspects of the draft treaty and that its political dimensions would be debated later .
eu legal experts will open discussions on the treaty in brussels on tuesday and are set to meet regularly until the bloc 's summit in lisbon in october .
" i envisage the possibility of some level of political discussion but not at the moment , " he said .
" it is vital that the union should not allow itself to be paralysed once again on account of internal , institutional problems , so that is may respond to the real challenges that it must face . "
under german chancellor angela merkel 's leadership , eu members agreed in june to a deal that would streamline the bloc by giving more power to its foreign policy chief , electing a long-term eu president and instituting changes to the bloc 's voting system .
luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn predicted that the treaty details could be finalized at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in early september but warned : " the devil is in the detail . "
the new amended treaty will replace an eu draft constitution which was rejected by dutch and french voters two years ago , plunging the bloc into crisis .

" the german national and four afghans we had reported to have killed are still alive , " qari mohammad yousuf , told reuters from an unknown location by telephone . in exchange for the hostages ' release , yousuf said the taliban demanded the release of 10 prisoners held by the afghan government and the withdrawal of germany 's 3,000 troops stationed in afghanistan . other news agencies reported similar statements and demands from taliban leaders on monday . the body of a second german found over the weekend was returned to germany for an autopsy on monday .
it remained unclear whether the man , identified as rüdiger b. , died of gunshot wounds or if his captors shot his body after his death .
the german government has said he was not executed . crisis team still at work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crisis team is still working to locate the german hostage in berlin , chancellor angela merkel said on sunday in a television interview that germany would not allow itself to be blackmailed by the taliban . " we are not going to respond to demands from the area of the taliban , " merkel told the ard public television .
" we can not be blackmailed . " she said she had " no new reliable information " regarding how the hostage died or on the whereabouts of the other man .
berlin has set up a crisis team to evaluate all information regarding the pair of germans kidnapped last week .
the two men were reported to be engineers working on a dam project south of kabul . though it is not a position shared by any of germany 's main political parties , a recent survey showed that some 60 percent of germans support pulling bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
this autumn , the german parliament is scheduled to debate whether to extend the three mandates governing the army 's deployment to afghanistan . south koreans ' ultimatum extended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the south koreans were kidnapped on one of the main highways leading out of kabul taliban rebels also extended the deadline on monday for their demands to be met before killing 23 south korean hostages seized thursday .
it 's the second 24-hour extension the militants have given the south korean government . " since the afghan government has not sincerely tried to solve the problem , this time we are giving another 24 hours to the korean government to solve the matter yousuf told the dpa news agency . afghan interior ministry spokesman zemarai bashary said earlier that authorities were " working on the issue constantly , around the clock . " " we have more hope of success for the release of both the south koreans and the german , " he said .

" i favor the concept of an international troika , made up of the us , russia and eu , so with that we would have three international partners to negotiate with the serbs and the kosovars -lrb- ethnic albanians -rrb- , " steinmeier told reporters at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels .
he said that such a troika offered the " best chance " to secure a so far elusive deal on kosovo .
" i think that once russia and the united states sit at the table together , there will be a very real possibility that the kosovars and the serbs will start acting the way they should , " he said .
steinmeier 's proposal comes after russia last week threatened to veto yet another draft un security council resolution calling for supervised independence for kosovo .
steinmeier seeking alternative to contact group others , also seeking to avert a russian veto by putting preparations for the un resolution on hold , have said discussions on kosovo should be spearheaded by the contact group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier continues to push for supervised independence steinmeier said there was also a suggestion that un secretary-general ban ki-moon should appoint a new envoy to replace martti ahtisaari to mediate between serbs and kosovars .
however , the proposed troika discussions would continue to focus on ahtisaari 's plan for supervised independence for kosovo , steinmeier added .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn also said the eu wanted to move forward on the basis of ahtisaari 's recommendation that kosovo be granted " independence supervised by the international community . "
" if the contact group is going to have further negotiations we are of course ready to contribute to those , " rehn told reporters .
he warned that it is " essential that both parties including serbia take finally a constructive and realistic approach to these negotiations . "
eu officials , however , once again stated that if the troika proposal was rejected and the issue moved to the contact group , it would be a temporary solution and that the un security council would have the final say to the status of kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia and kosovo came to the table - but agreed to nothing luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn also backed steinmeier 's proposal , saying it was important that serbs and kosovars came back to the negotiating table .
" if they are not able to talk together about their future , then others will take the decisions , " asselborn said .
steinmeier said he had discussed his troika proposal with ban , russian foreign minister sergi lavrov and us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
" now that we all have to presume there will not be a security council resolution , i feel it is important that we do n't leave the ongoing process to its own devices , " steinmeier said .
the german foreign minister stated that stability in the western balkans was a key eu priority , adding , " the international community needs therefore to maintain its joint responsibility towards the region . "
eu 's credibility at stake over kosovo other eu foreign ministers at the brussels meeting emphasized that the eu 's credibility was on the line over the resolution of kosovo ’ s status .
" the stability of the balkans , the unity of the european union , the credibility of us versus the united states and russia is at stake , " swedish foreign minister carl bildt , a balkans expert within the eu , told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish balkan expert bildt sees kosovo as the eu 's problem bildt added that unity between the eu states over kosovo was " absolutely paramount " if the issue of kosovo was to move from the un security council to the international contact group .
british foreign secretary david miliband echoed bildt 's statement on eu unity .
" it 's probably important that we establish our own position and are clear about the need for strong european leadership and strong european unity in this area , " he said .
russian resistance scuppers un resolution the europeans and their us allies on friday postponed attempts to secure a security council resolution that would have granted kosovo " supervised independence , " in the face of a likely russian veto .
russia , a strong ally of serbia , had complained that recognizing an independent kosovo would send the wrong signal to other breakaway regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia is being backed in its stance by its ally russia serbia has said such a move would be a breach of its national sovereignty but concedes it could give special autonomy to kosovo .
after talks with rice on monday , kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said the province would work with the united states and europe to coordinate its future and not unilaterally declare independence .
" for us it is critical that the process is coordinated and moves ahead in close cooperation with the international community , the us and the european union in the first place , " he told the afp news agency .
" of course , a formal announcement of independence will happen in due course , but in cooperation and in close partnership with the countries which are supportive of the kosovo independence . "
kosovo has been under un administration since 1999 , when a nato campaign drove out serb forces after accusing them of committing atrocities against ethnic albanians .
in april this year , ahtisaari proposed independence under the supervision of the eu after 13 months of serb-albanian talks ended in deadlock . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany can help you find it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ben donald goes native jaded by the globalization of travel , writer ben donald wanted to go somewhere - anywhere - not yet colonized by the " distasteful hordes . "
his personal patch of paradise turns out to be closer than expected - germany . " this is the not so lonely planet we are living on , " explains a character in donald 's recently published travelogue , " springtime for germany - or how i learned to love lederhosen . " but discerning globetrotters need not despair . " there is a new frontier , " he goes on .
" a lost , or rather overlooked horizon ; a place that is remaining undiscovered , cloaked in poisonous myth and all but unvisited , as we speak , for over 60 years since it became obscured from the minds of most of the world . " is that really germany he 's talking about ? initiated readers may be puzzled to hear it described in such terms .
but wait , he has a point , does n't he ?
it is better than its reputation .
in fact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who could resist germany 's biooodiful fräuleins ? ...

so why does this much-maligned country get short shrift with travelers , or , in donald-speak , " chavelers " ?
determined to get to the bottom of it , he sets out to discover the real germany .
and guess what ?
contrary to popular belief - at least the one defined by tabloid britain - there 's more to deutschland than soccer coaches with mullets , disney castles and nude bathers .

in the chapter headed gemütlichkeit , he snuggles up with the bavarians at the annual oktoberfest , heads to berlin to capture the zeitgeist , gets the measure of grossmansucht on hamburg 's reeperbahn and meets a german stand-up comedian in schadenfreude . it proves to be a journey of enlightenment . " i am inclined to judge the depth of a man 's civilization by his opinion of germany and her culture , " he concludes . dw-world.de spoke to ben donald and asked him why , if germany 's so great , does britain still harp on about men in socks and sandals , girls with hairy armpits , and of course , david hasselhof . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the definitive guide to the real germany ?
you decide .
ben donald : well , if you 're writing a book about germany you have to use the stereotypes simply because they provide so much material , and humor is a key way of attracting people to a subject .
the british do the same with other countries too .
the stereotypical battle over the sun loungers is an entirely anglo-german issue - italians wouldn ‘ t take a blind bit of notice of a towel on a sun lounger , they ‘ d just sit down and ignore it .
the thing is , the english and the germans are quite similar in their approach to staking out territory and personal privacy . ultimately , the book said as much about brits as it did about germany . good !
that ‘ s how it should be .
i wanted to pitch myself as a kind of everyman , and the idea was that the book would show some sort of development from my original position .
i couldn ‘ t start out being a germanophile .
and in the course of the journey , i as the narrator also reveal a great deal about the british . but there was the assumption that readers would recognize and agree with britain 's stereotypes about germany . to go back to the genesis of this book , there 's simply nothing in the travel bookshops about germany , nothing lighthearted , nothing extolling the delights of the german countryside and way of life .
why is that , when there are hundreds about italy and france and spain ?
there 's something stopping people in britain from seeing germany as a holiday destination and romanticizing a view of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen 's famous cliffs when i do radio interviews in britain , the first questions are invariably : is n't germany just about sausages and dodgy wine , v olksmusik and nena ?
so these stereotypes do still exist - but they 've become more playful , they 're not malicious at all .
and while german ambassadors to britain always get involved with debates with the uk tabloids about how they treat germany , it should be pointed out that the british do this with everyone !
we 're terrible when it comes to xenophobic tendencies . in the book i focus on how germans are extraordinarily introspective and self questioning , and perhaps they just need to see anglo-german attitudes in the context of british xenophobia towards other countries too . even when brits are telling you how much they love france , the wine , the chateaux , their gites and so on , they ca n't help saying it 's just a shame about all the frenchmen in it .
the english view of france , as you see in books such as " a year in the merde " by stephen clarke , is also very stereotypical . but germans might still find the stereotypes offensive ... but what the book does is take these clichés and explode them .
there are few nazi references in it , because i specifically did n't want to write a book only about the war .
when i refer to lebensraum , for example , i explain what it is .
i mention kraft durch freude and the prora resort on rügen as an example of the socialism aspect we rarely talk about in the context of national socialism . i tried to see where the stereotypes are rooted and then to supply a deeper cultural reading .
when i wanted to explore - albeit in a jocular fashion - where germany 's thing about nudism has its roots , i tied it together with the specifically german interpretation of the hippy movement , the second world war and germany 's tradition of the kur -lsb- spa -rsb- culture .
what i did was find plausible explanations as to why these stereotypes emerged in the first place . you could argue that germans , who are quite serious , are the antithesis of the brits , who tend to be relentlessly ironic and su per cilious .
is it basically a per sonality clash ? but they do get on in many areas .
doing business with germans is an utter pleasure and in many ways we have a lot in common .

germany can help you find it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ben donald goes native jaded by the globalization of travel , writer ben donald wanted to go somewhere - anywhere - not yet colonized by the " distasteful hordes . "
his personal patch of paradise turns out to be closer than expected - germany . " this is the not so lonely planet we are living on , " explains a character in donald 's recently published travelogue , " springtime for germany - or how i learned to love lederhosen . " but discerning globetrotters need not despair . " there is a new frontier , " he goes on .
" a lost , or rather overlooked horizon ; a place that is remaining undiscovered , cloaked in poisonous myth and all but unvisited , as we speak , for over 60 years since it became obscured from the minds of most of the world . " is that really germany he 's talking about ? initiated readers may be puzzled to hear it described in such terms .
but wait , he has a point , does n't he ?
it is better than its reputation .
in fact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who could resist germany 's biooodiful fräuleins ? ... " it is a european shangri-la : a romantic , wooded place , a country of rivers , vineyards , forests , castles , poetry and music ... of fast cars , schöne ladies - ' ver ze girls are biooodiful . '
a country preserved by neglect ; ripe and waiting to be revealed again . " blimey .
so why does this much-maligned country get short shrift with travelers , or , in donald-speak , " chavelers " ?
determined to get to the bottom of it , he sets out to discover the real germany .
and guess what ?
contrary to popular belief - at least the one defined by tabloid britain - there 's more to deutschland than soccer coaches with mullets , disney castles and nude bathers .
and no , sturm und drang do n't make hi-fis , and fkk has nothing to do with the ku klux klan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red lights on the reeperbahn as he scuppers the clichés with the same doggedness he mocks the germans for , donald gets to grips with the concepts he feels best sum up the essence of germany and germans .
in the chapter headed gemütlichkeit , he snuggles up with the bavarians at the annual oktoberfest , heads to berlin to capture the zeitgeist , gets the measure of grossmansucht on hamburg 's reeperbahn and meets a german stand-up comedian in schadenfreude . it proves to be a journey of enlightenment . " i am inclined to judge the depth of a man 's civilization by his opinion of germany and her culture , " he concludes . dw-world.de spoke to ben donald and asked him why , if germany 's so great , does britain still harp on about men in socks and sandals , girls with hairy armpits , and of course , david hasselhof . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the definitive guide to the real germany ?
you decide .
ben donald : well , if you 're writing a book about germany you have to use the stereotypes simply because they provide so much material , and humor is a key way of attracting people to a subject .
the british do the same with other countries too .
the stereotypical battle over the sun loungers is an entirely anglo-german issue - italians wouldn ‘ t take a blind bit of notice of a towel on a sun lounger , they ‘ d just sit down and ignore it .
the thing is , the english and the germans are quite similar in their approach to staking out territory and personal privacy . ultimately , the book said as much about brits as it did about germany . good !
that ‘ s how it should be .
i wanted to pitch myself as a kind of everyman , and the idea was that the book would show some sort of development from my original position .
i couldn ‘ t start out being a germanophile .
and in the course of the journey , i as the narrator also reveal a great deal about the british . but there was the assumption that readers would recognize and agree with britain 's stereotypes about germany . to go back to the genesis of this book , there 's simply nothing in the travel bookshops about germany , nothing lighthearted , nothing extolling the delights of the german countryside and way of life .
why is that , when there are hundreds about italy and france and spain ?
there 's something stopping people in britain from seeing germany as a holiday destination and romanticizing a view of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen 's famous cliffs when i do radio interviews in britain , the first questions are invariably : is n't germany just about sausages and dodgy wine , v olksmusik and nena ?
so these stereotypes do still exist - but they 've become more playful , they 're not malicious at all .
and while german ambassadors to britain always get involved with debates with the uk tabloids about how they treat germany , it should be pointed out that the british do this with everyone !
we 're terrible when it comes to xenophobic tendencies . in the book i focus on how germans are extraordinarily introspective and self questioning , and perhaps they just need to see anglo-german attitudes in the context of british xenophobia towards other countries too . even when brits are telling you how much they love france , the wine , the chateaux , their gites and so on , they ca n't help saying it 's just a shame about all the frenchmen in it .
the english view of france , as you see in books such as " a year in the merde " by stephen clarke , is also very stereotypical . but germans might still find the stereotypes offensive ... but what the book does is take these clichés and explode them .
there are few nazi references in it , because i specifically did n't want to write a book only about the war .
when i refer to lebensraum , for example , i explain what it is .
i mention kraft durch freude and the prora resort on rügen as an example of the socialism aspect we rarely talk about in the context of national socialism . i tried to see where the stereotypes are rooted and then to supply a deeper cultural reading .
when i wanted to explore - albeit in a jocular fashion - where germany 's thing about nudism has its roots , i tied it together with the specifically german interpretation of the hippy movement , the second world war and germany 's tradition of the kur -lsb- spa -rsb- culture .
what i did was find plausible explanations as to why these stereotypes emerged in the first place . you could argue that germans , who are quite serious , are the antithesis of the brits , who tend to be relentlessly ironic and su per cilious .
is it basically a per sonality clash ? but they do get on in many areas .
doing business with germans is an utter pleasure and in many ways we have a lot in common .
we actually have many affinities and shared interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein castle - too much for some so might we eventually see a great bond between the two countries ? all the people i speak to one-on-one have brilliant experiences of germany .
but it ‘ s a question of changing perceptions within the media and the collective nation .
in a way , these stereotypes are just too good to give up .
a map was drawn in 1945 , which was when the media explosion happened , and things became hard to change . what is your per sonal favorite part of germany ? i really love the baltic coast , the island of rügen and also further inland , the mecklenburgische seenplatte .
i 'd also love to go back to thuringia .

germany can help you find it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ben donald goes native jaded by the globalization of travel , writer ben donald wanted to go somewhere - anywhere - not yet colonized by the " distasteful hordes . "
his personal patch of paradise turns out to be closer than expected - germany . " this is the not so lonely planet we are living on , " explains a character in donald 's recently published travelogue , " springtime for germany - or how i learned to love lederhosen . " but discerning globetrotters need not despair . " there is a new frontier , " he goes on .
" a lost , or rather overlooked horizon ; a place that is remaining undiscovered , cloaked in poisonous myth and all but unvisited , as we speak , for over 60 years since it became obscured from the minds of most of the world . " is that really germany he 's talking about ? initiated readers may be puzzled to hear it described in such terms .
but wait , he has a point , does n't he ?
it is better than its reputation .
in fact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who could resist germany 's biooodiful fräuleins ? ... " it is a european shangri-la : a romantic , wooded place , a country of rivers , vineyards , forests , castles , poetry and music ... of fast cars , schöne ladies - ' ver ze girls are biooodiful . '
a country preserved by neglect ; ripe and waiting to be revealed again . " blimey .
so why does this much-maligned country get short shrift with travelers , or , in donald-speak , " chavelers " ?
determined to get to the bottom of it , he sets out to discover the real germany .
and guess what ?
contrary to popular belief - at least the one defined by tabloid britain - there 's more to deutschland than soccer coaches with mullets , disney castles and nude bathers .
and no , sturm und drang do n't make hi-fis , and fkk has nothing to do with the ku klux klan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red lights on the reeperbahn as he scuppers the clichés with the same doggedness he mocks the germans for , donald gets to grips with the concepts he feels best sum up the essence of germany and germans .
in the chapter headed gemütlichkeit , he snuggles up with the bavarians at the annual oktoberfest , heads to berlin to capture the zeitgeist , gets the measure of grossmansucht on hamburg 's reeperbahn and meets a german stand-up comedian in schadenfreude . it proves to be a journey of enlightenment . " i am inclined to judge the depth of a man 's civilization by his opinion of germany and her culture , " he concludes . dw-world.de spoke to ben donald and asked him why , if germany 's so great , does britain still harp on about men in socks and sandals , girls with hairy armpits , and of course , david hasselhof . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the definitive guide to the real germany ?
you decide .
ben donald : well , if you 're writing a book about germany you have to use the stereotypes simply because they provide so much material , and humor is a key way of attracting people to a subject .
the british do the same with other countries too .
the stereotypical battle over the sun loungers is an entirely anglo-german issue - italians wouldn ‘ t take a blind bit of notice of a towel on a sun lounger , they ‘ d just sit down and ignore it .
the thing is , the english and the germans are quite similar in their approach to staking out territory and personal privacy . ultimately , the book said as much about brits as it did about germany . good !
that ‘ s how it should be .
i wanted to pitch myself as a kind of everyman , and the idea was that the book would show some sort of development from my original position .
i couldn ‘ t start out being a germanophile .
and in the course of the journey , i as the narrator also reveal a great deal about the british . but there was the assumption that readers would recognize and agree with britain 's stereotypes about germany . to go back to the genesis of this book , there 's simply nothing in the travel bookshops about germany , nothing lighthearted , nothing extolling the delights of the german countryside and way of life .
why is that , when there are hundreds about italy and france and spain ?
there 's something stopping people in britain from seeing germany as a holiday destination and romanticizing a view of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen 's famous cliffs when i do radio interviews in britain , the first questions are invariably : is n't germany just about sausages and dodgy wine , v olksmusik and nena ?
so these stereotypes do still exist - but they 've become more playful , they 're not malicious at all .
and while german ambassadors to britain always get involved with debates with the uk tabloids about how they treat germany , it should be pointed out that the british do this with everyone !
we 're terrible when it comes to xenophobic tendencies . in the book i focus on how germans are extraordinarily introspective and self questioning , and perhaps they just need to see anglo-german attitudes in the context of british xenophobia towards other countries too . even when brits are telling you how much they love france , the wine , the chateaux , their gites and so on , they ca n't help saying it 's just a shame about all the frenchmen in it .
the english view of france , as you see in books such as " a year in the merde " by stephen clarke , is also very stereotypical . but germans might still find the stereotypes offensive ... but what the book does is take these clichés and explode them .
there are few nazi references in it , because i specifically did n't want to write a book only about the war .
when i refer to lebensraum , for example , i explain what it is .
i mention kraft durch freude and the prora resort on rügen as an example of the socialism aspect we rarely talk about in the context of national socialism . i tried to see where the stereotypes are rooted and then to supply a deeper cultural reading .
when i wanted to explore - albeit in a jocular fashion - where germany 's thing about nudism has its roots , i tied it together with the specifically german interpretation of the hippy movement , the second world war and germany 's tradition of the kur -lsb- spa -rsb- culture .
what i did was find plausible explanations as to why these stereotypes emerged in the first place . you could argue that germans , who are quite serious , are the antithesis of the brits , who tend to be relentlessly ironic and su per cilious .
is it basically a per sonality clash ? but they do get on in many areas .
doing business with germans is an utter pleasure and in many ways we have a lot in common .
we actually have many affinities and shared interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein castle - too much for some so might we eventually see a great bond between the two countries ? all the people i speak to one-on-one have brilliant experiences of germany .
but it ‘ s a question of changing perceptions within the media and the collective nation .
in a way , these stereotypes are just too good to give up .
a map was drawn in 1945 , which was when the media explosion happened , and things became hard to change . what is your per sonal favorite part of germany ? i really love the baltic coast , the island of rügen and also further inland , the mecklenburgische seenplatte .
i 'd also love to go back to thuringia .

germany can help you find it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ben donald goes native jaded by the globalization of travel , writer ben donald wanted to go somewhere - anywhere - not yet colonized by the " distasteful hordes . "
his personal patch of paradise turns out to be closer than expected - germany . " this is the not so lonely planet we are living on , " explains a character in donald 's recently published travelogue , " springtime for germany - or how i learned to love lederhosen . " but discerning globetrotters need not despair . " there is a new frontier , " he goes on .
" a lost , or rather overlooked horizon ; a place that is remaining undiscovered , cloaked in poisonous myth and all but unvisited , as we speak , for over 60 years since it became obscured from the minds of most of the world . " is that really germany he 's talking about ? initiated readers may be puzzled to hear it described in such terms .
but wait , he has a point , does n't he ?
it is better than its reputation .
in fact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who could resist germany 's biooodiful fräuleins ? ... " it is a european shangri-la : a romantic , wooded place , a country of rivers , vineyards , forests , castles , poetry and music ... of fast cars , schöne ladies - ' ver ze girls are biooodiful . '
a country preserved by neglect ; ripe and waiting to be revealed again . " blimey .
so why does this much-maligned country get short shrift with travelers , or , in donald-speak , " chavelers " ?
determined to get to the bottom of it , he sets out to discover the real germany .
and guess what ?
contrary to popular belief - at least the one defined by tabloid britain - there 's more to deutschland than soccer coaches with mullets , disney castles and nude bathers .

in the chapter headed gemütlichkeit , he snuggles up with the bavarians at the annual oktoberfest , heads to berlin to capture the zeitgeist , gets the measure of grossmansucht on hamburg 's reeperbahn and meets a german stand-up comedian in schadenfreude . it proves to be a journey of enlightenment . " i am inclined to judge the depth of a man 's civilization by his opinion of germany and her culture , " he concludes . dw-world.de spoke to ben donald and asked him why , if germany 's so great , does britain still harp on about men in socks and sandals , girls with hairy armpits , and of course , david hasselhof . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the definitive guide to the real germany ?
you decide .
ben donald : well , if you 're writing a book about germany you have to use the stereotypes simply because they provide so much material , and humor is a key way of attracting people to a subject .
the british do the same with other countries too .
the stereotypical battle over the sun loungers is an entirely anglo-german issue - italians wouldn ‘ t take a blind bit of notice of a towel on a sun lounger , they ‘ d just sit down and ignore it .
the thing is , the english and the germans are quite similar in their approach to staking out territory and personal privacy . ultimately , the book said as much about brits as it did about germany . good !
that ‘ s how it should be .
i wanted to pitch myself as a kind of everyman , and the idea was that the book would show some sort of development from my original position .
i couldn ‘ t start out being a germanophile .
and in the course of the journey , i as the narrator also reveal a great deal about the british . but there was the assumption that readers would recognize and agree with britain 's stereotypes about germany . to go back to the genesis of this book , there 's simply nothing in the travel bookshops about germany , nothing lighthearted , nothing extolling the delights of the german countryside and way of life .
why is that , when there are hundreds about italy and france and spain ?
there 's something stopping people in britain from seeing germany as a holiday destination and romanticizing a view of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen 's famous cliffs when i do radio interviews in britain , the first questions are invariably : is n't germany just about sausages and dodgy wine , v olksmusik and nena ?
so these stereotypes do still exist - but they 've become more playful , they 're not malicious at all .
and while german ambassadors to britain always get involved with debates with the uk tabloids about how they treat germany , it should be pointed out that the british do this with everyone !
we 're terrible when it comes to xenophobic tendencies . in the book i focus on how germans are extraordinarily introspective and self questioning , and perhaps they just need to see anglo-german attitudes in the context of british xenophobia towards other countries too . even when brits are telling you how much they love france , the wine , the chateaux , their gites and so on , they ca n't help saying it 's just a shame about all the frenchmen in it .
the english view of france , as you see in books such as " a year in the merde " by stephen clarke , is also very stereotypical . but germans might still find the stereotypes offensive ... but what the book does is take these clichés and explode them .
there are few nazi references in it , because i specifically did n't want to write a book only about the war .
when i refer to lebensraum , for example , i explain what it is .
i mention kraft durch freude and the prora resort on rügen as an example of the socialism aspect we rarely talk about in the context of national socialism . i tried to see where the stereotypes are rooted and then to supply a deeper cultural reading .
when i wanted to explore - albeit in a jocular fashion - where germany 's thing about nudism has its roots , i tied it together with the specifically german interpretation of the hippy movement , the second world war and germany 's tradition of the kur -lsb- spa -rsb- culture .
what i did was find plausible explanations as to why these stereotypes emerged in the first place . you could argue that germans , who are quite serious , are the antithesis of the brits , who tend to be relentlessly ironic and su per cilious .
is it basically a per sonality clash ? but they do get on in many areas .
doing business with germans is an utter pleasure and in many ways we have a lot in common .
we actually have many affinities and shared interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein castle - too much for some so might we eventually see a great bond between the two countries ? all the people i speak to one-on-one have brilliant experiences of germany .
but it ‘ s a question of changing perceptions within the media and the collective nation .
in a way , these stereotypes are just too good to give up .
a map was drawn in 1945 , which was when the media explosion happened , and things became hard to change . what is your per sonal favorite part of germany ? i really love the baltic coast , the island of rügen and also further inland , the mecklenburgische seenplatte .

germany can help you find it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ben donald goes native jaded by the globalization of travel , writer ben donald wanted to go somewhere - anywhere - not yet colonized by the " distasteful hordes . "
his personal patch of paradise turns out to be closer than expected - germany . " this is the not so lonely planet we are living on , " explains a character in donald 's recently published travelogue , " springtime for germany - or how i learned to love lederhosen . " but discerning globetrotters need not despair . " there is a new frontier , " he goes on .
" a lost , or rather overlooked horizon ; a place that is remaining undiscovered , cloaked in poisonous myth and all but unvisited , as we speak , for over 60 years since it became obscured from the minds of most of the world . " is that really germany he 's talking about ? initiated readers may be puzzled to hear it described in such terms .
but wait , he has a point , does n't he ?
it is better than its reputation .
in fact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who could resist germany 's biooodiful fräuleins ? ... " it is a european shangri-la : a romantic , wooded place , a country of rivers , vineyards , forests , castles , poetry and music ... of fast cars , schöne ladies - ' ver ze girls are biooodiful . '
a country preserved by neglect ; ripe and waiting to be revealed again . " blimey .
so why does this much-maligned country get short shrift with travelers , or , in donald-speak , " chavelers " ?
determined to get to the bottom of it , he sets out to discover the real germany .
and guess what ?
contrary to popular belief - at least the one defined by tabloid britain - there 's more to deutschland than soccer coaches with mullets , disney castles and nude bathers .
and no , sturm und drang do n't make hi-fis , and fkk has nothing to do with the ku klux klan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red lights on the reeperbahn as he scuppers the clichés with the same doggedness he mocks the germans for , donald gets to grips with the concepts he feels best sum up the essence of germany and germans .
in the chapter headed gemütlichkeit , he snuggles up with the bavarians at the annual oktoberfest , heads to berlin to capture the zeitgeist , gets the measure of grossmansucht on hamburg 's reeperbahn and meets a german stand-up comedian in schadenfreude . it proves to be a journey of enlightenment . " i am inclined to judge the depth of a man 's civilization by his opinion of germany and her culture , " he concludes . dw-world.de spoke to ben donald and asked him why , if germany 's so great , does britain still harp on about men in socks and sandals , girls with hairy armpits , and of course , david hasselhof . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the definitive guide to the real germany ?
you decide .
ben donald : well , if you 're writing a book about germany you have to use the stereotypes simply because they provide so much material , and humor is a key way of attracting people to a subject .
the british do the same with other countries too .
the stereotypical battle over the sun loungers is an entirely anglo-german issue - italians wouldn ‘ t take a blind bit of notice of a towel on a sun lounger , they ‘ d just sit down and ignore it .
the thing is , the english and the germans are quite similar in their approach to staking out territory and personal privacy . ultimately , the book said as much about brits as it did about germany . good !
that ‘ s how it should be .
i wanted to pitch myself as a kind of everyman , and the idea was that the book would show some sort of development from my original position .
i couldn ‘ t start out being a germanophile .
and in the course of the journey , i as the narrator also reveal a great deal about the british . but there was the assumption that readers would recognize and agree with britain 's stereotypes about germany . to go back to the genesis of this book , there 's simply nothing in the travel bookshops about germany , nothing lighthearted , nothing extolling the delights of the german countryside and way of life .
why is that , when there are hundreds about italy and france and spain ?
there 's something stopping people in britain from seeing germany as a holiday destination and romanticizing a view of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen 's famous cliffs when i do radio interviews in britain , the first questions are invariably : is n't germany just about sausages and dodgy wine , v olksmusik and nena ?
so these stereotypes do still exist - but they 've become more playful , they 're not malicious at all .
and while german ambassadors to britain always get involved with debates with the uk tabloids about how they treat germany , it should be pointed out that the british do this with everyone !
we 're terrible when it comes to xenophobic tendencies . in the book i focus on how germans are extraordinarily introspective and self questioning , and perhaps they just need to see anglo-german attitudes in the context of british xenophobia towards other countries too . even when brits are telling you how much they love france , the wine , the chateaux , their gites and so on , they ca n't help saying it 's just a shame about all the frenchmen in it .
the english view of france , as you see in books such as " a year in the merde " by stephen clarke , is also very stereotypical . but germans might still find the stereotypes offensive ... but what the book does is take these clichés and explode them .
there are few nazi references in it , because i specifically did n't want to write a book only about the war .
when i refer to lebensraum , for example , i explain what it is .
i mention kraft durch freude and the prora resort on rügen as an example of the socialism aspect we rarely talk about in the context of national socialism . i tried to see where the stereotypes are rooted and then to supply a deeper cultural reading .
when i wanted to explore - albeit in a jocular fashion - where germany 's thing about nudism has its roots , i tied it together with the specifically german interpretation of the hippy movement , the second world war and germany 's tradition of the kur -lsb- spa -rsb- culture .
what i did was find plausible explanations as to why these stereotypes emerged in the first place . you could argue that germans , who are quite serious , are the antithesis of the brits , who tend to be relentlessly ironic and su per cilious .
is it basically a per sonality clash ? but they do get on in many areas .
doing business with germans is an utter pleasure and in many ways we have a lot in common .
we actually have many affinities and shared interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuschwanstein castle - too much for some so might we eventually see a great bond between the two countries ? all the people i speak to one-on-one have brilliant experiences of germany .
but it ‘ s a question of changing perceptions within the media and the collective nation .
in a way , these stereotypes are just too good to give up .
a map was drawn in 1945 , which was when the media explosion happened , and things became hard to change . what is your per sonal favorite part of germany ? i really love the baltic coast , the island of rügen and also further inland , the mecklenburgische seenplatte .
i 'd also love to go back to thuringia .

the pumping plant at mythe near tewkesbury was put out of action by the scale of the flooding .
emergency crews have also been trying to stop an electricity substation which feeds 500,000 gloucestershire homes from shutting down .
instances of panic buying of drinking water have also been reported .
the raf said the scale of its operation to remove stranded people from their homes was the biggest it had ever undertaken in peacetime .
in an attempt to bolster drinking water supplies , about 600 water tanks have been drafted in with military help while 150,000 homes in gloucestershire are now without fresh water .
the rivers severn and avon which join in tewkesbury have burst their banks and flooded much of the town and surrounding area .
warning signs ignored meanwhile , west mercia police said their rescue operations were being hampered in some cases by flood sight-seers .
a number of abandoned cars had also been broken into by thieves .
a spokesman said : " not only are drivers stopping on the roadside to look at and photograph flood scenes , but some are driving past clear flood warning signs . "
he said they were " endangering themselves and their passengers , and possibly causing more work for over-stretched emergency services " .
car owners are being urged to collect their vehicles as soon as possible to avoid opportunist thieves .
at stroud hospital doctors have accepted 11 patients from tewkesbury hospital .
rnli crews were in the town centre checking properties for stranded people .
alan head , of the rnli , said his team in tewkesbury had rescued about 20 people who were caught out by the rising waters .
gloucester has been put on a severe flood warning with water just 30cm -lrb- 1ft -rrb- short of flood defences .
nearly 500 people in the dockside area of gloucester are preparing to leave their homes in preparation for the severn bursting its banks .
no deaths reported water levels in the city are equal to the 1947 flood , according to many experts .
police confirmed that hmp gloucester which is situated near the docks , would not be evacuated in the event of flooding .
chief constable dr tim brain said many of the county 's roads had re-opened and there had been no reports of deaths or missing persons associated with the floods .
terry standing , chief fire officer for gloucestershire fire and rescue service , said they were poised for breach of the river severn in gloucester quays but river water levels had stopped rising .
severe flood warnings are in force for the rivers severn and avon .
severn trent water said the water supply situation was serious and urged customers to conserve water , not run baths or to hose down any dirty areas on sunday .
shona arora , director of public health for gloucestershire , advised anyone affected to conserve water and not to panic buy .
she advised people not to take baths and not to clean up flood damage as that would use up water supply from the mains system .
the severn trent spokesman said : " the situation is serious , our pumping and treatment works at mythe has been flooded by the water .
" it has been overwhelmed .
we can not remember a time the works itself have ever been flooded like this .
it does n't sit on the flood plain but is some way off . "
four lorry loads of bottled water for emergency distribution were sent to sainsbury 's in barnett way , barnwood , gloucester and tesco in quedgeley .
' disrupted ' service but each person is being restricted to two bottles although tankers containing fresh water were on their way to ease the situation .
" yorkshire water , anglia water and thames water have all offered their services to help severn trent and the army may be used to distribute the water to areas most in need , " the spokesman added .
rail operator first great western said it had managed to run a " reduced and disrupted " service although passengers had been warned to expect cancellations and extended journey times .
gloucestershire county council is trying to find suppliers of portable loos to help those without access to toilets .
bbc radio gloucestershire is running special programming with regular updates on the flooding .

they are a relaxed nation and because most of the economy is agriculture-based , there 's rarely a need to rush anywhere .
but when it comes to the east african state 's main cash crop , tobacco , the pace picks up quite a bit .
at auction day in lilongwe , malawi 's capital city , " green gold " - as the farmers here like calling their raw harvest - goes on sale .
dozens of bare-chested young men sprint with wheelbarrow-like trolleys into and out of a giant hall in the late morning heat .
half of them have large bales of canvas sacks , but if you follow those with empty carts , you arrive at an enormous warehouse - the largest in the country .
there , your senses are accosted by the sights and sounds of hundreds of people buzzing around thousands of yellowing sacks , as the pungent mix of freshly harvested tobacco competes with human body odour .
the auction process itself is a fascinating mix of theatre and business .
on one side of a long row of open tobacco sacks stands the auctioneer , barking out the price per kg . "
i read about health problems in europe and wonder what it will mean for the people here " ponsiano kaomba , tobacco farmer opposing him and swiftly moving up the line is the buyer and his team , haggling over that price in a series of gestures and grunts - more akin to a cattle mart than to anything at christie 's or sotheby 's .
the farmers , who have grown and delivered these sacks of tobacco , wait in the wings - like expectant fathers - for an agreed price .
they and their families and their workers ' families depend hugely on what transpires in front of their eyes .
today , there are universal smiles in the wings .
near-record prices are being paid for this summer 's crop .
at $ 1.80 a kg , it 's more than double last year 's prices .
asian expansion the buyers are n't smiling , though .
they blame a scarcity of supply and government intervention for the high prices .
even though they feel they are paying too much , they have to buy anyway .
the demand from soon-to-be rich countries , such as china and india , is too great to abstain from purchasing .
they will be passing on this bad news to tobacco giants such as altria -lrb- makers of marlboro -rrb- , bat -lrb- lucky strike -rrb- and gallahers -lrb- benson & hedges -rrb- , who will have to pay more to turn these shabby-looking leaves into expensive cigars and branded cigarettes .
and they have a willing and waiting market in east asia .
one in every four smokers in the world lives in china alone - dwarfing most western countries .
and there 's room for expansion for the big multinationals .
only 1.2 billion of the 700 billion cigarettes that were sold by bat last year went to china .
it is also a more receptive market .
unlike europe and much of north america , smoking is still widely popular in china .
there is only a partial ban on tobacco advertising in place , and there are few restrictions on smoking in public places - which are more or less the norm in the eu now .
whether or not big tobacco succeeds in making major inroads into east asia or south asia matters a lot in malawi .
for farmers such as ponsiano kaomba , his very livelihood depends on it .

malawi 's tobacco changes hands in a huge warehouse they are a relaxed nation and because most of the economy is agriculture-based , there 's rarely a need to rush anywhere .
but when it comes to the east african state 's main cash crop , tobacco , the pace picks up quite a bit .
at auction day in lilongwe , malawi 's capital city , " green gold " - as the farmers here like calling their raw harvest - goes on sale .
dozens of bare-chested young men sprint with wheelbarrow-like trolleys into and out of a giant hall in the late morning heat .
half of them have large bales of canvas sacks , but if you follow those with empty carts , you arrive at an enormous warehouse - the largest in the country .
there , your senses are accosted by the sights and sounds of hundreds of people buzzing around thousands of yellowing sacks , as the pungent mix of freshly harvested tobacco competes with human body odour .
the auction process itself is a fascinating mix of theatre and business .
on one side of a long row of open tobacco sacks stands the auctioneer , barking out the price per kg .
i read about health problems in europe and wonder what it will mean for the people here ponsiano kaomba , tobacco farmer opposing him and swiftly moving up the line is the buyer and his team , haggling over that price in a series of gestures and grunts - more akin to a cattle mart than to anything at christie 's or sotheby 's .
the farmers , who have grown and delivered these sacks of tobacco , wait in the wings - like expectant fathers - for an agreed price .
they and their families and their workers ' families depend hugely on what transpires in front of their eyes .
today , there are universal smiles in the wings .
near-record prices are being paid for this summer 's crop .
at $ 1.80 a kg , it 's more than double last year 's prices .
asian expansion the buyers are n't smiling , though .
they blame a scarcity of supply and government intervention for the high prices .
even though they feel they are paying too much , they have to buy anyway .
the demand from soon-to-be rich countries , such as china and india , is too great to abstain from purchasing .
they will be passing on this bad news to tobacco giants such as altria -lrb- makers of marlboro -rrb- , bat -lrb- lucky strike -rrb- and gallahers -lrb- benson & hedges -rrb- , who will have to pay more to turn these shabby-looking leaves into expensive cigars and branded cigarettes .
ponsiano kaomba is at the mercy of world tobacco markets and they have a willing and waiting market in east asia .
one in every four smokers in the world lives in china alone - dwarfing most western countries .
and there 's room for expansion for the big multinationals .
only 1.2 billion of the 700 billion cigarettes that were sold by bat last year went to china .
it is also a more receptive market .
unlike europe and much of north america , smoking is still widely popular in china .
there is only a partial ban on tobacco advertising in place , and there are few restrictions on smoking in public places - which are more or less the norm in the eu now .
whether or not big tobacco succeeds in making major inroads into east asia or south asia matters a lot in malawi .
for farmers such as ponsiano kaomba , his very livelihood depends on it .
he worries that health fears surrounding tobacco may damage his earnings .

in 2002 , the ex-king returned home after nearly three decades in exile , to become a unifying symbol of peace and freedom among his former people .
born in kabul in 1914 , zahir shah was educated in france .
the last monarch of a 200-year-old pashtun dynasty , he ascended the throne , aged 19 , in 1933 , following the assassination of his father , nadir shah .
during world war ii , the king safeguarded his country 's neutrality and , throughout his reign , afghanistan enjoyed a period of stability .
foreign advisers helped the king modernise his nation and , in 1964 , his new constitution transformed the country into one with free elections , civil rights , female emancipation and universal suffrage .
he built the country 's first university , and developed cultural and commercial bonds with the west .
travellers began to view afghanistan as an attractive destination , with its mountains , rich culture and the relics of many ancient civilisations .
but the country 's tribal factions continued to wrangle .
in july 1973 , the king was ousted in a coup , at the behest of his cousin mohammad daoud , an opponent of zahir shah 's new western alliances .
afghan crowds celebrated zahir 's return in 2002 zahir shah was in italy for medical treatment at the time , and remained there for another 28 years .
he could only watch as his country suffered civil war , the 1979 soviet invasion and , more recently , the rise of the fundamentalist taleban regime .
1n 1996 , the taleban 's capture of the afghan capital kabul brought with it harsh legal restrictions on the country 's minorities and the ending of women 's rights .
throughout all this , the exiled former king maintained that he would be " ready to return to afghanistan if it serves to help my people " .
return home and so it proved .
after america was attacked in september 2001 and us outrage was focused on afghanistan , zahir shah gave a rare interview defending his former subjects .
he said that a new government would soon be decided by a " loya jirga " , a national gathering of elders , intellectuals and other influential figures .
on 17 april 2002 , the former king stepped back onto afghan soil .
he was given an overwhelming welcome by the country 's people , many of whom were reassured by his very presence .
hamid karzai welcomed zahir shah on his return members of the king 's own tribe , the pashtuns , had been neglected during the tenure of the northern alliance government , which had replaced the taleban .
on the king 's return , many pashtuns called for the restoration of the monarchy .
but some afghan warlords and politicians feared his return .
on more than one occasion , zahir shah found that when he made a speech on live television , the sound failed to be transmitted .
the former king himself felt unable to preside over long meetings , and warlords , members of al-qaeda and mujahideen fundamentalists all posed a threat to his safety .
instead , hamid karzai led the country 's new alliance .
zahir shah remained a private citizen , but security was tight around his 1970s-built palace .
he was given the title of " baba-i-millat-afghan " - father of the afghan nation - but his was largely a ceremonial role .
to rebuild the devastated country , zahir shah knew that afghanistan needed the help of such institutions as the united nations and the european union .
however , the former king was determined that the future of his country should remain firmly in the hands of afghans .
he held dear the wish for his people " to decide their government in a democratic manner , with free elections " .
following his return home , the former king enjoyed the enduring respect of his people .
although his political role was limited , until his death zahir shah remained a symbol of peace , reform and stability in the war-ravaged provinces of his beloved afghanistan .

in 2002 , the ex-king returned home after nearly three decades in exile , to become a unifying symbol of peace and freedom among his former people .
born in kabul in 1914 , zahir shah was educated in france .
the last monarch of a 200-year-old pashtun dynasty , he ascended the throne , aged 19 , in 1933 , following the assassination of his father , nadir shah .
during world war ii , the king safeguarded his country 's neutrality and , throughout his reign , afghanistan enjoyed a period of stability .
foreign advisers helped the king modernise his nation and , in 1964 , his new constitution transformed the country into one with free elections , civil rights , female emancipation and universal suffrage .
he built the country 's first university , and developed cultural and commercial bonds with the west .
travellers began to view afghanistan as an attractive destination , with its mountains , rich culture and the relics of many ancient civilisations .
but the country 's tribal factions continued to wrangle .
in july 1973 , the king was ousted in a coup , at the behest of his cousin mohammad daoud , an opponent of zahir shah 's new western alliances .
afghan crowds celebrated zahir 's return in 2002 zahir shah was in italy for medical treatment at the time , and remained there for another 28 years .
he could only watch as his country suffered civil war , the 1979 soviet invasion and , more recently , the rise of the fundamentalist taleban regime .
1n 1996 , the taleban 's capture of the afghan capital kabul brought with it harsh legal restrictions on the country 's minorities and the ending of women 's rights .
throughout all this , the exiled former king maintained that he would be " ready to return to afghanistan if it serves to help my people " .
return home and so it proved .
after america was attacked in september 2001 and us outrage was focused on afghanistan , zahir shah gave a rare interview defending his former subjects .
he said that a new government would soon be decided by a " loya jirga " , a national gathering of elders , intellectuals and other influential figures .
on 17 april 2002 , the former king stepped back onto afghan soil .
he was given an overwhelming welcome by the country 's people , many of whom were reassured by his very presence .
hamid karzai welcomed zahir shah on his return members of the king 's own tribe , the pashtuns , had been neglected during the tenure of the northern alliance government , which had replaced the taleban .
on the king 's return , many pashtuns called for the restoration of the monarchy .
but some afghan warlords and politicians feared his return .
on more than one occasion , zahir shah found that when he made a speech on live television , the sound failed to be transmitted .
the former king himself felt unable to preside over long meetings , and warlords , members of al-qaeda and mujahideen fundamentalists all posed a threat to his safety .
instead , hamid karzai led the country 's new alliance .
zahir shah remained a private citizen , but security was tight around his 1970s-built palace .
he was given the title of " baba-i-millat-afghan " - father of the afghan nation - but his was largely a ceremonial role .
to rebuild the devastated country , zahir shah knew that afghanistan needed the help of such institutions as the united nations and the european union .
however , the former king was determined that the future of his country should remain firmly in the hands of afghans .
he held dear the wish for his people " to decide their government in a democratic manner , with free elections " .
following his return home , the former king enjoyed the enduring respect of his people .
although his political role was limited , until his death zahir shah remained a symbol of peace , reform and stability in the war-ravaged provinces of his beloved afghanistan .

the family - which holds a 64 % stake in the wall street journal owner - is then expected to consider the matter for several days before taking a vote .
if it does go ahead , the deal could reshape the us media landscape .
a successful bid would bring dow jones publications into the same stable as news corp 's new york post in the us , and the sun and the times in the uk .
takeover fears however , unions and journalists have voiced concern that the proposed takeover could lead to the wall street journal losing its independence .
last week , the company 's german director dieter von holtzbrinck quit the dow jones ' board saying he was " very worried " about the impact of the bid on the wall street journal and its editorial independence .
in an effort to dispel fears that mr murdoch may interfere in the running of the paper , the media giant has already promised to establish " an independent , autonomous editorial board " for the newspaper if his bid for dow jones is accepted .
the offer represents a 65 % premium on dow jones ' share price at the time the deal was announced .
several bancroft family members have been looking for alternatives to rupert murdoch 's news corporation , and have courted other potential investors .
but no-one has come forward with an offer that trumps news corp 's $ 60-a-share price .

the family - which holds a 64 % stake in the wall street journal owner - is then expected to consider the matter for several days before taking a vote .
if it does go ahead , the deal could reshape the us media landscape .
a successful bid would bring dow jones publications into the same stable as news corp 's new york post in the us , and the sun and the times in the uk .
takeover fears however , unions and journalists have voiced concern that the proposed takeover could lead to the wall street journal losing its independence .
last week , the company 's german director dieter von holtzbrinck quit the dow jones ' board saying he was " very worried " about the impact of the bid on the wall street journal and its editorial independence .
in an effort to dispel fears that mr murdoch may interfere in the running of the paper , the media giant has already promised to establish " an independent , autonomous editorial board " for the newspaper if his bid for dow jones is accepted .
the offer represents a 65 % premium on dow jones ' share price at the time the deal was announced .
several bancroft family members have been looking for alternatives to rupert murdoch 's news corporation , and have courted other potential investors .
but no-one has come forward with an offer that trumps news corp 's $ 60-a-share price .
