just prior to this week 's eu constitutional treaty summit , poland insisted that changes be made to the treaty 's voting system .
can and should the document be rescued ?
readers gave their two cents . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i am totally opposed to any further extension of eu powers as proposed in the new treaty .
i therefore fully support poland in the stand taken on voting rights . - joseph wright , great britain if the eu wants to live in a false democratic state , then it should apply pressure .
however , if they want to leave in a truly democratic state , than the eu must adopt poland 's solution .
a basic and true fundamental principle of democracy is that the power must be divided equally along the partners . - jan , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kaczynski wants to change the treaty 's voting system as america formed its union with the acceptance of 9 of 13 states , the eu should consider forming the union with the acceptance of the constitution by 20 states , or some such majority .
one for all , all for one , is a very difficult formulation for the complexity of the constitution . - scott miller , us in my opinion , romano prodi is right .
the countries that want more integration should improve their relationship formally .
two blocks inside the eu - that is the answer . - gustavo araujo , uruguay the voting system related to population count in each of the eu countries would be fair only in the case of total integration of eu citizens .
this is not the case at the moment and there need to be some security for smaller nations .
the current system is giving much less voice to small countries .
poland is right that the system should be a compromise between interests of big countries like germany and small countries like the czech republic .
germany has the largest population and obviously the system merkel proposes is in germany 's interest . - jack , canada poland is a relatively new member within the eu , which was carried by france and germany .
when spain , for example , joined the eu , eu contributions initiated its economic recovery .
spain does n't have any problems regarding voting allocations .
poland should accept the present voting allocations and stop trying to scare europe with its veto power .
one should not ignore history .
with many polish people leaving for england , human migration throughout the eu should be recognized in the constitution through amendments . - hans reuther-fix , antigua and barbuda compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland dampens hopes for eu treaty success poland seemed to have softened its public tone on the eve of a crucial eu treaty summit , but concerns run deep in the country about not being taken seriously for plans to change the bloc 's reformed voting system .
-lrb- 20.06.2007 -rrb- poles threaten to derail major summit on new eu treaty eu member states have agreed to drop symbolic elements of the new treaty , but a meeting of german and polish leaders over the weekend failed to resolve an impasse over the bloc 's voting structure .
-lrb- 18.06.2007 -rrb- merkel pushes eu treaty in talks with czech premier german chancellor angela merkel hosted czech leader mirek topolanek sunday as part of a diplomatic drive to remove obstacles to an accord on a new institutional treaty for the eu .

but his reign between the posts might be short-lived if he fails to have success this year with the premiership side arsenal . jens lehmann was in bonn on tuesday to cement his place in german sports history .
the 37-year-old keeper was on hand as that city 's house of history museum received the page of notes he used to save two penalties in germany 's dramatic quarterfinal win over argentina in last year 's world cup . it was a moment of confirmation and satisfaction for a keeper who used to play second fiddle in his national side and who is germany 's clear number one ahead of the european soccer championship next year in austria and switzerland . but lehmann still has work to do , if he wants a chance to crown his career with an international title for germany .

indeed , some seem never to have forgiven him for picking up a red card in that final match against barcelona , which arsenal lost 2-1 . the german 's periodic bursts of temper have earned him the nicknames " mad jens " and " looney lehmann " from fans whose own mental stability is reflected by the fact that they refer to themselves as " gooners . " moreover , arsenal refused to offer lehmann anything more than a one-year contract in the off-season , and the club 's first signing this summer was polish keeper lukasz fabianski - hardly signs of abiding faith in lehmann 's abilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabianski says he 's ready to challenge for lehmann 's arsenal job in the wake of that acquisition , some gooners have called for the german to be replaced .
" lehmann , " opined one blogger on the bbc 's website after the fabianski signing was announced , " has shown increasingly last season he can not be trusted to play for the team when he is distracting the defence with his stupid antics .

but his reign between the posts might be short-lived if he fails to have success this year with the premiership side arsenal . jens lehmann was in bonn on tuesday to cement his place in german sports history .
the 37-year-old keeper was on hand as that city 's house of history museum received the page of notes he used to save two penalties in germany 's dramatic quarterfinal win over argentina in last year 's world cup . it was a moment of confirmation and satisfaction for a keeper who used to play second fiddle in his national side and who is germany 's clear number one ahead of the european soccer championship next year in austria and switzerland . but lehmann still has work to do , if he wants a chance to crown his career with an international title for germany .
to maintain his status in the national side , he first has to do the same with the club he plays for on a weekly basis , arsenal , who are coming off a year with no titles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann was a world cup hero against argentina " we had a very disappointing season , " lehmann acknowledged to dw-radio .
" normally we were always involved in the finals at the end of the season . " those sentiments have been seconded by arsenal fans , many of whom believe the club needs a major shake-up .
and some think the place to start is in goal . gooners having a go at " mad jens " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but he was a goat in the 2006 champions league final although lehmann anchored arsenal 's unprecedented unbeaten 2003-4 season in the premiership and led them to the champions league final in 2006 , club supporters are becoming increasingly critical of their number one .
indeed , some seem never to have forgiven him for picking up a red card in that final match against barcelona , which arsenal lost 2-1 . the german 's periodic bursts of temper have earned him the nicknames " mad jens " and " looney lehmann " from fans whose own mental stability is reflected by the fact that they refer to themselves as " gooners . " moreover , arsenal refused to offer lehmann anything more than a one-year contract in the off-season , and the club 's first signing this summer was polish keeper lukasz fabianski - hardly signs of abiding faith in lehmann 's abilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabianski says he 's ready to challenge for lehmann 's arsenal job in the wake of that acquisition , some gooners have called for the german to be replaced .
" lehmann , " opined one blogger on the bbc 's website after the fabianski signing was announced , " has shown increasingly last season he can not be trusted to play for the team when he is distracting the defence with his stupid antics . " gunners fans also rushed to youtube to check out fabianski 's skills for themselves .
most were impressed , with one of them commenting , succinctly : " lehman out , fabianski in , come on arsenal . " last time around ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann will be 38 by the time euro 2008 begins gunners coach arsene wenger is unlikely to put much stock in the ranting of often hysterical fans , but he does want to win some silverware .

strike action launched by the union on may 11 to protest the outsourcing plans would end on friday , a union spokesman said .
tens of thousands of the company 's 160,000 employees in germany took part in the strikes , the biggest labor dispute involving the company since it was privatized 12 years ago .
drop in earnings telekom plans to outsource the workers into three lower-paying service companies in a bid to boost earnings and competitiveness in the face of fierce competition in its domestic german market .
last month , the former state monopoly reported a 58-per-cent drop in first-quarter earnings , largely as a result of a slump in its fixed-line operations in germany .
under the deal agreed on wednesday , the workers transferred to the new companies will receive a 6.5 cut in pay and see their working week increased by four hours to 38 hours .
telekom had initially sought a 9 percent pay cut and a six-hour increase in the working week in order to achieve savings of up to 900 million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 20.06.2007 poland dampens hopes for eu treaty success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski 's are unpredictable , polish observers say poland seemed to have softened its public tone on the eve of a crucial eu treaty summit , but concerns run deep in the country about not being taken seriously for plans to change the bloc 's reformed voting system . the polish government had indeed already signed the eu constitutional treaty , in 2004 .
three years and a change of government later , however , warsaw 's trying to undo the hard-found compromise .
" nice or death " was the polish government 's approach in 2003 , when the eu member states started negotiating a bloc-wide treaty .
the bone of contention then , as now , was the double-majority voting system .
the treaty of nice gave poland - a country of 38 million - more votes , nearly as many as germany , with its 82 million people .
poland 's insistence on sticking to the treaty of nice ultimately led to isolation .
the then social democratic government in warsaw finally gave in and signed , in 2004 .
however , after the failed referendums on the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year , poland dropped its endorsement of the paper .
ever since germany started preparing the ground for a new eu constitution , an institutional treaty as they have started calling it , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's president and prime minister respectively , have been threatening to veto .
their demands concern one individual point : the double-majority voting system in the european council , the eu 's top decision-making body , should be dropped in favor of a square-root principle . allocating votes to countries on that basis would reduce the influence of the eu 's biggest countries - in particular that of germany .
there 's no mistaking the reproachful tone of warsaw 's arguments implying that berlin dominates the eu .
anti-german sentiment " we are n't so afraid of the germans , " poland 's chief negotiator , marek cichocki , told dw-world.de.
" if we were so afraid of them , would we propose a rule that still concedes the germans more votes than the poles ? "

three years and a change of government later , however , warsaw 's trying to undo the hard-found compromise .
" nice or death " was the polish government 's approach in 2003 , when the eu member states started negotiating a bloc-wide treaty .
the bone of contention then , as now , was the double-majority voting system .
the treaty of nice gave poland - a country of 38 million - more votes , nearly as many as germany , with its 82 million people .
poland 's insistence on sticking to the treaty of nice ultimately led to isolation .
the then social democratic government in warsaw finally gave in and signed , in 2004 .
however , after the failed referendums on the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year , poland dropped its endorsement of the paper .
ever since germany started preparing the ground for a new eu constitution , an institutional treaty as they have started calling it , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's president and prime minister respectively , have been threatening to veto .
their demands concern one individual point : the double-majority voting system in the european council , the eu 's top decision-making body , should be dropped in favor of a square-root principle . allocating votes to countries on that basis would reduce the influence of the eu 's biggest countries - in particular that of germany .
there 's no mistaking the reproachful tone of warsaw 's arguments implying that berlin dominates the eu .
anti-german sentiment " we are n't so afraid of the germans , " poland 's chief negotiator , marek cichocki , told dw-world.de.

three years and a change of government later , however , warsaw 's trying to undo the hard-found compromise .
" nice or death " was the polish government 's approach in 2003 , when the eu member states started negotiating a bloc-wide treaty .
the bone of contention then , as now , was the double-majority voting system .
the treaty of nice gave poland - a country of 38 million - more votes , nearly as many as germany , with its 82 million people .
poland 's insistence on sticking to the treaty of nice ultimately led to isolation .
the then social democratic government in warsaw finally gave in and signed , in 2004 .
however , after the failed referendums on the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year , poland dropped its endorsement of the paper .
ever since germany started preparing the ground for a new eu constitution , an institutional treaty as they have started calling it , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's president and prime minister respectively , have been threatening to veto .
their demands concern one individual point : the double-majority voting system in the european council , the eu 's top decision-making body , should be dropped in favor of a square-root principle . allocating votes to countries on that basis would reduce the influence of the eu 's biggest countries - in particular that of germany .
there 's no mistaking the reproachful tone of warsaw 's arguments implying that berlin dominates the eu .
anti-german sentiment " we are n't so afraid of the germans , " poland 's chief negotiator , marek cichocki , told dw-world.de.
" if we were so afraid of them , would we propose a rule that still concedes the germans more votes than the poles ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski could well be up for some long nights together during the summit rather , the poles were concerned with establishing a generally more fair voting system , cichocki said .
polish eu expert jacek pawlicki , a commentator at polish daily gazeta wyborcza , conceded that cichocki 's argument was understandable .
however , he pointed out , the debate in poland had been marked by increasing anti-german sentiment .
" most poles do n't fully understand what the issue is , " pawlicki said .
" but they sense that it 's about increasing the poles ' influence , and thus , the majority naturally approves . "
in their collective memory , the poles are haunted by having been deceived and betrayed in the past .
the kaczynski twins know how to capitalize on those fears and are neither put off by a worsening of relations to germany nor by isolation within the eu .
isolation is not at all an issue , said cichocki .
instead , he said he felt that , in the course of the discussion about the voting system , public opinion in europe had already changed .
" many listen intently to our proposals and understand our problem . "
europe annoyed ?
" the unloved neighbors - how the poles irritate europe " was , however , the title of this week 's edition of germany 's der spiegel news magazine .
even if some commentators and political scientists see promise in the polish square-root proposal , warsaw 's threat to veto has riled some .
silvana koch-mehrin , a german member of the european parliament , even went so far as to suggest that the poles ought to consider getting out of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw says it does n't want to cause deadlock at the summit " if a country in the eu does n't feel good than you should tell it : if you do n't like it , there 's this possibility , " she said .
cichocki rebuffs the attacks , calling koch-mehrin 's a " reckless idea . "
" such suggestions are entirely unnecessary . "
the question is whether warsaw will agree to a compromise .
" that 's hard to say , " said cichocki .
" this summit has its own logic and this logic is only foreseeable up to a certain standpoint . "
wait and see polish politics also has a certain logic , according to jan barcz , a professor of european law in warsaw .
" no independent expert in poland at the moment can say how the kaczynski brothers will behave in the negotiations .
their politics are simply unpredictable . "
for now , prime minister kaczynski hinted that warsaw might be willing to budge in an interview with germany 's bild-zeitung newspaper , published on wednesday , the day before the two-day summit opens .
poland 's proposal did n't necessarily have to lead to a deadlock in the talks , he said .
" at the moment we only want a debate to be allowed -lrb- at the summit -rrb- on the voting system . "
but he also told the paper , " they are trying to isolate and ignore poland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 20.06.2007 spate of new reactor plans gives eu an atomic jolt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power is on the march across parts of europe thanks to increased demand for energy that does not emit greenhouse gases , the nuclear power industry is seeing a surge in popularity - especially in former communist countries . european pledges to combat global warming appear to be giving nuclear energy a boost .
even some countries that have moved to phase out nuclear reactors have once more taken up the debate over atomic power , which advocates promote as being much cleaner than traditional energy sources because it produces very low levels of toxic co2 . the change might come as something of a surprise to anyone who has swum in the tide of overwhelmingly anti-nuke public opinion for the past two decades , and especially after the chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 showed the reality of the flaws of lax nuclear safety . yet the mood appears to be shifting , prompted at least in part by european pledges to cut carbon emissions and slow global warming .
especially eager to jump aboard the pro-nukes bandwagon are ex-soviet countries , whose rapid growth and long-standing dependence on russian natural gas makes them extra-keen to take control of their energy markets . new member states are key five of the 10 countries that joined the then 15-nation european union in its 2004 expansion - the czech republic , hungary , lithuania , slovakia and slovenia - have operating reactors .
bulgaria was made to shut down two soviet-era reactors as a condition for eu entry despite noisy opposition .
but its controversial plans to build a new reactor in belene , near the danube , are moving ahead .
the country has already signed with russian company atomstroyexport to build the new plant . romania and the czech republic also have plans to build new reactors .
while construction has begun on plants in romania , the czech government is holding off on similar moves for the next four years due to the presence of the greens in the new coalition . hungary and slovakia are also discussing adding additional units , while baltic states , lithuania , estonia and latvia , have signed an agreement committing to the construction of a new plant at ignalina in lithuania .
poland has also signed a co-operation agreement with lithuania . the ukraine , not in the eu , got almost 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear power last year .
it is considering adding up to 11 new nuclear plants by 2030 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1986 , crowds demonstrated against an atomic plant in hamburg sami tulonen , a spokesman for eu nuclear trade association foratom , acknowledged that eastern-bloc countries have " more advanced discussions " of building new power plants .
this , he said , could be attributed to several factors . " in the new eu states there is more political and public support for nuclear power , " tulonen said .
and as a result of eu entry , " there is very strong economic growth in the region , and need for more electricity capacity to meet demand . " add to that the fact that so much of the east 's current power comes from " very dirty " sources like coal , and the increasing intolerance for greenhouse gases , and its easy to understand how the tide of public opinion can turn toward nuclear energy , tulonen said . ' they want no part of russian domination ' " they have to meet the kyoto goals , and they know their economies are growing , yet they need more nuclear power to meet the low carbon demand , " he added . under the 1997 kyoto protocol , 39 industrialized nations agreed to cut emissions of six greenhouse gases to an average of 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 . finally , observers note that former soviet states are eager to be less dependent on russia 's energy monopolies in the region . " they already know what its like to be dominated by russia , and they want no part of trading political domination for economic domination by increasing their dependence on russia oil and gas , " wrote pro-nuke activist rod adams on his blog , atomicinsight . growth in western europe , too foratom 's tulonen warns that it is false to see the movement as clearly one of east versus west , however . " there is also a lot of discussion about nuclear new build among old -lrb- eu -rrb- member states , " he said , noting that finland is currently building the first nuclear reactor to go up in the eu in the last 15 years . france has serious plans to build , and discussions on amping up nuclear energy in sweden and belgium are ongoing .
even britain is considering nuclear options , he said . " reactor-wise , it is difficult to say where the widest growth will be in five years , " tulonen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paks nuklear power plant in hungary currently , 30 percent of the eu 's total electricity production comes from nuclear sources ; that number is as high as 80 percent in nuke-friendly countries like france and belgium .
germany gets 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear sources .
eu forum on nukes meanwhile , on june 15 the eu announced the formation of an eu nuclear energy forum , which will meet twice a year in an effort to " lay the groundwork for a structured , open debate , about this energy source , without taboos , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a press release .
foratom 's tulonen says he hopes the forum will be used to " lay a roadmap for nuclear investment , in order to support the nuclear renaissance . " opponents of nuclear power , however , argue that the atomic industry is simply using a cynical ploy to exploit people who are worried about global warming by stressing the supposedly low levels of co2 produced by nuclear plants . cynical ploy ? " the nuclear industry has gotten wise to the fact that people are interested in this … they 're trying to sell the idea that nuclear power is the clean alternative , " said sonja meister , a climate and energy campaigner for grassroots environmental group friends of the earth .
not only is it a ploy , meister argues , " its just not true .
they say nuclear power has no co2 emissions , but if you look at the whole production cycle - the emissions produced during uranium mining , building the plant , there is a great deal of co2 produced . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is closing this plant in lithuania , but a replacement is planned moreover , when cost comparisons are made between nuclear and other types of energy sources , safety and potential cleanup costs are almost always ignored , meister said .
" nuclear power plants can never be safe , " she said .
" there is always a danger of human error , even if they are a bit more secure or efficient .
and the general problem of what to do with nuclear waste remains , so it does n't matter if they are a little safer . "
the question remains if it would be possible to phase out nuclear energy and still meet projected emissions cuts in europe .
according to meister , the key lies in investing in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency . " there is no valid reason for nuclear energy , " meister said .
" you can save 10 times more co2 emissions by investing in energy efficiency than in nuclear power … continuing to invest in nuclear energy is just economically insane , " she said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany gets 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear sources .
eu forum on nukes meanwhile , on june 15 the eu announced the formation of an eu nuclear energy forum , which will meet twice a year in an effort to " lay the groundwork for a structured , open debate , about this energy source , without taboos , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a press release .
foratom 's tulonen says he hopes the forum will be used to " lay a roadmap for nuclear investment , in order to support the nuclear renaissance . " opponents of nuclear power , however , argue that the atomic industry is simply using a cynical ploy to exploit people who are worried about global warming by stressing the supposedly low levels of co2 produced by nuclear plants . cynical ploy ? " the nuclear industry has gotten wise to the fact that people are interested in this … they 're trying to sell the idea that nuclear power is the clean alternative , " said sonja meister , a climate and energy campaigner for grassroots environmental group friends of the earth .
not only is it a ploy , meister argues , " its just not true .
they say nuclear power has no co2 emissions , but if you look at the whole production cycle - the emissions produced during uranium mining , building the plant , there is a great deal of co2 produced . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is closing this plant in lithuania , but a replacement is planned moreover , when cost comparisons are made between nuclear and other types of energy sources , safety and potential cleanup costs are almost always ignored , meister said .
" nuclear power plants can never be safe , " she said .
" there is always a danger of human error , even if they are a bit more secure or efficient .
and the general problem of what to do with nuclear waste remains , so it does n't matter if they are a little safer . "
the question remains if it would be possible to phase out nuclear energy and still meet projected emissions cuts in europe .
according to meister , the key lies in investing in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency . " there is no valid reason for nuclear energy , " meister said .
" you can save 10 times more co2 emissions by investing in energy efficiency than in nuclear power … continuing to invest in nuclear energy is just economically insane , " she said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even some countries that have moved to phase out nuclear reactors have once more taken up the debate over atomic power , which advocates promote as being much cleaner than traditional energy sources because it produces very low levels of toxic co2 . the change might come as something of a surprise to anyone who has swum in the tide of overwhelmingly anti-nuke public opinion for the past two decades , and especially after the chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 showed the reality of the flaws of lax nuclear safety . yet the mood appears to be shifting , prompted at least in part by european pledges to cut carbon emissions and slow global warming .
especially eager to jump aboard the pro-nukes bandwagon are ex-soviet countries , whose rapid growth and long-standing dependence on russian natural gas makes them extra-keen to take control of their energy markets . new member states are key five of the 10 countries that joined the then 15-nation european union in its 2004 expansion - the czech republic , hungary , lithuania , slovakia and slovenia - have operating reactors .
bulgaria was made to shut down two soviet-era reactors as a condition for eu entry despite noisy opposition .
but its controversial plans to build a new reactor in belene , near the danube , are moving ahead .
the country has already signed with russian company atomstroyexport to build the new plant . romania and the czech republic also have plans to build new reactors .
while construction has begun on plants in romania , the czech government is holding off on similar moves for the next four years due to the presence of the greens in the new coalition . hungary and slovakia are also discussing adding additional units , while baltic states , lithuania , estonia and latvia , have signed an agreement committing to the construction of a new plant at ignalina in lithuania .
poland has also signed a co-operation agreement with lithuania . the ukraine , not in the eu , got almost 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear power last year .
it is considering adding up to 11 new nuclear plants by 2030 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1986 , crowds demonstrated against an atomic plant in hamburg sami tulonen , a spokesman for eu nuclear trade association foratom , acknowledged that eastern-bloc countries have " more advanced discussions " of building new power plants .
this , he said , could be attributed to several factors . " in the new eu states there is more political and public support for nuclear power , " tulonen said .
and as a result of eu entry , " there is very strong economic growth in the region , and need for more electricity capacity to meet demand . " add to that the fact that so much of the east 's current power comes from " very dirty " sources like coal , and the increasing intolerance for greenhouse gases , and its easy to understand how the tide of public opinion can turn toward nuclear energy , tulonen said . ' they want no part of russian domination ' " they have to meet the kyoto goals , and they know their economies are growing , yet they need more nuclear power to meet the low carbon demand , " he added . under the 1997 kyoto protocol , 39 industrialized nations agreed to cut emissions of six greenhouse gases to an average of 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 . finally , observers note that former soviet states are eager to be less dependent on russia 's energy monopolies in the region . " they already know what its like to be dominated by russia , and they want no part of trading political domination for economic domination by increasing their dependence on russia oil and gas , " wrote pro-nuke activist rod adams on his blog , atomicinsight . growth in western europe , too foratom 's tulonen warns that it is false to see the movement as clearly one of east versus west , however .

even some countries that have moved to phase out nuclear reactors have once more taken up the debate over atomic power , which advocates promote as being much cleaner than traditional energy sources because it produces very low levels of toxic co2 . the change might come as something of a surprise to anyone who has swum in the tide of overwhelmingly anti-nuke public opinion for the past two decades , and especially after the chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 showed the reality of the flaws of lax nuclear safety . yet the mood appears to be shifting , prompted at least in part by european pledges to cut carbon emissions and slow global warming .
especially eager to jump aboard the pro-nukes bandwagon are ex-soviet countries , whose rapid growth and long-standing dependence on russian natural gas makes them extra-keen to take control of their energy markets . new member states are key five of the 10 countries that joined the then 15-nation european union in its 2004 expansion - the czech republic , hungary , lithuania , slovakia and slovenia - have operating reactors .
bulgaria was made to shut down two soviet-era reactors as a condition for eu entry despite noisy opposition .
but its controversial plans to build a new reactor in belene , near the danube , are moving ahead .
the country has already signed with russian company atomstroyexport to build the new plant . romania and the czech republic also have plans to build new reactors .
while construction has begun on plants in romania , the czech government is holding off on similar moves for the next four years due to the presence of the greens in the new coalition . hungary and slovakia are also discussing adding additional units , while baltic states , lithuania , estonia and latvia , have signed an agreement committing to the construction of a new plant at ignalina in lithuania .
poland has also signed a co-operation agreement with lithuania . the ukraine , not in the eu , got almost 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear power last year .

this , he said , could be attributed to several factors . " in the new eu states there is more political and public support for nuclear power , " tulonen said .
and as a result of eu entry , " there is very strong economic growth in the region , and need for more electricity capacity to meet demand . " add to that the fact that so much of the east 's current power comes from " very dirty " sources like coal , and the increasing intolerance for greenhouse gases , and its easy to understand how the tide of public opinion can turn toward nuclear energy , tulonen said . ' they want no part of russian domination ' " they have to meet the kyoto goals , and they know their economies are growing , yet they need more nuclear power to meet the low carbon demand , " he added . under the 1997 kyoto protocol , 39 industrialized nations agreed to cut emissions of six greenhouse gases to an average of 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 . finally , observers note that former soviet states are eager to be less dependent on russia 's energy monopolies in the region . " they already know what its like to be dominated by russia , and they want no part of trading political domination for economic domination by increasing their dependence on russia oil and gas , " wrote pro-nuke activist rod adams on his blog , atomicinsight . growth in western europe , too foratom 's tulonen warns that it is false to see the movement as clearly one of east versus west , however . " there is also a lot of discussion about nuclear new build among old -lrb- eu -rrb- member states , " he said , noting that finland is currently building the first nuclear reactor to go up in the eu in the last 15 years . france has serious plans to build , and discussions on amping up nuclear energy in sweden and belgium are ongoing .
even britain is considering nuclear options , he said . " reactor-wise , it is difficult to say where the widest growth will be in five years , " tulonen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paks nuklear power plant in hungary currently , 30 percent of the eu 's total electricity production comes from nuclear sources ; that number is as high as 80 percent in nuke-friendly countries like france and belgium .

eu forum on nukes meanwhile , on june 15 the eu announced the formation of an eu nuclear energy forum , which will meet twice a year in an effort to " lay the groundwork for a structured , open debate , about this energy source , without taboos , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a press release .
foratom 's tulonen says he hopes the forum will be used to " lay a roadmap for nuclear investment , in order to support the nuclear renaissance . " opponents of nuclear power , however , argue that the atomic industry is simply using a cynical ploy to exploit people who are worried about global warming by stressing the supposedly low levels of co2 produced by nuclear plants . cynical ploy ? " the nuclear industry has gotten wise to the fact that people are interested in this … they 're trying to sell the idea that nuclear power is the clean alternative , " said sonja meister , a climate and energy campaigner for grassroots environmental group friends of the earth .
not only is it a ploy , meister argues , " its just not true .
they say nuclear power has no co2 emissions , but if you look at the whole production cycle - the emissions produced during uranium mining , building the plant , there is a great deal of co2 produced . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is closing this plant in lithuania , but a replacement is planned moreover , when cost comparisons are made between nuclear and other types of energy sources , safety and potential cleanup costs are almost always ignored , meister said .

" there is always a danger of human error , even if they are a bit more secure or efficient .
and the general problem of what to do with nuclear waste remains , so it does n't matter if they are a little safer . "
the question remains if it would be possible to phase out nuclear energy and still meet projected emissions cuts in europe .
according to meister , the key lies in investing in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency . " there is no valid reason for nuclear energy , " meister said .

but his reign between the posts might be short-lived if he fails to have success this year with the premiership side arsenal . jens lehmann was in bonn on tuesday to cement his place in german sports history .
the 37-year-old keeper was on hand as that city 's house of history museum received the page of notes he used to save two penalties in germany 's dramatic quarterfinal win over argentina in last year 's world cup . it was a moment of confirmation and satisfaction for a keeper who used to play second fiddle in his national side and who is germany 's clear number one ahead of the european soccer championship next year in austria and switzerland . but lehmann still has work to do , if he wants a chance to crown his career with an international title for germany .
to maintain his status in the national side , he first has to do the same with the club he plays for on a weekly basis , arsenal , who are coming off a year with no titles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann was a world cup hero against argentina " we had a very disappointing season , " lehmann acknowledged to dw-radio .
" normally we were always involved in the finals at the end of the season . " those sentiments have been seconded by arsenal fans , many of whom believe the club needs a major shake-up .
and some think the place to start is in goal . gooners having a go at " mad jens " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but he was a goat in the 2006 champions league final although lehmann anchored arsenal 's unprecedented unbeaten 2003-4 season in the premiership and led them to the champions league final in 2006 , club supporters are becoming increasingly critical of their number one .
indeed , some seem never to have forgiven him for picking up a red card in that final match against barcelona , which arsenal lost 2-1 . the german 's periodic bursts of temper have earned him the nicknames " mad jens " and " looney lehmann " from fans whose own mental stability is reflected by the fact that they refer to themselves as " gooners . " moreover , arsenal refused to offer lehmann anything more than a one-year contract in the off-season , and the club 's first signing this summer was polish keeper lukasz fabianski - hardly signs of abiding faith in lehmann 's abilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabianski says he 's ready to challenge for lehmann 's arsenal job in the wake of that acquisition , some gooners have called for the german to be replaced .
" lehmann , " opined one blogger on the bbc 's website after the fabianski signing was announced , " has shown increasingly last season he can not be trusted to play for the team when he is distracting the defence with his stupid antics . " gunners fans also rushed to youtube to check out fabianski 's skills for themselves .
most were impressed , with one of them commenting , succinctly : " lehman out , fabianski in , come on arsenal . " last time around ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann will be 38 by the time euro 2008 begins gunners coach arsene wenger is unlikely to put much stock in the ranting of often hysterical fans , but he does want to win some silverware .
should lehmann make a couple of costly blunders early next season , wenger might decide to bench him in favor of fabianski or arsenal 's other backup , manuel almunia . if that hypothetical situation came to pass , it would be hard for german national coach joachim löw to justify starting lehmann ahead of germany 's host of other great keepers . there are also questions about lehmann 's age , with even the keeper himself unclear as to whether he will extend his career beyond 2008 .
" everybody 's spreading rumors , and i 'm doing the same , " lehmann told dw-radio , " so i really do n't know . " a year is a long time in soccer , as lehmann is obviously aware .
so while the arsenal keeper looks a good bet to be minding the posts for germany at the euro 2008 , he is not , by any means , a sure thing . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : leaders meet for crucial summit on europe 's future polish prime minister brings world war two into eu vote debate survey : europeans want strong leadership role from merkel sarkozy could be key player at eu summit central european leaders push for eu reform compromise european union -pipe- 20.06.2007 pressure from all sides as eu prepares for crucial summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the eu reached a dead end or will leaders manage to agree on a compromise ?
european union leaders prepared wednesday for a key summit aimed at agreeing a mandate for a new treaty that reform certain eu rules .
but polish and british objections are still threatening to derail the talks . german chancellor angela merkel formally invited her fellow eu leaders to the brussels summit starting thursday , with the message that " only together will we succeed in resolving the issues before us . "
" the european public now expects us to put the necessary reforms of the union in hand , " she said .
" following our consultations over the last few months the time has now come to set out the roadmap for the impending reform of the treaties . "
however the polish position remains " unchanged , we have not seen any accommodation , " a spokesman for the german eu presidency said in berlin .
poland strongly objects to the voting system proposed by germany which will be discussed at the summit , aimed at working out the broad lines of a new treaty to replace the constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
warsaw believes " double majority " voting , under which agreement by 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the eu population would be required for new rules , would favor big states like germany .
bildunterschrift : merkel and barroso remain optimistic possibility of compromise ?
eu commission chief jose manuel barroso held an hour-long telephone conversation with polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski wednesday seeking a compromise .
after the talks , a polish spokesman said both men " see the possibility of compromise . "

european union leaders prepared wednesday for a key summit aimed at agreeing a mandate for a new treaty that reform certain eu rules .
but polish and british objections are still threatening to derail the talks . german chancellor angela merkel formally invited her fellow eu leaders to the brussels summit starting thursday , with the message that " only together will we succeed in resolving the issues before us . "
" the european public now expects us to put the necessary reforms of the union in hand , " she said .
" following our consultations over the last few months the time has now come to set out the roadmap for the impending reform of the treaties . "
however the polish position remains " unchanged , we have not seen any accommodation , " a spokesman for the german eu presidency said in berlin .
poland strongly objects to the voting system proposed by germany which will be discussed at the summit , aimed at working out the broad lines of a new treaty to replace the constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
warsaw believes " double majority " voting , under which agreement by 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the eu population would be required for new rules , would favor big states like germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : leaders meet for crucial summit on europe 's future polish prime minister brings world war two into eu vote debate survey : europeans want strong leadership role from merkel sarkozy could be key player at eu summit central european leaders push for eu reform compromise european union -pipe- 20.06.2007 pressure from all sides as eu prepares for crucial summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the eu reached a dead end or will leaders manage to agree on a compromise ?
european union leaders prepared wednesday for a key summit aimed at agreeing a mandate for a new treaty that reform certain eu rules .
but polish and british objections are still threatening to derail the talks . german chancellor angela merkel formally invited her fellow eu leaders to the brussels summit starting thursday , with the message that " only together will we succeed in resolving the issues before us . "
" the european public now expects us to put the necessary reforms of the union in hand , " she said .
" following our consultations over the last few months the time has now come to set out the roadmap for the impending reform of the treaties . "
however the polish position remains " unchanged , we have not seen any accommodation , " a spokesman for the german eu presidency said in berlin .
poland strongly objects to the voting system proposed by germany which will be discussed at the summit , aimed at working out the broad lines of a new treaty to replace the constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
warsaw believes " double majority " voting , under which agreement by 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the eu population would be required for new rules , would favor big states like germany .
bildunterschrift : merkel and barroso remain optimistic possibility of compromise ?
eu commission chief jose manuel barroso held an hour-long telephone conversation with polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski wednesday seeking a compromise .
after the talks , a polish spokesman said both men " see the possibility of compromise . "
he hinted that modifications , or a delay , to the double majority voting plan might be enough to persuade warsaw to get in line .
czech premier mirek topolanek , the only backer of the polish demand , meanwhile said wednesday that his country would not veto an agreement at the summit even if poland fails to get the requested changes included .
pressure from both sides britain , the other major opponent to some of merkel 's suggestions was still talking tough wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary margaret beckett " if it comes down to deal or no deal at this european council the uk government is clear ... no deal is better than buying any old pig in a poke , " foreign secretary margaret beckett said .
british prime minister tony blair insists he will not cede national control over foreign policy , the judicial and police system or tax and social security rules , while refusing to give legal force to an eu charter of fundamental rights .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said he was sure the eu states could reach agreement on a new treaty but said he was " very worried " about british opposition to an eu-wide foreign policy .
at the other end of the spectrum , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker threatened to reject the new eu treaty if it did not correspond with crucial elements of the current proposal for a constitution , putting pressure on germany from another side .
germany 's draft germany , which holds the eu presidency until the end of the month , on tuesday handed its eu partners a draft mandate for the intergovernmental conference .
the draft scraps reference to the eu flag and anthem , items guaranteed to raise the hackles of euroskeptics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany does n't care what the document is called as long as it starts an eu reform process it also avoids some controversial terminology .
the new " reform treaty " would amend existing eu treaties rather than replace them .
the word " constitution " has been dropped .
germany insists on an eu " foreign minister , " but a new job title has to be agreed on .
this is unlikely to satisfy britain .
for britain , which also opposes more qualified majority voting in judicial matters , preferring instead unanimous decision-making , germany offered a clause for countries that choose not to participate .
the german draft also provides for national parliaments to be given up to eight weeks to examine draft laws , satisfying a demand by the netherlands .

artist peter friedl 's stuffed giraffe from kalkilya zoo in the west bank is garnering a lot of attention . her eyes are halfway shut and her coat looks worn like those of stuffed toys that have been played with for a very long time .
brownie the giraffe also looks a little small when compared to other specimens of its kind .
but the stuffed animal has still become the center of attention at the 12th documenta that opened in the central german city of kassel last weekend .
until five years ago , brownie was a favorite among visitors to kalkilya zoo in the west bank .
she died when the small town became the center of a military offensive and israeli troops attacked a hamas camp .
brownie panicked , ran into an iron rod , then fell to the floor and died of heart failure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sculpture has become a visitor magnet austrian artist peter friedl said he 's not interested in presenting the animal as a witness for the prosecution , nor does he intend to take a side .
instead , he 's aiming to add an aesthetic experience to the flood of pictures that can be found in the media .
" if you make the mistake of competing with media images by working in a documentary style , you 're bound to lose , " he said .
" fiction and documentation only produce clichés in this situation .

tickling the imagination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter friedl but the example of the dead giraffe from palestine also stands for the overall concept of this year 's documenta .
" migrating forms " is the overarching theme of the exhibition .
it means that a picture , a sculpture or an installation does n't only change in a new environment , but also takes on new meaning .
the documenta is trying to give back images to visitors so they can trust their own imaginations again .
friedl said he views the giraffe as a sculpture that can and should help visitors invent stories to go along with it .

three years and a change of government later , however , warsaw 's trying to undo the hard-found compromise .
" nice or death " was the polish government 's approach in 2003 , when the eu member states started negotiating a bloc-wide treaty .
the bone of contention then , as now , was the double-majority voting system .
the treaty of nice gave poland - a country of 38 million - more votes , nearly as many as germany , with its 82 million people .
poland 's insistence on sticking to the treaty of nice ultimately led to isolation .
the then social democratic government in warsaw finally gave in and signed , in 2004 .
however , after the failed referendums on the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year , poland dropped its endorsement of the paper .
ever since germany started preparing the ground for a new eu constitution , an institutional treaty as they have started calling it , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's president and prime minister respectively , have been threatening to veto .
their demands concern one individual point : the double-majority voting system in the european council , the eu 's top decision-making body , should be dropped in favor of a square-root principle . allocating votes to countries on that basis would reduce the influence of the eu 's biggest countries - in particular that of germany .
there 's no mistaking the reproachful tone of warsaw 's arguments implying that berlin dominates the eu .
anti-german sentiment " we are n't so afraid of the germans , " poland 's chief negotiator , marek cichocki , told dw-world.de.
" if we were so afraid of them , would we propose a rule that still concedes the germans more votes than the poles ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski could well be up for some long nights together during the summit rather , the poles were concerned with establishing a generally more fair voting system , cichocki said .
polish eu expert jacek pawlicki , a commentator at polish daily gazeta wyborcza , conceded that cichocki 's argument was understandable .
however , he pointed out , the debate in poland had been marked by increasing anti-german sentiment .
" most poles do n't fully understand what the issue is , " pawlicki said .
" but they sense that it 's about increasing the poles ' influence , and thus , the majority naturally approves . "
in their collective memory , the poles are haunted by having been deceived and betrayed in the past .
the kaczynski twins know how to capitalize on those fears and are neither put off by a worsening of relations to germany nor by isolation within the eu .
isolation is not at all an issue , said cichocki .
instead , he said he felt that , in the course of the discussion about the voting system , public opinion in europe had already changed .
" many listen intently to our proposals and understand our problem . "
europe annoyed ?
" the unloved neighbors - how the poles irritate europe " was , however , the title of this week 's edition of germany 's der spiegel news magazine .
even if some commentators and political scientists see promise in the polish square-root proposal , warsaw 's threat to veto has riled some .
silvana koch-mehrin , a german member of the european parliament , even went so far as to suggest that the poles ought to consider getting out of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw says it does n't want to cause deadlock at the summit " if a country in the eu does n't feel good than you should tell it : if you do n't like it , there 's this possibility , " she said .
cichocki rebuffs the attacks , calling koch-mehrin 's a " reckless idea . "
" such suggestions are entirely unnecessary . "
the question is whether warsaw will agree to a compromise .
" that 's hard to say , " said cichocki .
" this summit has its own logic and this logic is only foreseeable up to a certain standpoint . "
wait and see polish politics also has a certain logic , according to jan barcz , a professor of european law in warsaw .
" no independent expert in poland at the moment can say how the kaczynski brothers will behave in the negotiations .
their politics are simply unpredictable . "
for now , prime minister kaczynski hinted that warsaw might be willing to budge in an interview with germany 's bild-zeitung newspaper , published on wednesday , the day before the two-day summit opens .
poland 's proposal did n't necessarily have to lead to a deadlock in the talks , he said .
" at the moment we only want a debate to be allowed -lrb- at the summit -rrb- on the voting system . "
but he also told the paper , " they are trying to isolate and ignore poland .
we can not agree to that .
that would be suicide , " he said . britain too is seeking to water down proposals for a common european foreign and security policy .

just prior to this week 's eu constitutional treaty summit , poland insisted that changes be made to the treaty 's voting system .
can and should the document be rescued ?
readers gave their two cents . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i am totally opposed to any further extension of eu powers as proposed in the new treaty .
i therefore fully support poland in the stand taken on voting rights . - joseph wright , great britain if the eu wants to live in a false democratic state , then it should apply pressure .
however , if they want to leave in a truly democratic state , than the eu must adopt poland 's solution .
a basic and true fundamental principle of democracy is that the power must be divided equally along the partners . - jan , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kaczynski wants to change the treaty 's voting system as america formed its union with the acceptance of 9 of 13 states , the eu should consider forming the union with the acceptance of the constitution by 20 states , or some such majority .
one for all , all for one , is a very difficult formulation for the complexity of the constitution . - scott miller , us in my opinion , romano prodi is right .
the countries that want more integration should improve their relationship formally .
two blocks inside the eu - that is the answer . - gustavo araujo , uruguay the voting system related to population count in each of the eu countries would be fair only in the case of total integration of eu citizens .
this is not the case at the moment and there need to be some security for smaller nations .
the current system is giving much less voice to small countries .
poland is right that the system should be a compromise between interests of big countries like germany and small countries like the czech republic .
germany has the largest population and obviously the system merkel proposes is in germany 's interest . - jack , canada poland is a relatively new member within the eu , which was carried by france and germany .
when spain , for example , joined the eu , eu contributions initiated its economic recovery .
spain does n't have any problems regarding voting allocations .
poland should accept the present voting allocations and stop trying to scare europe with its veto power .
one should not ignore history .
with many polish people leaving for england , human migration throughout the eu should be recognized in the constitution through amendments . - hans reuther-fix , antigua and barbuda compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland dampens hopes for eu treaty success poland seemed to have softened its public tone on the eve of a crucial eu treaty summit , but concerns run deep in the country about not being taken seriously for plans to change the bloc 's reformed voting system .

three years and a change of government later , however , warsaw 's trying to undo the hard-found compromise .
" nice or death " was the polish government 's approach in 2003 , when the eu member states started negotiating a bloc-wide treaty .
the bone of contention then , as now , was the double-majority voting system .
the treaty of nice gave poland - a country of 38 million - more votes , nearly as many as germany , with its 82 million people .
poland 's insistence on sticking to the treaty of nice ultimately led to isolation .
the then social democratic government in warsaw finally gave in and signed , in 2004 .
however , after the failed referendums on the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year , poland dropped its endorsement of the paper .
ever since germany started preparing the ground for a new eu constitution , an institutional treaty as they have started calling it , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's president and prime minister respectively , have been threatening to veto .
their demands concern one individual point : the double-majority voting system in the european council , the eu 's top decision-making body , should be dropped in favor of a square-root principle . allocating votes to countries on that basis would reduce the influence of the eu 's biggest countries - in particular that of germany .
there 's no mistaking the reproachful tone of warsaw 's arguments implying that berlin dominates the eu .
anti-german sentiment " we are n't so afraid of the germans , " poland 's chief negotiator , marek cichocki , told dw-world.de.
" if we were so afraid of them , would we propose a rule that still concedes the germans more votes than the poles ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski could well be up for some long nights together during the summit rather , the poles were concerned with establishing a generally more fair voting system , cichocki said .
polish eu expert jacek pawlicki , a commentator at polish daily gazeta wyborcza , conceded that cichocki 's argument was understandable .
however , he pointed out , the debate in poland had been marked by increasing anti-german sentiment .
" most poles do n't fully understand what the issue is , " pawlicki said .
" but they sense that it 's about increasing the poles ' influence , and thus , the majority naturally approves . "
in their collective memory , the poles are haunted by having been deceived and betrayed in the past .
the kaczynski twins know how to capitalize on those fears and are neither put off by a worsening of relations to germany nor by isolation within the eu .
isolation is not at all an issue , said cichocki .
instead , he said he felt that , in the course of the discussion about the voting system , public opinion in europe had already changed .
" many listen intently to our proposals and understand our problem . "
europe annoyed ?
" the unloved neighbors - how the poles irritate europe " was , however , the title of this week 's edition of germany 's der spiegel news magazine .
even if some commentators and political scientists see promise in the polish square-root proposal , warsaw 's threat to veto has riled some .
silvana koch-mehrin , a german member of the european parliament , even went so far as to suggest that the poles ought to consider getting out of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw says it does n't want to cause deadlock at the summit " if a country in the eu does n't feel good than you should tell it : if you do n't like it , there 's this possibility , " she said .
cichocki rebuffs the attacks , calling koch-mehrin 's a " reckless idea . "
" such suggestions are entirely unnecessary . "
the question is whether warsaw will agree to a compromise .
" that 's hard to say , " said cichocki .
" this summit has its own logic and this logic is only foreseeable up to a certain standpoint . "
wait and see polish politics also has a certain logic , according to jan barcz , a professor of european law in warsaw .
" no independent expert in poland at the moment can say how the kaczynski brothers will behave in the negotiations .
their politics are simply unpredictable . "
for now , prime minister kaczynski hinted that warsaw might be willing to budge in an interview with germany 's bild-zeitung newspaper , published on wednesday , the day before the two-day summit opens .
poland 's proposal did n't necessarily have to lead to a deadlock in the talks , he said .

strike action launched by the union on may 11 to protest the outsourcing plans would end on friday , a union spokesman said .

last month , the former state monopoly reported a 58-per-cent drop in first-quarter earnings , largely as a result of a slump in its fixed-line operations in germany .
under the deal agreed on wednesday , the workers transferred to the new companies will receive a 6.5 cut in pay and see their working week increased by four hours to 38 hours .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 20.06.2007 spate of new reactor plans gives eu an atomic jolt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power is on the march across parts of europe thanks to increased demand for energy that does not emit greenhouse gases , the nuclear power industry is seeing a surge in popularity - especially in former communist countries . european pledges to combat global warming appear to be giving nuclear energy a boost .
even some countries that have moved to phase out nuclear reactors have once more taken up the debate over atomic power , which advocates promote as being much cleaner than traditional energy sources because it produces very low levels of toxic co2 . the change might come as something of a surprise to anyone who has swum in the tide of overwhelmingly anti-nuke public opinion for the past two decades , and especially after the chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 showed the reality of the flaws of lax nuclear safety . yet the mood appears to be shifting , prompted at least in part by european pledges to cut carbon emissions and slow global warming .
especially eager to jump aboard the pro-nukes bandwagon are ex-soviet countries , whose rapid growth and long-standing dependence on russian natural gas makes them extra-keen to take control of their energy markets . new member states are key five of the 10 countries that joined the then 15-nation european union in its 2004 expansion - the czech republic , hungary , lithuania , slovakia and slovenia - have operating reactors .
bulgaria was made to shut down two soviet-era reactors as a condition for eu entry despite noisy opposition .
but its controversial plans to build a new reactor in belene , near the danube , are moving ahead .
the country has already signed with russian company atomstroyexport to build the new plant . romania and the czech republic also have plans to build new reactors .
while construction has begun on plants in romania , the czech government is holding off on similar moves for the next four years due to the presence of the greens in the new coalition . hungary and slovakia are also discussing adding additional units , while baltic states , lithuania , estonia and latvia , have signed an agreement committing to the construction of a new plant at ignalina in lithuania .
poland has also signed a co-operation agreement with lithuania . the ukraine , not in the eu , got almost 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear power last year .
it is considering adding up to 11 new nuclear plants by 2030 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1986 , crowds demonstrated against an atomic plant in hamburg sami tulonen , a spokesman for eu nuclear trade association foratom , acknowledged that eastern-bloc countries have " more advanced discussions " of building new power plants .
this , he said , could be attributed to several factors . " in the new eu states there is more political and public support for nuclear power , " tulonen said .
and as a result of eu entry , " there is very strong economic growth in the region , and need for more electricity capacity to meet demand . " add to that the fact that so much of the east 's current power comes from " very dirty " sources like coal , and the increasing intolerance for greenhouse gases , and its easy to understand how the tide of public opinion can turn toward nuclear energy , tulonen said . ' they want no part of russian domination ' " they have to meet the kyoto goals , and they know their economies are growing , yet they need more nuclear power to meet the low carbon demand , " he added . under the 1997 kyoto protocol , 39 industrialized nations agreed to cut emissions of six greenhouse gases to an average of 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 . finally , observers note that former soviet states are eager to be less dependent on russia 's energy monopolies in the region . " they already know what its like to be dominated by russia , and they want no part of trading political domination for economic domination by increasing their dependence on russia oil and gas , " wrote pro-nuke activist rod adams on his blog , atomicinsight . growth in western europe , too foratom 's tulonen warns that it is false to see the movement as clearly one of east versus west , however . " there is also a lot of discussion about nuclear new build among old -lrb- eu -rrb- member states , " he said , noting that finland is currently building the first nuclear reactor to go up in the eu in the last 15 years . france has serious plans to build , and discussions on amping up nuclear energy in sweden and belgium are ongoing .
even britain is considering nuclear options , he said . " reactor-wise , it is difficult to say where the widest growth will be in five years , " tulonen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paks nuklear power plant in hungary currently , 30 percent of the eu 's total electricity production comes from nuclear sources ; that number is as high as 80 percent in nuke-friendly countries like france and belgium .
germany gets 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear sources .
eu forum on nukes meanwhile , on june 15 the eu announced the formation of an eu nuclear energy forum , which will meet twice a year in an effort to " lay the groundwork for a structured , open debate , about this energy source , without taboos , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a press release .
foratom 's tulonen says he hopes the forum will be used to " lay a roadmap for nuclear investment , in order to support the nuclear renaissance . " opponents of nuclear power , however , argue that the atomic industry is simply using a cynical ploy to exploit people who are worried about global warming by stressing the supposedly low levels of co2 produced by nuclear plants . cynical ploy ? " the nuclear industry has gotten wise to the fact that people are interested in this … they 're trying to sell the idea that nuclear power is the clean alternative , " said sonja meister , a climate and energy campaigner for grassroots environmental group friends of the earth .
not only is it a ploy , meister argues , " its just not true .
they say nuclear power has no co2 emissions , but if you look at the whole production cycle - the emissions produced during uranium mining , building the plant , there is a great deal of co2 produced . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is closing this plant in lithuania , but a replacement is planned moreover , when cost comparisons are made between nuclear and other types of energy sources , safety and potential cleanup costs are almost always ignored , meister said .
" nuclear power plants can never be safe , " she said .
" there is always a danger of human error , even if they are a bit more secure or efficient .
and the general problem of what to do with nuclear waste remains , so it does n't matter if they are a little safer . "
the question remains if it would be possible to phase out nuclear energy and still meet projected emissions cuts in europe .
according to meister , the key lies in investing in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency . " there is no valid reason for nuclear energy , " meister said .
" you can save 10 times more co2 emissions by investing in energy efficiency than in nuclear power … continuing to invest in nuclear energy is just economically insane , " she said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

poland has also signed a co-operation agreement with lithuania . the ukraine , not in the eu , got almost 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear power last year .
it is considering adding up to 11 new nuclear plants by 2030 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1986 , crowds demonstrated against an atomic plant in hamburg sami tulonen , a spokesman for eu nuclear trade association foratom , acknowledged that eastern-bloc countries have " more advanced discussions " of building new power plants .
this , he said , could be attributed to several factors . " in the new eu states there is more political and public support for nuclear power , " tulonen said .
and as a result of eu entry , " there is very strong economic growth in the region , and need for more electricity capacity to meet demand . " add to that the fact that so much of the east 's current power comes from " very dirty " sources like coal , and the increasing intolerance for greenhouse gases , and its easy to understand how the tide of public opinion can turn toward nuclear energy , tulonen said . ' they want no part of russian domination ' " they have to meet the kyoto goals , and they know their economies are growing , yet they need more nuclear power to meet the low carbon demand , " he added . under the 1997 kyoto protocol , 39 industrialized nations agreed to cut emissions of six greenhouse gases to an average of 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 . finally , observers note that former soviet states are eager to be less dependent on russia 's energy monopolies in the region . " they already know what its like to be dominated by russia , and they want no part of trading political domination for economic domination by increasing their dependence on russia oil and gas , " wrote pro-nuke activist rod adams on his blog , atomicinsight . growth in western europe , too foratom 's tulonen warns that it is false to see the movement as clearly one of east versus west , however . " there is also a lot of discussion about nuclear new build among old -lrb- eu -rrb- member states , " he said , noting that finland is currently building the first nuclear reactor to go up in the eu in the last 15 years . france has serious plans to build , and discussions on amping up nuclear energy in sweden and belgium are ongoing .
even britain is considering nuclear options , he said . " reactor-wise , it is difficult to say where the widest growth will be in five years , " tulonen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paks nuklear power plant in hungary currently , 30 percent of the eu 's total electricity production comes from nuclear sources ; that number is as high as 80 percent in nuke-friendly countries like france and belgium .
germany gets 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear sources .
eu forum on nukes meanwhile , on june 15 the eu announced the formation of an eu nuclear energy forum , which will meet twice a year in an effort to " lay the groundwork for a structured , open debate , about this energy source , without taboos , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a press release .
foratom 's tulonen says he hopes the forum will be used to " lay a roadmap for nuclear investment , in order to support the nuclear renaissance . " opponents of nuclear power , however , argue that the atomic industry is simply using a cynical ploy to exploit people who are worried about global warming by stressing the supposedly low levels of co2 produced by nuclear plants . cynical ploy ? " the nuclear industry has gotten wise to the fact that people are interested in this … they 're trying to sell the idea that nuclear power is the clean alternative , " said sonja meister , a climate and energy campaigner for grassroots environmental group friends of the earth .
not only is it a ploy , meister argues , " its just not true .
they say nuclear power has no co2 emissions , but if you look at the whole production cycle - the emissions produced during uranium mining , building the plant , there is a great deal of co2 produced . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is closing this plant in lithuania , but a replacement is planned moreover , when cost comparisons are made between nuclear and other types of energy sources , safety and potential cleanup costs are almost always ignored , meister said .
" nuclear power plants can never be safe , " she said .
" there is always a danger of human error , even if they are a bit more secure or efficient .
and the general problem of what to do with nuclear waste remains , so it does n't matter if they are a little safer . "
the question remains if it would be possible to phase out nuclear energy and still meet projected emissions cuts in europe .
according to meister , the key lies in investing in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency . " there is no valid reason for nuclear energy , " meister said .
" you can save 10 times more co2 emissions by investing in energy efficiency than in nuclear power … continuing to invest in nuclear energy is just economically insane , " she said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european championships -pipe- 20.06.2007 lehmann 's arsenal fortunes could affect his status for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann has fought his way to the top of the german national team it took jens lehmann almost a decade to supplant ollie kahn as germany 's starting keeper .
but his reign between the posts might be short-lived if he fails to have success this year with the premiership side arsenal . jens lehmann was in bonn on tuesday to cement his place in german sports history .
the 37-year-old keeper was on hand as that city 's house of history museum received the page of notes he used to save two penalties in germany 's dramatic quarterfinal win over argentina in last year 's world cup . it was a moment of confirmation and satisfaction for a keeper who used to play second fiddle in his national side and who is germany 's clear number one ahead of the european soccer championship next year in austria and switzerland . but lehmann still has work to do , if he wants a chance to crown his career with an international title for germany .
to maintain his status in the national side , he first has to do the same with the club he plays for on a weekly basis , arsenal , who are coming off a year with no titles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann was a world cup hero against argentina " we had a very disappointing season , " lehmann acknowledged to dw-radio .
" normally we were always involved in the finals at the end of the season . " those sentiments have been seconded by arsenal fans , many of whom believe the club needs a major shake-up .
and some think the place to start is in goal . gooners having a go at " mad jens " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but he was a goat in the 2006 champions league final although lehmann anchored arsenal 's unprecedented unbeaten 2003-4 season in the premiership and led them to the champions league final in 2006 , club supporters are becoming increasingly critical of their number one .
indeed , some seem never to have forgiven him for picking up a red card in that final match against barcelona , which arsenal lost 2-1 . the german 's periodic bursts of temper have earned him the nicknames " mad jens " and " looney lehmann " from fans whose own mental stability is reflected by the fact that they refer to themselves as " gooners . " moreover , arsenal refused to offer lehmann anything more than a one-year contract in the off-season , and the club 's first signing this summer was polish keeper lukasz fabianski - hardly signs of abiding faith in lehmann 's abilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabianski says he 's ready to challenge for lehmann 's arsenal job in the wake of that acquisition , some gooners have called for the german to be replaced .
" lehmann , " opined one blogger on the bbc 's website after the fabianski signing was announced , " has shown increasingly last season he can not be trusted to play for the team when he is distracting the defence with his stupid antics . " gunners fans also rushed to youtube to check out fabianski 's skills for themselves .
most were impressed , with one of them commenting , succinctly : " lehman out , fabianski in , come on arsenal . " last time around ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann will be 38 by the time euro 2008 begins gunners coach arsene wenger is unlikely to put much stock in the ranting of often hysterical fans , but he does want to win some silverware .
should lehmann make a couple of costly blunders early next season , wenger might decide to bench him in favor of fabianski or arsenal 's other backup , manuel almunia . if that hypothetical situation came to pass , it would be hard for german national coach joachim löw to justify starting lehmann ahead of germany 's host of other great keepers . there are also questions about lehmann 's age , with even the keeper himself unclear as to whether he will extend his career beyond 2008 .
" everybody 's spreading rumors , and i 'm doing the same , " lehmann told dw-radio , " so i really do n't know . " a year is a long time in soccer , as lehmann is obviously aware .

but his reign between the posts might be short-lived if he fails to have success this year with the premiership side arsenal . jens lehmann was in bonn on tuesday to cement his place in german sports history .
the 37-year-old keeper was on hand as that city 's house of history museum received the page of notes he used to save two penalties in germany 's dramatic quarterfinal win over argentina in last year 's world cup . it was a moment of confirmation and satisfaction for a keeper who used to play second fiddle in his national side and who is germany 's clear number one ahead of the european soccer championship next year in austria and switzerland . but lehmann still has work to do , if he wants a chance to crown his career with an international title for germany .
to maintain his status in the national side , he first has to do the same with the club he plays for on a weekly basis , arsenal , who are coming off a year with no titles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann was a world cup hero against argentina " we had a very disappointing season , " lehmann acknowledged to dw-radio .

indeed , some seem never to have forgiven him for picking up a red card in that final match against barcelona , which arsenal lost 2-1 . the german 's periodic bursts of temper have earned him the nicknames " mad jens " and " looney lehmann " from fans whose own mental stability is reflected by the fact that they refer to themselves as " gooners . " moreover , arsenal refused to offer lehmann anything more than a one-year contract in the off-season , and the club 's first signing this summer was polish keeper lukasz fabianski - hardly signs of abiding faith in lehmann 's abilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabianski says he 's ready to challenge for lehmann 's arsenal job in the wake of that acquisition , some gooners have called for the german to be replaced .
" lehmann , " opined one blogger on the bbc 's website after the fabianski signing was announced , " has shown increasingly last season he can not be trusted to play for the team when he is distracting the defence with his stupid antics .

slimming down the cabinet is part of sarkozy 's agenda to cut costs and increase government efficiency . sweeping reforms a special session of the newly-elected national assembly is to be convened next week to push through a first round of reforms , including tax breaks aimed at jump-starting the economy and lowering unemployment hovering at 8.2 percent , one of the highest in europe . one month after sarkozy took office promising sweeping reforms , his ump party won a national assembly majority in sunday 's vote , but it lost more than 40 seats while the opposition socialists made surprise gains . and in a symbolic blow to the government , juppe , a former prime minister and mayor of bordeaux , lost to a socialist and had to resign from the cabinet . sarkozy had brought him back from political exile after his conviction in a party finance scandal that had prevented him from holding public office for a year . despite the disappointment , prime minister francois fillon has insisted that the election delivered a " majority for action " and vowed to forge ahead with the reform programm . fillon said tuesday that he had not " shut the door " on a proposal to increase the value-added tax by up to 5 percent to help finance soaring health care costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal has her eye on her party 's top job the proposal was widely seen as having provided the opposition socialists with a boon during the final days of campaigning for the parliamentary elections . royal split many in the party were angered by segolene royal 's announcement sunday that she had split from her long-standing partner , socialist party leader francois hollande .

three years and a change of government later , however , warsaw 's trying to undo the hard-found compromise .
" nice or death " was the polish government 's approach in 2003 , when the eu member states started negotiating a bloc-wide treaty .
the bone of contention then , as now , was the double-majority voting system .
the treaty of nice gave poland - a country of 38 million - more votes , nearly as many as germany , with its 82 million people .
poland 's insistence on sticking to the treaty of nice ultimately led to isolation .
the then social democratic government in warsaw finally gave in and signed , in 2004 .
however , after the failed referendums on the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year , poland dropped its endorsement of the paper .
ever since germany started preparing the ground for a new eu constitution , an institutional treaty as they have started calling it , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's president and prime minister respectively , have been threatening to veto .
their demands concern one individual point : the double-majority voting system in the european council , the eu 's top decision-making body , should be dropped in favor of a square-root principle . allocating votes to countries on that basis would reduce the influence of the eu 's biggest countries - in particular that of germany .
there 's no mistaking the reproachful tone of warsaw 's arguments implying that berlin dominates the eu .
anti-german sentiment " we are n't so afraid of the germans , " poland 's chief negotiator , marek cichocki , told dw-world.de.
" if we were so afraid of them , would we propose a rule that still concedes the germans more votes than the poles ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski could well be up for some long nights together during the summit rather , the poles were concerned with establishing a generally more fair voting system , cichocki said .
polish eu expert jacek pawlicki , a commentator at polish daily gazeta wyborcza , conceded that cichocki 's argument was understandable .
however , he pointed out , the debate in poland had been marked by increasing anti-german sentiment .
" most poles do n't fully understand what the issue is , " pawlicki said .
" but they sense that it 's about increasing the poles ' influence , and thus , the majority naturally approves . "
in their collective memory , the poles are haunted by having been deceived and betrayed in the past .
the kaczynski twins know how to capitalize on those fears and are neither put off by a worsening of relations to germany nor by isolation within the eu .
isolation is not at all an issue , said cichocki .
instead , he said he felt that , in the course of the discussion about the voting system , public opinion in europe had already changed .
" many listen intently to our proposals and understand our problem . "
europe annoyed ?
" the unloved neighbors - how the poles irritate europe " was , however , the title of this week 's edition of germany 's der spiegel news magazine .
even if some commentators and political scientists see promise in the polish square-root proposal , warsaw 's threat to veto has riled some .
silvana koch-mehrin , a german member of the european parliament , even went so far as to suggest that the poles ought to consider getting out of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw says it does n't want to cause deadlock at the summit " if a country in the eu does n't feel good than you should tell it : if you do n't like it , there 's this possibility , " she said .
cichocki rebuffs the attacks , calling koch-mehrin 's a " reckless idea . "
" such suggestions are entirely unnecessary . "
the question is whether warsaw will agree to a compromise .
" that 's hard to say , " said cichocki .
" this summit has its own logic and this logic is only foreseeable up to a certain standpoint . "
wait and see polish politics also has a certain logic , according to jan barcz , a professor of european law in warsaw .
" no independent expert in poland at the moment can say how the kaczynski brothers will behave in the negotiations .
their politics are simply unpredictable . "
for now , prime minister kaczynski hinted that warsaw might be willing to budge in an interview with germany 's bild-zeitung newspaper , published on wednesday , the day before the two-day summit opens .
poland 's proposal did n't necessarily have to lead to a deadlock in the talks , he said .
" at the moment we only want a debate to be allowed -lrb- at the summit -rrb- on the voting system . "
but he also told the paper , " they are trying to isolate and ignore poland .
we can not agree to that .
that would be suicide , " he said . britain too is seeking to water down proposals for a common european foreign and security policy .
london and warsaw 's positions are seen as the chief obstacles to acheiving a deal on the treaty . nadine wojcik -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the then social democratic government in warsaw finally gave in and signed , in 2004 .
however , after the failed referendums on the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year , poland dropped its endorsement of the paper .
ever since germany started preparing the ground for a new eu constitution , an institutional treaty as they have started calling it , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's president and prime minister respectively , have been threatening to veto .
their demands concern one individual point : the double-majority voting system in the european council , the eu 's top decision-making body , should be dropped in favor of a square-root principle . allocating votes to countries on that basis would reduce the influence of the eu 's biggest countries - in particular that of germany .
there 's no mistaking the reproachful tone of warsaw 's arguments implying that berlin dominates the eu .
anti-german sentiment " we are n't so afraid of the germans , " poland 's chief negotiator , marek cichocki , told dw-world.de.
" if we were so afraid of them , would we propose a rule that still concedes the germans more votes than the poles ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski could well be up for some long nights together during the summit rather , the poles were concerned with establishing a generally more fair voting system , cichocki said .
polish eu expert jacek pawlicki , a commentator at polish daily gazeta wyborcza , conceded that cichocki 's argument was understandable .
however , he pointed out , the debate in poland had been marked by increasing anti-german sentiment .
" most poles do n't fully understand what the issue is , " pawlicki said .
" but they sense that it 's about increasing the poles ' influence , and thus , the majority naturally approves . "
in their collective memory , the poles are haunted by having been deceived and betrayed in the past .
the kaczynski twins know how to capitalize on those fears and are neither put off by a worsening of relations to germany nor by isolation within the eu .
isolation is not at all an issue , said cichocki .
instead , he said he felt that , in the course of the discussion about the voting system , public opinion in europe had already changed .
" many listen intently to our proposals and understand our problem . "
europe annoyed ?
" the unloved neighbors - how the poles irritate europe " was , however , the title of this week 's edition of germany 's der spiegel news magazine .
even if some commentators and political scientists see promise in the polish square-root proposal , warsaw 's threat to veto has riled some .
silvana koch-mehrin , a german member of the european parliament , even went so far as to suggest that the poles ought to consider getting out of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw says it does n't want to cause deadlock at the summit " if a country in the eu does n't feel good than you should tell it : if you do n't like it , there 's this possibility , " she said .
cichocki rebuffs the attacks , calling koch-mehrin 's a " reckless idea . "
" such suggestions are entirely unnecessary . "
the question is whether warsaw will agree to a compromise .
" that 's hard to say , " said cichocki .
" this summit has its own logic and this logic is only foreseeable up to a certain standpoint . "
wait and see polish politics also has a certain logic , according to jan barcz , a professor of european law in warsaw .
" no independent expert in poland at the moment can say how the kaczynski brothers will behave in the negotiations .
their politics are simply unpredictable . "
for now , prime minister kaczynski hinted that warsaw might be willing to budge in an interview with germany 's bild-zeitung newspaper , published on wednesday , the day before the two-day summit opens .
poland 's proposal did n't necessarily have to lead to a deadlock in the talks , he said .
" at the moment we only want a debate to be allowed -lrb- at the summit -rrb- on the voting system . "
but he also told the paper , " they are trying to isolate and ignore poland .
we can not agree to that .
that would be suicide , " he said . britain too is seeking to water down proposals for a common european foreign and security policy .
london and warsaw 's positions are seen as the chief obstacles to acheiving a deal on the treaty . nadine wojcik -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european union leaders prepared wednesday for a key summit aimed at agreeing a mandate for a new treaty that reform certain eu rules .
but polish and british objections are still threatening to derail the talks . german chancellor angela merkel formally invited her fellow eu leaders to the brussels summit starting thursday , with the message that " only together will we succeed in resolving the issues before us . "
" the european public now expects us to put the necessary reforms of the union in hand , " she said .
" following our consultations over the last few months the time has now come to set out the roadmap for the impending reform of the treaties . "
however the polish position remains " unchanged , we have not seen any accommodation , " a spokesman for the german eu presidency said in berlin .
poland strongly objects to the voting system proposed by germany which will be discussed at the summit , aimed at working out the broad lines of a new treaty to replace the constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
warsaw believes " double majority " voting , under which agreement by 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the eu population would be required for new rules , would favor big states like germany .

eu commission chief jose manuel barroso held an hour-long telephone conversation with polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski wednesday seeking a compromise .
after the talks , a polish spokesman said both men " see the possibility of compromise . "
he hinted that modifications , or a delay , to the double majority voting plan might be enough to persuade warsaw to get in line .
czech premier mirek topolanek , the only backer of the polish demand , meanwhile said wednesday that his country would not veto an agreement at the summit even if poland fails to get the requested changes included .

european union leaders prepared wednesday for a key summit aimed at agreeing a mandate for a new treaty that reform certain eu rules .
but polish and british objections are still threatening to derail the talks . german chancellor angela merkel formally invited her fellow eu leaders to the brussels summit starting thursday , with the message that " only together will we succeed in resolving the issues before us . "
" the european public now expects us to put the necessary reforms of the union in hand , " she said .
" following our consultations over the last few months the time has now come to set out the roadmap for the impending reform of the treaties . "
however the polish position remains " unchanged , we have not seen any accommodation , " a spokesman for the german eu presidency said in berlin .
poland strongly objects to the voting system proposed by germany which will be discussed at the summit , aimed at working out the broad lines of a new treaty to replace the constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
warsaw believes " double majority " voting , under which agreement by 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the eu population would be required for new rules , would favor big states like germany .
bildunterschrift : merkel and barroso remain optimistic possibility of compromise ?
eu commission chief jose manuel barroso held an hour-long telephone conversation with polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski wednesday seeking a compromise .
after the talks , a polish spokesman said both men " see the possibility of compromise . "
he hinted that modifications , or a delay , to the double majority voting plan might be enough to persuade warsaw to get in line .
czech premier mirek topolanek , the only backer of the polish demand , meanwhile said wednesday that his country would not veto an agreement at the summit even if poland fails to get the requested changes included .
pressure from both sides britain , the other major opponent to some of merkel 's suggestions was still talking tough wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary margaret beckett " if it comes down to deal or no deal at this european council the uk government is clear ... no deal is better than buying any old pig in a poke , " foreign secretary margaret beckett said .
british prime minister tony blair insists he will not cede national control over foreign policy , the judicial and police system or tax and social security rules , while refusing to give legal force to an eu charter of fundamental rights .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said he was sure the eu states could reach agreement on a new treaty but said he was " very worried " about british opposition to an eu-wide foreign policy .
at the other end of the spectrum , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker threatened to reject the new eu treaty if it did not correspond with crucial elements of the current proposal for a constitution , putting pressure on germany from another side .
germany 's draft germany , which holds the eu presidency until the end of the month , on tuesday handed its eu partners a draft mandate for the intergovernmental conference .
the draft scraps reference to the eu flag and anthem , items guaranteed to raise the hackles of euroskeptics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany does n't care what the document is called as long as it starts an eu reform process it also avoids some controversial terminology .
the new " reform treaty " would amend existing eu treaties rather than replace them .
the word " constitution " has been dropped .
germany insists on an eu " foreign minister , " but a new job title has to be agreed on .
this is unlikely to satisfy britain .
for britain , which also opposes more qualified majority voting in judicial matters , preferring instead unanimous decision-making , germany offered a clause for countries that choose not to participate .
the german draft also provides for national parliaments to be given up to eight weeks to examine draft laws , satisfying a demand by the netherlands .
any draft mandate for a treaty will then go to an intergovernmental conference , which official say is likely to start in july , for several months of discussion . dw staff based on wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 20.06.2007 spate of new reactor plans gives eu an atomic jolt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power is on the march across parts of europe thanks to increased demand for energy that does not emit greenhouse gases , the nuclear power industry is seeing a surge in popularity - especially in former communist countries . european pledges to combat global warming appear to be giving nuclear energy a boost .
even some countries that have moved to phase out nuclear reactors have once more taken up the debate over atomic power , which advocates promote as being much cleaner than traditional energy sources because it produces very low levels of toxic co2 . the change might come as something of a surprise to anyone who has swum in the tide of overwhelmingly anti-nuke public opinion for the past two decades , and especially after the chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 showed the reality of the flaws of lax nuclear safety . yet the mood appears to be shifting , prompted at least in part by european pledges to cut carbon emissions and slow global warming .
especially eager to jump aboard the pro-nukes bandwagon are ex-soviet countries , whose rapid growth and long-standing dependence on russian natural gas makes them extra-keen to take control of their energy markets . new member states are key five of the 10 countries that joined the then 15-nation european union in its 2004 expansion - the czech republic , hungary , lithuania , slovakia and slovenia - have operating reactors .
bulgaria was made to shut down two soviet-era reactors as a condition for eu entry despite noisy opposition .
but its controversial plans to build a new reactor in belene , near the danube , are moving ahead .
the country has already signed with russian company atomstroyexport to build the new plant . romania and the czech republic also have plans to build new reactors .
while construction has begun on plants in romania , the czech government is holding off on similar moves for the next four years due to the presence of the greens in the new coalition . hungary and slovakia are also discussing adding additional units , while baltic states , lithuania , estonia and latvia , have signed an agreement committing to the construction of a new plant at ignalina in lithuania .
poland has also signed a co-operation agreement with lithuania . the ukraine , not in the eu , got almost 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear power last year .
it is considering adding up to 11 new nuclear plants by 2030 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1986 , crowds demonstrated against an atomic plant in hamburg sami tulonen , a spokesman for eu nuclear trade association foratom , acknowledged that eastern-bloc countries have " more advanced discussions " of building new power plants .
this , he said , could be attributed to several factors . " in the new eu states there is more political and public support for nuclear power , " tulonen said .
and as a result of eu entry , " there is very strong economic growth in the region , and need for more electricity capacity to meet demand . " add to that the fact that so much of the east 's current power comes from " very dirty " sources like coal , and the increasing intolerance for greenhouse gases , and its easy to understand how the tide of public opinion can turn toward nuclear energy , tulonen said . ' they want no part of russian domination ' " they have to meet the kyoto goals , and they know their economies are growing , yet they need more nuclear power to meet the low carbon demand , " he added . under the 1997 kyoto protocol , 39 industrialized nations agreed to cut emissions of six greenhouse gases to an average of 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 . finally , observers note that former soviet states are eager to be less dependent on russia 's energy monopolies in the region . " they already know what its like to be dominated by russia , and they want no part of trading political domination for economic domination by increasing their dependence on russia oil and gas , " wrote pro-nuke activist rod adams on his blog , atomicinsight . growth in western europe , too foratom 's tulonen warns that it is false to see the movement as clearly one of east versus west , however . " there is also a lot of discussion about nuclear new build among old -lrb- eu -rrb- member states , " he said , noting that finland is currently building the first nuclear reactor to go up in the eu in the last 15 years . france has serious plans to build , and discussions on amping up nuclear energy in sweden and belgium are ongoing .
even britain is considering nuclear options , he said . " reactor-wise , it is difficult to say where the widest growth will be in five years , " tulonen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paks nuklear power plant in hungary currently , 30 percent of the eu 's total electricity production comes from nuclear sources ; that number is as high as 80 percent in nuke-friendly countries like france and belgium .
germany gets 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear sources .
eu forum on nukes meanwhile , on june 15 the eu announced the formation of an eu nuclear energy forum , which will meet twice a year in an effort to " lay the groundwork for a structured , open debate , about this energy source , without taboos , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a press release .
foratom 's tulonen says he hopes the forum will be used to " lay a roadmap for nuclear investment , in order to support the nuclear renaissance . " opponents of nuclear power , however , argue that the atomic industry is simply using a cynical ploy to exploit people who are worried about global warming by stressing the supposedly low levels of co2 produced by nuclear plants . cynical ploy ? " the nuclear industry has gotten wise to the fact that people are interested in this … they 're trying to sell the idea that nuclear power is the clean alternative , " said sonja meister , a climate and energy campaigner for grassroots environmental group friends of the earth .
not only is it a ploy , meister argues , " its just not true .
they say nuclear power has no co2 emissions , but if you look at the whole production cycle - the emissions produced during uranium mining , building the plant , there is a great deal of co2 produced . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is closing this plant in lithuania , but a replacement is planned moreover , when cost comparisons are made between nuclear and other types of energy sources , safety and potential cleanup costs are almost always ignored , meister said .
" nuclear power plants can never be safe , " she said .
" there is always a danger of human error , even if they are a bit more secure or efficient .
and the general problem of what to do with nuclear waste remains , so it does n't matter if they are a little safer . "
the question remains if it would be possible to phase out nuclear energy and still meet projected emissions cuts in europe .
according to meister , the key lies in investing in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency . " there is no valid reason for nuclear energy , " meister said .
" you can save 10 times more co2 emissions by investing in energy efficiency than in nuclear power … continuing to invest in nuclear energy is just economically insane , " she said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this , he said , could be attributed to several factors . " in the new eu states there is more political and public support for nuclear power , " tulonen said .
and as a result of eu entry , " there is very strong economic growth in the region , and need for more electricity capacity to meet demand .

" there is also a lot of discussion about nuclear new build among old -lrb- eu -rrb- member states , " he said , noting that finland is currently building the first nuclear reactor to go up in the eu in the last 15 years . france has serious plans to build , and discussions on amping up nuclear energy in sweden and belgium are ongoing .
even britain is considering nuclear options , he said . " reactor-wise , it is difficult to say where the widest growth will be in five years , " tulonen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paks nuklear power plant in hungary currently , 30 percent of the eu 's total electricity production comes from nuclear sources ; that number is as high as 80 percent in nuke-friendly countries like france and belgium .
germany gets 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear sources .
eu forum on nukes meanwhile , on june 15 the eu announced the formation of an eu nuclear energy forum , which will meet twice a year in an effort to " lay the groundwork for a structured , open debate , about this energy source , without taboos , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a press release .
foratom 's tulonen says he hopes the forum will be used to " lay a roadmap for nuclear investment , in order to support the nuclear renaissance . " opponents of nuclear power , however , argue that the atomic industry is simply using a cynical ploy to exploit people who are worried about global warming by stressing the supposedly low levels of co2 produced by nuclear plants . cynical ploy ? " the nuclear industry has gotten wise to the fact that people are interested in this … they 're trying to sell the idea that nuclear power is the clean alternative , " said sonja meister , a climate and energy campaigner for grassroots environmental group friends of the earth .
not only is it a ploy , meister argues , " its just not true .
they say nuclear power has no co2 emissions , but if you look at the whole production cycle - the emissions produced during uranium mining , building the plant , there is a great deal of co2 produced . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is closing this plant in lithuania , but a replacement is planned moreover , when cost comparisons are made between nuclear and other types of energy sources , safety and potential cleanup costs are almost always ignored , meister said .
" nuclear power plants can never be safe , " she said .
" there is always a danger of human error , even if they are a bit more secure or efficient .
and the general problem of what to do with nuclear waste remains , so it does n't matter if they are a little safer . "
the question remains if it would be possible to phase out nuclear energy and still meet projected emissions cuts in europe .
according to meister , the key lies in investing in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency . " there is no valid reason for nuclear energy , " meister said .
" you can save 10 times more co2 emissions by investing in energy efficiency than in nuclear power … continuing to invest in nuclear energy is just economically insane , " she said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu forum on nukes meanwhile , on june 15 the eu announced the formation of an eu nuclear energy forum , which will meet twice a year in an effort to " lay the groundwork for a structured , open debate , about this energy source , without taboos , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a press release .
foratom 's tulonen says he hopes the forum will be used to " lay a roadmap for nuclear investment , in order to support the nuclear renaissance . " opponents of nuclear power , however , argue that the atomic industry is simply using a cynical ploy to exploit people who are worried about global warming by stressing the supposedly low levels of co2 produced by nuclear plants . cynical ploy ? " the nuclear industry has gotten wise to the fact that people are interested in this … they 're trying to sell the idea that nuclear power is the clean alternative , " said sonja meister , a climate and energy campaigner for grassroots environmental group friends of the earth .
not only is it a ploy , meister argues , " its just not true .
they say nuclear power has no co2 emissions , but if you look at the whole production cycle - the emissions produced during uranium mining , building the plant , there is a great deal of co2 produced . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is closing this plant in lithuania , but a replacement is planned moreover , when cost comparisons are made between nuclear and other types of energy sources , safety and potential cleanup costs are almost always ignored , meister said .

" there is always a danger of human error , even if they are a bit more secure or efficient .
and the general problem of what to do with nuclear waste remains , so it does n't matter if they are a little safer . "
the question remains if it would be possible to phase out nuclear energy and still meet projected emissions cuts in europe .
according to meister , the key lies in investing in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency . " there is no valid reason for nuclear energy , " meister said .
" you can save 10 times more co2 emissions by investing in energy efficiency than in nuclear power … continuing to invest in nuclear energy is just economically insane , " she said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 20.06.2007 spate of new reactor plans gives eu an atomic jolt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power is on the march across parts of europe thanks to increased demand for energy that does not emit greenhouse gases , the nuclear power industry is seeing a surge in popularity - especially in former communist countries . european pledges to combat global warming appear to be giving nuclear energy a boost .
even some countries that have moved to phase out nuclear reactors have once more taken up the debate over atomic power , which advocates promote as being much cleaner than traditional energy sources because it produces very low levels of toxic co2 . the change might come as something of a surprise to anyone who has swum in the tide of overwhelmingly anti-nuke public opinion for the past two decades , and especially after the chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 showed the reality of the flaws of lax nuclear safety . yet the mood appears to be shifting , prompted at least in part by european pledges to cut carbon emissions and slow global warming .
especially eager to jump aboard the pro-nukes bandwagon are ex-soviet countries , whose rapid growth and long-standing dependence on russian natural gas makes them extra-keen to take control of their energy markets . new member states are key five of the 10 countries that joined the then 15-nation european union in its 2004 expansion - the czech republic , hungary , lithuania , slovakia and slovenia - have operating reactors .
bulgaria was made to shut down two soviet-era reactors as a condition for eu entry despite noisy opposition .
but its controversial plans to build a new reactor in belene , near the danube , are moving ahead .
the country has already signed with russian company atomstroyexport to build the new plant . romania and the czech republic also have plans to build new reactors .
while construction has begun on plants in romania , the czech government is holding off on similar moves for the next four years due to the presence of the greens in the new coalition . hungary and slovakia are also discussing adding additional units , while baltic states , lithuania , estonia and latvia , have signed an agreement committing to the construction of a new plant at ignalina in lithuania .
poland has also signed a co-operation agreement with lithuania . the ukraine , not in the eu , got almost 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear power last year .
it is considering adding up to 11 new nuclear plants by 2030 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1986 , crowds demonstrated against an atomic plant in hamburg sami tulonen , a spokesman for eu nuclear trade association foratom , acknowledged that eastern-bloc countries have " more advanced discussions " of building new power plants .
this , he said , could be attributed to several factors . " in the new eu states there is more political and public support for nuclear power , " tulonen said .
and as a result of eu entry , " there is very strong economic growth in the region , and need for more electricity capacity to meet demand . " add to that the fact that so much of the east 's current power comes from " very dirty " sources like coal , and the increasing intolerance for greenhouse gases , and its easy to understand how the tide of public opinion can turn toward nuclear energy , tulonen said . ' they want no part of russian domination ' " they have to meet the kyoto goals , and they know their economies are growing , yet they need more nuclear power to meet the low carbon demand , " he added . under the 1997 kyoto protocol , 39 industrialized nations agreed to cut emissions of six greenhouse gases to an average of 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 . finally , observers note that former soviet states are eager to be less dependent on russia 's energy monopolies in the region . " they already know what its like to be dominated by russia , and they want no part of trading political domination for economic domination by increasing their dependence on russia oil and gas , " wrote pro-nuke activist rod adams on his blog , atomicinsight . growth in western europe , too foratom 's tulonen warns that it is false to see the movement as clearly one of east versus west , however . " there is also a lot of discussion about nuclear new build among old -lrb- eu -rrb- member states , " he said , noting that finland is currently building the first nuclear reactor to go up in the eu in the last 15 years . france has serious plans to build , and discussions on amping up nuclear energy in sweden and belgium are ongoing .
even britain is considering nuclear options , he said . " reactor-wise , it is difficult to say where the widest growth will be in five years , " tulonen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paks nuklear power plant in hungary currently , 30 percent of the eu 's total electricity production comes from nuclear sources ; that number is as high as 80 percent in nuke-friendly countries like france and belgium .

just prior to this week 's eu constitutional treaty summit , poland insisted that changes be made to the treaty 's voting system .
can and should the document be rescued ?
readers gave their two cents . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i am totally opposed to any further extension of eu powers as proposed in the new treaty .
i therefore fully support poland in the stand taken on voting rights . - joseph wright , great britain if the eu wants to live in a false democratic state , then it should apply pressure .
however , if they want to leave in a truly democratic state , than the eu must adopt poland 's solution .
a basic and true fundamental principle of democracy is that the power must be divided equally along the partners . - jan , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kaczynski wants to change the treaty 's voting system as america formed its union with the acceptance of 9 of 13 states , the eu should consider forming the union with the acceptance of the constitution by 20 states , or some such majority .
one for all , all for one , is a very difficult formulation for the complexity of the constitution . - scott miller , us in my opinion , romano prodi is right .
the countries that want more integration should improve their relationship formally .
two blocks inside the eu - that is the answer . - gustavo araujo , uruguay the voting system related to population count in each of the eu countries would be fair only in the case of total integration of eu citizens .
this is not the case at the moment and there need to be some security for smaller nations .
the current system is giving much less voice to small countries .
poland is right that the system should be a compromise between interests of big countries like germany and small countries like the czech republic .
germany has the largest population and obviously the system merkel proposes is in germany 's interest . - jack , canada poland is a relatively new member within the eu , which was carried by france and germany .
when spain , for example , joined the eu , eu contributions initiated its economic recovery .
spain does n't have any problems regarding voting allocations .
poland should accept the present voting allocations and stop trying to scare europe with its veto power .
one should not ignore history .
with many polish people leaving for england , human migration throughout the eu should be recognized in the constitution through amendments . - hans reuther-fix , antigua and barbuda compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland dampens hopes for eu treaty success poland seemed to have softened its public tone on the eve of a crucial eu treaty summit , but concerns run deep in the country about not being taken seriously for plans to change the bloc 's reformed voting system .
-lrb- 20.06.2007 -rrb- poles threaten to derail major summit on new eu treaty eu member states have agreed to drop symbolic elements of the new treaty , but a meeting of german and polish leaders over the weekend failed to resolve an impasse over the bloc 's voting structure .
-lrb- 18.06.2007 -rrb- merkel pushes eu treaty in talks with czech premier german chancellor angela merkel hosted czech leader mirek topolanek sunday as part of a diplomatic drive to remove obstacles to an accord on a new institutional treaty for the eu .

the 37-year-old keeper was on hand as that city 's house of history museum received the page of notes he used to save two penalties in germany 's dramatic quarterfinal win over argentina in last year 's world cup . it was a moment of confirmation and satisfaction for a keeper who used to play second fiddle in his national side and who is germany 's clear number one ahead of the european soccer championship next year in austria and switzerland . but lehmann still has work to do , if he wants a chance to crown his career with an international title for germany .
to maintain his status in the national side , he first has to do the same with the club he plays for on a weekly basis , arsenal , who are coming off a year with no titles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann was a world cup hero against argentina " we had a very disappointing season , " lehmann acknowledged to dw-radio .
" normally we were always involved in the finals at the end of the season . " those sentiments have been seconded by arsenal fans , many of whom believe the club needs a major shake-up .
and some think the place to start is in goal . gooners having a go at " mad jens " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but he was a goat in the 2006 champions league final although lehmann anchored arsenal 's unprecedented unbeaten 2003-4 season in the premiership and led them to the champions league final in 2006 , club supporters are becoming increasingly critical of their number one .
indeed , some seem never to have forgiven him for picking up a red card in that final match against barcelona , which arsenal lost 2-1 . the german 's periodic bursts of temper have earned him the nicknames " mad jens " and " looney lehmann " from fans whose own mental stability is reflected by the fact that they refer to themselves as " gooners . " moreover , arsenal refused to offer lehmann anything more than a one-year contract in the off-season , and the club 's first signing this summer was polish keeper lukasz fabianski - hardly signs of abiding faith in lehmann 's abilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabianski says he 's ready to challenge for lehmann 's arsenal job in the wake of that acquisition , some gooners have called for the german to be replaced .
" lehmann , " opined one blogger on the bbc 's website after the fabianski signing was announced , " has shown increasingly last season he can not be trusted to play for the team when he is distracting the defence with his stupid antics . " gunners fans also rushed to youtube to check out fabianski 's skills for themselves .
most were impressed , with one of them commenting , succinctly : " lehman out , fabianski in , come on arsenal . " last time around ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann will be 38 by the time euro 2008 begins gunners coach arsene wenger is unlikely to put much stock in the ranting of often hysterical fans , but he does want to win some silverware .
should lehmann make a couple of costly blunders early next season , wenger might decide to bench him in favor of fabianski or arsenal 's other backup , manuel almunia . if that hypothetical situation came to pass , it would be hard for german national coach joachim löw to justify starting lehmann ahead of germany 's host of other great keepers . there are also questions about lehmann 's age , with even the keeper himself unclear as to whether he will extend his career beyond 2008 .
" everybody 's spreading rumors , and i 'm doing the same , " lehmann told dw-radio , " so i really do n't know . " a year is a long time in soccer , as lehmann is obviously aware .
so while the arsenal keeper looks a good bet to be minding the posts for germany at the euro 2008 , he is not , by any means , a sure thing . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de players ' development crucial to german success , says lehmann after reaching third place in the 2006 world cup and progressing well in qualification for euro 2008 , germany 's young stars appear to have polished their shine .
but goalie jens lehmann still sees room for improvement .

strike action launched by the union on may 11 to protest the outsourcing plans would end on friday , a union spokesman said .
tens of thousands of the company 's 160,000 employees in germany took part in the strikes , the biggest labor dispute involving the company since it was privatized 12 years ago .
drop in earnings telekom plans to outsource the workers into three lower-paying service companies in a bid to boost earnings and competitiveness in the face of fierce competition in its domestic german market .

three years and a change of government later , however , warsaw 's trying to undo the hard-found compromise .
" nice or death " was the polish government 's approach in 2003 , when the eu member states started negotiating a bloc-wide treaty .
the bone of contention then , as now , was the double-majority voting system .
the treaty of nice gave poland - a country of 38 million - more votes , nearly as many as germany , with its 82 million people .
poland 's insistence on sticking to the treaty of nice ultimately led to isolation .
the then social democratic government in warsaw finally gave in and signed , in 2004 .
however , after the failed referendums on the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year , poland dropped its endorsement of the paper .
ever since germany started preparing the ground for a new eu constitution , an institutional treaty as they have started calling it , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's president and prime minister respectively , have been threatening to veto .
their demands concern one individual point : the double-majority voting system in the european council , the eu 's top decision-making body , should be dropped in favor of a square-root principle . allocating votes to countries on that basis would reduce the influence of the eu 's biggest countries - in particular that of germany .
there 's no mistaking the reproachful tone of warsaw 's arguments implying that berlin dominates the eu .
anti-german sentiment " we are n't so afraid of the germans , " poland 's chief negotiator , marek cichocki , told dw-world.de.
" if we were so afraid of them , would we propose a rule that still concedes the germans more votes than the poles ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski could well be up for some long nights together during the summit rather , the poles were concerned with establishing a generally more fair voting system , cichocki said .
polish eu expert jacek pawlicki , a commentator at polish daily gazeta wyborcza , conceded that cichocki 's argument was understandable .
however , he pointed out , the debate in poland had been marked by increasing anti-german sentiment .
" most poles do n't fully understand what the issue is , " pawlicki said .
" but they sense that it 's about increasing the poles ' influence , and thus , the majority naturally approves . "
in their collective memory , the poles are haunted by having been deceived and betrayed in the past .
the kaczynski twins know how to capitalize on those fears and are neither put off by a worsening of relations to germany nor by isolation within the eu .
isolation is not at all an issue , said cichocki .
instead , he said he felt that , in the course of the discussion about the voting system , public opinion in europe had already changed .
" many listen intently to our proposals and understand our problem . "
europe annoyed ?
" the unloved neighbors - how the poles irritate europe " was , however , the title of this week 's edition of germany 's der spiegel news magazine .
even if some commentators and political scientists see promise in the polish square-root proposal , warsaw 's threat to veto has riled some .
silvana koch-mehrin , a german member of the european parliament , even went so far as to suggest that the poles ought to consider getting out of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw says it does n't want to cause deadlock at the summit " if a country in the eu does n't feel good than you should tell it : if you do n't like it , there 's this possibility , " she said .
cichocki rebuffs the attacks , calling koch-mehrin 's a " reckless idea . "
" such suggestions are entirely unnecessary . "
the question is whether warsaw will agree to a compromise .
" that 's hard to say , " said cichocki .
" this summit has its own logic and this logic is only foreseeable up to a certain standpoint . "
wait and see polish politics also has a certain logic , according to jan barcz , a professor of european law in warsaw .
" no independent expert in poland at the moment can say how the kaczynski brothers will behave in the negotiations .
their politics are simply unpredictable . "
for now , prime minister kaczynski hinted that warsaw might be willing to budge in an interview with germany 's bild-zeitung newspaper , published on wednesday , the day before the two-day summit opens .
poland 's proposal did n't necessarily have to lead to a deadlock in the talks , he said .
" at the moment we only want a debate to be allowed -lrb- at the summit -rrb- on the voting system . "

three years and a change of government later , however , warsaw 's trying to undo the hard-found compromise .
" nice or death " was the polish government 's approach in 2003 , when the eu member states started negotiating a bloc-wide treaty .
the bone of contention then , as now , was the double-majority voting system .
the treaty of nice gave poland - a country of 38 million - more votes , nearly as many as germany , with its 82 million people .
poland 's insistence on sticking to the treaty of nice ultimately led to isolation .
the then social democratic government in warsaw finally gave in and signed , in 2004 .
however , after the failed referendums on the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year , poland dropped its endorsement of the paper .
ever since germany started preparing the ground for a new eu constitution , an institutional treaty as they have started calling it , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's president and prime minister respectively , have been threatening to veto .
their demands concern one individual point : the double-majority voting system in the european council , the eu 's top decision-making body , should be dropped in favor of a square-root principle . allocating votes to countries on that basis would reduce the influence of the eu 's biggest countries - in particular that of germany .

artist peter friedl 's stuffed giraffe from kalkilya zoo in the west bank is garnering a lot of attention . her eyes are halfway shut and her coat looks worn like those of stuffed toys that have been played with for a very long time .
brownie the giraffe also looks a little small when compared to other specimens of its kind .
but the stuffed animal has still become the center of attention at the 12th documenta that opened in the central german city of kassel last weekend .
until five years ago , brownie was a favorite among visitors to kalkilya zoo in the west bank .
she died when the small town became the center of a military offensive and israeli troops attacked a hamas camp .
brownie panicked , ran into an iron rod , then fell to the floor and died of heart failure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sculpture has become a visitor magnet austrian artist peter friedl said he 's not interested in presenting the animal as a witness for the prosecution , nor does he intend to take a side .
instead , he 's aiming to add an aesthetic experience to the flood of pictures that can be found in the media .
" if you make the mistake of competing with media images by working in a documentary style , you 're bound to lose , " he said .
" fiction and documentation only produce clichés in this situation .
i was interested in asking : what happens when i bring the real thing with me ? "
tickling the imagination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter friedl but the example of the dead giraffe from palestine also stands for the overall concept of this year 's documenta .
" migrating forms " is the overarching theme of the exhibition .
it means that a picture , a sculpture or an installation does n't only change in a new environment , but also takes on new meaning .
the documenta is trying to give back images to visitors so they can trust their own imaginations again .
friedl said he views the giraffe as a sculpture that can and should help visitors invent stories to go along with it .
" they just have to let it happen , " he said .
" everyone comes with preconceived ideas .
you either know a giraffe or you think , ' it looks a little strange . '

european union leaders prepared wednesday for a key summit aimed at agreeing a mandate for a new treaty that reform certain eu rules .
but polish and british objections are still threatening to derail the talks . german chancellor angela merkel formally invited her fellow eu leaders to the brussels summit starting thursday , with the message that " only together will we succeed in resolving the issues before us . "
" the european public now expects us to put the necessary reforms of the union in hand , " she said .
" following our consultations over the last few months the time has now come to set out the roadmap for the impending reform of the treaties . "
however the polish position remains " unchanged , we have not seen any accommodation , " a spokesman for the german eu presidency said in berlin .
poland strongly objects to the voting system proposed by germany which will be discussed at the summit , aimed at working out the broad lines of a new treaty to replace the constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
warsaw believes " double majority " voting , under which agreement by 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the eu population would be required for new rules , would favor big states like germany .
bildunterschrift : merkel and barroso remain optimistic possibility of compromise ?
eu commission chief jose manuel barroso held an hour-long telephone conversation with polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski wednesday seeking a compromise .
after the talks , a polish spokesman said both men " see the possibility of compromise . "
he hinted that modifications , or a delay , to the double majority voting plan might be enough to persuade warsaw to get in line .
czech premier mirek topolanek , the only backer of the polish demand , meanwhile said wednesday that his country would not veto an agreement at the summit even if poland fails to get the requested changes included .
pressure from both sides britain , the other major opponent to some of merkel 's suggestions was still talking tough wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary margaret beckett " if it comes down to deal or no deal at this european council the uk government is clear ... no deal is better than buying any old pig in a poke , " foreign secretary margaret beckett said .
british prime minister tony blair insists he will not cede national control over foreign policy , the judicial and police system or tax and social security rules , while refusing to give legal force to an eu charter of fundamental rights .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said he was sure the eu states could reach agreement on a new treaty but said he was " very worried " about british opposition to an eu-wide foreign policy .
at the other end of the spectrum , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker threatened to reject the new eu treaty if it did not correspond with crucial elements of the current proposal for a constitution , putting pressure on germany from another side .
germany 's draft germany , which holds the eu presidency until the end of the month , on tuesday handed its eu partners a draft mandate for the intergovernmental conference .
the draft scraps reference to the eu flag and anthem , items guaranteed to raise the hackles of euroskeptics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany does n't care what the document is called as long as it starts an eu reform process it also avoids some controversial terminology .
the new " reform treaty " would amend existing eu treaties rather than replace them .

germany insists on an eu " foreign minister , " but a new job title has to be agreed on .
this is unlikely to satisfy britain .
for britain , which also opposes more qualified majority voting in judicial matters , preferring instead unanimous decision-making , germany offered a clause for countries that choose not to participate .
the german draft also provides for national parliaments to be given up to eight weeks to examine draft laws , satisfying a demand by the netherlands .

european union leaders prepared wednesday for a key summit aimed at agreeing a mandate for a new treaty that reform certain eu rules .
but polish and british objections are still threatening to derail the talks . german chancellor angela merkel formally invited her fellow eu leaders to the brussels summit starting thursday , with the message that " only together will we succeed in resolving the issues before us . "
" the european public now expects us to put the necessary reforms of the union in hand , " she said .
" following our consultations over the last few months the time has now come to set out the roadmap for the impending reform of the treaties . "
however the polish position remains " unchanged , we have not seen any accommodation , " a spokesman for the german eu presidency said in berlin .
poland strongly objects to the voting system proposed by germany which will be discussed at the summit , aimed at working out the broad lines of a new treaty to replace the constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
warsaw believes " double majority " voting , under which agreement by 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the eu population would be required for new rules , would favor big states like germany .
bildunterschrift : merkel and barroso remain optimistic possibility of compromise ?
eu commission chief jose manuel barroso held an hour-long telephone conversation with polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski wednesday seeking a compromise .
after the talks , a polish spokesman said both men " see the possibility of compromise . "
he hinted that modifications , or a delay , to the double majority voting plan might be enough to persuade warsaw to get in line .
czech premier mirek topolanek , the only backer of the polish demand , meanwhile said wednesday that his country would not veto an agreement at the summit even if poland fails to get the requested changes included .
pressure from both sides britain , the other major opponent to some of merkel 's suggestions was still talking tough wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary margaret beckett " if it comes down to deal or no deal at this european council the uk government is clear ... no deal is better than buying any old pig in a poke , " foreign secretary margaret beckett said .
british prime minister tony blair insists he will not cede national control over foreign policy , the judicial and police system or tax and social security rules , while refusing to give legal force to an eu charter of fundamental rights .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said he was sure the eu states could reach agreement on a new treaty but said he was " very worried " about british opposition to an eu-wide foreign policy .
at the other end of the spectrum , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker threatened to reject the new eu treaty if it did not correspond with crucial elements of the current proposal for a constitution , putting pressure on germany from another side .
germany 's draft germany , which holds the eu presidency until the end of the month , on tuesday handed its eu partners a draft mandate for the intergovernmental conference .
the draft scraps reference to the eu flag and anthem , items guaranteed to raise the hackles of euroskeptics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany does n't care what the document is called as long as it starts an eu reform process it also avoids some controversial terminology .
the new " reform treaty " would amend existing eu treaties rather than replace them .
the word " constitution " has been dropped .
germany insists on an eu " foreign minister , " but a new job title has to be agreed on .
this is unlikely to satisfy britain .
for britain , which also opposes more qualified majority voting in judicial matters , preferring instead unanimous decision-making , germany offered a clause for countries that choose not to participate .
the german draft also provides for national parliaments to be given up to eight weeks to examine draft laws , satisfying a demand by the netherlands .
any draft mandate for a treaty will then go to an intergovernmental conference , which official say is likely to start in july , for several months of discussion . dw staff based on wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bhutanese professor ratan gazmere , forced into exile in 1992 , said that the health and education services in particular had been " drastically reduced " .

their so-called home is adjacent to india 's darjeeling district in west bengal and their only means of returning is by crossing the india-nepal border .
however , clashes with the indian security forces which have left one refugee dead and over a dozen injured are not helping their cause .
deteriorating conditions meanwhile , the conditions in the camps have deteriorated over the past decade .
the bhutanese professor ratan gazmere , forced into exile in 1992 , said that the health and education services in particular had been " drastically reduced " .
" many people are dying now because they don ’ t get medical assistance in time , especially old people because the help there is seems to focus on young people , " gazmere complained .
and while the unhcr provided higher education at the start , this was abolished after a few years .
young refugees now only have access to primary and secondary-level education .
headache for bengal the refugee matter is turning out to be a real headache for the left front government in west bengal which borders nepal .
the bengal government has admitted that it 's worried .
last week , the chief secretary of the state , amit kiran deb , held a meeting with darjeeling district officials to discuss the situation .
the bhutanese refugees are trapped in a vicious diplomatic quandary .
" we want unconditional passage via india to return to our country , " explained balram paudel , the vice-chairman of the national front for democracy in bhutan .
" the indian government should try and resolve the issue through talks , otherwise our protests will continue , " he warned .
us plan in april , the united states announced it had come to an agreement with nepal ’ s government to resettle 60,000 bhutanese refugees .
the plan has divided the refugee community living in the un-run camps in nepal and last month ’ s violence was sparked by disagreement over the issue .
some want to go to a third country , others insist they should be given the right to return to bhutan .
path to democracy bhutan is one of the world ’ s most isolated countries and the government strictly regulates all influence from abroad , including tourism , to preserve the country ’ s buddhist culture .
last month , a second " mock election " was staged as a dress rehearsal for the isolated himalayan kingdom ’ s transition to democracy next year after a century of royal rule .
but it remains to be seen whether many bhutanese refugees are able to participate .
until a solution is reached , the bhutanese refugees seem doomed to live in the un camps . prabhakar mani tewari send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 global media forum human rights in a globalized world - challenges for the media singapore polls as singapore votes , not much change is likely with the people 's action party expected to win cherian george , adjunct senior research fellow at the institute of policy studies in singapore , talks about the likely outcome north korea amnesty international paints a horrifying picture of conditions in north korea 's prison camps .

european union leaders prepared wednesday for a key summit aimed at agreeing a mandate for a new treaty that reform certain eu rules .
but polish and british objections are still threatening to derail the talks . german chancellor angela merkel formally invited her fellow eu leaders to the brussels summit starting thursday , with the message that " only together will we succeed in resolving the issues before us . "
" the european public now expects us to put the necessary reforms of the union in hand , " she said .
" following our consultations over the last few months the time has now come to set out the roadmap for the impending reform of the treaties . "
however the polish position remains " unchanged , we have not seen any accommodation , " a spokesman for the german eu presidency said in berlin .
poland strongly objects to the voting system proposed by germany which will be discussed at the summit , aimed at working out the broad lines of a new treaty to replace the constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
warsaw believes " double majority " voting , under which agreement by 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the eu population would be required for new rules , would favor big states like germany .

eu commission chief jose manuel barroso held an hour-long telephone conversation with polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski wednesday seeking a compromise .
after the talks , a polish spokesman said both men " see the possibility of compromise . "
he hinted that modifications , or a delay , to the double majority voting plan might be enough to persuade warsaw to get in line .
czech premier mirek topolanek , the only backer of the polish demand , meanwhile said wednesday that his country would not veto an agreement at the summit even if poland fails to get the requested changes included .
pressure from both sides britain , the other major opponent to some of merkel 's suggestions was still talking tough wednesday .

artist peter friedl 's stuffed giraffe from kalkilya zoo in the west bank is garnering a lot of attention . her eyes are halfway shut and her coat looks worn like those of stuffed toys that have been played with for a very long time .
brownie the giraffe also looks a little small when compared to other specimens of its kind .
but the stuffed animal has still become the center of attention at the 12th documenta that opened in the central german city of kassel last weekend .
until five years ago , brownie was a favorite among visitors to kalkilya zoo in the west bank .
she died when the small town became the center of a military offensive and israeli troops attacked a hamas camp .
brownie panicked , ran into an iron rod , then fell to the floor and died of heart failure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sculpture has become a visitor magnet austrian artist peter friedl said he 's not interested in presenting the animal as a witness for the prosecution , nor does he intend to take a side .
instead , he 's aiming to add an aesthetic experience to the flood of pictures that can be found in the media .
" if you make the mistake of competing with media images by working in a documentary style , you 're bound to lose , " he said .

" migrating forms " is the overarching theme of the exhibition .
it means that a picture , a sculpture or an installation does n't only change in a new environment , but also takes on new meaning .
the documenta is trying to give back images to visitors so they can trust their own imaginations again .
friedl said he views the giraffe as a sculpture that can and should help visitors invent stories to go along with it .
" they just have to let it happen , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 20.06.2007 bhutanese refugees await their fate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesting bhutanese refugees at camps in nepal wednesday is the un 's world refugee day which is good reason for remembering the 100,000 refugees languishing in nepal .
as others decide their fates , they wait without enough food or adequate healthcare . they are of ethnic nepalese origin but were born in bhutan but .
when trouble flared up in the early 1990s , they were stripped of their citizenship and deported from the tiny himalayan kingdom for being non-nationals .
since then , they have been living in camps set up by the un in the jhapa district of eastern nepal .
as bhutan prepares for its first democratic elections in 2008 , many refugees are trying desperately to return .
their so-called home is adjacent to india 's darjeeling district in west bengal and their only means of returning is by crossing the india-nepal border .
however , clashes with the indian security forces which have left one refugee dead and over a dozen injured are not helping their cause .
deteriorating conditions meanwhile , the conditions in the camps have deteriorated over the past decade .
the bhutanese professor ratan gazmere , forced into exile in 1992 , said that the health and education services in particular had been " drastically reduced " .
" many people are dying now because they don ’ t get medical assistance in time , especially old people because the help there is seems to focus on young people , " gazmere complained .
and while the unhcr provided higher education at the start , this was abolished after a few years .
young refugees now only have access to primary and secondary-level education .
headache for bengal the refugee matter is turning out to be a real headache for the left front government in west bengal which borders nepal .
the bengal government has admitted that it 's worried .
last week , the chief secretary of the state , amit kiran deb , held a meeting with darjeeling district officials to discuss the situation .
the bhutanese refugees are trapped in a vicious diplomatic quandary .
" we want unconditional passage via india to return to our country , " explained balram paudel , the vice-chairman of the national front for democracy in bhutan .
" the indian government should try and resolve the issue through talks , otherwise our protests will continue , " he warned .
us plan in april , the united states announced it had come to an agreement with nepal ’ s government to resettle 60,000 bhutanese refugees .
the plan has divided the refugee community living in the un-run camps in nepal and last month ’ s violence was sparked by disagreement over the issue .
some want to go to a third country , others insist they should be given the right to return to bhutan .
path to democracy bhutan is one of the world ’ s most isolated countries and the government strictly regulates all influence from abroad , including tourism , to preserve the country ’ s buddhist culture .
last month , a second " mock election " was staged as a dress rehearsal for the isolated himalayan kingdom ’ s transition to democracy next year after a century of royal rule .
but it remains to be seen whether many bhutanese refugees are able to participate .
until a solution is reached , the bhutanese refugees seem doomed to live in the un camps . prabhakar mani tewari send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

european union leaders prepared wednesday for a key summit aimed at agreeing a mandate for a new treaty that reform certain eu rules .
but polish and british objections are still threatening to derail the talks . german chancellor angela merkel formally invited her fellow eu leaders to the brussels summit starting thursday , with the message that " only together will we succeed in resolving the issues before us . "
" the european public now expects us to put the necessary reforms of the union in hand , " she said .
" following our consultations over the last few months the time has now come to set out the roadmap for the impending reform of the treaties . "
however the polish position remains " unchanged , we have not seen any accommodation , " a spokesman for the german eu presidency said in berlin .
poland strongly objects to the voting system proposed by germany which will be discussed at the summit , aimed at working out the broad lines of a new treaty to replace the constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
warsaw believes " double majority " voting , under which agreement by 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the eu population would be required for new rules , would favor big states like germany .
bildunterschrift : merkel and barroso remain optimistic possibility of compromise ?
eu commission chief jose manuel barroso held an hour-long telephone conversation with polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski wednesday seeking a compromise .
after the talks , a polish spokesman said both men " see the possibility of compromise . "
he hinted that modifications , or a delay , to the double majority voting plan might be enough to persuade warsaw to get in line .
czech premier mirek topolanek , the only backer of the polish demand , meanwhile said wednesday that his country would not veto an agreement at the summit even if poland fails to get the requested changes included .
pressure from both sides britain , the other major opponent to some of merkel 's suggestions was still talking tough wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary margaret beckett " if it comes down to deal or no deal at this european council the uk government is clear ... no deal is better than buying any old pig in a poke , " foreign secretary margaret beckett said .
british prime minister tony blair insists he will not cede national control over foreign policy , the judicial and police system or tax and social security rules , while refusing to give legal force to an eu charter of fundamental rights .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said he was sure the eu states could reach agreement on a new treaty but said he was " very worried " about british opposition to an eu-wide foreign policy .
at the other end of the spectrum , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker threatened to reject the new eu treaty if it did not correspond with crucial elements of the current proposal for a constitution , putting pressure on germany from another side .
germany 's draft germany , which holds the eu presidency until the end of the month , on tuesday handed its eu partners a draft mandate for the intergovernmental conference .
the draft scraps reference to the eu flag and anthem , items guaranteed to raise the hackles of euroskeptics .

germany insists on an eu " foreign minister , " but a new job title has to be agreed on .

three years and a change of government later , however , warsaw 's trying to undo the hard-found compromise .
" nice or death " was the polish government 's approach in 2003 , when the eu member states started negotiating a bloc-wide treaty .
the bone of contention then , as now , was the double-majority voting system .
the treaty of nice gave poland - a country of 38 million - more votes , nearly as many as germany , with its 82 million people .
poland 's insistence on sticking to the treaty of nice ultimately led to isolation .
the then social democratic government in warsaw finally gave in and signed , in 2004 .
however , after the failed referendums on the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year , poland dropped its endorsement of the paper .
ever since germany started preparing the ground for a new eu constitution , an institutional treaty as they have started calling it , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's president and prime minister respectively , have been threatening to veto .
their demands concern one individual point : the double-majority voting system in the european council , the eu 's top decision-making body , should be dropped in favor of a square-root principle . allocating votes to countries on that basis would reduce the influence of the eu 's biggest countries - in particular that of germany .
there 's no mistaking the reproachful tone of warsaw 's arguments implying that berlin dominates the eu .
anti-german sentiment " we are n't so afraid of the germans , " poland 's chief negotiator , marek cichocki , told dw-world.de.
" if we were so afraid of them , would we propose a rule that still concedes the germans more votes than the poles ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski could well be up for some long nights together during the summit rather , the poles were concerned with establishing a generally more fair voting system , cichocki said .
polish eu expert jacek pawlicki , a commentator at polish daily gazeta wyborcza , conceded that cichocki 's argument was understandable .
however , he pointed out , the debate in poland had been marked by increasing anti-german sentiment .
" most poles do n't fully understand what the issue is , " pawlicki said .
" but they sense that it 's about increasing the poles ' influence , and thus , the majority naturally approves . "
in their collective memory , the poles are haunted by having been deceived and betrayed in the past .
the kaczynski twins know how to capitalize on those fears and are neither put off by a worsening of relations to germany nor by isolation within the eu .
isolation is not at all an issue , said cichocki .
instead , he said he felt that , in the course of the discussion about the voting system , public opinion in europe had already changed .
" many listen intently to our proposals and understand our problem . "
europe annoyed ?
" the unloved neighbors - how the poles irritate europe " was , however , the title of this week 's edition of germany 's der spiegel news magazine .
even if some commentators and political scientists see promise in the polish square-root proposal , warsaw 's threat to veto has riled some .
silvana koch-mehrin , a german member of the european parliament , even went so far as to suggest that the poles ought to consider getting out of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw says it does n't want to cause deadlock at the summit " if a country in the eu does n't feel good than you should tell it : if you do n't like it , there 's this possibility , " she said .
cichocki rebuffs the attacks , calling koch-mehrin 's a " reckless idea . "
" such suggestions are entirely unnecessary . "
the question is whether warsaw will agree to a compromise .
" that 's hard to say , " said cichocki .
" this summit has its own logic and this logic is only foreseeable up to a certain standpoint . "
wait and see polish politics also has a certain logic , according to jan barcz , a professor of european law in warsaw .
" no independent expert in poland at the moment can say how the kaczynski brothers will behave in the negotiations .
their politics are simply unpredictable . "
for now , prime minister kaczynski hinted that warsaw might be willing to budge in an interview with germany 's bild-zeitung newspaper , published on wednesday , the day before the two-day summit opens .
poland 's proposal did n't necessarily have to lead to a deadlock in the talks , he said .
" at the moment we only want a debate to be allowed -lrb- at the summit -rrb- on the voting system . "
but he also told the paper , " they are trying to isolate and ignore poland .
we can not agree to that .

artist peter friedl 's stuffed giraffe from kalkilya zoo in the west bank is garnering a lot of attention . her eyes are halfway shut and her coat looks worn like those of stuffed toys that have been played with for a very long time .
brownie the giraffe also looks a little small when compared to other specimens of its kind .
but the stuffed animal has still become the center of attention at the 12th documenta that opened in the central german city of kassel last weekend .
until five years ago , brownie was a favorite among visitors to kalkilya zoo in the west bank .
she died when the small town became the center of a military offensive and israeli troops attacked a hamas camp .
brownie panicked , ran into an iron rod , then fell to the floor and died of heart failure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sculpture has become a visitor magnet austrian artist peter friedl said he 's not interested in presenting the animal as a witness for the prosecution , nor does he intend to take a side .
instead , he 's aiming to add an aesthetic experience to the flood of pictures that can be found in the media .
" if you make the mistake of competing with media images by working in a documentary style , you 're bound to lose , " he said .
" fiction and documentation only produce clichés in this situation .
i was interested in asking : what happens when i bring the real thing with me ? "
tickling the imagination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter friedl but the example of the dead giraffe from palestine also stands for the overall concept of this year 's documenta .
" migrating forms " is the overarching theme of the exhibition .
it means that a picture , a sculpture or an installation does n't only change in a new environment , but also takes on new meaning .
the documenta is trying to give back images to visitors so they can trust their own imaginations again .
friedl said he views the giraffe as a sculpture that can and should help visitors invent stories to go along with it .
" they just have to let it happen , " he said .
" everyone comes with preconceived ideas .
you either know a giraffe or you think , ' it looks a little strange . '
a lack of information , which would sometimes be desirable , does n't exist in art . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the overall assessment we have of the german presidency is reasonably positive … but there are serious issues , " oosting said . " if europe does n't get its own house in order and act properly it will undermine its credibility and effectiveness on the global stage .
and that is something we can not afford , certainly not after the us has lost its credibility as an actor for human rights . " human rights : just a footnote ? the head of the german section of amnesty international , barbara lochbihler , warned that human rights issues must not become a mere footnote in any future european basic treaty and deplored the fact that the german presidency had failed to promote a world-wide ban on torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara lochbihler " as far as we know , no steps have been taken during the german eu presidency to put a global ban on torture on the agenda again , " lochbihler said .
" germany itself still hasn ’ t ratified the special un anti-torture protocol , although it became a signatory to it in september of 2006 . " oosting said he was most concerned about the failure of the eu to confess to past mistakes and speak out openly about its alleged part in the cia ’ s deportations of terror suspects . " for a limited number of people , most of whom we know to be innocent , the rule of law in the heart of europe has broken down totally , " said oosting . " it has been established that there has been european complicity in european countries , by the council of europe , the european parliament , by ngos like amnesty international and human rights watch . and yet we have seen only silence and denial .
and that more than anything undermines the eu 's credibility . " both oosting and lochbihler praised the foreign office in berlin for initiating a productive human rights dialogue with central asian nations . they also noted that the german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier hadn ’ t shied away from criticizing russia for human rights violations , but added that the same amount of openness had not been displayed towards their trans-atlantic allies .

but his reign between the posts might be short-lived if he fails to have success this year with the premiership side arsenal . jens lehmann was in bonn on tuesday to cement his place in german sports history .
the 37-year-old keeper was on hand as that city 's house of history museum received the page of notes he used to save two penalties in germany 's dramatic quarterfinal win over argentina in last year 's world cup . it was a moment of confirmation and satisfaction for a keeper who used to play second fiddle in his national side and who is germany 's clear number one ahead of the european soccer championship next year in austria and switzerland . but lehmann still has work to do , if he wants a chance to crown his career with an international title for germany .
to maintain his status in the national side , he first has to do the same with the club he plays for on a weekly basis , arsenal , who are coming off a year with no titles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann was a world cup hero against argentina " we had a very disappointing season , " lehmann acknowledged to dw-radio .
" normally we were always involved in the finals at the end of the season . " those sentiments have been seconded by arsenal fans , many of whom believe the club needs a major shake-up .
and some think the place to start is in goal . gooners having a go at " mad jens " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but he was a goat in the 2006 champions league final although lehmann anchored arsenal 's unprecedented unbeaten 2003-4 season in the premiership and led them to the champions league final in 2006 , club supporters are becoming increasingly critical of their number one .
indeed , some seem never to have forgiven him for picking up a red card in that final match against barcelona , which arsenal lost 2-1 . the german 's periodic bursts of temper have earned him the nicknames " mad jens " and " looney lehmann " from fans whose own mental stability is reflected by the fact that they refer to themselves as " gooners . " moreover , arsenal refused to offer lehmann anything more than a one-year contract in the off-season , and the club 's first signing this summer was polish keeper lukasz fabianski - hardly signs of abiding faith in lehmann 's abilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabianski says he 's ready to challenge for lehmann 's arsenal job in the wake of that acquisition , some gooners have called for the german to be replaced .
" lehmann , " opined one blogger on the bbc 's website after the fabianski signing was announced , " has shown increasingly last season he can not be trusted to play for the team when he is distracting the defence with his stupid antics . " gunners fans also rushed to youtube to check out fabianski 's skills for themselves .
most were impressed , with one of them commenting , succinctly : " lehman out , fabianski in , come on arsenal . " last time around ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann will be 38 by the time euro 2008 begins gunners coach arsene wenger is unlikely to put much stock in the ranting of often hysterical fans , but he does want to win some silverware .
should lehmann make a couple of costly blunders early next season , wenger might decide to bench him in favor of fabianski or arsenal 's other backup , manuel almunia . if that hypothetical situation came to pass , it would be hard for german national coach joachim löw to justify starting lehmann ahead of germany 's host of other great keepers . there are also questions about lehmann 's age , with even the keeper himself unclear as to whether he will extend his career beyond 2008 .
" everybody 's spreading rumors , and i 'm doing the same , " lehmann told dw-radio , " so i really do n't know . " a year is a long time in soccer , as lehmann is obviously aware .
so while the arsenal keeper looks a good bet to be minding the posts for germany at the euro 2008 , he is not , by any means , a sure thing . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her appointment will see her play a key role in shaping sarkozy 's ambitious and controversial reforms - and puts the number of women in the cabinet at a total of seven .
other women appointed include interior minister michele alliot-marie , culture minister christine albanel and higher education minister valerie pecresse . as justice minister , sarkozy 's campaign spokeswomen rachida dati becomes the first ethnic minority figure in a senior cabinet post . in further surprise moves , sarkozy added half a dozen junior ministers to the government , some of them also hailing from ethnic minorities and the left in line with his declared policy of " openness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rachida dati muslim feminist , fadela amara , became junior minister for urban affairs , and a senegalese-born woman rama yade , 30 , a junior minister for foreign affairs and human rights . former foreign minister michel barnier took over from lagarde as agriculture minister , while socialist senator jean-marie bockel was named junior minister for foreign assistance and francophony , bringing to three the number of leftists in foreign affairs . defying expectations sarkozy scored a political coup when he appointed prominent socialist bernard kouchner , the founder of doctors without borders , as foreign minister last month , confounding critics who had warned that he would concentrate power in a rightwing clique . most of the 15 senior ministers appointed last month after sarkozy defeated socialist segolene royal in the presidential election remained in their posts . sarkozy also named france rugby coach bernard laporte as sports minister , a post he will take up later this year following the world cup , saying his priority was to win the event . overall , cabinet positions were halved , while portfolios expanded .
slimming down the cabinet is part of sarkozy 's agenda to cut costs and increase government efficiency . sweeping reforms a special session of the newly-elected national assembly is to be convened next week to push through a first round of reforms , including tax breaks aimed at jump-starting the economy and lowering unemployment hovering at 8.2 percent , one of the highest in europe . one month after sarkozy took office promising sweeping reforms , his ump party won a national assembly majority in sunday 's vote , but it lost more than 40 seats while the opposition socialists made surprise gains . and in a symbolic blow to the government , juppe , a former prime minister and mayor of bordeaux , lost to a socialist and had to resign from the cabinet . sarkozy had brought him back from political exile after his conviction in a party finance scandal that had prevented him from holding public office for a year . despite the disappointment , prime minister francois fillon has insisted that the election delivered a " majority for action " and vowed to forge ahead with the reform programm . fillon said tuesday that he had not " shut the door " on a proposal to increase the value-added tax by up to 5 percent to help finance soaring health care costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal has her eye on her party 's top job the proposal was widely seen as having provided the opposition socialists with a boon during the final days of campaigning for the parliamentary elections . royal split many in the party were angered by segolene royal 's announcement sunday that she had split from her long-standing partner , socialist party leader francois hollande .
the french media has suggested that their troubled relationship undermined the party 's campaign , and speculation is now rife that royal is keen to take over from hollande as socialist leader . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 20.06.2007 poland dampens hopes for eu treaty success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski 's are unpredictable , polish observers say poland seemed to have softened its public tone on the eve of a crucial eu treaty summit , but concerns run deep in the country about not being taken seriously for plans to change the bloc 's reformed voting system . the polish government had indeed already signed the eu constitutional treaty , in 2004 .
three years and a change of government later , however , warsaw 's trying to undo the hard-found compromise .
" nice or death " was the polish government 's approach in 2003 , when the eu member states started negotiating a bloc-wide treaty .
the bone of contention then , as now , was the double-majority voting system .
the treaty of nice gave poland - a country of 38 million - more votes , nearly as many as germany , with its 82 million people .
poland 's insistence on sticking to the treaty of nice ultimately led to isolation .
the then social democratic government in warsaw finally gave in and signed , in 2004 .
however , after the failed referendums on the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year , poland dropped its endorsement of the paper .
ever since germany started preparing the ground for a new eu constitution , an institutional treaty as they have started calling it , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's president and prime minister respectively , have been threatening to veto .
their demands concern one individual point : the double-majority voting system in the european council , the eu 's top decision-making body , should be dropped in favor of a square-root principle . allocating votes to countries on that basis would reduce the influence of the eu 's biggest countries - in particular that of germany .
there 's no mistaking the reproachful tone of warsaw 's arguments implying that berlin dominates the eu .
anti-german sentiment " we are n't so afraid of the germans , " poland 's chief negotiator , marek cichocki , told dw-world.de.
" if we were so afraid of them , would we propose a rule that still concedes the germans more votes than the poles ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski could well be up for some long nights together during the summit rather , the poles were concerned with establishing a generally more fair voting system , cichocki said .
polish eu expert jacek pawlicki , a commentator at polish daily gazeta wyborcza , conceded that cichocki 's argument was understandable .
however , he pointed out , the debate in poland had been marked by increasing anti-german sentiment .
" most poles do n't fully understand what the issue is , " pawlicki said .
" but they sense that it 's about increasing the poles ' influence , and thus , the majority naturally approves . "
in their collective memory , the poles are haunted by having been deceived and betrayed in the past .
the kaczynski twins know how to capitalize on those fears and are neither put off by a worsening of relations to germany nor by isolation within the eu .
isolation is not at all an issue , said cichocki .
instead , he said he felt that , in the course of the discussion about the voting system , public opinion in europe had already changed .
" many listen intently to our proposals and understand our problem . "
europe annoyed ?
" the unloved neighbors - how the poles irritate europe " was , however , the title of this week 's edition of germany 's der spiegel news magazine .
even if some commentators and political scientists see promise in the polish square-root proposal , warsaw 's threat to veto has riled some .
silvana koch-mehrin , a german member of the european parliament , even went so far as to suggest that the poles ought to consider getting out of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw says it does n't want to cause deadlock at the summit " if a country in the eu does n't feel good than you should tell it : if you do n't like it , there 's this possibility , " she said .
cichocki rebuffs the attacks , calling koch-mehrin 's a " reckless idea . "
" such suggestions are entirely unnecessary . "
the question is whether warsaw will agree to a compromise .
" that 's hard to say , " said cichocki .
" this summit has its own logic and this logic is only foreseeable up to a certain standpoint . "
wait and see polish politics also has a certain logic , according to jan barcz , a professor of european law in warsaw .
" no independent expert in poland at the moment can say how the kaczynski brothers will behave in the negotiations .
their politics are simply unpredictable . "
for now , prime minister kaczynski hinted that warsaw might be willing to budge in an interview with germany 's bild-zeitung newspaper , published on wednesday , the day before the two-day summit opens .
poland 's proposal did n't necessarily have to lead to a deadlock in the talks , he said .
" at the moment we only want a debate to be allowed -lrb- at the summit -rrb- on the voting system . "
but he also told the paper , " they are trying to isolate and ignore poland .
we can not agree to that .
that would be suicide , " he said . britain too is seeking to water down proposals for a common european foreign and security policy .
london and warsaw 's positions are seen as the chief obstacles to acheiving a deal on the treaty . nadine wojcik -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the overall assessment we have of the german presidency is reasonably positive … but there are serious issues , " oosting said . " if europe does n't get its own house in order and act properly it will undermine its credibility and effectiveness on the global stage .
and that is something we can not afford , certainly not after the us has lost its credibility as an actor for human rights . " human rights : just a footnote ? the head of the german section of amnesty international , barbara lochbihler , warned that human rights issues must not become a mere footnote in any future european basic treaty and deplored the fact that the german presidency had failed to promote a world-wide ban on torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara lochbihler " as far as we know , no steps have been taken during the german eu presidency to put a global ban on torture on the agenda again , " lochbihler said .
" germany itself still hasn ’ t ratified the special un anti-torture protocol , although it became a signatory to it in september of 2006 . " oosting said he was most concerned about the failure of the eu to confess to past mistakes and speak out openly about its alleged part in the cia ’ s deportations of terror suspects . " for a limited number of people , most of whom we know to be innocent , the rule of law in the heart of europe has broken down totally , " said oosting . " it has been established that there has been european complicity in european countries , by the council of europe , the european parliament , by ngos like amnesty international and human rights watch . and yet we have seen only silence and denial .
and that more than anything undermines the eu 's credibility . " both oosting and lochbihler praised the foreign office in berlin for initiating a productive human rights dialogue with central asian nations . they also noted that the german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier hadn ’ t shied away from criticizing russia for human rights violations , but added that the same amount of openness had not been displayed towards their trans-atlantic allies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 20.06.2007 spate of new reactor plans gives eu an atomic jolt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power is on the march across parts of europe thanks to increased demand for energy that does not emit greenhouse gases , the nuclear power industry is seeing a surge in popularity - especially in former communist countries . european pledges to combat global warming appear to be giving nuclear energy a boost .
even some countries that have moved to phase out nuclear reactors have once more taken up the debate over atomic power , which advocates promote as being much cleaner than traditional energy sources because it produces very low levels of toxic co2 . the change might come as something of a surprise to anyone who has swum in the tide of overwhelmingly anti-nuke public opinion for the past two decades , and especially after the chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 showed the reality of the flaws of lax nuclear safety . yet the mood appears to be shifting , prompted at least in part by european pledges to cut carbon emissions and slow global warming .
especially eager to jump aboard the pro-nukes bandwagon are ex-soviet countries , whose rapid growth and long-standing dependence on russian natural gas makes them extra-keen to take control of their energy markets . new member states are key five of the 10 countries that joined the then 15-nation european union in its 2004 expansion - the czech republic , hungary , lithuania , slovakia and slovenia - have operating reactors .
bulgaria was made to shut down two soviet-era reactors as a condition for eu entry despite noisy opposition .
but its controversial plans to build a new reactor in belene , near the danube , are moving ahead .
the country has already signed with russian company atomstroyexport to build the new plant . romania and the czech republic also have plans to build new reactors .
while construction has begun on plants in romania , the czech government is holding off on similar moves for the next four years due to the presence of the greens in the new coalition . hungary and slovakia are also discussing adding additional units , while baltic states , lithuania , estonia and latvia , have signed an agreement committing to the construction of a new plant at ignalina in lithuania .
poland has also signed a co-operation agreement with lithuania . the ukraine , not in the eu , got almost 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear power last year .
it is considering adding up to 11 new nuclear plants by 2030 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1986 , crowds demonstrated against an atomic plant in hamburg sami tulonen , a spokesman for eu nuclear trade association foratom , acknowledged that eastern-bloc countries have " more advanced discussions " of building new power plants .
this , he said , could be attributed to several factors . " in the new eu states there is more political and public support for nuclear power , " tulonen said .
and as a result of eu entry , " there is very strong economic growth in the region , and need for more electricity capacity to meet demand . " add to that the fact that so much of the east 's current power comes from " very dirty " sources like coal , and the increasing intolerance for greenhouse gases , and its easy to understand how the tide of public opinion can turn toward nuclear energy , tulonen said . ' they want no part of russian domination ' " they have to meet the kyoto goals , and they know their economies are growing , yet they need more nuclear power to meet the low carbon demand , " he added . under the 1997 kyoto protocol , 39 industrialized nations agreed to cut emissions of six greenhouse gases to an average of 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 . finally , observers note that former soviet states are eager to be less dependent on russia 's energy monopolies in the region . " they already know what its like to be dominated by russia , and they want no part of trading political domination for economic domination by increasing their dependence on russia oil and gas , " wrote pro-nuke activist rod adams on his blog , atomicinsight . growth in western europe , too foratom 's tulonen warns that it is false to see the movement as clearly one of east versus west , however . " there is also a lot of discussion about nuclear new build among old -lrb- eu -rrb- member states , " he said , noting that finland is currently building the first nuclear reactor to go up in the eu in the last 15 years . france has serious plans to build , and discussions on amping up nuclear energy in sweden and belgium are ongoing .
even britain is considering nuclear options , he said . " reactor-wise , it is difficult to say where the widest growth will be in five years , " tulonen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paks nuklear power plant in hungary currently , 30 percent of the eu 's total electricity production comes from nuclear sources ; that number is as high as 80 percent in nuke-friendly countries like france and belgium .
germany gets 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear sources .
eu forum on nukes meanwhile , on june 15 the eu announced the formation of an eu nuclear energy forum , which will meet twice a year in an effort to " lay the groundwork for a structured , open debate , about this energy source , without taboos , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a press release .
foratom 's tulonen says he hopes the forum will be used to " lay a roadmap for nuclear investment , in order to support the nuclear renaissance . " opponents of nuclear power , however , argue that the atomic industry is simply using a cynical ploy to exploit people who are worried about global warming by stressing the supposedly low levels of co2 produced by nuclear plants . cynical ploy ? " the nuclear industry has gotten wise to the fact that people are interested in this … they 're trying to sell the idea that nuclear power is the clean alternative , " said sonja meister , a climate and energy campaigner for grassroots environmental group friends of the earth .
not only is it a ploy , meister argues , " its just not true .
they say nuclear power has no co2 emissions , but if you look at the whole production cycle - the emissions produced during uranium mining , building the plant , there is a great deal of co2 produced . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is closing this plant in lithuania , but a replacement is planned moreover , when cost comparisons are made between nuclear and other types of energy sources , safety and potential cleanup costs are almost always ignored , meister said .
" nuclear power plants can never be safe , " she said .
" there is always a danger of human error , even if they are a bit more secure or efficient .
and the general problem of what to do with nuclear waste remains , so it does n't matter if they are a little safer . "
the question remains if it would be possible to phase out nuclear energy and still meet projected emissions cuts in europe .
according to meister , the key lies in investing in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency . " there is no valid reason for nuclear energy , " meister said .
" you can save 10 times more co2 emissions by investing in energy efficiency than in nuclear power … continuing to invest in nuclear energy is just economically insane , " she said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just prior to this week 's eu constitutional treaty summit , poland insisted that changes be made to the treaty 's voting system .
can and should the document be rescued ?
readers gave their two cents . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i am totally opposed to any further extension of eu powers as proposed in the new treaty .
i therefore fully support poland in the stand taken on voting rights . - joseph wright , great britain if the eu wants to live in a false democratic state , then it should apply pressure .
however , if they want to leave in a truly democratic state , than the eu must adopt poland 's solution .
a basic and true fundamental principle of democracy is that the power must be divided equally along the partners . - jan , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kaczynski wants to change the treaty 's voting system as america formed its union with the acceptance of 9 of 13 states , the eu should consider forming the union with the acceptance of the constitution by 20 states , or some such majority .
one for all , all for one , is a very difficult formulation for the complexity of the constitution . - scott miller , us in my opinion , romano prodi is right .
the countries that want more integration should improve their relationship formally .
two blocks inside the eu - that is the answer . - gustavo araujo , uruguay the voting system related to population count in each of the eu countries would be fair only in the case of total integration of eu citizens .
this is not the case at the moment and there need to be some security for smaller nations .
the current system is giving much less voice to small countries .
poland is right that the system should be a compromise between interests of big countries like germany and small countries like the czech republic .
germany has the largest population and obviously the system merkel proposes is in germany 's interest . - jack , canada poland is a relatively new member within the eu , which was carried by france and germany .
when spain , for example , joined the eu , eu contributions initiated its economic recovery .
spain does n't have any problems regarding voting allocations .
poland should accept the present voting allocations and stop trying to scare europe with its veto power .
one should not ignore history .
with many polish people leaving for england , human migration throughout the eu should be recognized in the constitution through amendments . - hans reuther-fix , antigua and barbuda compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland dampens hopes for eu treaty success poland seemed to have softened its public tone on the eve of a crucial eu treaty summit , but concerns run deep in the country about not being taken seriously for plans to change the bloc 's reformed voting system .
-lrb- 20.06.2007 -rrb- poles threaten to derail major summit on new eu treaty eu member states have agreed to drop symbolic elements of the new treaty , but a meeting of german and polish leaders over the weekend failed to resolve an impasse over the bloc 's voting structure .

" if europe does n't get its own house in order and act properly it will undermine its credibility and effectiveness on the global stage .
and that is something we can not afford , certainly not after the us has lost its credibility as an actor for human rights . " human rights : just a footnote ? the head of the german section of amnesty international , barbara lochbihler , warned that human rights issues must not become a mere footnote in any future european basic treaty and deplored the fact that the german presidency had failed to promote a world-wide ban on torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara lochbihler " as far as we know , no steps have been taken during the german eu presidency to put a global ban on torture on the agenda again , " lochbihler said .
" germany itself still hasn ’ t ratified the special un anti-torture protocol , although it became a signatory to it in september of 2006 . " oosting said he was most concerned about the failure of the eu to confess to past mistakes and speak out openly about its alleged part in the cia ’ s deportations of terror suspects . " for a limited number of people , most of whom we know to be innocent , the rule of law in the heart of europe has broken down totally , " said oosting . " it has been established that there has been european complicity in european countries , by the council of europe , the european parliament , by ngos like amnesty international and human rights watch . and yet we have seen only silence and denial .
and that more than anything undermines the eu 's credibility . " both oosting and lochbihler praised the foreign office in berlin for initiating a productive human rights dialogue with central asian nations . they also noted that the german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier hadn ’ t shied away from criticizing russia for human rights violations , but added that the same amount of openness had not been displayed towards their trans-atlantic allies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 20.06.2007 spate of new reactor plans gives eu an atomic jolt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power is on the march across parts of europe thanks to increased demand for energy that does not emit greenhouse gases , the nuclear power industry is seeing a surge in popularity - especially in former communist countries . european pledges to combat global warming appear to be giving nuclear energy a boost .
even some countries that have moved to phase out nuclear reactors have once more taken up the debate over atomic power , which advocates promote as being much cleaner than traditional energy sources because it produces very low levels of toxic co2 . the change might come as something of a surprise to anyone who has swum in the tide of overwhelmingly anti-nuke public opinion for the past two decades , and especially after the chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 showed the reality of the flaws of lax nuclear safety . yet the mood appears to be shifting , prompted at least in part by european pledges to cut carbon emissions and slow global warming .
especially eager to jump aboard the pro-nukes bandwagon are ex-soviet countries , whose rapid growth and long-standing dependence on russian natural gas makes them extra-keen to take control of their energy markets . new member states are key five of the 10 countries that joined the then 15-nation european union in its 2004 expansion - the czech republic , hungary , lithuania , slovakia and slovenia - have operating reactors .
bulgaria was made to shut down two soviet-era reactors as a condition for eu entry despite noisy opposition .
but its controversial plans to build a new reactor in belene , near the danube , are moving ahead .
the country has already signed with russian company atomstroyexport to build the new plant . romania and the czech republic also have plans to build new reactors .
while construction has begun on plants in romania , the czech government is holding off on similar moves for the next four years due to the presence of the greens in the new coalition . hungary and slovakia are also discussing adding additional units , while baltic states , lithuania , estonia and latvia , have signed an agreement committing to the construction of a new plant at ignalina in lithuania .
poland has also signed a co-operation agreement with lithuania . the ukraine , not in the eu , got almost 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear power last year .
it is considering adding up to 11 new nuclear plants by 2030 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1986 , crowds demonstrated against an atomic plant in hamburg sami tulonen , a spokesman for eu nuclear trade association foratom , acknowledged that eastern-bloc countries have " more advanced discussions " of building new power plants .
this , he said , could be attributed to several factors . " in the new eu states there is more political and public support for nuclear power , " tulonen said .
and as a result of eu entry , " there is very strong economic growth in the region , and need for more electricity capacity to meet demand . " add to that the fact that so much of the east 's current power comes from " very dirty " sources like coal , and the increasing intolerance for greenhouse gases , and its easy to understand how the tide of public opinion can turn toward nuclear energy , tulonen said . ' they want no part of russian domination ' " they have to meet the kyoto goals , and they know their economies are growing , yet they need more nuclear power to meet the low carbon demand , " he added . under the 1997 kyoto protocol , 39 industrialized nations agreed to cut emissions of six greenhouse gases to an average of 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 . finally , observers note that former soviet states are eager to be less dependent on russia 's energy monopolies in the region . " they already know what its like to be dominated by russia , and they want no part of trading political domination for economic domination by increasing their dependence on russia oil and gas , " wrote pro-nuke activist rod adams on his blog , atomicinsight . growth in western europe , too foratom 's tulonen warns that it is false to see the movement as clearly one of east versus west , however . " there is also a lot of discussion about nuclear new build among old -lrb- eu -rrb- member states , " he said , noting that finland is currently building the first nuclear reactor to go up in the eu in the last 15 years . france has serious plans to build , and discussions on amping up nuclear energy in sweden and belgium are ongoing .
even britain is considering nuclear options , he said . " reactor-wise , it is difficult to say where the widest growth will be in five years , " tulonen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paks nuklear power plant in hungary currently , 30 percent of the eu 's total electricity production comes from nuclear sources ; that number is as high as 80 percent in nuke-friendly countries like france and belgium .
germany gets 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear sources .
eu forum on nukes meanwhile , on june 15 the eu announced the formation of an eu nuclear energy forum , which will meet twice a year in an effort to " lay the groundwork for a structured , open debate , about this energy source , without taboos , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a press release .
foratom 's tulonen says he hopes the forum will be used to " lay a roadmap for nuclear investment , in order to support the nuclear renaissance . " opponents of nuclear power , however , argue that the atomic industry is simply using a cynical ploy to exploit people who are worried about global warming by stressing the supposedly low levels of co2 produced by nuclear plants . cynical ploy ? " the nuclear industry has gotten wise to the fact that people are interested in this … they 're trying to sell the idea that nuclear power is the clean alternative , " said sonja meister , a climate and energy campaigner for grassroots environmental group friends of the earth .
not only is it a ploy , meister argues , " its just not true .
they say nuclear power has no co2 emissions , but if you look at the whole production cycle - the emissions produced during uranium mining , building the plant , there is a great deal of co2 produced . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is closing this plant in lithuania , but a replacement is planned moreover , when cost comparisons are made between nuclear and other types of energy sources , safety and potential cleanup costs are almost always ignored , meister said .
" nuclear power plants can never be safe , " she said .
" there is always a danger of human error , even if they are a bit more secure or efficient .
and the general problem of what to do with nuclear waste remains , so it does n't matter if they are a little safer . "
the question remains if it would be possible to phase out nuclear energy and still meet projected emissions cuts in europe .
according to meister , the key lies in investing in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency . " there is no valid reason for nuclear energy , " meister said .
" you can save 10 times more co2 emissions by investing in energy efficiency than in nuclear power … continuing to invest in nuclear energy is just economically insane , " she said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

strike action launched by the union on may 11 to protest the outsourcing plans would end on friday , a union spokesman said .
tens of thousands of the company 's 160,000 employees in germany took part in the strikes , the biggest labor dispute involving the company since it was privatized 12 years ago .
drop in earnings telekom plans to outsource the workers into three lower-paying service companies in a bid to boost earnings and competitiveness in the face of fierce competition in its domestic german market .
last month , the former state monopoly reported a 58-per-cent drop in first-quarter earnings , largely as a result of a slump in its fixed-line operations in germany .
under the deal agreed on wednesday , the workers transferred to the new companies will receive a 6.5 cut in pay and see their working week increased by four hours to 38 hours .
telekom had initially sought a 9 percent pay cut and a six-hour increase in the working week in order to achieve savings of up to 900 million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- .
ver.di said it would ballot its members on the deal next week . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the overall assessment we have of the german presidency is reasonably positive … but there are serious issues , " oosting said . " if europe does n't get its own house in order and act properly it will undermine its credibility and effectiveness on the global stage .
and that is something we can not afford , certainly not after the us has lost its credibility as an actor for human rights . " human rights : just a footnote ? the head of the german section of amnesty international , barbara lochbihler , warned that human rights issues must not become a mere footnote in any future european basic treaty and deplored the fact that the german presidency had failed to promote a world-wide ban on torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara lochbihler " as far as we know , no steps have been taken during the german eu presidency to put a global ban on torture on the agenda again , " lochbihler said .
" germany itself still hasn ’ t ratified the special un anti-torture protocol , although it became a signatory to it in september of 2006 . " oosting said he was most concerned about the failure of the eu to confess to past mistakes and speak out openly about its alleged part in the cia ’ s deportations of terror suspects . " for a limited number of people , most of whom we know to be innocent , the rule of law in the heart of europe has broken down totally , " said oosting . " it has been established that there has been european complicity in european countries , by the council of europe , the european parliament , by ngos like amnesty international and human rights watch . and yet we have seen only silence and denial .
and that more than anything undermines the eu 's credibility . " both oosting and lochbihler praised the foreign office in berlin for initiating a productive human rights dialogue with central asian nations . they also noted that the german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier hadn ’ t shied away from criticizing russia for human rights violations , but added that the same amount of openness had not been displayed towards their trans-atlantic allies .

artist peter friedl 's stuffed giraffe from kalkilya zoo in the west bank is garnering a lot of attention . her eyes are halfway shut and her coat looks worn like those of stuffed toys that have been played with for a very long time .
brownie the giraffe also looks a little small when compared to other specimens of its kind .
but the stuffed animal has still become the center of attention at the 12th documenta that opened in the central german city of kassel last weekend .
until five years ago , brownie was a favorite among visitors to kalkilya zoo in the west bank .
she died when the small town became the center of a military offensive and israeli troops attacked a hamas camp .
brownie panicked , ran into an iron rod , then fell to the floor and died of heart failure .

instead , he 's aiming to add an aesthetic experience to the flood of pictures that can be found in the media .
" if you make the mistake of competing with media images by working in a documentary style , you 're bound to lose , " he said .
" fiction and documentation only produce clichés in this situation .
i was interested in asking : what happens when i bring the real thing with me ? "
tickling the imagination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter friedl but the example of the dead giraffe from palestine also stands for the overall concept of this year 's documenta .
" migrating forms " is the overarching theme of the exhibition .
it means that a picture , a sculpture or an installation does n't only change in a new environment , but also takes on new meaning .
the documenta is trying to give back images to visitors so they can trust their own imaginations again .
friedl said he views the giraffe as a sculpture that can and should help visitors invent stories to go along with it .
" they just have to let it happen , " he said .
" everyone comes with preconceived ideas .
you either know a giraffe or you think , ' it looks a little strange . '

european union leaders prepared wednesday for a key summit aimed at agreeing a mandate for a new treaty that reform certain eu rules .
but polish and british objections are still threatening to derail the talks . german chancellor angela merkel formally invited her fellow eu leaders to the brussels summit starting thursday , with the message that " only together will we succeed in resolving the issues before us . "
" the european public now expects us to put the necessary reforms of the union in hand , " she said .
" following our consultations over the last few months the time has now come to set out the roadmap for the impending reform of the treaties . "
however the polish position remains " unchanged , we have not seen any accommodation , " a spokesman for the german eu presidency said in berlin .
poland strongly objects to the voting system proposed by germany which will be discussed at the summit , aimed at working out the broad lines of a new treaty to replace the constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
warsaw believes " double majority " voting , under which agreement by 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the eu population would be required for new rules , would favor big states like germany .
bildunterschrift : merkel and barroso remain optimistic possibility of compromise ?
eu commission chief jose manuel barroso held an hour-long telephone conversation with polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski wednesday seeking a compromise .
after the talks , a polish spokesman said both men " see the possibility of compromise . "
he hinted that modifications , or a delay , to the double majority voting plan might be enough to persuade warsaw to get in line .
czech premier mirek topolanek , the only backer of the polish demand , meanwhile said wednesday that his country would not veto an agreement at the summit even if poland fails to get the requested changes included .
pressure from both sides britain , the other major opponent to some of merkel 's suggestions was still talking tough wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary margaret beckett " if it comes down to deal or no deal at this european council the uk government is clear ... no deal is better than buying any old pig in a poke , " foreign secretary margaret beckett said .
british prime minister tony blair insists he will not cede national control over foreign policy , the judicial and police system or tax and social security rules , while refusing to give legal force to an eu charter of fundamental rights .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said he was sure the eu states could reach agreement on a new treaty but said he was " very worried " about british opposition to an eu-wide foreign policy .
at the other end of the spectrum , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker threatened to reject the new eu treaty if it did not correspond with crucial elements of the current proposal for a constitution , putting pressure on germany from another side .
germany 's draft germany , which holds the eu presidency until the end of the month , on tuesday handed its eu partners a draft mandate for the intergovernmental conference .
the draft scraps reference to the eu flag and anthem , items guaranteed to raise the hackles of euroskeptics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany does n't care what the document is called as long as it starts an eu reform process it also avoids some controversial terminology .
the new " reform treaty " would amend existing eu treaties rather than replace them .
the word " constitution " has been dropped .
germany insists on an eu " foreign minister , " but a new job title has to be agreed on .
this is unlikely to satisfy britain .
for britain , which also opposes more qualified majority voting in judicial matters , preferring instead unanimous decision-making , germany offered a clause for countries that choose not to participate .
the german draft also provides for national parliaments to be given up to eight weeks to examine draft laws , satisfying a demand by the netherlands .
any draft mandate for a treaty will then go to an intergovernmental conference , which official say is likely to start in july , for several months of discussion . dw staff based on wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european union leaders prepared wednesday for a key summit aimed at agreeing a mandate for a new treaty that reform certain eu rules .
but polish and british objections are still threatening to derail the talks . german chancellor angela merkel formally invited her fellow eu leaders to the brussels summit starting thursday , with the message that " only together will we succeed in resolving the issues before us . "
" the european public now expects us to put the necessary reforms of the union in hand , " she said .
" following our consultations over the last few months the time has now come to set out the roadmap for the impending reform of the treaties . "
however the polish position remains " unchanged , we have not seen any accommodation , " a spokesman for the german eu presidency said in berlin .
poland strongly objects to the voting system proposed by germany which will be discussed at the summit , aimed at working out the broad lines of a new treaty to replace the constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
warsaw believes " double majority " voting , under which agreement by 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the eu population would be required for new rules , would favor big states like germany .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i am totally opposed to any further extension of eu powers as proposed in the new treaty .
i therefore fully support poland in the stand taken on voting rights . - joseph wright , great britain if the eu wants to live in a false democratic state , then it should apply pressure .
however , if they want to leave in a truly democratic state , than the eu must adopt poland 's solution .
a basic and true fundamental principle of democracy is that the power must be divided equally along the partners . - jan , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kaczynski wants to change the treaty 's voting system as america formed its union with the acceptance of 9 of 13 states , the eu should consider forming the union with the acceptance of the constitution by 20 states , or some such majority .
one for all , all for one , is a very difficult formulation for the complexity of the constitution . - scott miller , us in my opinion , romano prodi is right .
the countries that want more integration should improve their relationship formally .
two blocks inside the eu - that is the answer . - gustavo araujo , uruguay the voting system related to population count in each of the eu countries would be fair only in the case of total integration of eu citizens .
this is not the case at the moment and there need to be some security for smaller nations .
the current system is giving much less voice to small countries .
poland is right that the system should be a compromise between interests of big countries like germany and small countries like the czech republic .
germany has the largest population and obviously the system merkel proposes is in germany 's interest . - jack , canada poland is a relatively new member within the eu , which was carried by france and germany .
when spain , for example , joined the eu , eu contributions initiated its economic recovery .
spain does n't have any problems regarding voting allocations .
poland should accept the present voting allocations and stop trying to scare europe with its veto power .
one should not ignore history .
with many polish people leaving for england , human migration throughout the eu should be recognized in the constitution through amendments . - hans reuther-fix , antigua and barbuda compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland dampens hopes for eu treaty success poland seemed to have softened its public tone on the eve of a crucial eu treaty summit , but concerns run deep in the country about not being taken seriously for plans to change the bloc 's reformed voting system .
-lrb- 20.06.2007 -rrb- poles threaten to derail major summit on new eu treaty eu member states have agreed to drop symbolic elements of the new treaty , but a meeting of german and polish leaders over the weekend failed to resolve an impasse over the bloc 's voting structure .
-lrb- 18.06.2007 -rrb- merkel pushes eu treaty in talks with czech premier german chancellor angela merkel hosted czech leader mirek topolanek sunday as part of a diplomatic drive to remove obstacles to an accord on a new institutional treaty for the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 20.06.2007 spate of new reactor plans gives eu an atomic jolt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power is on the march across parts of europe thanks to increased demand for energy that does not emit greenhouse gases , the nuclear power industry is seeing a surge in popularity - especially in former communist countries . european pledges to combat global warming appear to be giving nuclear energy a boost .
even some countries that have moved to phase out nuclear reactors have once more taken up the debate over atomic power , which advocates promote as being much cleaner than traditional energy sources because it produces very low levels of toxic co2 . the change might come as something of a surprise to anyone who has swum in the tide of overwhelmingly anti-nuke public opinion for the past two decades , and especially after the chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 showed the reality of the flaws of lax nuclear safety . yet the mood appears to be shifting , prompted at least in part by european pledges to cut carbon emissions and slow global warming .
especially eager to jump aboard the pro-nukes bandwagon are ex-soviet countries , whose rapid growth and long-standing dependence on russian natural gas makes them extra-keen to take control of their energy markets . new member states are key five of the 10 countries that joined the then 15-nation european union in its 2004 expansion - the czech republic , hungary , lithuania , slovakia and slovenia - have operating reactors .
bulgaria was made to shut down two soviet-era reactors as a condition for eu entry despite noisy opposition .
but its controversial plans to build a new reactor in belene , near the danube , are moving ahead .
the country has already signed with russian company atomstroyexport to build the new plant . romania and the czech republic also have plans to build new reactors .
while construction has begun on plants in romania , the czech government is holding off on similar moves for the next four years due to the presence of the greens in the new coalition . hungary and slovakia are also discussing adding additional units , while baltic states , lithuania , estonia and latvia , have signed an agreement committing to the construction of a new plant at ignalina in lithuania .
poland has also signed a co-operation agreement with lithuania . the ukraine , not in the eu , got almost 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear power last year .
it is considering adding up to 11 new nuclear plants by 2030 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1986 , crowds demonstrated against an atomic plant in hamburg sami tulonen , a spokesman for eu nuclear trade association foratom , acknowledged that eastern-bloc countries have " more advanced discussions " of building new power plants .
this , he said , could be attributed to several factors . " in the new eu states there is more political and public support for nuclear power , " tulonen said .
and as a result of eu entry , " there is very strong economic growth in the region , and need for more electricity capacity to meet demand . " add to that the fact that so much of the east 's current power comes from " very dirty " sources like coal , and the increasing intolerance for greenhouse gases , and its easy to understand how the tide of public opinion can turn toward nuclear energy , tulonen said . ' they want no part of russian domination ' " they have to meet the kyoto goals , and they know their economies are growing , yet they need more nuclear power to meet the low carbon demand , " he added . under the 1997 kyoto protocol , 39 industrialized nations agreed to cut emissions of six greenhouse gases to an average of 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 . finally , observers note that former soviet states are eager to be less dependent on russia 's energy monopolies in the region . " they already know what its like to be dominated by russia , and they want no part of trading political domination for economic domination by increasing their dependence on russia oil and gas , " wrote pro-nuke activist rod adams on his blog , atomicinsight . growth in western europe , too foratom 's tulonen warns that it is false to see the movement as clearly one of east versus west , however . " there is also a lot of discussion about nuclear new build among old -lrb- eu -rrb- member states , " he said , noting that finland is currently building the first nuclear reactor to go up in the eu in the last 15 years . france has serious plans to build , and discussions on amping up nuclear energy in sweden and belgium are ongoing .
even britain is considering nuclear options , he said . " reactor-wise , it is difficult to say where the widest growth will be in five years , " tulonen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paks nuklear power plant in hungary currently , 30 percent of the eu 's total electricity production comes from nuclear sources ; that number is as high as 80 percent in nuke-friendly countries like france and belgium .
germany gets 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear sources .
eu forum on nukes meanwhile , on june 15 the eu announced the formation of an eu nuclear energy forum , which will meet twice a year in an effort to " lay the groundwork for a structured , open debate , about this energy source , without taboos , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a press release .
foratom 's tulonen says he hopes the forum will be used to " lay a roadmap for nuclear investment , in order to support the nuclear renaissance . " opponents of nuclear power , however , argue that the atomic industry is simply using a cynical ploy to exploit people who are worried about global warming by stressing the supposedly low levels of co2 produced by nuclear plants . cynical ploy ? " the nuclear industry has gotten wise to the fact that people are interested in this … they 're trying to sell the idea that nuclear power is the clean alternative , " said sonja meister , a climate and energy campaigner for grassroots environmental group friends of the earth .
not only is it a ploy , meister argues , " its just not true .
they say nuclear power has no co2 emissions , but if you look at the whole production cycle - the emissions produced during uranium mining , building the plant , there is a great deal of co2 produced . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is closing this plant in lithuania , but a replacement is planned moreover , when cost comparisons are made between nuclear and other types of energy sources , safety and potential cleanup costs are almost always ignored , meister said .
" nuclear power plants can never be safe , " she said .
" there is always a danger of human error , even if they are a bit more secure or efficient .
and the general problem of what to do with nuclear waste remains , so it does n't matter if they are a little safer . "
the question remains if it would be possible to phase out nuclear energy and still meet projected emissions cuts in europe .
according to meister , the key lies in investing in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency . " there is no valid reason for nuclear energy , " meister said .
" you can save 10 times more co2 emissions by investing in energy efficiency than in nuclear power … continuing to invest in nuclear energy is just economically insane , " she said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu forum on nukes meanwhile , on june 15 the eu announced the formation of an eu nuclear energy forum , which will meet twice a year in an effort to " lay the groundwork for a structured , open debate , about this energy source , without taboos , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a press release .
foratom 's tulonen says he hopes the forum will be used to " lay a roadmap for nuclear investment , in order to support the nuclear renaissance . " opponents of nuclear power , however , argue that the atomic industry is simply using a cynical ploy to exploit people who are worried about global warming by stressing the supposedly low levels of co2 produced by nuclear plants . cynical ploy ? " the nuclear industry has gotten wise to the fact that people are interested in this … they 're trying to sell the idea that nuclear power is the clean alternative , " said sonja meister , a climate and energy campaigner for grassroots environmental group friends of the earth .
not only is it a ploy , meister argues , " its just not true .
they say nuclear power has no co2 emissions , but if you look at the whole production cycle - the emissions produced during uranium mining , building the plant , there is a great deal of co2 produced . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is closing this plant in lithuania , but a replacement is planned moreover , when cost comparisons are made between nuclear and other types of energy sources , safety and potential cleanup costs are almost always ignored , meister said .
" nuclear power plants can never be safe , " she said .
" there is always a danger of human error , even if they are a bit more secure or efficient .
and the general problem of what to do with nuclear waste remains , so it does n't matter if they are a little safer . "
the question remains if it would be possible to phase out nuclear energy and still meet projected emissions cuts in europe .
according to meister , the key lies in investing in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency . " there is no valid reason for nuclear energy , " meister said .

even some countries that have moved to phase out nuclear reactors have once more taken up the debate over atomic power , which advocates promote as being much cleaner than traditional energy sources because it produces very low levels of toxic co2 . the change might come as something of a surprise to anyone who has swum in the tide of overwhelmingly anti-nuke public opinion for the past two decades , and especially after the chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 showed the reality of the flaws of lax nuclear safety . yet the mood appears to be shifting , prompted at least in part by european pledges to cut carbon emissions and slow global warming .
especially eager to jump aboard the pro-nukes bandwagon are ex-soviet countries , whose rapid growth and long-standing dependence on russian natural gas makes them extra-keen to take control of their energy markets . new member states are key five of the 10 countries that joined the then 15-nation european union in its 2004 expansion - the czech republic , hungary , lithuania , slovakia and slovenia - have operating reactors .
bulgaria was made to shut down two soviet-era reactors as a condition for eu entry despite noisy opposition .
but its controversial plans to build a new reactor in belene , near the danube , are moving ahead .
the country has already signed with russian company atomstroyexport to build the new plant . romania and the czech republic also have plans to build new reactors .
while construction has begun on plants in romania , the czech government is holding off on similar moves for the next four years due to the presence of the greens in the new coalition . hungary and slovakia are also discussing adding additional units , while baltic states , lithuania , estonia and latvia , have signed an agreement committing to the construction of a new plant at ignalina in lithuania .
poland has also signed a co-operation agreement with lithuania . the ukraine , not in the eu , got almost 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear power last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 20.06.2007 spate of new reactor plans gives eu an atomic jolt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power is on the march across parts of europe thanks to increased demand for energy that does not emit greenhouse gases , the nuclear power industry is seeing a surge in popularity - especially in former communist countries . european pledges to combat global warming appear to be giving nuclear energy a boost .
even some countries that have moved to phase out nuclear reactors have once more taken up the debate over atomic power , which advocates promote as being much cleaner than traditional energy sources because it produces very low levels of toxic co2 . the change might come as something of a surprise to anyone who has swum in the tide of overwhelmingly anti-nuke public opinion for the past two decades , and especially after the chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 showed the reality of the flaws of lax nuclear safety . yet the mood appears to be shifting , prompted at least in part by european pledges to cut carbon emissions and slow global warming .
especially eager to jump aboard the pro-nukes bandwagon are ex-soviet countries , whose rapid growth and long-standing dependence on russian natural gas makes them extra-keen to take control of their energy markets . new member states are key five of the 10 countries that joined the then 15-nation european union in its 2004 expansion - the czech republic , hungary , lithuania , slovakia and slovenia - have operating reactors .
bulgaria was made to shut down two soviet-era reactors as a condition for eu entry despite noisy opposition .
but its controversial plans to build a new reactor in belene , near the danube , are moving ahead .
the country has already signed with russian company atomstroyexport to build the new plant . romania and the czech republic also have plans to build new reactors .
while construction has begun on plants in romania , the czech government is holding off on similar moves for the next four years due to the presence of the greens in the new coalition . hungary and slovakia are also discussing adding additional units , while baltic states , lithuania , estonia and latvia , have signed an agreement committing to the construction of a new plant at ignalina in lithuania .
poland has also signed a co-operation agreement with lithuania . the ukraine , not in the eu , got almost 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear power last year .
it is considering adding up to 11 new nuclear plants by 2030 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1986 , crowds demonstrated against an atomic plant in hamburg sami tulonen , a spokesman for eu nuclear trade association foratom , acknowledged that eastern-bloc countries have " more advanced discussions " of building new power plants .
this , he said , could be attributed to several factors . " in the new eu states there is more political and public support for nuclear power , " tulonen said .
and as a result of eu entry , " there is very strong economic growth in the region , and need for more electricity capacity to meet demand . " add to that the fact that so much of the east 's current power comes from " very dirty " sources like coal , and the increasing intolerance for greenhouse gases , and its easy to understand how the tide of public opinion can turn toward nuclear energy , tulonen said . ' they want no part of russian domination ' " they have to meet the kyoto goals , and they know their economies are growing , yet they need more nuclear power to meet the low carbon demand , " he added . under the 1997 kyoto protocol , 39 industrialized nations agreed to cut emissions of six greenhouse gases to an average of 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 . finally , observers note that former soviet states are eager to be less dependent on russia 's energy monopolies in the region . " they already know what its like to be dominated by russia , and they want no part of trading political domination for economic domination by increasing their dependence on russia oil and gas , " wrote pro-nuke activist rod adams on his blog , atomicinsight . growth in western europe , too foratom 's tulonen warns that it is false to see the movement as clearly one of east versus west , however . " there is also a lot of discussion about nuclear new build among old -lrb- eu -rrb- member states , " he said , noting that finland is currently building the first nuclear reactor to go up in the eu in the last 15 years . france has serious plans to build , and discussions on amping up nuclear energy in sweden and belgium are ongoing .
even britain is considering nuclear options , he said . " reactor-wise , it is difficult to say where the widest growth will be in five years , " tulonen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paks nuklear power plant in hungary currently , 30 percent of the eu 's total electricity production comes from nuclear sources ; that number is as high as 80 percent in nuke-friendly countries like france and belgium .
germany gets 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear sources .
eu forum on nukes meanwhile , on june 15 the eu announced the formation of an eu nuclear energy forum , which will meet twice a year in an effort to " lay the groundwork for a structured , open debate , about this energy source , without taboos , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a press release .
foratom 's tulonen says he hopes the forum will be used to " lay a roadmap for nuclear investment , in order to support the nuclear renaissance . " opponents of nuclear power , however , argue that the atomic industry is simply using a cynical ploy to exploit people who are worried about global warming by stressing the supposedly low levels of co2 produced by nuclear plants . cynical ploy ? " the nuclear industry has gotten wise to the fact that people are interested in this … they 're trying to sell the idea that nuclear power is the clean alternative , " said sonja meister , a climate and energy campaigner for grassroots environmental group friends of the earth .
not only is it a ploy , meister argues , " its just not true .
they say nuclear power has no co2 emissions , but if you look at the whole production cycle - the emissions produced during uranium mining , building the plant , there is a great deal of co2 produced . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is closing this plant in lithuania , but a replacement is planned moreover , when cost comparisons are made between nuclear and other types of energy sources , safety and potential cleanup costs are almost always ignored , meister said .

strike action launched by the union on may 11 to protest the outsourcing plans would end on friday , a union spokesman said .
tens of thousands of the company 's 160,000 employees in germany took part in the strikes , the biggest labor dispute involving the company since it was privatized 12 years ago .
drop in earnings telekom plans to outsource the workers into three lower-paying service companies in a bid to boost earnings and competitiveness in the face of fierce competition in its domestic german market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 20.06.2007 poland dampens hopes for eu treaty success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski 's are unpredictable , polish observers say poland seemed to have softened its public tone on the eve of a crucial eu treaty summit , but concerns run deep in the country about not being taken seriously for plans to change the bloc 's reformed voting system . the polish government had indeed already signed the eu constitutional treaty , in 2004 .
three years and a change of government later , however , warsaw 's trying to undo the hard-found compromise .
" nice or death " was the polish government 's approach in 2003 , when the eu member states started negotiating a bloc-wide treaty .
the bone of contention then , as now , was the double-majority voting system .
the treaty of nice gave poland - a country of 38 million - more votes , nearly as many as germany , with its 82 million people .
poland 's insistence on sticking to the treaty of nice ultimately led to isolation .
the then social democratic government in warsaw finally gave in and signed , in 2004 .
however , after the failed referendums on the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year , poland dropped its endorsement of the paper .
ever since germany started preparing the ground for a new eu constitution , an institutional treaty as they have started calling it , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's president and prime minister respectively , have been threatening to veto .
their demands concern one individual point : the double-majority voting system in the european council , the eu 's top decision-making body , should be dropped in favor of a square-root principle . allocating votes to countries on that basis would reduce the influence of the eu 's biggest countries - in particular that of germany .
there 's no mistaking the reproachful tone of warsaw 's arguments implying that berlin dominates the eu .
anti-german sentiment " we are n't so afraid of the germans , " poland 's chief negotiator , marek cichocki , told dw-world.de.
" if we were so afraid of them , would we propose a rule that still concedes the germans more votes than the poles ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski could well be up for some long nights together during the summit rather , the poles were concerned with establishing a generally more fair voting system , cichocki said .
polish eu expert jacek pawlicki , a commentator at polish daily gazeta wyborcza , conceded that cichocki 's argument was understandable .
however , he pointed out , the debate in poland had been marked by increasing anti-german sentiment .
" most poles do n't fully understand what the issue is , " pawlicki said .
" but they sense that it 's about increasing the poles ' influence , and thus , the majority naturally approves . "
in their collective memory , the poles are haunted by having been deceived and betrayed in the past .
the kaczynski twins know how to capitalize on those fears and are neither put off by a worsening of relations to germany nor by isolation within the eu .
isolation is not at all an issue , said cichocki .
instead , he said he felt that , in the course of the discussion about the voting system , public opinion in europe had already changed .
" many listen intently to our proposals and understand our problem . "
europe annoyed ?
" the unloved neighbors - how the poles irritate europe " was , however , the title of this week 's edition of germany 's der spiegel news magazine .
even if some commentators and political scientists see promise in the polish square-root proposal , warsaw 's threat to veto has riled some .
silvana koch-mehrin , a german member of the european parliament , even went so far as to suggest that the poles ought to consider getting out of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw says it does n't want to cause deadlock at the summit " if a country in the eu does n't feel good than you should tell it : if you do n't like it , there 's this possibility , " she said .
cichocki rebuffs the attacks , calling koch-mehrin 's a " reckless idea . "
" such suggestions are entirely unnecessary . "
the question is whether warsaw will agree to a compromise .
" that 's hard to say , " said cichocki .
" this summit has its own logic and this logic is only foreseeable up to a certain standpoint . "
wait and see polish politics also has a certain logic , according to jan barcz , a professor of european law in warsaw .
" no independent expert in poland at the moment can say how the kaczynski brothers will behave in the negotiations .
their politics are simply unpredictable . "
for now , prime minister kaczynski hinted that warsaw might be willing to budge in an interview with germany 's bild-zeitung newspaper , published on wednesday , the day before the two-day summit opens .
poland 's proposal did n't necessarily have to lead to a deadlock in the talks , he said .
" at the moment we only want a debate to be allowed -lrb- at the summit -rrb- on the voting system . "

three years and a change of government later , however , warsaw 's trying to undo the hard-found compromise .
" nice or death " was the polish government 's approach in 2003 , when the eu member states started negotiating a bloc-wide treaty .
the bone of contention then , as now , was the double-majority voting system .
the treaty of nice gave poland - a country of 38 million - more votes , nearly as many as germany , with its 82 million people .
poland 's insistence on sticking to the treaty of nice ultimately led to isolation .
the then social democratic government in warsaw finally gave in and signed , in 2004 .
however , after the failed referendums on the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year , poland dropped its endorsement of the paper .
ever since germany started preparing the ground for a new eu constitution , an institutional treaty as they have started calling it , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's president and prime minister respectively , have been threatening to veto .
their demands concern one individual point : the double-majority voting system in the european council , the eu 's top decision-making body , should be dropped in favor of a square-root principle . allocating votes to countries on that basis would reduce the influence of the eu 's biggest countries - in particular that of germany .
there 's no mistaking the reproachful tone of warsaw 's arguments implying that berlin dominates the eu .
anti-german sentiment " we are n't so afraid of the germans , " poland 's chief negotiator , marek cichocki , told dw-world.de.
" if we were so afraid of them , would we propose a rule that still concedes the germans more votes than the poles ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski could well be up for some long nights together during the summit rather , the poles were concerned with establishing a generally more fair voting system , cichocki said .
polish eu expert jacek pawlicki , a commentator at polish daily gazeta wyborcza , conceded that cichocki 's argument was understandable .
however , he pointed out , the debate in poland had been marked by increasing anti-german sentiment .
" most poles do n't fully understand what the issue is , " pawlicki said .
" but they sense that it 's about increasing the poles ' influence , and thus , the majority naturally approves . "
in their collective memory , the poles are haunted by having been deceived and betrayed in the past .
the kaczynski twins know how to capitalize on those fears and are neither put off by a worsening of relations to germany nor by isolation within the eu .
isolation is not at all an issue , said cichocki .
instead , he said he felt that , in the course of the discussion about the voting system , public opinion in europe had already changed .
" many listen intently to our proposals and understand our problem . "
europe annoyed ?
" the unloved neighbors - how the poles irritate europe " was , however , the title of this week 's edition of germany 's der spiegel news magazine .
even if some commentators and political scientists see promise in the polish square-root proposal , warsaw 's threat to veto has riled some .
silvana koch-mehrin , a german member of the european parliament , even went so far as to suggest that the poles ought to consider getting out of the eu .

cichocki rebuffs the attacks , calling koch-mehrin 's a " reckless idea . "
" such suggestions are entirely unnecessary . "
the question is whether warsaw will agree to a compromise .
" that 's hard to say , " said cichocki .
" this summit has its own logic and this logic is only foreseeable up to a certain standpoint . "
wait and see polish politics also has a certain logic , according to jan barcz , a professor of european law in warsaw .

" the overall assessment we have of the german presidency is reasonably positive … but there are serious issues , " oosting said . " if europe does n't get its own house in order and act properly it will undermine its credibility and effectiveness on the global stage .
and that is something we can not afford , certainly not after the us has lost its credibility as an actor for human rights . " human rights : just a footnote ? the head of the german section of amnesty international , barbara lochbihler , warned that human rights issues must not become a mere footnote in any future european basic treaty and deplored the fact that the german presidency had failed to promote a world-wide ban on torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara lochbihler " as far as we know , no steps have been taken during the german eu presidency to put a global ban on torture on the agenda again , " lochbihler said .
" germany itself still hasn ’ t ratified the special un anti-torture protocol , although it became a signatory to it in september of 2006 . " oosting said he was most concerned about the failure of the eu to confess to past mistakes and speak out openly about its alleged part in the cia ’ s deportations of terror suspects . " for a limited number of people , most of whom we know to be innocent , the rule of law in the heart of europe has broken down totally , " said oosting . " it has been established that there has been european complicity in european countries , by the council of europe , the european parliament , by ngos like amnesty international and human rights watch . and yet we have seen only silence and denial .
and that more than anything undermines the eu 's credibility . " both oosting and lochbihler praised the foreign office in berlin for initiating a productive human rights dialogue with central asian nations . they also noted that the german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier hadn ’ t shied away from criticizing russia for human rights violations , but added that the same amount of openness had not been displayed towards their trans-atlantic allies .

three years and a change of government later , however , warsaw 's trying to undo the hard-found compromise .
" nice or death " was the polish government 's approach in 2003 , when the eu member states started negotiating a bloc-wide treaty .
the bone of contention then , as now , was the double-majority voting system .
the treaty of nice gave poland - a country of 38 million - more votes , nearly as many as germany , with its 82 million people .
poland 's insistence on sticking to the treaty of nice ultimately led to isolation .
the then social democratic government in warsaw finally gave in and signed , in 2004 .
however , after the failed referendums on the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year , poland dropped its endorsement of the paper .
ever since germany started preparing the ground for a new eu constitution , an institutional treaty as they have started calling it , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's president and prime minister respectively , have been threatening to veto .
their demands concern one individual point : the double-majority voting system in the european council , the eu 's top decision-making body , should be dropped in favor of a square-root principle . allocating votes to countries on that basis would reduce the influence of the eu 's biggest countries - in particular that of germany .
there 's no mistaking the reproachful tone of warsaw 's arguments implying that berlin dominates the eu .
anti-german sentiment " we are n't so afraid of the germans , " poland 's chief negotiator , marek cichocki , told dw-world.de.
" if we were so afraid of them , would we propose a rule that still concedes the germans more votes than the poles ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski could well be up for some long nights together during the summit rather , the poles were concerned with establishing a generally more fair voting system , cichocki said .
polish eu expert jacek pawlicki , a commentator at polish daily gazeta wyborcza , conceded that cichocki 's argument was understandable .
however , he pointed out , the debate in poland had been marked by increasing anti-german sentiment .
" most poles do n't fully understand what the issue is , " pawlicki said .
" but they sense that it 's about increasing the poles ' influence , and thus , the majority naturally approves . "
in their collective memory , the poles are haunted by having been deceived and betrayed in the past .
the kaczynski twins know how to capitalize on those fears and are neither put off by a worsening of relations to germany nor by isolation within the eu .
isolation is not at all an issue , said cichocki .
instead , he said he felt that , in the course of the discussion about the voting system , public opinion in europe had already changed .
" many listen intently to our proposals and understand our problem . "
europe annoyed ?
" the unloved neighbors - how the poles irritate europe " was , however , the title of this week 's edition of germany 's der spiegel news magazine .
even if some commentators and political scientists see promise in the polish square-root proposal , warsaw 's threat to veto has riled some .
silvana koch-mehrin , a german member of the european parliament , even went so far as to suggest that the poles ought to consider getting out of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw says it does n't want to cause deadlock at the summit " if a country in the eu does n't feel good than you should tell it : if you do n't like it , there 's this possibility , " she said .
cichocki rebuffs the attacks , calling koch-mehrin 's a " reckless idea . "
" such suggestions are entirely unnecessary . "
the question is whether warsaw will agree to a compromise .
" that 's hard to say , " said cichocki .
" this summit has its own logic and this logic is only foreseeable up to a certain standpoint . "
wait and see polish politics also has a certain logic , according to jan barcz , a professor of european law in warsaw .
" no independent expert in poland at the moment can say how the kaczynski brothers will behave in the negotiations .
their politics are simply unpredictable . "
for now , prime minister kaczynski hinted that warsaw might be willing to budge in an interview with germany 's bild-zeitung newspaper , published on wednesday , the day before the two-day summit opens .
poland 's proposal did n't necessarily have to lead to a deadlock in the talks , he said .
" at the moment we only want a debate to be allowed -lrb- at the summit -rrb- on the voting system . "
but he also told the paper , " they are trying to isolate and ignore poland .
we can not agree to that .
that would be suicide , " he said . britain too is seeking to water down proposals for a common european foreign and security policy .

" the overall assessment we have of the german presidency is reasonably positive … but there are serious issues , " oosting said . " if europe does n't get its own house in order and act properly it will undermine its credibility and effectiveness on the global stage .
and that is something we can not afford , certainly not after the us has lost its credibility as an actor for human rights . " human rights : just a footnote ? the head of the german section of amnesty international , barbara lochbihler , warned that human rights issues must not become a mere footnote in any future european basic treaty and deplored the fact that the german presidency had failed to promote a world-wide ban on torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara lochbihler " as far as we know , no steps have been taken during the german eu presidency to put a global ban on torture on the agenda again , " lochbihler said .
" germany itself still hasn ’ t ratified the special un anti-torture protocol , although it became a signatory to it in september of 2006 . " oosting said he was most concerned about the failure of the eu to confess to past mistakes and speak out openly about its alleged part in the cia ’ s deportations of terror suspects . " for a limited number of people , most of whom we know to be innocent , the rule of law in the heart of europe has broken down totally , " said oosting . " it has been established that there has been european complicity in european countries , by the council of europe , the european parliament , by ngos like amnesty international and human rights watch . and yet we have seen only silence and denial .
and that more than anything undermines the eu 's credibility . " both oosting and lochbihler praised the foreign office in berlin for initiating a productive human rights dialogue with central asian nations . they also noted that the german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier hadn ’ t shied away from criticizing russia for human rights violations , but added that the same amount of openness had not been displayed towards their trans-atlantic allies .

artist peter friedl 's stuffed giraffe from kalkilya zoo in the west bank is garnering a lot of attention . her eyes are halfway shut and her coat looks worn like those of stuffed toys that have been played with for a very long time .
brownie the giraffe also looks a little small when compared to other specimens of its kind .
but the stuffed animal has still become the center of attention at the 12th documenta that opened in the central german city of kassel last weekend .
until five years ago , brownie was a favorite among visitors to kalkilya zoo in the west bank .
she died when the small town became the center of a military offensive and israeli troops attacked a hamas camp .
brownie panicked , ran into an iron rod , then fell to the floor and died of heart failure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sculpture has become a visitor magnet austrian artist peter friedl said he 's not interested in presenting the animal as a witness for the prosecution , nor does he intend to take a side .
instead , he 's aiming to add an aesthetic experience to the flood of pictures that can be found in the media .
" if you make the mistake of competing with media images by working in a documentary style , you 're bound to lose , " he said .
" fiction and documentation only produce clichés in this situation .
i was interested in asking : what happens when i bring the real thing with me ? "
tickling the imagination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter friedl but the example of the dead giraffe from palestine also stands for the overall concept of this year 's documenta .
" migrating forms " is the overarching theme of the exhibition .
it means that a picture , a sculpture or an installation does n't only change in a new environment , but also takes on new meaning .
the documenta is trying to give back images to visitors so they can trust their own imaginations again .
friedl said he views the giraffe as a sculpture that can and should help visitors invent stories to go along with it .
" they just have to let it happen , " he said .
" everyone comes with preconceived ideas .
you either know a giraffe or you think , ' it looks a little strange . '
a lack of information , which would sometimes be desirable , does n't exist in art . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european championships -pipe- 20.06.2007 lehmann 's arsenal fortunes could affect his status for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann has fought his way to the top of the german national team it took jens lehmann almost a decade to supplant ollie kahn as germany 's starting keeper .
but his reign between the posts might be short-lived if he fails to have success this year with the premiership side arsenal . jens lehmann was in bonn on tuesday to cement his place in german sports history .
the 37-year-old keeper was on hand as that city 's house of history museum received the page of notes he used to save two penalties in germany 's dramatic quarterfinal win over argentina in last year 's world cup . it was a moment of confirmation and satisfaction for a keeper who used to play second fiddle in his national side and who is germany 's clear number one ahead of the european soccer championship next year in austria and switzerland . but lehmann still has work to do , if he wants a chance to crown his career with an international title for germany .
to maintain his status in the national side , he first has to do the same with the club he plays for on a weekly basis , arsenal , who are coming off a year with no titles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann was a world cup hero against argentina " we had a very disappointing season , " lehmann acknowledged to dw-radio .
" normally we were always involved in the finals at the end of the season . " those sentiments have been seconded by arsenal fans , many of whom believe the club needs a major shake-up .
and some think the place to start is in goal . gooners having a go at " mad jens " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but he was a goat in the 2006 champions league final although lehmann anchored arsenal 's unprecedented unbeaten 2003-4 season in the premiership and led them to the champions league final in 2006 , club supporters are becoming increasingly critical of their number one .
indeed , some seem never to have forgiven him for picking up a red card in that final match against barcelona , which arsenal lost 2-1 . the german 's periodic bursts of temper have earned him the nicknames " mad jens " and " looney lehmann " from fans whose own mental stability is reflected by the fact that they refer to themselves as " gooners . " moreover , arsenal refused to offer lehmann anything more than a one-year contract in the off-season , and the club 's first signing this summer was polish keeper lukasz fabianski - hardly signs of abiding faith in lehmann 's abilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabianski says he 's ready to challenge for lehmann 's arsenal job in the wake of that acquisition , some gooners have called for the german to be replaced .
" lehmann , " opined one blogger on the bbc 's website after the fabianski signing was announced , " has shown increasingly last season he can not be trusted to play for the team when he is distracting the defence with his stupid antics . " gunners fans also rushed to youtube to check out fabianski 's skills for themselves .
most were impressed , with one of them commenting , succinctly : " lehman out , fabianski in , come on arsenal . " last time around ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann will be 38 by the time euro 2008 begins gunners coach arsene wenger is unlikely to put much stock in the ranting of often hysterical fans , but he does want to win some silverware .
should lehmann make a couple of costly blunders early next season , wenger might decide to bench him in favor of fabianski or arsenal 's other backup , manuel almunia . if that hypothetical situation came to pass , it would be hard for german national coach joachim löw to justify starting lehmann ahead of germany 's host of other great keepers . there are also questions about lehmann 's age , with even the keeper himself unclear as to whether he will extend his career beyond 2008 .
" everybody 's spreading rumors , and i 'm doing the same , " lehmann told dw-radio , " so i really do n't know . " a year is a long time in soccer , as lehmann is obviously aware .
so while the arsenal keeper looks a good bet to be minding the posts for germany at the euro 2008 , he is not , by any means , a sure thing . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de players ' development crucial to german success , says lehmann after reaching third place in the 2006 world cup and progressing well in qualification for euro 2008 , germany 's young stars appear to have polished their shine .

three years and a change of government later , however , warsaw 's trying to undo the hard-found compromise .
" nice or death " was the polish government 's approach in 2003 , when the eu member states started negotiating a bloc-wide treaty .
the bone of contention then , as now , was the double-majority voting system .
the treaty of nice gave poland - a country of 38 million - more votes , nearly as many as germany , with its 82 million people .
poland 's insistence on sticking to the treaty of nice ultimately led to isolation .
the then social democratic government in warsaw finally gave in and signed , in 2004 .
however , after the failed referendums on the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year , poland dropped its endorsement of the paper .
ever since germany started preparing the ground for a new eu constitution , an institutional treaty as they have started calling it , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's president and prime minister respectively , have been threatening to veto .
their demands concern one individual point : the double-majority voting system in the european council , the eu 's top decision-making body , should be dropped in favor of a square-root principle . allocating votes to countries on that basis would reduce the influence of the eu 's biggest countries - in particular that of germany .
there 's no mistaking the reproachful tone of warsaw 's arguments implying that berlin dominates the eu .
anti-german sentiment " we are n't so afraid of the germans , " poland 's chief negotiator , marek cichocki , told dw-world.de.
" if we were so afraid of them , would we propose a rule that still concedes the germans more votes than the poles ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski could well be up for some long nights together during the summit rather , the poles were concerned with establishing a generally more fair voting system , cichocki said .
polish eu expert jacek pawlicki , a commentator at polish daily gazeta wyborcza , conceded that cichocki 's argument was understandable .
however , he pointed out , the debate in poland had been marked by increasing anti-german sentiment .
" most poles do n't fully understand what the issue is , " pawlicki said .
" but they sense that it 's about increasing the poles ' influence , and thus , the majority naturally approves . "
in their collective memory , the poles are haunted by having been deceived and betrayed in the past .
the kaczynski twins know how to capitalize on those fears and are neither put off by a worsening of relations to germany nor by isolation within the eu .
isolation is not at all an issue , said cichocki .
instead , he said he felt that , in the course of the discussion about the voting system , public opinion in europe had already changed .
" many listen intently to our proposals and understand our problem . "
europe annoyed ?
" the unloved neighbors - how the poles irritate europe " was , however , the title of this week 's edition of germany 's der spiegel news magazine .
even if some commentators and political scientists see promise in the polish square-root proposal , warsaw 's threat to veto has riled some .
silvana koch-mehrin , a german member of the european parliament , even went so far as to suggest that the poles ought to consider getting out of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw says it does n't want to cause deadlock at the summit " if a country in the eu does n't feel good than you should tell it : if you do n't like it , there 's this possibility , " she said .
cichocki rebuffs the attacks , calling koch-mehrin 's a " reckless idea . "
" such suggestions are entirely unnecessary . "
the question is whether warsaw will agree to a compromise .
" that 's hard to say , " said cichocki .
" this summit has its own logic and this logic is only foreseeable up to a certain standpoint . "
wait and see polish politics also has a certain logic , according to jan barcz , a professor of european law in warsaw .
" no independent expert in poland at the moment can say how the kaczynski brothers will behave in the negotiations .
their politics are simply unpredictable . "
for now , prime minister kaczynski hinted that warsaw might be willing to budge in an interview with germany 's bild-zeitung newspaper , published on wednesday , the day before the two-day summit opens .

three years and a change of government later , however , warsaw 's trying to undo the hard-found compromise .
" nice or death " was the polish government 's approach in 2003 , when the eu member states started negotiating a bloc-wide treaty .
the bone of contention then , as now , was the double-majority voting system .
the treaty of nice gave poland - a country of 38 million - more votes , nearly as many as germany , with its 82 million people .
poland 's insistence on sticking to the treaty of nice ultimately led to isolation .
the then social democratic government in warsaw finally gave in and signed , in 2004 .
however , after the failed referendums on the draft constitution in france and the netherlands last year , poland dropped its endorsement of the paper .
ever since germany started preparing the ground for a new eu constitution , an institutional treaty as they have started calling it , lech and jaroslaw kaczynski , poland 's president and prime minister respectively , have been threatening to veto .
their demands concern one individual point : the double-majority voting system in the european council , the eu 's top decision-making body , should be dropped in favor of a square-root principle . allocating votes to countries on that basis would reduce the influence of the eu 's biggest countries - in particular that of germany .
there 's no mistaking the reproachful tone of warsaw 's arguments implying that berlin dominates the eu .
anti-german sentiment " we are n't so afraid of the germans , " poland 's chief negotiator , marek cichocki , told dw-world.de.
" if we were so afraid of them , would we propose a rule that still concedes the germans more votes than the poles ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski could well be up for some long nights together during the summit rather , the poles were concerned with establishing a generally more fair voting system , cichocki said .
polish eu expert jacek pawlicki , a commentator at polish daily gazeta wyborcza , conceded that cichocki 's argument was understandable .
however , he pointed out , the debate in poland had been marked by increasing anti-german sentiment .
" most poles do n't fully understand what the issue is , " pawlicki said .
" but they sense that it 's about increasing the poles ' influence , and thus , the majority naturally approves . "
in their collective memory , the poles are haunted by having been deceived and betrayed in the past .
the kaczynski twins know how to capitalize on those fears and are neither put off by a worsening of relations to germany nor by isolation within the eu .
isolation is not at all an issue , said cichocki .
instead , he said he felt that , in the course of the discussion about the voting system , public opinion in europe had already changed .
" many listen intently to our proposals and understand our problem . "
europe annoyed ?
" the unloved neighbors - how the poles irritate europe " was , however , the title of this week 's edition of germany 's der spiegel news magazine .
even if some commentators and political scientists see promise in the polish square-root proposal , warsaw 's threat to veto has riled some .
silvana koch-mehrin , a german member of the european parliament , even went so far as to suggest that the poles ought to consider getting out of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw says it does n't want to cause deadlock at the summit " if a country in the eu does n't feel good than you should tell it : if you do n't like it , there 's this possibility , " she said .
cichocki rebuffs the attacks , calling koch-mehrin 's a " reckless idea . "
" such suggestions are entirely unnecessary . "
the question is whether warsaw will agree to a compromise .
" that 's hard to say , " said cichocki .
" this summit has its own logic and this logic is only foreseeable up to a certain standpoint . "
wait and see polish politics also has a certain logic , according to jan barcz , a professor of european law in warsaw .
" no independent expert in poland at the moment can say how the kaczynski brothers will behave in the negotiations .
their politics are simply unpredictable . "
for now , prime minister kaczynski hinted that warsaw might be willing to budge in an interview with germany 's bild-zeitung newspaper , published on wednesday , the day before the two-day summit opens .
poland 's proposal did n't necessarily have to lead to a deadlock in the talks , he said .

her appointment will see her play a key role in shaping sarkozy 's ambitious and controversial reforms - and puts the number of women in the cabinet at a total of seven .
other women appointed include interior minister michele alliot-marie , culture minister christine albanel and higher education minister valerie pecresse . as justice minister , sarkozy 's campaign spokeswomen rachida dati becomes the first ethnic minority figure in a senior cabinet post . in further surprise moves , sarkozy added half a dozen junior ministers to the government , some of them also hailing from ethnic minorities and the left in line with his declared policy of " openness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rachida dati muslim feminist , fadela amara , became junior minister for urban affairs , and a senegalese-born woman rama yade , 30 , a junior minister for foreign affairs and human rights . former foreign minister michel barnier took over from lagarde as agriculture minister , while socialist senator jean-marie bockel was named junior minister for foreign assistance and francophony , bringing to three the number of leftists in foreign affairs . defying expectations sarkozy scored a political coup when he appointed prominent socialist bernard kouchner , the founder of doctors without borders , as foreign minister last month , confounding critics who had warned that he would concentrate power in a rightwing clique . most of the 15 senior ministers appointed last month after sarkozy defeated socialist segolene royal in the presidential election remained in their posts . sarkozy also named france rugby coach bernard laporte as sports minister , a post he will take up later this year following the world cup , saying his priority was to win the event . overall , cabinet positions were halved , while portfolios expanded .
slimming down the cabinet is part of sarkozy 's agenda to cut costs and increase government efficiency . sweeping reforms a special session of the newly-elected national assembly is to be convened next week to push through a first round of reforms , including tax breaks aimed at jump-starting the economy and lowering unemployment hovering at 8.2 percent , one of the highest in europe . one month after sarkozy took office promising sweeping reforms , his ump party won a national assembly majority in sunday 's vote , but it lost more than 40 seats while the opposition socialists made surprise gains . and in a symbolic blow to the government , juppe , a former prime minister and mayor of bordeaux , lost to a socialist and had to resign from the cabinet . sarkozy had brought him back from political exile after his conviction in a party finance scandal that had prevented him from holding public office for a year . despite the disappointment , prime minister francois fillon has insisted that the election delivered a " majority for action " and vowed to forge ahead with the reform programm . fillon said tuesday that he had not " shut the door " on a proposal to increase the value-added tax by up to 5 percent to help finance soaring health care costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal has her eye on her party 's top job the proposal was widely seen as having provided the opposition socialists with a boon during the final days of campaigning for the parliamentary elections . royal split many in the party were angered by segolene royal 's announcement sunday that she had split from her long-standing partner , socialist party leader francois hollande .
the french media has suggested that their troubled relationship undermined the party 's campaign , and speculation is now rife that royal is keen to take over from hollande as socialist leader . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

artist peter friedl 's stuffed giraffe from kalkilya zoo in the west bank is garnering a lot of attention . her eyes are halfway shut and her coat looks worn like those of stuffed toys that have been played with for a very long time .
brownie the giraffe also looks a little small when compared to other specimens of its kind .
but the stuffed animal has still become the center of attention at the 12th documenta that opened in the central german city of kassel last weekend .
until five years ago , brownie was a favorite among visitors to kalkilya zoo in the west bank .
she died when the small town became the center of a military offensive and israeli troops attacked a hamas camp .
brownie panicked , ran into an iron rod , then fell to the floor and died of heart failure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sculpture has become a visitor magnet austrian artist peter friedl said he 's not interested in presenting the animal as a witness for the prosecution , nor does he intend to take a side .
instead , he 's aiming to add an aesthetic experience to the flood of pictures that can be found in the media .
" if you make the mistake of competing with media images by working in a documentary style , you 're bound to lose , " he said .
" fiction and documentation only produce clichés in this situation .
i was interested in asking : what happens when i bring the real thing with me ? "
tickling the imagination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter friedl but the example of the dead giraffe from palestine also stands for the overall concept of this year 's documenta .
" migrating forms " is the overarching theme of the exhibition .
it means that a picture , a sculpture or an installation does n't only change in a new environment , but also takes on new meaning .
the documenta is trying to give back images to visitors so they can trust their own imaginations again .
friedl said he views the giraffe as a sculpture that can and should help visitors invent stories to go along with it .
" they just have to let it happen , " he said .
" everyone comes with preconceived ideas .
you either know a giraffe or you think , ' it looks a little strange . '
a lack of information , which would sometimes be desirable , does n't exist in art . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even some countries that have moved to phase out nuclear reactors have once more taken up the debate over atomic power , which advocates promote as being much cleaner than traditional energy sources because it produces very low levels of toxic co2 . the change might come as something of a surprise to anyone who has swum in the tide of overwhelmingly anti-nuke public opinion for the past two decades , and especially after the chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 showed the reality of the flaws of lax nuclear safety . yet the mood appears to be shifting , prompted at least in part by european pledges to cut carbon emissions and slow global warming .
especially eager to jump aboard the pro-nukes bandwagon are ex-soviet countries , whose rapid growth and long-standing dependence on russian natural gas makes them extra-keen to take control of their energy markets . new member states are key five of the 10 countries that joined the then 15-nation european union in its 2004 expansion - the czech republic , hungary , lithuania , slovakia and slovenia - have operating reactors .
bulgaria was made to shut down two soviet-era reactors as a condition for eu entry despite noisy opposition .
but its controversial plans to build a new reactor in belene , near the danube , are moving ahead .
the country has already signed with russian company atomstroyexport to build the new plant . romania and the czech republic also have plans to build new reactors .
while construction has begun on plants in romania , the czech government is holding off on similar moves for the next four years due to the presence of the greens in the new coalition . hungary and slovakia are also discussing adding additional units , while baltic states , lithuania , estonia and latvia , have signed an agreement committing to the construction of a new plant at ignalina in lithuania .
poland has also signed a co-operation agreement with lithuania . the ukraine , not in the eu , got almost 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear power last year .
it is considering adding up to 11 new nuclear plants by 2030 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1986 , crowds demonstrated against an atomic plant in hamburg sami tulonen , a spokesman for eu nuclear trade association foratom , acknowledged that eastern-bloc countries have " more advanced discussions " of building new power plants .
this , he said , could be attributed to several factors . " in the new eu states there is more political and public support for nuclear power , " tulonen said .
and as a result of eu entry , " there is very strong economic growth in the region , and need for more electricity capacity to meet demand . " add to that the fact that so much of the east 's current power comes from " very dirty " sources like coal , and the increasing intolerance for greenhouse gases , and its easy to understand how the tide of public opinion can turn toward nuclear energy , tulonen said . ' they want no part of russian domination ' " they have to meet the kyoto goals , and they know their economies are growing , yet they need more nuclear power to meet the low carbon demand , " he added . under the 1997 kyoto protocol , 39 industrialized nations agreed to cut emissions of six greenhouse gases to an average of 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 . finally , observers note that former soviet states are eager to be less dependent on russia 's energy monopolies in the region . " they already know what its like to be dominated by russia , and they want no part of trading political domination for economic domination by increasing their dependence on russia oil and gas , " wrote pro-nuke activist rod adams on his blog , atomicinsight . growth in western europe , too foratom 's tulonen warns that it is false to see the movement as clearly one of east versus west , however . " there is also a lot of discussion about nuclear new build among old -lrb- eu -rrb- member states , " he said , noting that finland is currently building the first nuclear reactor to go up in the eu in the last 15 years . france has serious plans to build , and discussions on amping up nuclear energy in sweden and belgium are ongoing .
even britain is considering nuclear options , he said . " reactor-wise , it is difficult to say where the widest growth will be in five years , " tulonen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paks nuklear power plant in hungary currently , 30 percent of the eu 's total electricity production comes from nuclear sources ; that number is as high as 80 percent in nuke-friendly countries like france and belgium .
germany gets 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear sources .
eu forum on nukes meanwhile , on june 15 the eu announced the formation of an eu nuclear energy forum , which will meet twice a year in an effort to " lay the groundwork for a structured , open debate , about this energy source , without taboos , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a press release .
foratom 's tulonen says he hopes the forum will be used to " lay a roadmap for nuclear investment , in order to support the nuclear renaissance . " opponents of nuclear power , however , argue that the atomic industry is simply using a cynical ploy to exploit people who are worried about global warming by stressing the supposedly low levels of co2 produced by nuclear plants . cynical ploy ? " the nuclear industry has gotten wise to the fact that people are interested in this … they 're trying to sell the idea that nuclear power is the clean alternative , " said sonja meister , a climate and energy campaigner for grassroots environmental group friends of the earth .
not only is it a ploy , meister argues , " its just not true .
they say nuclear power has no co2 emissions , but if you look at the whole production cycle - the emissions produced during uranium mining , building the plant , there is a great deal of co2 produced . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is closing this plant in lithuania , but a replacement is planned moreover , when cost comparisons are made between nuclear and other types of energy sources , safety and potential cleanup costs are almost always ignored , meister said .
" nuclear power plants can never be safe , " she said .
" there is always a danger of human error , even if they are a bit more secure or efficient .
and the general problem of what to do with nuclear waste remains , so it does n't matter if they are a little safer . "
the question remains if it would be possible to phase out nuclear energy and still meet projected emissions cuts in europe .
according to meister , the key lies in investing in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency . " there is no valid reason for nuclear energy , " meister said .
" you can save 10 times more co2 emissions by investing in energy efficiency than in nuclear power … continuing to invest in nuclear energy is just economically insane , " she said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : leaders meet for crucial summit on europe 's future polish prime minister brings world war two into eu vote debate survey : europeans want strong leadership role from merkel sarkozy could be key player at eu summit central european leaders push for eu reform compromise european union -pipe- 20.06.2007 pressure from all sides as eu prepares for crucial summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the eu reached a dead end or will leaders manage to agree on a compromise ?
european union leaders prepared wednesday for a key summit aimed at agreeing a mandate for a new treaty that reform certain eu rules .
but polish and british objections are still threatening to derail the talks . german chancellor angela merkel formally invited her fellow eu leaders to the brussels summit starting thursday , with the message that " only together will we succeed in resolving the issues before us . "
" the european public now expects us to put the necessary reforms of the union in hand , " she said .
" following our consultations over the last few months the time has now come to set out the roadmap for the impending reform of the treaties . "
however the polish position remains " unchanged , we have not seen any accommodation , " a spokesman for the german eu presidency said in berlin .
poland strongly objects to the voting system proposed by germany which will be discussed at the summit , aimed at working out the broad lines of a new treaty to replace the constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
warsaw believes " double majority " voting , under which agreement by 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the eu population would be required for new rules , would favor big states like germany .
bildunterschrift : merkel and barroso remain optimistic possibility of compromise ?
eu commission chief jose manuel barroso held an hour-long telephone conversation with polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski wednesday seeking a compromise .
after the talks , a polish spokesman said both men " see the possibility of compromise . "
he hinted that modifications , or a delay , to the double majority voting plan might be enough to persuade warsaw to get in line .
czech premier mirek topolanek , the only backer of the polish demand , meanwhile said wednesday that his country would not veto an agreement at the summit even if poland fails to get the requested changes included .
pressure from both sides britain , the other major opponent to some of merkel 's suggestions was still talking tough wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary margaret beckett " if it comes down to deal or no deal at this european council the uk government is clear ... no deal is better than buying any old pig in a poke , " foreign secretary margaret beckett said .
british prime minister tony blair insists he will not cede national control over foreign policy , the judicial and police system or tax and social security rules , while refusing to give legal force to an eu charter of fundamental rights .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said he was sure the eu states could reach agreement on a new treaty but said he was " very worried " about british opposition to an eu-wide foreign policy .
at the other end of the spectrum , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker threatened to reject the new eu treaty if it did not correspond with crucial elements of the current proposal for a constitution , putting pressure on germany from another side .
germany 's draft germany , which holds the eu presidency until the end of the month , on tuesday handed its eu partners a draft mandate for the intergovernmental conference .
the draft scraps reference to the eu flag and anthem , items guaranteed to raise the hackles of euroskeptics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany does n't care what the document is called as long as it starts an eu reform process it also avoids some controversial terminology .
the new " reform treaty " would amend existing eu treaties rather than replace them .
the word " constitution " has been dropped .
germany insists on an eu " foreign minister , " but a new job title has to be agreed on .
this is unlikely to satisfy britain .
for britain , which also opposes more qualified majority voting in judicial matters , preferring instead unanimous decision-making , germany offered a clause for countries that choose not to participate .
the german draft also provides for national parliaments to be given up to eight weeks to examine draft laws , satisfying a demand by the netherlands .
any draft mandate for a treaty will then go to an intergovernmental conference , which official say is likely to start in july , for several months of discussion . dw staff based on wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even some countries that have moved to phase out nuclear reactors have once more taken up the debate over atomic power , which advocates promote as being much cleaner than traditional energy sources because it produces very low levels of toxic co2 . the change might come as something of a surprise to anyone who has swum in the tide of overwhelmingly anti-nuke public opinion for the past two decades , and especially after the chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 showed the reality of the flaws of lax nuclear safety . yet the mood appears to be shifting , prompted at least in part by european pledges to cut carbon emissions and slow global warming .
especially eager to jump aboard the pro-nukes bandwagon are ex-soviet countries , whose rapid growth and long-standing dependence on russian natural gas makes them extra-keen to take control of their energy markets . new member states are key five of the 10 countries that joined the then 15-nation european union in its 2004 expansion - the czech republic , hungary , lithuania , slovakia and slovenia - have operating reactors .
bulgaria was made to shut down two soviet-era reactors as a condition for eu entry despite noisy opposition .
but its controversial plans to build a new reactor in belene , near the danube , are moving ahead .
the country has already signed with russian company atomstroyexport to build the new plant . romania and the czech republic also have plans to build new reactors .
while construction has begun on plants in romania , the czech government is holding off on similar moves for the next four years due to the presence of the greens in the new coalition . hungary and slovakia are also discussing adding additional units , while baltic states , lithuania , estonia and latvia , have signed an agreement committing to the construction of a new plant at ignalina in lithuania .
poland has also signed a co-operation agreement with lithuania . the ukraine , not in the eu , got almost 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear power last year .
it is considering adding up to 11 new nuclear plants by 2030 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1986 , crowds demonstrated against an atomic plant in hamburg sami tulonen , a spokesman for eu nuclear trade association foratom , acknowledged that eastern-bloc countries have " more advanced discussions " of building new power plants .
this , he said , could be attributed to several factors . " in the new eu states there is more political and public support for nuclear power , " tulonen said .
and as a result of eu entry , " there is very strong economic growth in the region , and need for more electricity capacity to meet demand . " add to that the fact that so much of the east 's current power comes from " very dirty " sources like coal , and the increasing intolerance for greenhouse gases , and its easy to understand how the tide of public opinion can turn toward nuclear energy , tulonen said . ' they want no part of russian domination ' " they have to meet the kyoto goals , and they know their economies are growing , yet they need more nuclear power to meet the low carbon demand , " he added . under the 1997 kyoto protocol , 39 industrialized nations agreed to cut emissions of six greenhouse gases to an average of 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 . finally , observers note that former soviet states are eager to be less dependent on russia 's energy monopolies in the region . " they already know what its like to be dominated by russia , and they want no part of trading political domination for economic domination by increasing their dependence on russia oil and gas , " wrote pro-nuke activist rod adams on his blog , atomicinsight . growth in western europe , too foratom 's tulonen warns that it is false to see the movement as clearly one of east versus west , however . " there is also a lot of discussion about nuclear new build among old -lrb- eu -rrb- member states , " he said , noting that finland is currently building the first nuclear reactor to go up in the eu in the last 15 years . france has serious plans to build , and discussions on amping up nuclear energy in sweden and belgium are ongoing .
even britain is considering nuclear options , he said . " reactor-wise , it is difficult to say where the widest growth will be in five years , " tulonen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paks nuklear power plant in hungary currently , 30 percent of the eu 's total electricity production comes from nuclear sources ; that number is as high as 80 percent in nuke-friendly countries like france and belgium .
germany gets 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear sources .
eu forum on nukes meanwhile , on june 15 the eu announced the formation of an eu nuclear energy forum , which will meet twice a year in an effort to " lay the groundwork for a structured , open debate , about this energy source , without taboos , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a press release .
foratom 's tulonen says he hopes the forum will be used to " lay a roadmap for nuclear investment , in order to support the nuclear renaissance . " opponents of nuclear power , however , argue that the atomic industry is simply using a cynical ploy to exploit people who are worried about global warming by stressing the supposedly low levels of co2 produced by nuclear plants . cynical ploy ? " the nuclear industry has gotten wise to the fact that people are interested in this … they 're trying to sell the idea that nuclear power is the clean alternative , " said sonja meister , a climate and energy campaigner for grassroots environmental group friends of the earth .
not only is it a ploy , meister argues , " its just not true .
they say nuclear power has no co2 emissions , but if you look at the whole production cycle - the emissions produced during uranium mining , building the plant , there is a great deal of co2 produced . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is closing this plant in lithuania , but a replacement is planned moreover , when cost comparisons are made between nuclear and other types of energy sources , safety and potential cleanup costs are almost always ignored , meister said .
" nuclear power plants can never be safe , " she said .
" there is always a danger of human error , even if they are a bit more secure or efficient .
and the general problem of what to do with nuclear waste remains , so it does n't matter if they are a little safer . "
the question remains if it would be possible to phase out nuclear energy and still meet projected emissions cuts in europe .
according to meister , the key lies in investing in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency . " there is no valid reason for nuclear energy , " meister said .
" you can save 10 times more co2 emissions by investing in energy efficiency than in nuclear power … continuing to invest in nuclear energy is just economically insane , " she said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the overall assessment we have of the german presidency is reasonably positive … but there are serious issues , " oosting said . " if europe does n't get its own house in order and act properly it will undermine its credibility and effectiveness on the global stage .
and that is something we can not afford , certainly not after the us has lost its credibility as an actor for human rights . " human rights : just a footnote ? the head of the german section of amnesty international , barbara lochbihler , warned that human rights issues must not become a mere footnote in any future european basic treaty and deplored the fact that the german presidency had failed to promote a world-wide ban on torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara lochbihler " as far as we know , no steps have been taken during the german eu presidency to put a global ban on torture on the agenda again , " lochbihler said .
" germany itself still hasn ’ t ratified the special un anti-torture protocol , although it became a signatory to it in september of 2006 . " oosting said he was most concerned about the failure of the eu to confess to past mistakes and speak out openly about its alleged part in the cia ’ s deportations of terror suspects . " for a limited number of people , most of whom we know to be innocent , the rule of law in the heart of europe has broken down totally , " said oosting . " it has been established that there has been european complicity in european countries , by the council of europe , the european parliament , by ngos like amnesty international and human rights watch . and yet we have seen only silence and denial .
and that more than anything undermines the eu 's credibility .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 20.06.2007 spate of new reactor plans gives eu an atomic jolt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power is on the march across parts of europe thanks to increased demand for energy that does not emit greenhouse gases , the nuclear power industry is seeing a surge in popularity - especially in former communist countries . european pledges to combat global warming appear to be giving nuclear energy a boost .
even some countries that have moved to phase out nuclear reactors have once more taken up the debate over atomic power , which advocates promote as being much cleaner than traditional energy sources because it produces very low levels of toxic co2 . the change might come as something of a surprise to anyone who has swum in the tide of overwhelmingly anti-nuke public opinion for the past two decades , and especially after the chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 showed the reality of the flaws of lax nuclear safety . yet the mood appears to be shifting , prompted at least in part by european pledges to cut carbon emissions and slow global warming .
especially eager to jump aboard the pro-nukes bandwagon are ex-soviet countries , whose rapid growth and long-standing dependence on russian natural gas makes them extra-keen to take control of their energy markets . new member states are key five of the 10 countries that joined the then 15-nation european union in its 2004 expansion - the czech republic , hungary , lithuania , slovakia and slovenia - have operating reactors .
bulgaria was made to shut down two soviet-era reactors as a condition for eu entry despite noisy opposition .
but its controversial plans to build a new reactor in belene , near the danube , are moving ahead .
the country has already signed with russian company atomstroyexport to build the new plant . romania and the czech republic also have plans to build new reactors .
while construction has begun on plants in romania , the czech government is holding off on similar moves for the next four years due to the presence of the greens in the new coalition . hungary and slovakia are also discussing adding additional units , while baltic states , lithuania , estonia and latvia , have signed an agreement committing to the construction of a new plant at ignalina in lithuania .
poland has also signed a co-operation agreement with lithuania . the ukraine , not in the eu , got almost 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear power last year .
it is considering adding up to 11 new nuclear plants by 2030 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1986 , crowds demonstrated against an atomic plant in hamburg sami tulonen , a spokesman for eu nuclear trade association foratom , acknowledged that eastern-bloc countries have " more advanced discussions " of building new power plants .
this , he said , could be attributed to several factors . " in the new eu states there is more political and public support for nuclear power , " tulonen said .
and as a result of eu entry , " there is very strong economic growth in the region , and need for more electricity capacity to meet demand . " add to that the fact that so much of the east 's current power comes from " very dirty " sources like coal , and the increasing intolerance for greenhouse gases , and its easy to understand how the tide of public opinion can turn toward nuclear energy , tulonen said . ' they want no part of russian domination ' " they have to meet the kyoto goals , and they know their economies are growing , yet they need more nuclear power to meet the low carbon demand , " he added . under the 1997 kyoto protocol , 39 industrialized nations agreed to cut emissions of six greenhouse gases to an average of 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 . finally , observers note that former soviet states are eager to be less dependent on russia 's energy monopolies in the region . " they already know what its like to be dominated by russia , and they want no part of trading political domination for economic domination by increasing their dependence on russia oil and gas , " wrote pro-nuke activist rod adams on his blog , atomicinsight . growth in western europe , too foratom 's tulonen warns that it is false to see the movement as clearly one of east versus west , however . " there is also a lot of discussion about nuclear new build among old -lrb- eu -rrb- member states , " he said , noting that finland is currently building the first nuclear reactor to go up in the eu in the last 15 years . france has serious plans to build , and discussions on amping up nuclear energy in sweden and belgium are ongoing .
even britain is considering nuclear options , he said . " reactor-wise , it is difficult to say where the widest growth will be in five years , " tulonen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paks nuklear power plant in hungary currently , 30 percent of the eu 's total electricity production comes from nuclear sources ; that number is as high as 80 percent in nuke-friendly countries like france and belgium .
germany gets 50 percent of its electricity from nuclear sources .
eu forum on nukes meanwhile , on june 15 the eu announced the formation of an eu nuclear energy forum , which will meet twice a year in an effort to " lay the groundwork for a structured , open debate , about this energy source , without taboos , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a press release .
foratom 's tulonen says he hopes the forum will be used to " lay a roadmap for nuclear investment , in order to support the nuclear renaissance . " opponents of nuclear power , however , argue that the atomic industry is simply using a cynical ploy to exploit people who are worried about global warming by stressing the supposedly low levels of co2 produced by nuclear plants . cynical ploy ? " the nuclear industry has gotten wise to the fact that people are interested in this … they 're trying to sell the idea that nuclear power is the clean alternative , " said sonja meister , a climate and energy campaigner for grassroots environmental group friends of the earth .
not only is it a ploy , meister argues , " its just not true .
they say nuclear power has no co2 emissions , but if you look at the whole production cycle - the emissions produced during uranium mining , building the plant , there is a great deal of co2 produced . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is closing this plant in lithuania , but a replacement is planned moreover , when cost comparisons are made between nuclear and other types of energy sources , safety and potential cleanup costs are almost always ignored , meister said .
" nuclear power plants can never be safe , " she said .
" there is always a danger of human error , even if they are a bit more secure or efficient .
and the general problem of what to do with nuclear waste remains , so it does n't matter if they are a little safer . "
the question remains if it would be possible to phase out nuclear energy and still meet projected emissions cuts in europe .
according to meister , the key lies in investing in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency . " there is no valid reason for nuclear energy , " meister said .
" you can save 10 times more co2 emissions by investing in energy efficiency than in nuclear power … continuing to invest in nuclear energy is just economically insane , " she said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just prior to this week 's eu constitutional treaty summit , poland insisted that changes be made to the treaty 's voting system .
can and should the document be rescued ?
readers gave their two cents . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i am totally opposed to any further extension of eu powers as proposed in the new treaty .
i therefore fully support poland in the stand taken on voting rights . - joseph wright , great britain if the eu wants to live in a false democratic state , then it should apply pressure .
however , if they want to leave in a truly democratic state , than the eu must adopt poland 's solution .
a basic and true fundamental principle of democracy is that the power must be divided equally along the partners . - jan , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kaczynski wants to change the treaty 's voting system as america formed its union with the acceptance of 9 of 13 states , the eu should consider forming the union with the acceptance of the constitution by 20 states , or some such majority .
one for all , all for one , is a very difficult formulation for the complexity of the constitution . - scott miller , us in my opinion , romano prodi is right .
the countries that want more integration should improve their relationship formally .
two blocks inside the eu - that is the answer . - gustavo araujo , uruguay the voting system related to population count in each of the eu countries would be fair only in the case of total integration of eu citizens .
this is not the case at the moment and there need to be some security for smaller nations .
the current system is giving much less voice to small countries .
poland is right that the system should be a compromise between interests of big countries like germany and small countries like the czech republic .
germany has the largest population and obviously the system merkel proposes is in germany 's interest . - jack , canada poland is a relatively new member within the eu , which was carried by france and germany .
when spain , for example , joined the eu , eu contributions initiated its economic recovery .
spain does n't have any problems regarding voting allocations .
poland should accept the present voting allocations and stop trying to scare europe with its veto power .
one should not ignore history .

artist peter friedl 's stuffed giraffe from kalkilya zoo in the west bank is garnering a lot of attention . her eyes are halfway shut and her coat looks worn like those of stuffed toys that have been played with for a very long time .
brownie the giraffe also looks a little small when compared to other specimens of its kind .
but the stuffed animal has still become the center of attention at the 12th documenta that opened in the central german city of kassel last weekend .
until five years ago , brownie was a favorite among visitors to kalkilya zoo in the west bank .
she died when the small town became the center of a military offensive and israeli troops attacked a hamas camp .
brownie panicked , ran into an iron rod , then fell to the floor and died of heart failure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sculpture has become a visitor magnet austrian artist peter friedl said he 's not interested in presenting the animal as a witness for the prosecution , nor does he intend to take a side .
instead , he 's aiming to add an aesthetic experience to the flood of pictures that can be found in the media .
" if you make the mistake of competing with media images by working in a documentary style , you 're bound to lose , " he said .
" fiction and documentation only produce clichés in this situation .
i was interested in asking : what happens when i bring the real thing with me ? "
tickling the imagination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter friedl but the example of the dead giraffe from palestine also stands for the overall concept of this year 's documenta .
" migrating forms " is the overarching theme of the exhibition .
it means that a picture , a sculpture or an installation does n't only change in a new environment , but also takes on new meaning .
the documenta is trying to give back images to visitors so they can trust their own imaginations again .
friedl said he views the giraffe as a sculpture that can and should help visitors invent stories to go along with it .
" they just have to let it happen , " he said .
" everyone comes with preconceived ideas .
you either know a giraffe or you think , ' it looks a little strange . '

european union leaders prepared wednesday for a key summit aimed at agreeing a mandate for a new treaty that reform certain eu rules .
but polish and british objections are still threatening to derail the talks . german chancellor angela merkel formally invited her fellow eu leaders to the brussels summit starting thursday , with the message that " only together will we succeed in resolving the issues before us . "
" the european public now expects us to put the necessary reforms of the union in hand , " she said .
" following our consultations over the last few months the time has now come to set out the roadmap for the impending reform of the treaties . "
however the polish position remains " unchanged , we have not seen any accommodation , " a spokesman for the german eu presidency said in berlin .
poland strongly objects to the voting system proposed by germany which will be discussed at the summit , aimed at working out the broad lines of a new treaty to replace the constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
warsaw believes " double majority " voting , under which agreement by 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the eu population would be required for new rules , would favor big states like germany .
bildunterschrift : merkel and barroso remain optimistic possibility of compromise ?
eu commission chief jose manuel barroso held an hour-long telephone conversation with polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski wednesday seeking a compromise .
after the talks , a polish spokesman said both men " see the possibility of compromise . "
he hinted that modifications , or a delay , to the double majority voting plan might be enough to persuade warsaw to get in line .
czech premier mirek topolanek , the only backer of the polish demand , meanwhile said wednesday that his country would not veto an agreement at the summit even if poland fails to get the requested changes included .
pressure from both sides britain , the other major opponent to some of merkel 's suggestions was still talking tough wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary margaret beckett " if it comes down to deal or no deal at this european council the uk government is clear ... no deal is better than buying any old pig in a poke , " foreign secretary margaret beckett said .

spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said he was sure the eu states could reach agreement on a new treaty but said he was " very worried " about british opposition to an eu-wide foreign policy .
at the other end of the spectrum , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker threatened to reject the new eu treaty if it did not correspond with crucial elements of the current proposal for a constitution , putting pressure on germany from another side .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary margaret beckett " if it comes down to deal or no deal at this european council the uk government is clear ... no deal is better than buying any old pig in a poke , " foreign secretary margaret beckett said .
british prime minister tony blair insists he will not cede national control over foreign policy , the judicial and police system or tax and social security rules , while refusing to give legal force to an eu charter of fundamental rights .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said he was sure the eu states could reach agreement on a new treaty but said he was " very worried " about british opposition to an eu-wide foreign policy .
at the other end of the spectrum , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker threatened to reject the new eu treaty if it did not correspond with crucial elements of the current proposal for a constitution , putting pressure on germany from another side .
germany 's draft germany , which holds the eu presidency until the end of the month , on tuesday handed its eu partners a draft mandate for the intergovernmental conference .
the draft scraps reference to the eu flag and anthem , items guaranteed to raise the hackles of euroskeptics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany does n't care what the document is called as long as it starts an eu reform process it also avoids some controversial terminology .
the new " reform treaty " would amend existing eu treaties rather than replace them .
the word " constitution " has been dropped .
germany insists on an eu " foreign minister , " but a new job title has to be agreed on .
this is unlikely to satisfy britain .
for britain , which also opposes more qualified majority voting in judicial matters , preferring instead unanimous decision-making , germany offered a clause for countries that choose not to participate .
the german draft also provides for national parliaments to be given up to eight weeks to examine draft laws , satisfying a demand by the netherlands .
any draft mandate for a treaty will then go to an intergovernmental conference , which official say is likely to start in july , for several months of discussion . dw staff based on wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her appointment will see her play a key role in shaping sarkozy 's ambitious and controversial reforms - and puts the number of women in the cabinet at a total of seven .
other women appointed include interior minister michele alliot-marie , culture minister christine albanel and higher education minister valerie pecresse . as justice minister , sarkozy 's campaign spokeswomen rachida dati becomes the first ethnic minority figure in a senior cabinet post . in further surprise moves , sarkozy added half a dozen junior ministers to the government , some of them also hailing from ethnic minorities and the left in line with his declared policy of " openness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rachida dati muslim feminist , fadela amara , became junior minister for urban affairs , and a senegalese-born woman rama yade , 30 , a junior minister for foreign affairs and human rights . former foreign minister michel barnier took over from lagarde as agriculture minister , while socialist senator jean-marie bockel was named junior minister for foreign assistance and francophony , bringing to three the number of leftists in foreign affairs . defying expectations sarkozy scored a political coup when he appointed prominent socialist bernard kouchner , the founder of doctors without borders , as foreign minister last month , confounding critics who had warned that he would concentrate power in a rightwing clique . most of the 15 senior ministers appointed last month after sarkozy defeated socialist segolene royal in the presidential election remained in their posts . sarkozy also named france rugby coach bernard laporte as sports minister , a post he will take up later this year following the world cup , saying his priority was to win the event . overall , cabinet positions were halved , while portfolios expanded .
slimming down the cabinet is part of sarkozy 's agenda to cut costs and increase government efficiency . sweeping reforms a special session of the newly-elected national assembly is to be convened next week to push through a first round of reforms , including tax breaks aimed at jump-starting the economy and lowering unemployment hovering at 8.2 percent , one of the highest in europe . one month after sarkozy took office promising sweeping reforms , his ump party won a national assembly majority in sunday 's vote , but it lost more than 40 seats while the opposition socialists made surprise gains . and in a symbolic blow to the government , juppe , a former prime minister and mayor of bordeaux , lost to a socialist and had to resign from the cabinet . sarkozy had brought him back from political exile after his conviction in a party finance scandal that had prevented him from holding public office for a year . despite the disappointment , prime minister francois fillon has insisted that the election delivered a " majority for action " and vowed to forge ahead with the reform programm . fillon said tuesday that he had not " shut the door " on a proposal to increase the value-added tax by up to 5 percent to help finance soaring health care costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal has her eye on her party 's top job the proposal was widely seen as having provided the opposition socialists with a boon during the final days of campaigning for the parliamentary elections . royal split many in the party were angered by segolene royal 's announcement sunday that she had split from her long-standing partner , socialist party leader francois hollande .
the french media has suggested that their troubled relationship undermined the party 's campaign , and speculation is now rife that royal is keen to take over from hollande as socialist leader . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european championships -pipe- 20.06.2007 lehmann 's arsenal fortunes could affect his status for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann has fought his way to the top of the german national team it took jens lehmann almost a decade to supplant ollie kahn as germany 's starting keeper .
but his reign between the posts might be short-lived if he fails to have success this year with the premiership side arsenal . jens lehmann was in bonn on tuesday to cement his place in german sports history .
the 37-year-old keeper was on hand as that city 's house of history museum received the page of notes he used to save two penalties in germany 's dramatic quarterfinal win over argentina in last year 's world cup . it was a moment of confirmation and satisfaction for a keeper who used to play second fiddle in his national side and who is germany 's clear number one ahead of the european soccer championship next year in austria and switzerland . but lehmann still has work to do , if he wants a chance to crown his career with an international title for germany .
to maintain his status in the national side , he first has to do the same with the club he plays for on a weekly basis , arsenal , who are coming off a year with no titles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann was a world cup hero against argentina " we had a very disappointing season , " lehmann acknowledged to dw-radio .
" normally we were always involved in the finals at the end of the season . " those sentiments have been seconded by arsenal fans , many of whom believe the club needs a major shake-up .
and some think the place to start is in goal . gooners having a go at " mad jens " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but he was a goat in the 2006 champions league final although lehmann anchored arsenal 's unprecedented unbeaten 2003-4 season in the premiership and led them to the champions league final in 2006 , club supporters are becoming increasingly critical of their number one .
indeed , some seem never to have forgiven him for picking up a red card in that final match against barcelona , which arsenal lost 2-1 . the german 's periodic bursts of temper have earned him the nicknames " mad jens " and " looney lehmann " from fans whose own mental stability is reflected by the fact that they refer to themselves as " gooners . " moreover , arsenal refused to offer lehmann anything more than a one-year contract in the off-season , and the club 's first signing this summer was polish keeper lukasz fabianski - hardly signs of abiding faith in lehmann 's abilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fabianski says he 's ready to challenge for lehmann 's arsenal job in the wake of that acquisition , some gooners have called for the german to be replaced .
" lehmann , " opined one blogger on the bbc 's website after the fabianski signing was announced , " has shown increasingly last season he can not be trusted to play for the team when he is distracting the defence with his stupid antics . " gunners fans also rushed to youtube to check out fabianski 's skills for themselves .
most were impressed , with one of them commenting , succinctly : " lehman out , fabianski in , come on arsenal . " last time around ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann will be 38 by the time euro 2008 begins gunners coach arsene wenger is unlikely to put much stock in the ranting of often hysterical fans , but he does want to win some silverware .
should lehmann make a couple of costly blunders early next season , wenger might decide to bench him in favor of fabianski or arsenal 's other backup , manuel almunia . if that hypothetical situation came to pass , it would be hard for german national coach joachim löw to justify starting lehmann ahead of germany 's host of other great keepers . there are also questions about lehmann 's age , with even the keeper himself unclear as to whether he will extend his career beyond 2008 .
" everybody 's spreading rumors , and i 'm doing the same , " lehmann told dw-radio , " so i really do n't know . " a year is a long time in soccer , as lehmann is obviously aware .
so while the arsenal keeper looks a good bet to be minding the posts for germany at the euro 2008 , he is not , by any means , a sure thing . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de players ' development crucial to german success , says lehmann after reaching third place in the 2006 world cup and progressing well in qualification for euro 2008 , germany 's young stars appear to have polished their shine .

a third of adults in wales suffer from at least one chronic condition - those which can not be cured - such as arthritis , diabetes or cystic fibrosis .
nhs wales director ann lloyd said about two thirds of people under 65 would develop such a condition at some point .
the world health organisation said they posed the greatest problem to health care systems in the 21st century .
" we do have this massive explosion of people who are going to be living longer with a chronic condition who need help and support , " mrs lloyd said . "
we have got to have a much bigger and better campaign to show individuals who have chronic diseases within the communities what they can do to help themselves " ann lloyd " they ca n't be cured , they have to be managed and they can be very difficult for people to live with . "
she said part of the solution was moving facilities into the community rather than at large traditional hospitals and treating people at home instead .
while current pilot treatments and new techniques had been successful , she said the system was currently too " bitty " .
" we need to give -lsb- patients -rsb- the confidence that they are going to get care in their own homes , or wherever it is most appropriate for them to receive care , " she added .
" this will allow them to take greater control over their lives and the way in which they can manage their own conditions . "
' greatest challenge ' powys community nurse , julie donnelly , said chronic conditions can affect virtually every aspect of the patient 's life .
" they 're not as mobile , they 're restricted in what they can eat , " she said .
" it is important to keep people at home and the greatest challenge is getting the resources to be able to keep them at home . "
however , ms lloyd 's calls for " fundamental change " may not be popular with campaign groups across wales , who have fought against hospital reorganisation plans .
earlier this month , first minister rhodri morgan called a temporary halt to changes to hospital services , a move which was cautiously welcomed by opposition politicians and campaigners .
but ms lloyd said : " we have got to have a much bigger and better campaign to show individuals who have chronic diseases what they can do to help themselves , and what alternatives we can now offer them , rather than just admitting them to a hospital .
" they will need assessment and treatment and management and an inpatient facility or a healthcare facility within their community might be the best place to provide that , but they do n't need to be there all the time . "
medical advances in the last 20 years , she explained , had been " fantastic " but that the health service be better at picking up on good practices and adopting them .

the world health organisation and the un children 's agency , unicef , say more needs to be done to inform parents of the risks of breast milk substitutes .
health experts at a conference in the philippines say breastfeeding is better for children 's health .
the practice leads to lowered child mortality rates , doctors say .
delegates to the conference in the philippines ' capital , manila , were told that in cambodia , where breastfeeding has been promoted , the child mortality rate has dramatically fallen .
' improved development ' in 2000 , one in 10 cambodian mothers were still breastfeeding their children when they were six months old .
five years later , the figure had grown to six out of 10 , says the bbc 's guy de launey in phnom penh , cambodia .
the comparable figure across asia is 35 % , says the who .
the average family in the developing world , they do n't breast feed because they think bottle feeding is better karen codling , unicef the child mortality rate in cambodia dropped by a third in the same period and the who believes breastfeeding is largely to credit .
" it 's not just a matter of cost - it 's a matter of survival for infants in developing countries , " dr chessa lutter from the who told the bbc .
infants born into conditions of poverty where there is not the access to clean water and adequate sanitation to safely feed infants formula milk , benefit from breastfeeding , she said .
children in developed countries who are breastfed benefit too .
they " have better cognitive development " and lower risk of type 2 diabetes , dr lutter added .
our correspondent says large billboards depicting a nursing mother and baby are a common sight in towns and rural areas in cambodia and local authorities have created breastfeeding-friendly sites in villages .
the health experts meeting in manila want the rest of the region to follow cambodia 's example .
they say more needs to be done to counter the marketing campaigns of makers of infant formula milk .
" the average family in the developing world , they do n't breast feed because they think bottle feeding is better , " said karen codling , a regional nutrition specialist at unicef 's asia-pacific office .
an association of milk formula companies in the philippines has launched a legal challenge against a strict marketing code imposed on the industry last year .

the davies family , from nantyglo near brynmawr , were rocked eight years ago when mother trish was diagnosed with alzheimer 's disease at the age of 35 .
now 43 , mrs davies said in the months before the diagnosis , she had been getting severe headaches and pains and that she used to forget simple things .
" they put it down to sleep deprivation and depression but i have been depressed before and it did n't feel the same , " she said .
" to be perfectly honest , i thought i had a brain tumour - and there is epilepsy in the family - i thought i might be having fits in my sleep . "
her husband kelvin , 57 , said he had started noticing that his wife failed to keep up with anything new and began watching old episodes of shows that had been very familiar to her .
the family use a diary to keep a regular routine " it was not my wife at all - she was n't behaving normally , " he said .
he said it took three years to get a diagnosis , after an mri scan revealed she had suffered a series of minor strokes .

" i think there were problems with doctors accepting that someone that young could have dementia , " he added .
daughter chamelle said that she and her sister jadee-lee had noticed their mother seemed to be " forgetting quite a lot " .
" she used to do a lot of singing , but her mind started blanking out , and she would get a bit angry , but it was at herself as she did n't know what was happening . "

' close family ' " my symptoms did n't change , but it is nice it has a name and that i was n't going mad , " she said .

mr davies said it had completely changed his life .
" i am a full-time carer - i am like a domestic mum and i am dad to two kids .
i run the house and all the day-to-day stuff . "
" it is hard at times .
we have a very strong relationship - my wife is my soul-mate and there is plenty of laughter .
" i see her getting frustrated - she can forget what she is saying .
it can be like a child taking a first step , but you know she is n't going to get any better .
" it can be emotionally draining but it is not like that for 24 hours . "
" sometimes , we have a normal conversation , but an hour later , that conversation had never taken place - she would say we have n't spoken about it . "
' very organised ' he added that his wife 's condition appears to move in stages .
" she can move along steadily , but might overnight have a minor stroke and take a step down , but then there is a plateau , but a bit lower than she was before . "
he said the couple had been very honest with his wife 's two children from a previous relationship .
in their bid to keep their life organised , the family now use a special diary that they use " for everything " .
" we try and go out visiting some of the family - it is very organised .

about 9m people of all different ages in the uk have one of the 200 forms of arthritis - an inflammation of the joints .
many have severe pain every day , and often experience a loss of mobility and extreme fatigue .
peter johnson , 48 , from llanarth in ceredigion , was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis when he was 22 .
" rheumatoid is an inflammatory disease of the joints , which can lead to joint damage , " he explained .
" for me , it is the inflammation that is the most painful - it flares up - it is not a constant pain and occurs for different joints at different times .
" when i was young , i used to get hugely swollen knees then it spread to my feet , shoulders , elbows , neck , jaw - all swelling , with pain and heat . "
at first i could continue working , but then i had to leave jobs as the illness was getting worse " " at first i could continue working , but then i had to leave jobs as the illness was getting worse .
i was out of work for 10 years .
" at that time , i was single and living on my own in a cold flat - there was an income problem . "
he said being diagnosed had changed things as it meant he could get some treatment , through an exercise programme and physiotherapy .
but he said there was no social support , which meant he struggled to deal with the condition .
' stared at ' " i needed a stick in my 20s , once i could face using it , " he said .
" it marks you out and sometimes i did n't use it when i should have , because i did n't want to be stared at .
" people think arthritis is an older person 's condition and are constantly quizzing you about it , which has a major impact when you are young .
" i still get that now , but i do n't care any more . "
mr johnson said he had had to rediscover " a whole bunch of interests " because of his arthritis .
" my main past-times were cycling and fell-walking and both of those had to go , " he said .
" it was very depressing and makes you feel there is nothing left .
feeling valuable is important and this can make you feel like you 're not . "
he said meeting other people with arthritis had helped him with the condition 's social impact .
" chatting it through is very liberating , and there were people just like me - i was not treated like a specimen , " he said .
" i have now picked up new hobbies , like it and computers and reading . "
after struggling with the condition in his 20s , mr johnson 's arthritis went into remission when he was in his 30s and he met gloria , who would become his wife , which gave him " more of a motivation to do something " about the disease .
he said he started thinking about his personal experiences and subjects like disability access , and started doing some volunteer work .
" you start to realise the issues and there was a drive not to let that happen to other people , " he said . "
mentally , it 's not as bad as when i was in my 20s as i can handle it most days - i can put it in its place . "
" it gave me value again and helped me realise that paid work was an option again . "
however , the arthritis returned when he reached his 40s and he said he was currently seeing a rheumatologist in pembrokeshire and had begun taking a new drug treatment .
" now my hips have worn out and i have problems with my wrists and elbows , " he said .
" but mentally , it 's not as bad as when i was in my 20s as i can handle it most days - i can put it in its place . "
and he said it had not affected his relationship as it had been " a known factor " when he and his wife had married .
mr johnson now works for arthritis care , which gives him the flexibility to work from home if he needs to because of his condition and he advises anyone who is diagnosed with arthritis to be " challenging with healthcare professionals " .
" be very clear on what you want to know and get information from sources that you trust , " he said .
" meet other people and talk to them and ask the awkward questions to your doctor . "

about 9m people of all different ages in the uk have one of the 200 forms of arthritis - an inflammation of the joints .
many have severe pain every day , and often experience a loss of mobility and extreme fatigue .
peter johnson , 48 , from llanarth in ceredigion , was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis when he was 22 .
" rheumatoid is an inflammatory disease of the joints , which can lead to joint damage , " he explained .
" for me , it is the inflammation that is the most painful - it flares up - it is not a constant pain and occurs for different joints at different times .
" when i was young , i used to get hugely swollen knees then it spread to my feet , shoulders , elbows , neck , jaw - all swelling , with pain and heat .

i was out of work for 10 years .

he said being diagnosed had changed things as it meant he could get some treatment , through an exercise programme and physiotherapy .
but he said there was no social support , which meant he struggled to deal with the condition .
' stared at ' " i needed a stick in my 20s , once i could face using it , " he said .

mr johnson said he had had to rediscover " a whole bunch of interests " because of his arthritis .
" my main past-times were cycling and fell-walking and both of those had to go , " he said .
" it was very depressing and makes you feel there is nothing left .

peter johnson speaking at an arthritis care volunteer event he said meeting other people with arthritis had helped him with the condition 's social impact .
" chatting it through is very liberating , and there were people just like me - i was not treated like a specimen , " he said .
" i have now picked up new hobbies , like it and computers and reading . "
after struggling with the condition in his 20s , mr johnson 's arthritis went into remission when he was in his 30s and he met gloria , who would become his wife , which gave him " more of a motivation to do something " about the disease .
he said he started thinking about his personal experiences and subjects like disability access , and started doing some volunteer work .

however , the arthritis returned when he reached his 40s and he said he was currently seeing a rheumatologist in pembrokeshire and had begun taking a new drug treatment .

y byd -lrb- the world -rrb- will be published on the first monday of march says the company behind it , dyddiol cyf .
editor aled price said initially they wanted to get 5,000 subscribers for the paper , which will cover welsh , uk and international news .
one expert in welsh journalism said the launch of the daily paper was both ambitious and historic .
previous anticipated launch dates have come and gone , but £ 300,000 worth of subscriptions have now been received , and staff are currently being taken on .
the paper will be given business grant aid by the welsh assembly government and powys county council .
mr price , a former bbc wales journalist from cardiff , was appointed editor in november 2006 and said 12 full-time journalists would be employed in addition to columnists and freelancers .
" y byd will revolutionise journalism in welsh .
for the first time wales will have a national daily newspaper in welsh , " he said .
" it will be a complete newspaper - incorporating sport , leisure , business and politics . "
y byd 's headquarters will be in machynlleth , powys , where the team will produce the paper and a website .
llion iwan , a journalism lecturer at the creative industries department in university wales , bangor believed the paper 's launch would be a milestone .
" historically in wales , we have not had a national paper because there have been practical problems .
conservative market " there have been difficulties in the way papers are distributed and also in the way the population is distributed .
" and over the last 10 years , and especially over the last three years , the newspaper market in britain is declining .
only the financial times is holding its ground .
" it 's a traditional and conservative market .
initially people might buy both y byd and their usual paper , but it will have to compete with them , " mr iwan said .
y byd will sell for 70p on monday to thursday and £ 1.20 on friday , which will include a weekend supplement .
according to mr price , y byd 's website will also be central to the scheme .
" a lively website will also be central to the enterprise as y byd breaks new ground with a live online newspaper , " he said .
the chairman of the company , ned thomas , said : " the promotion of the welsh economy is a priority for the newspaper .
" we will also continue talks with political parties in the national assembly urging them to build on promises made during the recent election campaign to help establish a daily newspaper based on firm foundations in accordance with the expectations of the council of europe . "
according to its website , the paper will have about 24 pages , almost certainly in two sections .
one section will concentrate on news , and the other will be dedicated to a particular theme each day , such as education , sport , rural life , the economy , culture .
it will be distributed throughout wales as well as to larger population centres in england .

for the first time wales will have a national daily newspaper in welsh , " he said .
" it will be a complete newspaper - incorporating sport , leisure , business and politics . "
y byd 's headquarters will be in machynlleth , powys , where the team will produce the paper and a website .
llion iwan , a journalism lecturer at the creative industries department in university wales , bangor believed the paper 's launch would be a milestone .
" historically in wales , we have not had a national paper because there have been practical problems .
conservative market " there have been difficulties in the way papers are distributed and also in the way the population is distributed .
" and over the last 10 years , and especially over the last three years , the newspaper market in britain is declining .
only the financial times is holding its ground .
" it 's a traditional and conservative market .
initially people might buy both y byd and their usual paper , but it will have to compete with them , " mr iwan said .
y byd will sell for 70p on monday to thursday and £ 1.20 on friday , which will include a weekend supplement .
according to mr price , y byd 's website will also be central to the scheme .
" a lively website will also be central to the enterprise as y byd breaks new ground with a live online newspaper , " he said .
the chairman of the company , ned thomas , said : " the promotion of the welsh economy is a priority for the newspaper .
" we will also continue talks with political parties in the national assembly urging them to build on promises made during the recent election campaign to help establish a daily newspaper based on firm foundations in accordance with the expectations of the council of europe . "
according to its website , the paper will have about 24 pages , almost certainly in two sections .
one section will concentrate on news , and the other will be dedicated to a particular theme each day , such as education , sport , rural life , the economy , culture .
it will be distributed throughout wales as well as to larger population centres in england .

rick costello * , who was 52 , had cancer of the pancreas and lungs .
he died at home in nottingham on monday .
rick , a father of three , first emailed bbc five live before christmas when the family were strugging to pay their fuel bills .
his wife had given up work to care for him and they were receiving disability living allowance and carers allowance .
he , along with thousands of others , had their fuel bills paid by the charity macmillan cancer support .
doctors had told him his life expectancy was between four and six months .
challenged the government when he appeared on air he challenged the government to meet him to talk about the winter fuel allowance - the annual payment made to everyone over 60 to help pay gas and electricity bills . "
he was a brave and articulate man who wanted his legacy to be that he had tried to change things for the better for others " rick felt the policy should be changed to include those who were critically or terminally ill .
the government , he said , had made " dying hard work " for him .
rick and his wife went to meet senior ministers and politicians at westminster in january , accompanied by nicky campbell .
by then he was weaker , but still fighting .
he talked to menzies campbell , leader of the liberal democrats , who has also had cancer in the past , labour 's ann mcguire , who heads up the department of work and pensions and phillip hammond , her counterpart for the conservatives .
the issue of winter fuel payments for the seriously ill was also raised at prime minister 's questions .
hard to cope the government always insisted that the benefits system was designed to help people in rick 's position , but he felt that even with the benefits it was hard to meet the rising costs of fuel .
he argued that cancer , and other diseases lead to weight loss and the sufferer feeling cold nearly all the time .
macmillan cancer support say they paid out £ 1.4 million to nearly 8,000 people in fuel grants in 2006 .
so far this year they have already given grants to more than 4,000 people , at a cost of £ 815,000 .
the charity backed rick 's appeals , saying that many people with cancer are caught in a poverty trap which means they can not pay household expenses .
following his appearance on five live , rick was offered money by listeners and organisations who had heard him speak .
he declined all offers , saying and the money was donated to macmillan cancer support .
campaigned to his death he continued to have conversations with politicians about the issue right up to his death with the liberal democrats and the conservatives showing particular interest in his views .
last week , when he knew he only had a few days to live , he asked to record a final interview .
in it , he says he would like the campaign to go on even after his death , and says that having to ask a charity to pay fuel bills is not right in 2007 .
by january he had given up the palliative chemotherapy because it was so painful but he eventually passed away painlessly at home with his family on monday .
when we first met , rick told me the doctors had told him he would not " live to see the daffodils . "
he said he wanted to not only see spring , but survive until the summer as well so he could sit in the garden and feel the sun on his face .
he achieved that aim .
from a personal point of view , he was a brave and articulate man who wanted his legacy to be that he had tried to change things for the better for others .
it was a privilege to have met him . * rick costello was not his real name .
he felt that his dying was hard enough for his family to bear , without them all being thrust into the glare of publicity .

rick , a father of three , first emailed bbc five live before christmas when the family were strugging to pay their fuel bills .
his wife had given up work to care for him and they were receiving disability living allowance and carers allowance .
he , along with thousands of others , had their fuel bills paid by the charity macmillan cancer support .

challenged the government when he appeared on air he challenged the government to meet him to talk about the winter fuel allowance - the annual payment made to everyone over 60 to help pay gas and electricity bills .
he was a brave and articulate man who wanted his legacy to be that he had tried to change things for the better for others rick felt the policy should be changed to include those who were critically or terminally ill .
the government , he said , had made " dying hard work " for him .
rick and his wife went to meet senior ministers and politicians at westminster in january , accompanied by nicky campbell .
by then he was weaker , but still fighting .
he talked to menzies campbell , leader of the liberal democrats , who has also had cancer in the past , labour 's ann mcguire , who heads up the department of work and pensions and phillip hammond , her counterpart for the conservatives .
the issue of winter fuel payments for the seriously ill was also raised at prime minister 's questions .

he argued that cancer , and other diseases lead to weight loss and the sufferer feeling cold nearly all the time .
macmillan cancer support say they paid out £ 1.4 million to nearly 8,000 people in fuel grants in 2006 .
so far this year they have already given grants to more than 4,000 people , at a cost of £ 815,000 .
the charity backed rick 's appeals , saying that many people with cancer are caught in a poverty trap which means they can not pay household expenses .

by january he had given up the palliative chemotherapy because it was so painful but he eventually passed away painlessly at home with his family on monday .
when we first met , rick told me the doctors had told him he would not " live to see the daffodils . "
he said he wanted to not only see spring , but survive until the summer as well so he could sit in the garden and feel the sun on his face .

the painting , which had been expected to sell for £ 15m , was seen as one of the finest of monet 's water lily series to have come on to the market .

the masterpiece , which had not been seen in public since 1936 , was bought by an anonymous american bidder over the phone .
art expert bobby read said the sale showed there was currently a " buzz " in the london art scene .
matisse 's danseuse dans le fauteuil set a sales record " it is unsurprising that this piece by monet sold at such a high price .
it is an exceptional example of his water lily series which is one of the most iconic images of impressionism .
" our figures show that modern art has rocketed in value in the last year . "
the auction also featured works by pablo picasso , amedeo modigliani and pierre-auguste renoir .
a painting by henri matisse set a new auction record for the artist .
