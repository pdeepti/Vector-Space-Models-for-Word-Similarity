" as the league leaders looked back on a disasterous 2-1 defeat on friday which cut their lead to two points . virtually six years ago to the day on april 28 , 200 , schalke were in a similar position ahead of their fourth-from-last match as they had a two-point lead over bayern munich .
schalke 's draw in bochum at the time saw bayern draw level on points and a further defeat in stuttgart eventually led to schalke losing the championship on the final day of the season .
the only schalke player who played in that game , gerald asamoah , said earlier this week that it remained a painful memory .
" we lost the championship in bochum six years ago . "
the schalke fans must have been able to almost taste the ominous sense of history repeating as goals by zvjezdan misimovic and theofanis gekas gave relegation-troubled bochum a come-back victory after kevin kuranyi had put schalke ahead early in the game .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi 's opener was not enough in the end the defeat keeps schalke on 62 points , two more than werder bremen and four more than vfb stuttgart , although both have a game in hand .
bremen can move ahead of schalke on sunday with a victory at arminia bielefeld , while stuttgart have a chance of moving within a point of the leaders if they win at bottom club borussia mönchengladbach .
slomka blames ref for defeat schalke coach mirko slomka criticised the referee after the game saying that he had failed to give his side two penalties .
" it is a pity that a game and possibly even more is decided in such a manner , " the usually pragmatic coach said after the game .
" we no longer have it in our own hands .
i am no longer 100 per cent sure that we will win the championship , " he added .
a capacity crowd watching the ruhr derby on friday witnessed the league leaders having the best possible start when germany striker kuranyi headed them in front in the eighth minute from a freekick played into the area by christian pander .
a short while later asamoah could have put schalke two goals ahead , but his well-taken shot was brilliantly saved by czech goalkeeper jaroslav drobny .

worse was to follow as bundesliga top scorer gekas scored his 19th goal of the season four minutes from the break after being found by a cross from marcel maltritz .
schalke pushed forward in the second half in search of an equalizer as coach slomka brought on forwards halil altintop and soren larsen , as well as offensive midfielder levan kobiashvili .
kuranyi came close with a header against the upright in the 69th minute and they had a confident penalty appeal turned down a short while later .

" as the league leaders looked back on a disasterous 2-1 defeat on friday which cut their lead to two points . virtually six years ago to the day on april 28 , 200 , schalke were in a similar position ahead of their fourth-from-last match as they had a two-point lead over bayern munich .
schalke 's draw in bochum at the time saw bayern draw level on points and a further defeat in stuttgart eventually led to schalke losing the championship on the final day of the season .
the only schalke player who played in that game , gerald asamoah , said earlier this week that it remained a painful memory .
" we lost the championship in bochum six years ago . "
the schalke fans must have been able to almost taste the ominous sense of history repeating as goals by zvjezdan misimovic and theofanis gekas gave relegation-troubled bochum a come-back victory after kevin kuranyi had put schalke ahead early in the game .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi 's opener was not enough in the end the defeat keeps schalke on 62 points , two more than werder bremen and four more than vfb stuttgart , although both have a game in hand .
bremen can move ahead of schalke on sunday with a victory at arminia bielefeld , while stuttgart have a chance of moving within a point of the leaders if they win at bottom club borussia mönchengladbach .
slomka blames ref for defeat schalke coach mirko slomka criticised the referee after the game saying that he had failed to give his side two penalties .
" it is a pity that a game and possibly even more is decided in such a manner , " the usually pragmatic coach said after the game .
" we no longer have it in our own hands .
i am no longer 100 per cent sure that we will win the championship , " he added .
a capacity crowd watching the ruhr derby on friday witnessed the league leaders having the best possible start when germany striker kuranyi headed them in front in the eighth minute from a freekick played into the area by christian pander .
a short while later asamoah could have put schalke two goals ahead , but his well-taken shot was brilliantly saved by czech goalkeeper jaroslav drobny .

worse was to follow as bundesliga top scorer gekas scored his 19th goal of the season four minutes from the break after being found by a cross from marcel maltritz .
schalke pushed forward in the second half in search of an equalizer as coach slomka brought on forwards halil altintop and soren larsen , as well as offensive midfielder levan kobiashvili .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 28.04.2007 eu warns turkish army about meddling in presidential elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army sees itself as the guardian of the country 's secular system the european union warned the turkish army on saturday not to interfere in the country 's democratic process amid a dispute over the ruling party 's islamist-rooted candidate to be turkey 's next president . " it is important that the military leaves the remit of democracy to the democratically elected government , " eu enlargement commissioner , ollie rehn , said in a statement .
his comments follows an army warning issued on friday that the military would defend turkey 's secularist system after parliament failed to approve the ruling party 's candidate for president .
" this is a test case if the turkish armed forces respect democratic secularism and the democratic arrangement of civil-military relations , " rehn said .
in friday 's first round of voting , the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- candidate , abdullah gul , narrowly failed to win .
gul , who is also foreign minister , secured 357 votes - just 10 short of the 367 , or two thirds of all deputies needed to win in the first round .
the main secular opposition party boycotted the vote and said it would challenge the election in court .
army blames akp for rising anti-secularism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army has led three coups since 1960 in its statement released late friday , the military accused the akp , the offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , of failing to prevent rising anti-secular activity in the country .
the turkish army , responsible for three past coups , warned that it is determined to defend the country 's secular system .
" the problem that recently came to the forefront of the presidential election process has focused on the issue of questioning secularism .
the turkish armed forces are observing this situation with concern , " the army said .
" the turkish armed forces ... will openly and clearly display their position and attitude when necessary .
no one should doubt this , " it warned .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has yet to respond to the army statement .
the akp 's nomination of gul has fanned unease in an increasingly polarised society where many fear the secular order is under threat from a growing islamist influence .
many suspect akp of an islamist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , left , with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan many are unconvinced by the akp 's arguments that it has disawoved its islamist past and fear the government will have a free hand to implement a suspected islamist agenda that will erode the separation of state and religion if gul is elected .
the turkish armed forces , which see themselves as the guardians of the secular system , seized power in 1960 , 1971 and 1980 and forced the resignation in 1997 of the country 's first islamist prime minister , necmettin erbakan .
the main opposition republican people 's party , which strongly opposes the idea of a former islamist becoming president , on friday evening petitioned the constitutional court to cancel the first round of voting , citing violation of a quorum rule .
if the court annuls the vote , general elections - originally scheduled for november 4 - must be called within 90 days .
if the constitutional court does not cancel the vote , parliament will hold a second round on wednesday , probably with a similar result , but gul is virtually certain to be elected in the third round on may 9 , when an absolute majority of 276 will suffice .
turkish media takes army threat seriously bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media says fast poiltical action will negate the army 's fears the turkish press on saturday urged the government to call early elections to prevent it from plunging into a deep crisis .

" it is important that the military leaves the remit of democracy to the democratically elected government , " eu enlargement commissioner , ollie rehn , said in a statement .
his comments follows an army warning issued on friday that the military would defend turkey 's secularist system after parliament failed to approve the ruling party 's candidate for president .
" this is a test case if the turkish armed forces respect democratic secularism and the democratic arrangement of civil-military relations , " rehn said .
in friday 's first round of voting , the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- candidate , abdullah gul , narrowly failed to win .
gul , who is also foreign minister , secured 357 votes - just 10 short of the 367 , or two thirds of all deputies needed to win in the first round .
the main secular opposition party boycotted the vote and said it would challenge the election in court .

the turkish army , responsible for three past coups , warned that it is determined to defend the country 's secular system .

prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has yet to respond to the army statement .

the turkish armed forces , which see themselves as the guardians of the secular system , seized power in 1960 , 1971 and 1980 and forced the resignation in 1997 of the country 's first islamist prime minister , necmettin erbakan .
the main opposition republican people 's party , which strongly opposes the idea of a former islamist becoming president , on friday evening petitioned the constitutional court to cancel the first round of voting , citing violation of a quorum rule .
if the court annuls the vote , general elections - originally scheduled for november 4 - must be called within 90 days .

" the quickest way to save turkey and its future is to convene parliament at once , hold elections as speedily as possible and prove to the world that turkey is mature enough to resolve its problems democratically , " it said .
many commentators accused prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's akp of raising tensions and not seeking a consensus with the opposition on the choice for the presidency , which is a non-partisan office , but relying on his comfortable parliamentary majority to have his way .
erdogan 's detractors accuse him of abusing his nearly two-thirds parliamentary majority garnered with only one third of the vote in the 2002 vote - thanks to turkey 's much-criticized electoral system - to put an islamist in the presidency seen as the last bastion of secularism in turkey .

" it is important that the military leaves the remit of democracy to the democratically elected government , " eu enlargement commissioner , ollie rehn , said in a statement .
his comments follows an army warning issued on friday that the military would defend turkey 's secularist system after parliament failed to approve the ruling party 's candidate for president .
" this is a test case if the turkish armed forces respect democratic secularism and the democratic arrangement of civil-military relations , " rehn said .
in friday 's first round of voting , the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- candidate , abdullah gul , narrowly failed to win .
gul , who is also foreign minister , secured 357 votes - just 10 short of the 367 , or two thirds of all deputies needed to win in the first round .
the main secular opposition party boycotted the vote and said it would challenge the election in court .
army blames akp for rising anti-secularism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army has led three coups since 1960 in its statement released late friday , the military accused the akp , the offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , of failing to prevent rising anti-secular activity in the country .
the turkish army , responsible for three past coups , warned that it is determined to defend the country 's secular system .
" the problem that recently came to the forefront of the presidential election process has focused on the issue of questioning secularism .
the turkish armed forces are observing this situation with concern , " the army said .
" the turkish armed forces ... will openly and clearly display their position and attitude when necessary .
no one should doubt this , " it warned .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has yet to respond to the army statement .
the akp 's nomination of gul has fanned unease in an increasingly polarised society where many fear the secular order is under threat from a growing islamist influence .
many suspect akp of an islamist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , left , with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan many are unconvinced by the akp 's arguments that it has disawoved its islamist past and fear the government will have a free hand to implement a suspected islamist agenda that will erode the separation of state and religion if gul is elected .
the turkish armed forces , which see themselves as the guardians of the secular system , seized power in 1960 , 1971 and 1980 and forced the resignation in 1997 of the country 's first islamist prime minister , necmettin erbakan .
the main opposition republican people 's party , which strongly opposes the idea of a former islamist becoming president , on friday evening petitioned the constitutional court to cancel the first round of voting , citing violation of a quorum rule .
if the court annuls the vote , general elections - originally scheduled for november 4 - must be called within 90 days .
if the constitutional court does not cancel the vote , parliament will hold a second round on wednesday , probably with a similar result , but gul is virtually certain to be elected in the third round on may 9 , when an absolute majority of 276 will suffice .

the two leaders had also discussed putin 's warning , issued to the russian parliament thursday , that russia would declare a moratorium on the 1990 conventional forces in europe treaty , if the us did not back down on the missile shield .
merkel and putin both attached great significance to relations between the european union and russia , the spokesman said .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has adopted a moderate tone in the controversy , pressing the case for the stationing of interceptor missiles in poland along with a radar station in the czech republic to be taken up at nato level .
the us initially preferred bilateral arrangements with poland and the czech republic .
steinmeier 's position came in for criticism from conservative members of merkel 's broad coalition , who urged a stronger line against russia .
the government spokesman said merkel had discussed a range of issues with putin , including the situation in ukraine and the eu- russian summit may 17-18 .
germany currently holds the eu presidency .
putin expresses russian anger at estonian riots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots have been raging in tallinn since thursday night the chancellor also breached the topic of the escalating unrest in estonia , which reached a deadly peak saturday when a russian national was killed in the estonian capital during unrest sparked by the removal of a soviet-era war memorial .
a surge in anti-estonian sentiment was in evidence on the streets of moscow and other russian cities with protestors out in force , newspapers voicing outrage and shoppers boycotting goods from their baltic neighbour .
putin had voiced " serious concern " over the events in tallinn during the telephone conversation with gmerkel , a kremlin spokeswoman said .
violence over monument leads to a russian death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statue was removed under cover of darkness early friday the row over the removal of a soviet war memorial from tallinn 's centre erupted in riots that began there last thursday , leading to 900 arrests and the death of a russian citizen identified by officials only as dmitri .
estonians see the bronze memorial as a symbol of 50 years of soviet occupation following world war ii .
the estonian authorities removed the statue from the center of tallinn early friday after the first night of rioting , in which dmitri was killed .
the german government statement saturday said merkel had urged both putin and estonian prime minister andrus ansip to keep a lid on the row by showing restraint and restoring parliamentary contacts as soon as possible .
the german government had suggested that the parliaments of the two countries should engage in direct contact over the conflict regarding the removal of the soviet war memorial , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said .
demonstrators target estonian consulate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian and russian protestors clashed with each other and police but at the estonian consulate in moscow about 150 members of two pro-kremlin youth groups protested for a second day , chanting : " fascism will not win ! "
ria novosti news agency quoted a spokesman at the estonian consulate in moscow , franek persidski , as saying the consulate had temporarily ceased operations because of safety concerns .
in saint petersburg another 100 activists demonstrated outside the estonian consulate , city police said .
in the city of pskov , 20 kilometres -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- east of russia 's border with estonia , several dozen protesters brought an empty coffin to the estonian consulate , ria novosti reported .
they were stopped by police while attempting to unfurl a banner reading : " a spike in the head for the fascist beast , then the grave ! "
amid calls for retaliation against estonia , moscow mayor yury luzhkov urged " russian state and municipal organizations to freeze all forms of financial , economic , business and cultural cooperation with estonian state organizations , " ria-novosti reported .
embargo planned on estonian goods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the violence continues , russia takes steps against estonia the interfax news agency quoted the management of three major supermarket chains as saying they would no longer sell estonian goods .
" we are against the removal of the soldier-liberator in tallinn and consider such actions inadmissible , " interfax quoted a spokesman for the sedmoi kontinent supermarket chain as saying .
" in the next 48 hours all goods of estonian origin will be removed from the assortment of products offered by our shops , " the spokesman said .
newspapers also voiced their indignation .
" we are finally convinced .

the two leaders had also discussed putin 's warning , issued to the russian parliament thursday , that russia would declare a moratorium on the 1990 conventional forces in europe treaty , if the us did not back down on the missile shield .
merkel and putin both attached great significance to relations between the european union and russia , the spokesman said .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has adopted a moderate tone in the controversy , pressing the case for the stationing of interceptor missiles in poland along with a radar station in the czech republic to be taken up at nato level .
the us initially preferred bilateral arrangements with poland and the czech republic .
steinmeier 's position came in for criticism from conservative members of merkel 's broad coalition , who urged a stronger line against russia .
the government spokesman said merkel had discussed a range of issues with putin , including the situation in ukraine and the eu- russian summit may 17-18 .
germany currently holds the eu presidency .
putin expresses russian anger at estonian riots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots have been raging in tallinn since thursday night the chancellor also breached the topic of the escalating unrest in estonia , which reached a deadly peak saturday when a russian national was killed in the estonian capital during unrest sparked by the removal of a soviet-era war memorial .
a surge in anti-estonian sentiment was in evidence on the streets of moscow and other russian cities with protestors out in force , newspapers voicing outrage and shoppers boycotting goods from their baltic neighbour .
putin had voiced " serious concern " over the events in tallinn during the telephone conversation with gmerkel , a kremlin spokeswoman said .
violence over monument leads to a russian death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statue was removed under cover of darkness early friday the row over the removal of a soviet war memorial from tallinn 's centre erupted in riots that began there last thursday , leading to 900 arrests and the death of a russian citizen identified by officials only as dmitri .
estonians see the bronze memorial as a symbol of 50 years of soviet occupation following world war ii .
the estonian authorities removed the statue from the center of tallinn early friday after the first night of rioting , in which dmitri was killed .
the german government statement saturday said merkel had urged both putin and estonian prime minister andrus ansip to keep a lid on the row by showing restraint and restoring parliamentary contacts as soon as possible .
the german government had suggested that the parliaments of the two countries should engage in direct contact over the conflict regarding the removal of the soviet war memorial , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said .
demonstrators target estonian consulate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian and russian protestors clashed with each other and police but at the estonian consulate in moscow about 150 members of two pro-kremlin youth groups protested for a second day , chanting : " fascism will not win ! "
ria novosti news agency quoted a spokesman at the estonian consulate in moscow , franek persidski , as saying the consulate had temporarily ceased operations because of safety concerns .
in saint petersburg another 100 activists demonstrated outside the estonian consulate , city police said .
in the city of pskov , 20 kilometres -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- east of russia 's border with estonia , several dozen protesters brought an empty coffin to the estonian consulate , ria novosti reported .
they were stopped by police while attempting to unfurl a banner reading : " a spike in the head for the fascist beast , then the grave ! "
amid calls for retaliation against estonia , moscow mayor yury luzhkov urged " russian state and municipal organizations to freeze all forms of financial , economic , business and cultural cooperation with estonian state organizations , " ria-novosti reported .
embargo planned on estonian goods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the violence continues , russia takes steps against estonia the interfax news agency quoted the management of three major supermarket chains as saying they would no longer sell estonian goods .
" we are against the removal of the soldier-liberator in tallinn and consider such actions inadmissible , " interfax quoted a spokesman for the sedmoi kontinent supermarket chain as saying .
" in the next 48 hours all goods of estonian origin will be removed from the assortment of products offered by our shops , " the spokesman said .
newspapers also voiced their indignation .
" we are finally convinced .
estonia is a fascist state , " thundered the moskovsky kosmolets tabloid , which in its headline used a stylized " ss " symbol in place of the letter " s " in the word estonia .
the row marks a new low in relations between the countries , which have not seen eye-to-eye since the soviet union 's 1991 collapse and the restoration of estonia 's independence .
many russians consider the statue in tallinn to be a poignant memorial to the huge losses suffered by the soviet union in defeating nazism and have complained at the status of ethnic russians in estonia , alleging discrimination . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato calls for clarification as putin raises missile stakes nato called for russia to clarify whether it has actually frozen its application of a key arms treaty limiting the number of military forces in europe as president putin warned of an increase in the nuclear threat .

" i think that at this point in time to have also the usa open a channel of communication with iran would be worth thinking about ... on everything , " said solana .
he and larijani held talks in ankara on wednesday and thursday .
" we have to see how much the usa are ready to engage , " he said .
these were their first face-to-face meetings since the un security council imposed a second round of limited sanctions on iran in march over tehran 's refusal to halt uranium enrichment .
more talks are scheduled in two weeks .
solana , in his talks with larijani , represented the five permanent members of the security council plus germany .
he said on friday that the talks were " constructive conversations . "
all sides need to be tenacious , says solana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani came to berlin for talks with the eu in september " they were constructive in the sense that it was some potential motion that we have to see if we can exploit in a next meeting we 'll have in about ten days , " he said .
" i do n't want to say at all that the difficulties are overcome , we have many important hurdles that have to be overcome , but we have to be tenacious . "
asked whether larijani and iran 's supreme leader ali khamenei were ready to speak to the united states , based on his conversations with larijani , solana replied : " i say without any hesitation , yes . "
solana was speaking friday after a brussels forum organised by the german marshall fund of the united states .

washington , which broke off diplomatic relations with iran in 1980 , accuses iran of wanting to develop nuclear weapons - which tehran denies - and of supporting insurgents in iraq .
rice may meet iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki at a conference on security in iraq in egypt on may 3-4 but iran has yet to confirm whether it will attend .

" it is important that the military leaves the remit of democracy to the democratically elected government , " eu enlargement commissioner , ollie rehn , said in a statement .
his comments follows an army warning issued on friday that the military would defend turkey 's secularist system after parliament failed to approve the ruling party 's candidate for president .
" this is a test case if the turkish armed forces respect democratic secularism and the democratic arrangement of civil-military relations , " rehn said .
in friday 's first round of voting , the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- candidate , abdullah gul , narrowly failed to win .
gul , who is also foreign minister , secured 357 votes - just 10 short of the 367 , or two thirds of all deputies needed to win in the first round .
the main secular opposition party boycotted the vote and said it would challenge the election in court .
army blames akp for rising anti-secularism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army has led three coups since 1960 in its statement released late friday , the military accused the akp , the offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , of failing to prevent rising anti-secular activity in the country .
the turkish army , responsible for three past coups , warned that it is determined to defend the country 's secular system .
" the problem that recently came to the forefront of the presidential election process has focused on the issue of questioning secularism .
the turkish armed forces are observing this situation with concern , " the army said .
" the turkish armed forces ... will openly and clearly display their position and attitude when necessary .
no one should doubt this , " it warned .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has yet to respond to the army statement .
the akp 's nomination of gul has fanned unease in an increasingly polarised society where many fear the secular order is under threat from a growing islamist influence .
many suspect akp of an islamist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , left , with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan many are unconvinced by the akp 's arguments that it has disawoved its islamist past and fear the government will have a free hand to implement a suspected islamist agenda that will erode the separation of state and religion if gul is elected .
the turkish armed forces , which see themselves as the guardians of the secular system , seized power in 1960 , 1971 and 1980 and forced the resignation in 1997 of the country 's first islamist prime minister , necmettin erbakan .
the main opposition republican people 's party , which strongly opposes the idea of a former islamist becoming president , on friday evening petitioned the constitutional court to cancel the first round of voting , citing violation of a quorum rule .
if the court annuls the vote , general elections - originally scheduled for november 4 - must be called within 90 days .
if the constitutional court does not cancel the vote , parliament will hold a second round on wednesday , probably with a similar result , but gul is virtually certain to be elected in the third round on may 9 , when an absolute majority of 276 will suffice .
turkish media takes army threat seriously bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media says fast poiltical action will negate the army 's fears the turkish press on saturday urged the government to call early elections to prevent it from plunging into a deep crisis .
in a front-page editorial , the popular daily vatan urged all political parties to take the army statement seriously .
" the quickest way to save turkey and its future is to convene parliament at once , hold elections as speedily as possible and prove to the world that turkey is mature enough to resolve its problems democratically , " it said .
many commentators accused prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's akp of raising tensions and not seeking a consensus with the opposition on the choice for the presidency , which is a non-partisan office , but relying on his comfortable parliamentary majority to have his way .
erdogan 's detractors accuse him of abusing his nearly two-thirds parliamentary majority garnered with only one third of the vote in the 2002 vote - thanks to turkey 's much-criticized electoral system - to put an islamist in the presidency seen as the last bastion of secularism in turkey .
dozens of non-governmental organizations have called for a rally in istanbul sunday to show their support for the secular system , similar to one in ankara two weeks ago which drew up up to 1.5 million people , acording to some estimates .
the akp was born out of erbakan 's party , banned for anti-secular activities the year after it was ousted from power , but argues that it has since evolved and is committed to the secular system .
secularists cite its unsuccessful attempts to criminalise adultery , restrict alcohol sales and lift a ban islamic headsarves in government offices and universities as evidence that the party has not changed . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish presidential race divides country foreign minister abdullah gul 's bid to become turkish president is exposing divisions between the islamist-rooted government and its secular elite .

worse was to follow as bundesliga top scorer gekas scored his 19th goal of the season four minutes from the break after being found by a cross from marcel maltritz .
schalke pushed forward in the second half in search of an equalizer as coach slomka brought on forwards halil altintop and soren larsen , as well as offensive midfielder levan kobiashvili .
kuranyi came close with a header against the upright in the 69th minute and they had a confident penalty appeal turned down a short while later .

the two leaders had also discussed putin 's warning , issued to the russian parliament thursday , that russia would declare a moratorium on the 1990 conventional forces in europe treaty , if the us did not back down on the missile shield .
merkel and putin both attached great significance to relations between the european union and russia , the spokesman said .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has adopted a moderate tone in the controversy , pressing the case for the stationing of interceptor missiles in poland along with a radar station in the czech republic to be taken up at nato level .
the us initially preferred bilateral arrangements with poland and the czech republic .
steinmeier 's position came in for criticism from conservative members of merkel 's broad coalition , who urged a stronger line against russia .
the government spokesman said merkel had discussed a range of issues with putin , including the situation in ukraine and the eu- russian summit may 17-18 .
germany currently holds the eu presidency .
putin expresses russian anger at estonian riots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots have been raging in tallinn since thursday night the chancellor also breached the topic of the escalating unrest in estonia , which reached a deadly peak saturday when a russian national was killed in the estonian capital during unrest sparked by the removal of a soviet-era war memorial .
a surge in anti-estonian sentiment was in evidence on the streets of moscow and other russian cities with protestors out in force , newspapers voicing outrage and shoppers boycotting goods from their baltic neighbour .
putin had voiced " serious concern " over the events in tallinn during the telephone conversation with gmerkel , a kremlin spokeswoman said .
violence over monument leads to a russian death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statue was removed under cover of darkness early friday the row over the removal of a soviet war memorial from tallinn 's centre erupted in riots that began there last thursday , leading to 900 arrests and the death of a russian citizen identified by officials only as dmitri .
estonians see the bronze memorial as a symbol of 50 years of soviet occupation following world war ii .
the estonian authorities removed the statue from the center of tallinn early friday after the first night of rioting , in which dmitri was killed .
the german government statement saturday said merkel had urged both putin and estonian prime minister andrus ansip to keep a lid on the row by showing restraint and restoring parliamentary contacts as soon as possible .
the german government had suggested that the parliaments of the two countries should engage in direct contact over the conflict regarding the removal of the soviet war memorial , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said .
demonstrators target estonian consulate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian and russian protestors clashed with each other and police but at the estonian consulate in moscow about 150 members of two pro-kremlin youth groups protested for a second day , chanting : " fascism will not win ! "
ria novosti news agency quoted a spokesman at the estonian consulate in moscow , franek persidski , as saying the consulate had temporarily ceased operations because of safety concerns .
in saint petersburg another 100 activists demonstrated outside the estonian consulate , city police said .
in the city of pskov , 20 kilometres -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- east of russia 's border with estonia , several dozen protesters brought an empty coffin to the estonian consulate , ria novosti reported .
they were stopped by police while attempting to unfurl a banner reading : " a spike in the head for the fascist beast , then the grave ! "
amid calls for retaliation against estonia , moscow mayor yury luzhkov urged " russian state and municipal organizations to freeze all forms of financial , economic , business and cultural cooperation with estonian state organizations , " ria-novosti reported .
embargo planned on estonian goods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the violence continues , russia takes steps against estonia the interfax news agency quoted the management of three major supermarket chains as saying they would no longer sell estonian goods .
" we are against the removal of the soldier-liberator in tallinn and consider such actions inadmissible , " interfax quoted a spokesman for the sedmoi kontinent supermarket chain as saying .
" in the next 48 hours all goods of estonian origin will be removed from the assortment of products offered by our shops , " the spokesman said .
newspapers also voiced their indignation .
" we are finally convinced .
estonia is a fascist state , " thundered the moskovsky kosmolets tabloid , which in its headline used a stylized " ss " symbol in place of the letter " s " in the word estonia .
the row marks a new low in relations between the countries , which have not seen eye-to-eye since the soviet union 's 1991 collapse and the restoration of estonia 's independence .
many russians consider the statue in tallinn to be a poignant memorial to the huge losses suffered by the soviet union in defeating nazism and have complained at the status of ethnic russians in estonia , alleging discrimination . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato calls for clarification as putin raises missile stakes nato called for russia to clarify whether it has actually frozen its application of a key arms treaty limiting the number of military forces in europe as president putin warned of an increase in the nuclear threat .

merkel and putin both attached great significance to relations between the european union and russia , the spokesman said .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has adopted a moderate tone in the controversy , pressing the case for the stationing of interceptor missiles in poland along with a radar station in the czech republic to be taken up at nato level .
the us initially preferred bilateral arrangements with poland and the czech republic .
steinmeier 's position came in for criticism from conservative members of merkel 's broad coalition , who urged a stronger line against russia .
the government spokesman said merkel had discussed a range of issues with putin , including the situation in ukraine and the eu- russian summit may 17-18 .
germany currently holds the eu presidency .

the two leaders had also discussed putin 's warning , issued to the russian parliament thursday , that russia would declare a moratorium on the 1990 conventional forces in europe treaty , if the us did not back down on the missile shield .
merkel and putin both attached great significance to relations between the european union and russia , the spokesman said .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has adopted a moderate tone in the controversy , pressing the case for the stationing of interceptor missiles in poland along with a radar station in the czech republic to be taken up at nato level .
the us initially preferred bilateral arrangements with poland and the czech republic .
steinmeier 's position came in for criticism from conservative members of merkel 's broad coalition , who urged a stronger line against russia .
the government spokesman said merkel had discussed a range of issues with putin , including the situation in ukraine and the eu- russian summit may 17-18 .
germany currently holds the eu presidency .

a surge in anti-estonian sentiment was in evidence on the streets of moscow and other russian cities with protestors out in force , newspapers voicing outrage and shoppers boycotting goods from their baltic neighbour .
putin had voiced " serious concern " over the events in tallinn during the telephone conversation with gmerkel , a kremlin spokeswoman said .
violence over monument leads to a russian death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statue was removed under cover of darkness early friday the row over the removal of a soviet war memorial from tallinn 's centre erupted in riots that began there last thursday , leading to 900 arrests and the death of a russian citizen identified by officials only as dmitri .
estonians see the bronze memorial as a symbol of 50 years of soviet occupation following world war ii .
the estonian authorities removed the statue from the center of tallinn early friday after the first night of rioting , in which dmitri was killed .
the german government statement saturday said merkel had urged both putin and estonian prime minister andrus ansip to keep a lid on the row by showing restraint and restoring parliamentary contacts as soon as possible .
the german government had suggested that the parliaments of the two countries should engage in direct contact over the conflict regarding the removal of the soviet war memorial , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said .

in saint petersburg another 100 activists demonstrated outside the estonian consulate , city police said .
in the city of pskov , 20 kilometres -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- east of russia 's border with estonia , several dozen protesters brought an empty coffin to the estonian consulate , ria novosti reported .
they were stopped by police while attempting to unfurl a banner reading : " a spike in the head for the fascist beast , then the grave ! "
amid calls for retaliation against estonia , moscow mayor yury luzhkov urged " russian state and municipal organizations to freeze all forms of financial , economic , business and cultural cooperation with estonian state organizations , " ria-novosti reported .

" in the next 48 hours all goods of estonian origin will be removed from the assortment of products offered by our shops , " the spokesman said .
newspapers also voiced their indignation .

money is the key to success . " our vision is a world free of malaria within the next couple of years , " said jörg maas , the foundation 's executive director , at the launch of the european alliance against malaria in berlin .
the organizations started the initiative " to encourage donor governments , particularly in europe and the north , to provide more funding for the fight against malaria , " he said .
the alliance is made up of 10 organizations from britain , belgium , france , germany and spain , and includes the german red cross and the german foundation for world population .
malaria remains a major problem , especially for the world 's children .
the mosquito-borne disease kills up to three million people each year .
the vast majority of those deaths occur in sub-saharan africa , mostly among children under the age of five .
the disease is also a huge barrier to development .
in africa alone , malaria is thought to cause an estimated $ 12 billion in lost gdp each year .
at the same time , simple preventive measures could drastically reduce the number of malaria cases .
the use of bed nets treated with insecticide could bring about a 25 percent fall in mortality .
more to be done a key measure to quell the spread of the disease is the use of insecticide-treated bed nets .
they prevent mosquitoes carrying the disease from biting people and can reduce mortality by up to 25 percent alone for the cost of about $ 10 -lrb- 7 euros -rrb- per net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty percent of the world population is threatened by malaria the german red cross distributed 18,000 mosquito nets in sudan in december , but sending thousands of bed nets to africa was n't enough , said rudolf seiters , the organization 's head .
people also needed to be shown how to use the nets effectively .
other means to fight the disease could be improved .
" we need to make sure drugs to treat malaria are the most effective ones available to reduce death , " peter salama , head of global health at the united nations children 's fund , unicef , told dw-radio .
new combined treatments for malaria were developed in the 1990s in response to a resurgence of the disease and mounting evidence that the parasite carried by the mosquito was growing resistant to traditional " monotherapies " like chloroquine .
since then , funding for combined treatments has increased significantly through bilateral and multilateral aid , corporate assistance , and national government programs in malarial countries .
but difficulties in the drug purchase and delivery processes as well as distribution of mosquito nets persist .
combined efforts indeed , the main hindrance to eradicating the disease is a lack of money .
" there 's a global requirement of about $ 3 billion a year to scale up those interventions … and currently we have way below $ 1 billion per year for malaria resources , " said salama .
" so we really have a critical gap there of more than $ 2 billion a year . "
that 's where the european alliance against malaria could make a difference .
closer coordination between european governments could yield lasting results in the fight against malaria .
" all the means necessary to eradicate malaria are already available , but the quality of strategy is not good enough to reach the goal , " said the project 's coordinator , stecy yghemonos .
" so we think if european governments are more focused on the strategy , the situation can really be improved . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insecticide keeps mosquitos away improved strategy means not only increasing the overall amount of funding , but also ensuring the money is spent on the most effective programs , and sent where it 's most needed .

" if malaria was a disease that was an immediate threat to the industrial countries , i 'm very sure that there would already be the appropriate medication that could be quickly employed , " heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said at the launch .

money is the key to success . " our vision is a world free of malaria within the next couple of years , " said jörg maas , the foundation 's executive director , at the launch of the european alliance against malaria in berlin .
the organizations started the initiative " to encourage donor governments , particularly in europe and the north , to provide more funding for the fight against malaria , " he said .
the alliance is made up of 10 organizations from britain , belgium , france , germany and spain , and includes the german red cross and the german foundation for world population .
malaria remains a major problem , especially for the world 's children .
the mosquito-borne disease kills up to three million people each year .
the vast majority of those deaths occur in sub-saharan africa , mostly among children under the age of five .
the disease is also a huge barrier to development .
in africa alone , malaria is thought to cause an estimated $ 12 billion in lost gdp each year .
at the same time , simple preventive measures could drastically reduce the number of malaria cases .
the use of bed nets treated with insecticide could bring about a 25 percent fall in mortality .
more to be done a key measure to quell the spread of the disease is the use of insecticide-treated bed nets .
they prevent mosquitoes carrying the disease from biting people and can reduce mortality by up to 25 percent alone for the cost of about $ 10 -lrb- 7 euros -rrb- per net .

new combined treatments for malaria were developed in the 1990s in response to a resurgence of the disease and mounting evidence that the parasite carried by the mosquito was growing resistant to traditional " monotherapies " like chloroquine .
since then , funding for combined treatments has increased significantly through bilateral and multilateral aid , corporate assistance , and national government programs in malarial countries .
but difficulties in the drug purchase and delivery processes as well as distribution of mosquito nets persist .
combined efforts indeed , the main hindrance to eradicating the disease is a lack of money .
" there 's a global requirement of about $ 3 billion a year to scale up those interventions … and currently we have way below $ 1 billion per year for malaria resources , " said salama .
" so we really have a critical gap there of more than $ 2 billion a year . "
that 's where the european alliance against malaria could make a difference .
closer coordination between european governments could yield lasting results in the fight against malaria .
" all the means necessary to eradicate malaria are already available , but the quality of strategy is not good enough to reach the goal , " said the project 's coordinator , stecy yghemonos .

the two leaders had also discussed putin 's warning , issued to the russian parliament thursday , that russia would declare a moratorium on the 1990 conventional forces in europe treaty , if the us did not back down on the missile shield .
merkel and putin both attached great significance to relations between the european union and russia , the spokesman said .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has adopted a moderate tone in the controversy , pressing the case for the stationing of interceptor missiles in poland along with a radar station in the czech republic to be taken up at nato level .
the us initially preferred bilateral arrangements with poland and the czech republic .
steinmeier 's position came in for criticism from conservative members of merkel 's broad coalition , who urged a stronger line against russia .
the government spokesman said merkel had discussed a range of issues with putin , including the situation in ukraine and the eu- russian summit may 17-18 .
germany currently holds the eu presidency .
putin expresses russian anger at estonian riots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots have been raging in tallinn since thursday night the chancellor also breached the topic of the escalating unrest in estonia , which reached a deadly peak saturday when a russian national was killed in the estonian capital during unrest sparked by the removal of a soviet-era war memorial .
a surge in anti-estonian sentiment was in evidence on the streets of moscow and other russian cities with protestors out in force , newspapers voicing outrage and shoppers boycotting goods from their baltic neighbour .
putin had voiced " serious concern " over the events in tallinn during the telephone conversation with gmerkel , a kremlin spokeswoman said .
violence over monument leads to a russian death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statue was removed under cover of darkness early friday the row over the removal of a soviet war memorial from tallinn 's centre erupted in riots that began there last thursday , leading to 900 arrests and the death of a russian citizen identified by officials only as dmitri .
estonians see the bronze memorial as a symbol of 50 years of soviet occupation following world war ii .
the estonian authorities removed the statue from the center of tallinn early friday after the first night of rioting , in which dmitri was killed .
the german government statement saturday said merkel had urged both putin and estonian prime minister andrus ansip to keep a lid on the row by showing restraint and restoring parliamentary contacts as soon as possible .
the german government had suggested that the parliaments of the two countries should engage in direct contact over the conflict regarding the removal of the soviet war memorial , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said .
demonstrators target estonian consulate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian and russian protestors clashed with each other and police but at the estonian consulate in moscow about 150 members of two pro-kremlin youth groups protested for a second day , chanting : " fascism will not win ! "
ria novosti news agency quoted a spokesman at the estonian consulate in moscow , franek persidski , as saying the consulate had temporarily ceased operations because of safety concerns .
in saint petersburg another 100 activists demonstrated outside the estonian consulate , city police said .
in the city of pskov , 20 kilometres -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- east of russia 's border with estonia , several dozen protesters brought an empty coffin to the estonian consulate , ria novosti reported .
they were stopped by police while attempting to unfurl a banner reading : " a spike in the head for the fascist beast , then the grave ! "
amid calls for retaliation against estonia , moscow mayor yury luzhkov urged " russian state and municipal organizations to freeze all forms of financial , economic , business and cultural cooperation with estonian state organizations , " ria-novosti reported .
embargo planned on estonian goods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the violence continues , russia takes steps against estonia the interfax news agency quoted the management of three major supermarket chains as saying they would no longer sell estonian goods .
" we are against the removal of the soldier-liberator in tallinn and consider such actions inadmissible , " interfax quoted a spokesman for the sedmoi kontinent supermarket chain as saying .
" in the next 48 hours all goods of estonian origin will be removed from the assortment of products offered by our shops , " the spokesman said .
newspapers also voiced their indignation .

" as the league leaders looked back on a disasterous 2-1 defeat on friday which cut their lead to two points . virtually six years ago to the day on april 28 , 200 , schalke were in a similar position ahead of their fourth-from-last match as they had a two-point lead over bayern munich .
schalke 's draw in bochum at the time saw bayern draw level on points and a further defeat in stuttgart eventually led to schalke losing the championship on the final day of the season .
the only schalke player who played in that game , gerald asamoah , said earlier this week that it remained a painful memory .
" we lost the championship in bochum six years ago . "
the schalke fans must have been able to almost taste the ominous sense of history repeating as goals by zvjezdan misimovic and theofanis gekas gave relegation-troubled bochum a come-back victory after kevin kuranyi had put schalke ahead early in the game .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi 's opener was not enough in the end the defeat keeps schalke on 62 points , two more than werder bremen and four more than vfb stuttgart , although both have a game in hand .
bremen can move ahead of schalke on sunday with a victory at arminia bielefeld , while stuttgart have a chance of moving within a point of the leaders if they win at bottom club borussia mönchengladbach .
slomka blames ref for defeat schalke coach mirko slomka criticised the referee after the game saying that he had failed to give his side two penalties .
" it is a pity that a game and possibly even more is decided in such a manner , " the usually pragmatic coach said after the game .
" we no longer have it in our own hands .
i am no longer 100 per cent sure that we will win the championship , " he added .
a capacity crowd watching the ruhr derby on friday witnessed the league leaders having the best possible start when germany striker kuranyi headed them in front in the eighth minute from a freekick played into the area by christian pander .
a short while later asamoah could have put schalke two goals ahead , but his well-taken shot was brilliantly saved by czech goalkeeper jaroslav drobny .
bochum fight back rocks title hopefuls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the topsy-turvy game eventually went bochum 's way the visitors were made to pay for their missed chances as bosnian midfielder misimovic leveled matters in the 33rd minute with a header after two schalke defenders hindered each other .
worse was to follow as bundesliga top scorer gekas scored his 19th goal of the season four minutes from the break after being found by a cross from marcel maltritz .

money is the key to success . " our vision is a world free of malaria within the next couple of years , " said jörg maas , the foundation 's executive director , at the launch of the european alliance against malaria in berlin .
the organizations started the initiative " to encourage donor governments , particularly in europe and the north , to provide more funding for the fight against malaria , " he said .
the alliance is made up of 10 organizations from britain , belgium , france , germany and spain , and includes the german red cross and the german foundation for world population .
malaria remains a major problem , especially for the world 's children .
the mosquito-borne disease kills up to three million people each year .
the vast majority of those deaths occur in sub-saharan africa , mostly among children under the age of five .
the disease is also a huge barrier to development .
in africa alone , malaria is thought to cause an estimated $ 12 billion in lost gdp each year .
at the same time , simple preventive measures could drastically reduce the number of malaria cases .
the use of bed nets treated with insecticide could bring about a 25 percent fall in mortality .
more to be done a key measure to quell the spread of the disease is the use of insecticide-treated bed nets .
they prevent mosquitoes carrying the disease from biting people and can reduce mortality by up to 25 percent alone for the cost of about $ 10 -lrb- 7 euros -rrb- per net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty percent of the world population is threatened by malaria the german red cross distributed 18,000 mosquito nets in sudan in december , but sending thousands of bed nets to africa was n't enough , said rudolf seiters , the organization 's head .
people also needed to be shown how to use the nets effectively .
other means to fight the disease could be improved .
" we need to make sure drugs to treat malaria are the most effective ones available to reduce death , " peter salama , head of global health at the united nations children 's fund , unicef , told dw-radio .
new combined treatments for malaria were developed in the 1990s in response to a resurgence of the disease and mounting evidence that the parasite carried by the mosquito was growing resistant to traditional " monotherapies " like chloroquine .
since then , funding for combined treatments has increased significantly through bilateral and multilateral aid , corporate assistance , and national government programs in malarial countries .
but difficulties in the drug purchase and delivery processes as well as distribution of mosquito nets persist .
combined efforts indeed , the main hindrance to eradicating the disease is a lack of money .
" there 's a global requirement of about $ 3 billion a year to scale up those interventions … and currently we have way below $ 1 billion per year for malaria resources , " said salama .
" so we really have a critical gap there of more than $ 2 billion a year . "
that 's where the european alliance against malaria could make a difference .
closer coordination between european governments could yield lasting results in the fight against malaria .
" all the means necessary to eradicate malaria are already available , but the quality of strategy is not good enough to reach the goal , " said the project 's coordinator , stecy yghemonos .
" so we think if european governments are more focused on the strategy , the situation can really be improved . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insecticide keeps mosquitos away improved strategy means not only increasing the overall amount of funding , but also ensuring the money is spent on the most effective programs , and sent where it 's most needed .
taking responsibility at the launch , germany 's development minister was critical of rich counties ' efforts to fight the disease .
" if malaria was a disease that was an immediate threat to the industrial countries , i 'm very sure that there would already be the appropriate medication that could be quickly employed , " heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said at the launch .
" but so far , malaria is a disease that mainly effects developing countries and that 's why it 's important that we draw attention to this situation and that we live up to our responsibility , for we can not leave people in these countries alone with this situation . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel pledges to keep africa on international agenda german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday that the world 's industrialized countries do not need to set new goals to help the developing world but keep the promises they have already made .
-lrb- 24.04.2007 -rrb- german aids action plan aims to revive awareness the german cabinet approved a national action plan against the spread of hiv and aids , which focuses on increased preventive measures and research into new strains of drug-resistant viruses .
-lrb- 08.03.2007 -rrb- development aid promises often go unfulfilled in 2000 , g8 nations , including germany , pledged to devote more money to combat misery in the world 's poorest countries .

" i think that at this point in time to have also the usa open a channel of communication with iran would be worth thinking about ... on everything , " said solana .
he and larijani held talks in ankara on wednesday and thursday .
" we have to see how much the usa are ready to engage , " he said .
these were their first face-to-face meetings since the un security council imposed a second round of limited sanctions on iran in march over tehran 's refusal to halt uranium enrichment .
more talks are scheduled in two weeks .
solana , in his talks with larijani , represented the five permanent members of the security council plus germany .
he said on friday that the talks were " constructive conversations . "
all sides need to be tenacious , says solana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani came to berlin for talks with the eu in september " they were constructive in the sense that it was some potential motion that we have to see if we can exploit in a next meeting we 'll have in about ten days , " he said .
" i do n't want to say at all that the difficulties are overcome , we have many important hurdles that have to be overcome , but we have to be tenacious . "
asked whether larijani and iran 's supreme leader ali khamenei were ready to speak to the united states , based on his conversations with larijani , solana replied : " i say without any hesitation , yes . "
solana was speaking friday after a brussels forum organised by the german marshall fund of the united states .
assistant under secretary of state dan fried , who was also at the brussels conference , said he was not in a position to announce any change in us policy .

money is the key to success . " our vision is a world free of malaria within the next couple of years , " said jörg maas , the foundation 's executive director , at the launch of the european alliance against malaria in berlin .
the organizations started the initiative " to encourage donor governments , particularly in europe and the north , to provide more funding for the fight against malaria , " he said .
the alliance is made up of 10 organizations from britain , belgium , france , germany and spain , and includes the german red cross and the german foundation for world population .
malaria remains a major problem , especially for the world 's children .
the mosquito-borne disease kills up to three million people each year .
the vast majority of those deaths occur in sub-saharan africa , mostly among children under the age of five .
the disease is also a huge barrier to development .
in africa alone , malaria is thought to cause an estimated $ 12 billion in lost gdp each year .
at the same time , simple preventive measures could drastically reduce the number of malaria cases .
the use of bed nets treated with insecticide could bring about a 25 percent fall in mortality .
more to be done a key measure to quell the spread of the disease is the use of insecticide-treated bed nets .
they prevent mosquitoes carrying the disease from biting people and can reduce mortality by up to 25 percent alone for the cost of about $ 10 -lrb- 7 euros -rrb- per net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty percent of the world population is threatened by malaria the german red cross distributed 18,000 mosquito nets in sudan in december , but sending thousands of bed nets to africa was n't enough , said rudolf seiters , the organization 's head .
people also needed to be shown how to use the nets effectively .

" we need to make sure drugs to treat malaria are the most effective ones available to reduce death , " peter salama , head of global health at the united nations children 's fund , unicef , told dw-radio .
new combined treatments for malaria were developed in the 1990s in response to a resurgence of the disease and mounting evidence that the parasite carried by the mosquito was growing resistant to traditional " monotherapies " like chloroquine .
since then , funding for combined treatments has increased significantly through bilateral and multilateral aid , corporate assistance , and national government programs in malarial countries .
but difficulties in the drug purchase and delivery processes as well as distribution of mosquito nets persist .
combined efforts indeed , the main hindrance to eradicating the disease is a lack of money .
" there 's a global requirement of about $ 3 billion a year to scale up those interventions … and currently we have way below $ 1 billion per year for malaria resources , " said salama .
" so we really have a critical gap there of more than $ 2 billion a year . "
that 's where the european alliance against malaria could make a difference .
closer coordination between european governments could yield lasting results in the fight against malaria .
" all the means necessary to eradicate malaria are already available , but the quality of strategy is not good enough to reach the goal , " said the project 's coordinator , stecy yghemonos .
" so we think if european governments are more focused on the strategy , the situation can really be improved . "

money is the key to success . " our vision is a world free of malaria within the next couple of years , " said jörg maas , the foundation 's executive director , at the launch of the european alliance against malaria in berlin .
the organizations started the initiative " to encourage donor governments , particularly in europe and the north , to provide more funding for the fight against malaria , " he said .
the alliance is made up of 10 organizations from britain , belgium , france , germany and spain , and includes the german red cross and the german foundation for world population .
malaria remains a major problem , especially for the world 's children .
the mosquito-borne disease kills up to three million people each year .
the vast majority of those deaths occur in sub-saharan africa , mostly among children under the age of five .
the disease is also a huge barrier to development .
in africa alone , malaria is thought to cause an estimated $ 12 billion in lost gdp each year .
at the same time , simple preventive measures could drastically reduce the number of malaria cases .
the use of bed nets treated with insecticide could bring about a 25 percent fall in mortality .
more to be done a key measure to quell the spread of the disease is the use of insecticide-treated bed nets .
they prevent mosquitoes carrying the disease from biting people and can reduce mortality by up to 25 percent alone for the cost of about $ 10 -lrb- 7 euros -rrb- per net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty percent of the world population is threatened by malaria the german red cross distributed 18,000 mosquito nets in sudan in december , but sending thousands of bed nets to africa was n't enough , said rudolf seiters , the organization 's head .
people also needed to be shown how to use the nets effectively .
other means to fight the disease could be improved .
" we need to make sure drugs to treat malaria are the most effective ones available to reduce death , " peter salama , head of global health at the united nations children 's fund , unicef , told dw-radio .

" it is important that the military leaves the remit of democracy to the democratically elected government , " eu enlargement commissioner , ollie rehn , said in a statement .
his comments follows an army warning issued on friday that the military would defend turkey 's secularist system after parliament failed to approve the ruling party 's candidate for president .
" this is a test case if the turkish armed forces respect democratic secularism and the democratic arrangement of civil-military relations , " rehn said .
in friday 's first round of voting , the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- candidate , abdullah gul , narrowly failed to win .
gul , who is also foreign minister , secured 357 votes - just 10 short of the 367 , or two thirds of all deputies needed to win in the first round .
the main secular opposition party boycotted the vote and said it would challenge the election in court .
army blames akp for rising anti-secularism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army has led three coups since 1960 in its statement released late friday , the military accused the akp , the offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , of failing to prevent rising anti-secular activity in the country .
the turkish army , responsible for three past coups , warned that it is determined to defend the country 's secular system .
" the problem that recently came to the forefront of the presidential election process has focused on the issue of questioning secularism .
the turkish armed forces are observing this situation with concern , " the army said .
" the turkish armed forces ... will openly and clearly display their position and attitude when necessary .
no one should doubt this , " it warned .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has yet to respond to the army statement .
the akp 's nomination of gul has fanned unease in an increasingly polarised society where many fear the secular order is under threat from a growing islamist influence .
many suspect akp of an islamist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , left , with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan many are unconvinced by the akp 's arguments that it has disawoved its islamist past and fear the government will have a free hand to implement a suspected islamist agenda that will erode the separation of state and religion if gul is elected .
the turkish armed forces , which see themselves as the guardians of the secular system , seized power in 1960 , 1971 and 1980 and forced the resignation in 1997 of the country 's first islamist prime minister , necmettin erbakan .
the main opposition republican people 's party , which strongly opposes the idea of a former islamist becoming president , on friday evening petitioned the constitutional court to cancel the first round of voting , citing violation of a quorum rule .
if the court annuls the vote , general elections - originally scheduled for november 4 - must be called within 90 days .
if the constitutional court does not cancel the vote , parliament will hold a second round on wednesday , probably with a similar result , but gul is virtually certain to be elected in the third round on may 9 , when an absolute majority of 276 will suffice .
turkish media takes army threat seriously bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media says fast poiltical action will negate the army 's fears the turkish press on saturday urged the government to call early elections to prevent it from plunging into a deep crisis .
in a front-page editorial , the popular daily vatan urged all political parties to take the army statement seriously .
" the quickest way to save turkey and its future is to convene parliament at once , hold elections as speedily as possible and prove to the world that turkey is mature enough to resolve its problems democratically , " it said .
many commentators accused prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's akp of raising tensions and not seeking a consensus with the opposition on the choice for the presidency , which is a non-partisan office , but relying on his comfortable parliamentary majority to have his way .
erdogan 's detractors accuse him of abusing his nearly two-thirds parliamentary majority garnered with only one third of the vote in the 2002 vote - thanks to turkey 's much-criticized electoral system - to put an islamist in the presidency seen as the last bastion of secularism in turkey .
dozens of non-governmental organizations have called for a rally in istanbul sunday to show their support for the secular system , similar to one in ankara two weeks ago which drew up up to 1.5 million people , acording to some estimates .
the akp was born out of erbakan 's party , banned for anti-secular activities the year after it was ousted from power , but argues that it has since evolved and is committed to the secular system .

" it is important that the military leaves the remit of democracy to the democratically elected government , " eu enlargement commissioner , ollie rehn , said in a statement .
his comments follows an army warning issued on friday that the military would defend turkey 's secularist system after parliament failed to approve the ruling party 's candidate for president .
" this is a test case if the turkish armed forces respect democratic secularism and the democratic arrangement of civil-military relations , " rehn said .
in friday 's first round of voting , the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- candidate , abdullah gul , narrowly failed to win .
gul , who is also foreign minister , secured 357 votes - just 10 short of the 367 , or two thirds of all deputies needed to win in the first round .
the main secular opposition party boycotted the vote and said it would challenge the election in court .
army blames akp for rising anti-secularism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army has led three coups since 1960 in its statement released late friday , the military accused the akp , the offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , of failing to prevent rising anti-secular activity in the country .
the turkish army , responsible for three past coups , warned that it is determined to defend the country 's secular system .
" the problem that recently came to the forefront of the presidential election process has focused on the issue of questioning secularism .
the turkish armed forces are observing this situation with concern , " the army said .
" the turkish armed forces ... will openly and clearly display their position and attitude when necessary .
no one should doubt this , " it warned .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has yet to respond to the army statement .
the akp 's nomination of gul has fanned unease in an increasingly polarised society where many fear the secular order is under threat from a growing islamist influence .
many suspect akp of an islamist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , left , with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan many are unconvinced by the akp 's arguments that it has disawoved its islamist past and fear the government will have a free hand to implement a suspected islamist agenda that will erode the separation of state and religion if gul is elected .
the turkish armed forces , which see themselves as the guardians of the secular system , seized power in 1960 , 1971 and 1980 and forced the resignation in 1997 of the country 's first islamist prime minister , necmettin erbakan .
the main opposition republican people 's party , which strongly opposes the idea of a former islamist becoming president , on friday evening petitioned the constitutional court to cancel the first round of voting , citing violation of a quorum rule .
if the court annuls the vote , general elections - originally scheduled for november 4 - must be called within 90 days .
if the constitutional court does not cancel the vote , parliament will hold a second round on wednesday , probably with a similar result , but gul is virtually certain to be elected in the third round on may 9 , when an absolute majority of 276 will suffice .
turkish media takes army threat seriously bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media says fast poiltical action will negate the army 's fears the turkish press on saturday urged the government to call early elections to prevent it from plunging into a deep crisis .
in a front-page editorial , the popular daily vatan urged all political parties to take the army statement seriously .
" the quickest way to save turkey and its future is to convene parliament at once , hold elections as speedily as possible and prove to the world that turkey is mature enough to resolve its problems democratically , " it said .
many commentators accused prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's akp of raising tensions and not seeking a consensus with the opposition on the choice for the presidency , which is a non-partisan office , but relying on his comfortable parliamentary majority to have his way .
erdogan 's detractors accuse him of abusing his nearly two-thirds parliamentary majority garnered with only one third of the vote in the 2002 vote - thanks to turkey 's much-criticized electoral system - to put an islamist in the presidency seen as the last bastion of secularism in turkey .
dozens of non-governmental organizations have called for a rally in istanbul sunday to show their support for the secular system , similar to one in ankara two weeks ago which drew up up to 1.5 million people , acording to some estimates .
the akp was born out of erbakan 's party , banned for anti-secular activities the year after it was ousted from power , but argues that it has since evolved and is committed to the secular system .

schalke 's draw in bochum at the time saw bayern draw level on points and a further defeat in stuttgart eventually led to schalke losing the championship on the final day of the season .

the meeting , organized by the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies , adopted a resolution calling for a " fair and just solution " in ongoing cases relating to compensation claims or restitution demands for art works sold under duress or confiscated by the nazis .
" the institutions have to act and trace possible heirs , " julius h schoeps , director of the mendelssohn center , told german news agency dpa ahead of the conference .
forgotten commitments ?
the three-day meeting reminded germany of the commitments it made to the 1998 washington conference on nazi-confiscated art when it pledged to do everything in its power to identify paintings that had not been returned to their owners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz marc paintings are also thought to be the subjects of restitution claims german museums are concerned that they could loose some of their most important paintings because of a contentious law governing works of art confiscated from jews by the nazis .
experts estimate 100 paintings by german expressionists are subjects of restitution claims , among them works by ernst ludwig kirchner and franz marc , a founder of the blue rider group .
in a high-profile case last november , kirchner 's " berlin street scene " was sold at a new york auction for $ 38 million -lrb- 28 million euros -rrb- after being returned by a berlin museum to the granddaughter of its former owner , jewish art collector alfred hess . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany rejects request to return posters disowned by nazis a german government commission has ruled that some 4,000 posters worth millions should n't be returned to the family of a jew who the nazis stripped of his possessions .

merkel and putin both attached great significance to relations between the european union and russia , the spokesman said .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has adopted a moderate tone in the controversy , pressing the case for the stationing of interceptor missiles in poland along with a radar station in the czech republic to be taken up at nato level .
the us initially preferred bilateral arrangements with poland and the czech republic .
steinmeier 's position came in for criticism from conservative members of merkel 's broad coalition , who urged a stronger line against russia .

" as the league leaders looked back on a disasterous 2-1 defeat on friday which cut their lead to two points . virtually six years ago to the day on april 28 , 200 , schalke were in a similar position ahead of their fourth-from-last match as they had a two-point lead over bayern munich .

" we no longer have it in our own hands .
i am no longer 100 per cent sure that we will win the championship , " he added .
a capacity crowd watching the ruhr derby on friday witnessed the league leaders having the best possible start when germany striker kuranyi headed them in front in the eighth minute from a freekick played into the area by christian pander .

worse was to follow as bundesliga top scorer gekas scored his 19th goal of the season four minutes from the break after being found by a cross from marcel maltritz .
schalke pushed forward in the second half in search of an equalizer as coach slomka brought on forwards halil altintop and soren larsen , as well as offensive midfielder levan kobiashvili .
kuranyi came close with a header against the upright in the 69th minute and they had a confident penalty appeal turned down a short while later .

the two leaders had also discussed putin 's warning , issued to the russian parliament thursday , that russia would declare a moratorium on the 1990 conventional forces in europe treaty , if the us did not back down on the missile shield .
merkel and putin both attached great significance to relations between the european union and russia , the spokesman said .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has adopted a moderate tone in the controversy , pressing the case for the stationing of interceptor missiles in poland along with a radar station in the czech republic to be taken up at nato level .
the us initially preferred bilateral arrangements with poland and the czech republic .
steinmeier 's position came in for criticism from conservative members of merkel 's broad coalition , who urged a stronger line against russia .
the government spokesman said merkel had discussed a range of issues with putin , including the situation in ukraine and the eu- russian summit may 17-18 .
germany currently holds the eu presidency .

a surge in anti-estonian sentiment was in evidence on the streets of moscow and other russian cities with protestors out in force , newspapers voicing outrage and shoppers boycotting goods from their baltic neighbour .
putin had voiced " serious concern " over the events in tallinn during the telephone conversation with gmerkel , a kremlin spokeswoman said .

the meeting , organized by the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies , adopted a resolution calling for a " fair and just solution " in ongoing cases relating to compensation claims or restitution demands for art works sold under duress or confiscated by the nazis .

money is the key to success . " our vision is a world free of malaria within the next couple of years , " said jörg maas , the foundation 's executive director , at the launch of the european alliance against malaria in berlin .
the organizations started the initiative " to encourage donor governments , particularly in europe and the north , to provide more funding for the fight against malaria , " he said .
the alliance is made up of 10 organizations from britain , belgium , france , germany and spain , and includes the german red cross and the german foundation for world population .
malaria remains a major problem , especially for the world 's children .
the mosquito-borne disease kills up to three million people each year .
the vast majority of those deaths occur in sub-saharan africa , mostly among children under the age of five .
the disease is also a huge barrier to development .
in africa alone , malaria is thought to cause an estimated $ 12 billion in lost gdp each year .
at the same time , simple preventive measures could drastically reduce the number of malaria cases .
the use of bed nets treated with insecticide could bring about a 25 percent fall in mortality .
more to be done a key measure to quell the spread of the disease is the use of insecticide-treated bed nets .
they prevent mosquitoes carrying the disease from biting people and can reduce mortality by up to 25 percent alone for the cost of about $ 10 -lrb- 7 euros -rrb- per net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty percent of the world population is threatened by malaria the german red cross distributed 18,000 mosquito nets in sudan in december , but sending thousands of bed nets to africa was n't enough , said rudolf seiters , the organization 's head .
people also needed to be shown how to use the nets effectively .
other means to fight the disease could be improved .
" we need to make sure drugs to treat malaria are the most effective ones available to reduce death , " peter salama , head of global health at the united nations children 's fund , unicef , told dw-radio .
new combined treatments for malaria were developed in the 1990s in response to a resurgence of the disease and mounting evidence that the parasite carried by the mosquito was growing resistant to traditional " monotherapies " like chloroquine .
since then , funding for combined treatments has increased significantly through bilateral and multilateral aid , corporate assistance , and national government programs in malarial countries .
but difficulties in the drug purchase and delivery processes as well as distribution of mosquito nets persist .
combined efforts indeed , the main hindrance to eradicating the disease is a lack of money .
" there 's a global requirement of about $ 3 billion a year to scale up those interventions … and currently we have way below $ 1 billion per year for malaria resources , " said salama .
" so we really have a critical gap there of more than $ 2 billion a year . "
that 's where the european alliance against malaria could make a difference .
closer coordination between european governments could yield lasting results in the fight against malaria .
" all the means necessary to eradicate malaria are already available , but the quality of strategy is not good enough to reach the goal , " said the project 's coordinator , stecy yghemonos .
" so we think if european governments are more focused on the strategy , the situation can really be improved . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insecticide keeps mosquitos away improved strategy means not only increasing the overall amount of funding , but also ensuring the money is spent on the most effective programs , and sent where it 's most needed .
taking responsibility at the launch , germany 's development minister was critical of rich counties ' efforts to fight the disease .
" if malaria was a disease that was an immediate threat to the industrial countries , i 'm very sure that there would already be the appropriate medication that could be quickly employed , " heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said at the launch .
" but so far , malaria is a disease that mainly effects developing countries and that 's why it 's important that we draw attention to this situation and that we live up to our responsibility , for we can not leave people in these countries alone with this situation .

money is the key to success . " our vision is a world free of malaria within the next couple of years , " said jörg maas , the foundation 's executive director , at the launch of the european alliance against malaria in berlin .
the organizations started the initiative " to encourage donor governments , particularly in europe and the north , to provide more funding for the fight against malaria , " he said .
the alliance is made up of 10 organizations from britain , belgium , france , germany and spain , and includes the german red cross and the german foundation for world population .
malaria remains a major problem , especially for the world 's children .
the mosquito-borne disease kills up to three million people each year .
the vast majority of those deaths occur in sub-saharan africa , mostly among children under the age of five .
the disease is also a huge barrier to development .
in africa alone , malaria is thought to cause an estimated $ 12 billion in lost gdp each year .
at the same time , simple preventive measures could drastically reduce the number of malaria cases .
the use of bed nets treated with insecticide could bring about a 25 percent fall in mortality .
more to be done a key measure to quell the spread of the disease is the use of insecticide-treated bed nets .
they prevent mosquitoes carrying the disease from biting people and can reduce mortality by up to 25 percent alone for the cost of about $ 10 -lrb- 7 euros -rrb- per net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty percent of the world population is threatened by malaria the german red cross distributed 18,000 mosquito nets in sudan in december , but sending thousands of bed nets to africa was n't enough , said rudolf seiters , the organization 's head .
people also needed to be shown how to use the nets effectively .
other means to fight the disease could be improved .
" we need to make sure drugs to treat malaria are the most effective ones available to reduce death , " peter salama , head of global health at the united nations children 's fund , unicef , told dw-radio .
new combined treatments for malaria were developed in the 1990s in response to a resurgence of the disease and mounting evidence that the parasite carried by the mosquito was growing resistant to traditional " monotherapies " like chloroquine .
since then , funding for combined treatments has increased significantly through bilateral and multilateral aid , corporate assistance , and national government programs in malarial countries .
but difficulties in the drug purchase and delivery processes as well as distribution of mosquito nets persist .
combined efforts indeed , the main hindrance to eradicating the disease is a lack of money .
" there 's a global requirement of about $ 3 billion a year to scale up those interventions … and currently we have way below $ 1 billion per year for malaria resources , " said salama .
" so we really have a critical gap there of more than $ 2 billion a year . "
that 's where the european alliance against malaria could make a difference .
closer coordination between european governments could yield lasting results in the fight against malaria .
" all the means necessary to eradicate malaria are already available , but the quality of strategy is not good enough to reach the goal , " said the project 's coordinator , stecy yghemonos .
" so we think if european governments are more focused on the strategy , the situation can really be improved . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 28.04.2007 eu warns turkish army about meddling in presidential elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army sees itself as the guardian of the country 's secular system the european union warned the turkish army on saturday not to interfere in the country 's democratic process amid a dispute over the ruling party 's islamist-rooted candidate to be turkey 's next president . " it is important that the military leaves the remit of democracy to the democratically elected government , " eu enlargement commissioner , ollie rehn , said in a statement .
his comments follows an army warning issued on friday that the military would defend turkey 's secularist system after parliament failed to approve the ruling party 's candidate for president .
" this is a test case if the turkish armed forces respect democratic secularism and the democratic arrangement of civil-military relations , " rehn said .
in friday 's first round of voting , the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- candidate , abdullah gul , narrowly failed to win .
gul , who is also foreign minister , secured 357 votes - just 10 short of the 367 , or two thirds of all deputies needed to win in the first round .
the main secular opposition party boycotted the vote and said it would challenge the election in court .
army blames akp for rising anti-secularism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army has led three coups since 1960 in its statement released late friday , the military accused the akp , the offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , of failing to prevent rising anti-secular activity in the country .
the turkish army , responsible for three past coups , warned that it is determined to defend the country 's secular system .
" the problem that recently came to the forefront of the presidential election process has focused on the issue of questioning secularism .
the turkish armed forces are observing this situation with concern , " the army said .
" the turkish armed forces ... will openly and clearly display their position and attitude when necessary .
no one should doubt this , " it warned .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has yet to respond to the army statement .
the akp 's nomination of gul has fanned unease in an increasingly polarised society where many fear the secular order is under threat from a growing islamist influence .
many suspect akp of an islamist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , left , with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan many are unconvinced by the akp 's arguments that it has disawoved its islamist past and fear the government will have a free hand to implement a suspected islamist agenda that will erode the separation of state and religion if gul is elected .
the turkish armed forces , which see themselves as the guardians of the secular system , seized power in 1960 , 1971 and 1980 and forced the resignation in 1997 of the country 's first islamist prime minister , necmettin erbakan .
the main opposition republican people 's party , which strongly opposes the idea of a former islamist becoming president , on friday evening petitioned the constitutional court to cancel the first round of voting , citing violation of a quorum rule .
if the court annuls the vote , general elections - originally scheduled for november 4 - must be called within 90 days .
if the constitutional court does not cancel the vote , parliament will hold a second round on wednesday , probably with a similar result , but gul is virtually certain to be elected in the third round on may 9 , when an absolute majority of 276 will suffice .
turkish media takes army threat seriously bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media says fast poiltical action will negate the army 's fears the turkish press on saturday urged the government to call early elections to prevent it from plunging into a deep crisis .
in a front-page editorial , the popular daily vatan urged all political parties to take the army statement seriously .
" the quickest way to save turkey and its future is to convene parliament at once , hold elections as speedily as possible and prove to the world that turkey is mature enough to resolve its problems democratically , " it said .
many commentators accused prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's akp of raising tensions and not seeking a consensus with the opposition on the choice for the presidency , which is a non-partisan office , but relying on his comfortable parliamentary majority to have his way .
erdogan 's detractors accuse him of abusing his nearly two-thirds parliamentary majority garnered with only one third of the vote in the 2002 vote - thanks to turkey 's much-criticized electoral system - to put an islamist in the presidency seen as the last bastion of secularism in turkey .
dozens of non-governmental organizations have called for a rally in istanbul sunday to show their support for the secular system , similar to one in ankara two weeks ago which drew up up to 1.5 million people , acording to some estimates .
the akp was born out of erbakan 's party , banned for anti-secular activities the year after it was ousted from power , but argues that it has since evolved and is committed to the secular system .
secularists cite its unsuccessful attempts to criminalise adultery , restrict alcohol sales and lift a ban islamic headsarves in government offices and universities as evidence that the party has not changed . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish presidential race divides country foreign minister abdullah gul 's bid to become turkish president is exposing divisions between the islamist-rooted government and its secular elite .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 28.04.2007 eu warns turkish army about meddling in presidential elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army sees itself as the guardian of the country 's secular system the european union warned the turkish army on saturday not to interfere in the country 's democratic process amid a dispute over the ruling party 's islamist-rooted candidate to be turkey 's next president . " it is important that the military leaves the remit of democracy to the democratically elected government , " eu enlargement commissioner , ollie rehn , said in a statement .
his comments follows an army warning issued on friday that the military would defend turkey 's secularist system after parliament failed to approve the ruling party 's candidate for president .
" this is a test case if the turkish armed forces respect democratic secularism and the democratic arrangement of civil-military relations , " rehn said .
in friday 's first round of voting , the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- candidate , abdullah gul , narrowly failed to win .
gul , who is also foreign minister , secured 357 votes - just 10 short of the 367 , or two thirds of all deputies needed to win in the first round .
the main secular opposition party boycotted the vote and said it would challenge the election in court .
army blames akp for rising anti-secularism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army has led three coups since 1960 in its statement released late friday , the military accused the akp , the offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , of failing to prevent rising anti-secular activity in the country .
the turkish army , responsible for three past coups , warned that it is determined to defend the country 's secular system .
" the problem that recently came to the forefront of the presidential election process has focused on the issue of questioning secularism .
the turkish armed forces are observing this situation with concern , " the army said .
" the turkish armed forces ... will openly and clearly display their position and attitude when necessary .
no one should doubt this , " it warned .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has yet to respond to the army statement .
the akp 's nomination of gul has fanned unease in an increasingly polarised society where many fear the secular order is under threat from a growing islamist influence .
many suspect akp of an islamist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , left , with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan many are unconvinced by the akp 's arguments that it has disawoved its islamist past and fear the government will have a free hand to implement a suspected islamist agenda that will erode the separation of state and religion if gul is elected .
the turkish armed forces , which see themselves as the guardians of the secular system , seized power in 1960 , 1971 and 1980 and forced the resignation in 1997 of the country 's first islamist prime minister , necmettin erbakan .
the main opposition republican people 's party , which strongly opposes the idea of a former islamist becoming president , on friday evening petitioned the constitutional court to cancel the first round of voting , citing violation of a quorum rule .
if the court annuls the vote , general elections - originally scheduled for november 4 - must be called within 90 days .
if the constitutional court does not cancel the vote , parliament will hold a second round on wednesday , probably with a similar result , but gul is virtually certain to be elected in the third round on may 9 , when an absolute majority of 276 will suffice .
turkish media takes army threat seriously bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media says fast poiltical action will negate the army 's fears the turkish press on saturday urged the government to call early elections to prevent it from plunging into a deep crisis .
in a front-page editorial , the popular daily vatan urged all political parties to take the army statement seriously .
" the quickest way to save turkey and its future is to convene parliament at once , hold elections as speedily as possible and prove to the world that turkey is mature enough to resolve its problems democratically , " it said .
many commentators accused prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's akp of raising tensions and not seeking a consensus with the opposition on the choice for the presidency , which is a non-partisan office , but relying on his comfortable parliamentary majority to have his way .
erdogan 's detractors accuse him of abusing his nearly two-thirds parliamentary majority garnered with only one third of the vote in the 2002 vote - thanks to turkey 's much-criticized electoral system - to put an islamist in the presidency seen as the last bastion of secularism in turkey .
dozens of non-governmental organizations have called for a rally in istanbul sunday to show their support for the secular system , similar to one in ankara two weeks ago which drew up up to 1.5 million people , acording to some estimates .
the akp was born out of erbakan 's party , banned for anti-secular activities the year after it was ousted from power , but argues that it has since evolved and is committed to the secular system .

" it is important that the military leaves the remit of democracy to the democratically elected government , " eu enlargement commissioner , ollie rehn , said in a statement .
his comments follows an army warning issued on friday that the military would defend turkey 's secularist system after parliament failed to approve the ruling party 's candidate for president .
" this is a test case if the turkish armed forces respect democratic secularism and the democratic arrangement of civil-military relations , " rehn said .
in friday 's first round of voting , the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- candidate , abdullah gul , narrowly failed to win .
gul , who is also foreign minister , secured 357 votes - just 10 short of the 367 , or two thirds of all deputies needed to win in the first round .

the turkish army , responsible for three past coups , warned that it is determined to defend the country 's secular system .
" the problem that recently came to the forefront of the presidential election process has focused on the issue of questioning secularism .

" the turkish armed forces ... will openly and clearly display their position and attitude when necessary .

prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has yet to respond to the army statement .

the turkish armed forces , which see themselves as the guardians of the secular system , seized power in 1960 , 1971 and 1980 and forced the resignation in 1997 of the country 's first islamist prime minister , necmettin erbakan .
the main opposition republican people 's party , which strongly opposes the idea of a former islamist becoming president , on friday evening petitioned the constitutional court to cancel the first round of voting , citing violation of a quorum rule .
if the court annuls the vote , general elections - originally scheduled for november 4 - must be called within 90 days .

" the quickest way to save turkey and its future is to convene parliament at once , hold elections as speedily as possible and prove to the world that turkey is mature enough to resolve its problems democratically , " it said .
many commentators accused prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's akp of raising tensions and not seeking a consensus with the opposition on the choice for the presidency , which is a non-partisan office , but relying on his comfortable parliamentary majority to have his way .
erdogan 's detractors accuse him of abusing his nearly two-thirds parliamentary majority garnered with only one third of the vote in the 2002 vote - thanks to turkey 's much-criticized electoral system - to put an islamist in the presidency seen as the last bastion of secularism in turkey .
dozens of non-governmental organizations have called for a rally in istanbul sunday to show their support for the secular system , similar to one in ankara two weeks ago which drew up up to 1.5 million people , acording to some estimates .

" as the league leaders looked back on a disasterous 2-1 defeat on friday which cut their lead to two points . virtually six years ago to the day on april 28 , 200 , schalke were in a similar position ahead of their fourth-from-last match as they had a two-point lead over bayern munich .

the only schalke player who played in that game , gerald asamoah , said earlier this week that it remained a painful memory .
" we lost the championship in bochum six years ago . "

slomka blames ref for defeat schalke coach mirko slomka criticised the referee after the game saying that he had failed to give his side two penalties .
" it is a pity that a game and possibly even more is decided in such a manner , " the usually pragmatic coach said after the game .
" we no longer have it in our own hands .
i am no longer 100 per cent sure that we will win the championship , " he added .
a capacity crowd watching the ruhr derby on friday witnessed the league leaders having the best possible start when germany striker kuranyi headed them in front in the eighth minute from a freekick played into the area by christian pander .
a short while later asamoah could have put schalke two goals ahead , but his well-taken shot was brilliantly saved by czech goalkeeper jaroslav drobny .

worse was to follow as bundesliga top scorer gekas scored his 19th goal of the season four minutes from the break after being found by a cross from marcel maltritz .
schalke pushed forward in the second half in search of an equalizer as coach slomka brought on forwards halil altintop and soren larsen , as well as offensive midfielder levan kobiashvili .
kuranyi came close with a header against the upright in the 69th minute and they had a confident penalty appeal turned down a short while later .

" as the league leaders looked back on a disasterous 2-1 defeat on friday which cut their lead to two points . virtually six years ago to the day on april 28 , 200 , schalke were in a similar position ahead of their fourth-from-last match as they had a two-point lead over bayern munich .
schalke 's draw in bochum at the time saw bayern draw level on points and a further defeat in stuttgart eventually led to schalke losing the championship on the final day of the season .
the only schalke player who played in that game , gerald asamoah , said earlier this week that it remained a painful memory .
" we lost the championship in bochum six years ago . "
the schalke fans must have been able to almost taste the ominous sense of history repeating as goals by zvjezdan misimovic and theofanis gekas gave relegation-troubled bochum a come-back victory after kevin kuranyi had put schalke ahead early in the game .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi 's opener was not enough in the end the defeat keeps schalke on 62 points , two more than werder bremen and four more than vfb stuttgart , although both have a game in hand .
bremen can move ahead of schalke on sunday with a victory at arminia bielefeld , while stuttgart have a chance of moving within a point of the leaders if they win at bottom club borussia mönchengladbach .
slomka blames ref for defeat schalke coach mirko slomka criticised the referee after the game saying that he had failed to give his side two penalties .
" it is a pity that a game and possibly even more is decided in such a manner , " the usually pragmatic coach said after the game .
" we no longer have it in our own hands .
i am no longer 100 per cent sure that we will win the championship , " he added .
a capacity crowd watching the ruhr derby on friday witnessed the league leaders having the best possible start when germany striker kuranyi headed them in front in the eighth minute from a freekick played into the area by christian pander .
a short while later asamoah could have put schalke two goals ahead , but his well-taken shot was brilliantly saved by czech goalkeeper jaroslav drobny .
bochum fight back rocks title hopefuls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the topsy-turvy game eventually went bochum 's way the visitors were made to pay for their missed chances as bosnian midfielder misimovic leveled matters in the 33rd minute with a header after two schalke defenders hindered each other .
worse was to follow as bundesliga top scorer gekas scored his 19th goal of the season four minutes from the break after being found by a cross from marcel maltritz .
schalke pushed forward in the second half in search of an equalizer as coach slomka brought on forwards halil altintop and soren larsen , as well as offensive midfielder levan kobiashvili .
kuranyi came close with a header against the upright in the 69th minute and they had a confident penalty appeal turned down a short while later .

a shocking two-thirds of the soldiers would not recommend military service to friends and relatives . the poll of 45,000 soldiers of the german army showed that recent budget cuts and scandals have taken a serious toll on morale in the bundeswehr .
german soldiers are so unhappy with their work that many regret having ever joined the army , the study by the armed forces association shows .
two out of three said they feel let down by the government , especially by the defense ministry .
the armed forces association represents the interests of germany 's professional soldiers .
the chairman of the association , says he is not surprised by the result .
he blames the dissatisfaction on a massive lack of funding which began at the beginning of the 1990s .
“ we do not doubt that all the problems and concerns that have come to light now are due to poor funding , " gertz told dw-radio .
" if we do not act now , the soldiers will be so frustrated that they simply wo n't be able to do their job properly . ”
bad image hurts recruiting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent scandals have hurt recruiting efforts the poll is another huge blow to the bundeswehr , whose reputation has suffered badly in recent months because of scandals about working conditions and abuse of recruits .
gertz fears that even fewer german youngsters will want to join the army and the bundeswehr recruitment problems will continue to multiply .
under germany 's conscription law , young men have to serve in the bundeswehr or do social work for nine months .
for girls participation in both options is voluntary .
a sampling of young people on the streets of berlin elicited derisive comments about a career in the bundeswehr .
" i do n't like military things because i do n't like the hierarchies , " a woman said .
" i do n't like these military structures and i think nowadays that going to the military is a waste of time , " a young man said .
" i do n't like these sorts of hierarchies and getting commands from people who are maybe less intelligent than you are . "
" i did n't see any sense in romping through the forest and playing war , " a young man said of his decision not to join .
missions not well explained bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers would n't recommend their job to friends a 60-year-old man said he left the army as a youngster after only six weeks and encourages young people to do the same .
" it 's a very stupid job because in fact you have a license to kill , " he said .
soldiers are aware of this type of criticism .
seven of 10 soldiers said they feel the government does not properly explain the purpose of foreign missions , according to the study .
almost the same number of soldiers complains that the armed a forces are poorly equipped for such tasks .

the meeting , organized by the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies , adopted a resolution calling for a " fair and just solution " in ongoing cases relating to compensation claims or restitution demands for art works sold under duress or confiscated by the nazis .
" the institutions have to act and trace possible heirs , " julius h schoeps , director of the mendelssohn center , told german news agency dpa ahead of the conference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 28.04.2007 european alliance aims to rid the world of malaria großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mosquito nets are one way to halt malaria infection , but much more could be done ten organizations from five european countries have joined forces to put an end to the scourge of malaria within a few years .
money is the key to success . " our vision is a world free of malaria within the next couple of years , " said jörg maas , the foundation 's executive director , at the launch of the european alliance against malaria in berlin .
the organizations started the initiative " to encourage donor governments , particularly in europe and the north , to provide more funding for the fight against malaria , " he said .
the alliance is made up of 10 organizations from britain , belgium , france , germany and spain , and includes the german red cross and the german foundation for world population .
malaria remains a major problem , especially for the world 's children .
the mosquito-borne disease kills up to three million people each year .
the vast majority of those deaths occur in sub-saharan africa , mostly among children under the age of five .
the disease is also a huge barrier to development .
in africa alone , malaria is thought to cause an estimated $ 12 billion in lost gdp each year .
at the same time , simple preventive measures could drastically reduce the number of malaria cases .
the use of bed nets treated with insecticide could bring about a 25 percent fall in mortality .
more to be done a key measure to quell the spread of the disease is the use of insecticide-treated bed nets .
they prevent mosquitoes carrying the disease from biting people and can reduce mortality by up to 25 percent alone for the cost of about $ 10 -lrb- 7 euros -rrb- per net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty percent of the world population is threatened by malaria the german red cross distributed 18,000 mosquito nets in sudan in december , but sending thousands of bed nets to africa was n't enough , said rudolf seiters , the organization 's head .
people also needed to be shown how to use the nets effectively .
other means to fight the disease could be improved .
" we need to make sure drugs to treat malaria are the most effective ones available to reduce death , " peter salama , head of global health at the united nations children 's fund , unicef , told dw-radio .
new combined treatments for malaria were developed in the 1990s in response to a resurgence of the disease and mounting evidence that the parasite carried by the mosquito was growing resistant to traditional " monotherapies " like chloroquine .
since then , funding for combined treatments has increased significantly through bilateral and multilateral aid , corporate assistance , and national government programs in malarial countries .
but difficulties in the drug purchase and delivery processes as well as distribution of mosquito nets persist .
combined efforts indeed , the main hindrance to eradicating the disease is a lack of money .
" there 's a global requirement of about $ 3 billion a year to scale up those interventions … and currently we have way below $ 1 billion per year for malaria resources , " said salama .
" so we really have a critical gap there of more than $ 2 billion a year . "
that 's where the european alliance against malaria could make a difference .
closer coordination between european governments could yield lasting results in the fight against malaria .
" all the means necessary to eradicate malaria are already available , but the quality of strategy is not good enough to reach the goal , " said the project 's coordinator , stecy yghemonos .
" so we think if european governments are more focused on the strategy , the situation can really be improved . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insecticide keeps mosquitos away improved strategy means not only increasing the overall amount of funding , but also ensuring the money is spent on the most effective programs , and sent where it 's most needed .
taking responsibility at the launch , germany 's development minister was critical of rich counties ' efforts to fight the disease .
" if malaria was a disease that was an immediate threat to the industrial countries , i 'm very sure that there would already be the appropriate medication that could be quickly employed , " heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said at the launch .
" but so far , malaria is a disease that mainly effects developing countries and that 's why it 's important that we draw attention to this situation and that we live up to our responsibility , for we can not leave people in these countries alone with this situation .

-lrb- 24.04.2007 -rrb- german aids action plan aims to revive awareness the german cabinet approved a national action plan against the spread of hiv and aids , which focuses on increased preventive measures and research into new strains of drug-resistant viruses .

money is the key to success . " our vision is a world free of malaria within the next couple of years , " said jörg maas , the foundation 's executive director , at the launch of the european alliance against malaria in berlin .
the organizations started the initiative " to encourage donor governments , particularly in europe and the north , to provide more funding for the fight against malaria , " he said .
the alliance is made up of 10 organizations from britain , belgium , france , germany and spain , and includes the german red cross and the german foundation for world population .
malaria remains a major problem , especially for the world 's children .
the mosquito-borne disease kills up to three million people each year .
the vast majority of those deaths occur in sub-saharan africa , mostly among children under the age of five .
the disease is also a huge barrier to development .
in africa alone , malaria is thought to cause an estimated $ 12 billion in lost gdp each year .
at the same time , simple preventive measures could drastically reduce the number of malaria cases .
the use of bed nets treated with insecticide could bring about a 25 percent fall in mortality .
more to be done a key measure to quell the spread of the disease is the use of insecticide-treated bed nets .
they prevent mosquitoes carrying the disease from biting people and can reduce mortality by up to 25 percent alone for the cost of about $ 10 -lrb- 7 euros -rrb- per net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty percent of the world population is threatened by malaria the german red cross distributed 18,000 mosquito nets in sudan in december , but sending thousands of bed nets to africa was n't enough , said rudolf seiters , the organization 's head .
people also needed to be shown how to use the nets effectively .
other means to fight the disease could be improved .
" we need to make sure drugs to treat malaria are the most effective ones available to reduce death , " peter salama , head of global health at the united nations children 's fund , unicef , told dw-radio .
new combined treatments for malaria were developed in the 1990s in response to a resurgence of the disease and mounting evidence that the parasite carried by the mosquito was growing resistant to traditional " monotherapies " like chloroquine .
since then , funding for combined treatments has increased significantly through bilateral and multilateral aid , corporate assistance , and national government programs in malarial countries .
but difficulties in the drug purchase and delivery processes as well as distribution of mosquito nets persist .
combined efforts indeed , the main hindrance to eradicating the disease is a lack of money .
" there 's a global requirement of about $ 3 billion a year to scale up those interventions … and currently we have way below $ 1 billion per year for malaria resources , " said salama .
" so we really have a critical gap there of more than $ 2 billion a year . "
that 's where the european alliance against malaria could make a difference .
closer coordination between european governments could yield lasting results in the fight against malaria .
" all the means necessary to eradicate malaria are already available , but the quality of strategy is not good enough to reach the goal , " said the project 's coordinator , stecy yghemonos .
" so we think if european governments are more focused on the strategy , the situation can really be improved . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insecticide keeps mosquitos away improved strategy means not only increasing the overall amount of funding , but also ensuring the money is spent on the most effective programs , and sent where it 's most needed .
taking responsibility at the launch , germany 's development minister was critical of rich counties ' efforts to fight the disease .
" if malaria was a disease that was an immediate threat to the industrial countries , i 'm very sure that there would already be the appropriate medication that could be quickly employed , " heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said at the launch .
" but so far , malaria is a disease that mainly effects developing countries and that 's why it 's important that we draw attention to this situation and that we live up to our responsibility , for we can not leave people in these countries alone with this situation . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel pledges to keep africa on international agenda german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday that the world 's industrialized countries do not need to set new goals to help the developing world but keep the promises they have already made .

money is the key to success . " our vision is a world free of malaria within the next couple of years , " said jörg maas , the foundation 's executive director , at the launch of the european alliance against malaria in berlin .
the organizations started the initiative " to encourage donor governments , particularly in europe and the north , to provide more funding for the fight against malaria , " he said .
the alliance is made up of 10 organizations from britain , belgium , france , germany and spain , and includes the german red cross and the german foundation for world population .
malaria remains a major problem , especially for the world 's children .
the mosquito-borne disease kills up to three million people each year .
the vast majority of those deaths occur in sub-saharan africa , mostly among children under the age of five .
the disease is also a huge barrier to development .
in africa alone , malaria is thought to cause an estimated $ 12 billion in lost gdp each year .
at the same time , simple preventive measures could drastically reduce the number of malaria cases .
the use of bed nets treated with insecticide could bring about a 25 percent fall in mortality .
more to be done a key measure to quell the spread of the disease is the use of insecticide-treated bed nets .
they prevent mosquitoes carrying the disease from biting people and can reduce mortality by up to 25 percent alone for the cost of about $ 10 -lrb- 7 euros -rrb- per net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty percent of the world population is threatened by malaria the german red cross distributed 18,000 mosquito nets in sudan in december , but sending thousands of bed nets to africa was n't enough , said rudolf seiters , the organization 's head .
people also needed to be shown how to use the nets effectively .
other means to fight the disease could be improved .
" we need to make sure drugs to treat malaria are the most effective ones available to reduce death , " peter salama , head of global health at the united nations children 's fund , unicef , told dw-radio .
new combined treatments for malaria were developed in the 1990s in response to a resurgence of the disease and mounting evidence that the parasite carried by the mosquito was growing resistant to traditional " monotherapies " like chloroquine .
since then , funding for combined treatments has increased significantly through bilateral and multilateral aid , corporate assistance , and national government programs in malarial countries .
but difficulties in the drug purchase and delivery processes as well as distribution of mosquito nets persist .
combined efforts indeed , the main hindrance to eradicating the disease is a lack of money .
" there 's a global requirement of about $ 3 billion a year to scale up those interventions … and currently we have way below $ 1 billion per year for malaria resources , " said salama .
" so we really have a critical gap there of more than $ 2 billion a year . "
that 's where the european alliance against malaria could make a difference .
closer coordination between european governments could yield lasting results in the fight against malaria .
" all the means necessary to eradicate malaria are already available , but the quality of strategy is not good enough to reach the goal , " said the project 's coordinator , stecy yghemonos .
" so we think if european governments are more focused on the strategy , the situation can really be improved . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insecticide keeps mosquitos away improved strategy means not only increasing the overall amount of funding , but also ensuring the money is spent on the most effective programs , and sent where it 's most needed .
taking responsibility at the launch , germany 's development minister was critical of rich counties ' efforts to fight the disease .
" if malaria was a disease that was an immediate threat to the industrial countries , i 'm very sure that there would already be the appropriate medication that could be quickly employed , " heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said at the launch .
" but so far , malaria is a disease that mainly effects developing countries and that 's why it 's important that we draw attention to this situation and that we live up to our responsibility , for we can not leave people in these countries alone with this situation .

the meeting , organized by the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies , adopted a resolution calling for a " fair and just solution " in ongoing cases relating to compensation claims or restitution demands for art works sold under duress or confiscated by the nazis .
" the institutions have to act and trace possible heirs , " julius h schoeps , director of the mendelssohn center , told german news agency dpa ahead of the conference .

the three-day meeting reminded germany of the commitments it made to the 1998 washington conference on nazi-confiscated art when it pledged to do everything in its power to identify paintings that had not been returned to their owners .

in a high-profile case last november , kirchner 's " berlin street scene " was sold at a new york auction for $ 38 million -lrb- 28 million euros -rrb- after being returned by a berlin museum to the granddaughter of its former owner , jewish art collector alfred hess . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany rejects request to return posters disowned by nazis a german government commission has ruled that some 4,000 posters worth millions should n't be returned to the family of a jew who the nazis stripped of his possessions .

a shocking two-thirds of the soldiers would not recommend military service to friends and relatives . the poll of 45,000 soldiers of the german army showed that recent budget cuts and scandals have taken a serious toll on morale in the bundeswehr .
german soldiers are so unhappy with their work that many regret having ever joined the army , the study by the armed forces association shows .
two out of three said they feel let down by the government , especially by the defense ministry .
the armed forces association represents the interests of germany 's professional soldiers .
the chairman of the association , says he is not surprised by the result .
he blames the dissatisfaction on a massive lack of funding which began at the beginning of the 1990s .
“ we do not doubt that all the problems and concerns that have come to light now are due to poor funding , " gertz told dw-radio .
" if we do not act now , the soldiers will be so frustrated that they simply wo n't be able to do their job properly . ”
bad image hurts recruiting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent scandals have hurt recruiting efforts the poll is another huge blow to the bundeswehr , whose reputation has suffered badly in recent months because of scandals about working conditions and abuse of recruits .
gertz fears that even fewer german youngsters will want to join the army and the bundeswehr recruitment problems will continue to multiply .
under germany 's conscription law , young men have to serve in the bundeswehr or do social work for nine months .
for girls participation in both options is voluntary .
a sampling of young people on the streets of berlin elicited derisive comments about a career in the bundeswehr .
" i do n't like military things because i do n't like the hierarchies , " a woman said .
" i do n't like these military structures and i think nowadays that going to the military is a waste of time , " a young man said .
" i do n't like these sorts of hierarchies and getting commands from people who are maybe less intelligent than you are . "
" i did n't see any sense in romping through the forest and playing war , " a young man said of his decision not to join .
missions not well explained bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers would n't recommend their job to friends a 60-year-old man said he left the army as a youngster after only six weeks and encourages young people to do the same .
" it 's a very stupid job because in fact you have a license to kill , " he said .
soldiers are aware of this type of criticism .
seven of 10 soldiers said they feel the government does not properly explain the purpose of foreign missions , according to the study .
almost the same number of soldiers complains that the armed a forces are poorly equipped for such tasks .

the two leaders had also discussed putin 's warning , issued to the russian parliament thursday , that russia would declare a moratorium on the 1990 conventional forces in europe treaty , if the us did not back down on the missile shield .
merkel and putin both attached great significance to relations between the european union and russia , the spokesman said .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has adopted a moderate tone in the controversy , pressing the case for the stationing of interceptor missiles in poland along with a radar station in the czech republic to be taken up at nato level .
the us initially preferred bilateral arrangements with poland and the czech republic .
steinmeier 's position came in for criticism from conservative members of merkel 's broad coalition , who urged a stronger line against russia .
the government spokesman said merkel had discussed a range of issues with putin , including the situation in ukraine and the eu- russian summit may 17-18 .
germany currently holds the eu presidency .
putin expresses russian anger at estonian riots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots have been raging in tallinn since thursday night the chancellor also breached the topic of the escalating unrest in estonia , which reached a deadly peak saturday when a russian national was killed in the estonian capital during unrest sparked by the removal of a soviet-era war memorial .
a surge in anti-estonian sentiment was in evidence on the streets of moscow and other russian cities with protestors out in force , newspapers voicing outrage and shoppers boycotting goods from their baltic neighbour .
putin had voiced " serious concern " over the events in tallinn during the telephone conversation with gmerkel , a kremlin spokeswoman said .
violence over monument leads to a russian death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statue was removed under cover of darkness early friday the row over the removal of a soviet war memorial from tallinn 's centre erupted in riots that began there last thursday , leading to 900 arrests and the death of a russian citizen identified by officials only as dmitri .
estonians see the bronze memorial as a symbol of 50 years of soviet occupation following world war ii .
the estonian authorities removed the statue from the center of tallinn early friday after the first night of rioting , in which dmitri was killed .
the german government statement saturday said merkel had urged both putin and estonian prime minister andrus ansip to keep a lid on the row by showing restraint and restoring parliamentary contacts as soon as possible .
the german government had suggested that the parliaments of the two countries should engage in direct contact over the conflict regarding the removal of the soviet war memorial , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said .
demonstrators target estonian consulate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian and russian protestors clashed with each other and police but at the estonian consulate in moscow about 150 members of two pro-kremlin youth groups protested for a second day , chanting : " fascism will not win ! "

the two leaders had also discussed putin 's warning , issued to the russian parliament thursday , that russia would declare a moratorium on the 1990 conventional forces in europe treaty , if the us did not back down on the missile shield .
merkel and putin both attached great significance to relations between the european union and russia , the spokesman said .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has adopted a moderate tone in the controversy , pressing the case for the stationing of interceptor missiles in poland along with a radar station in the czech republic to be taken up at nato level .
the us initially preferred bilateral arrangements with poland and the czech republic .
steinmeier 's position came in for criticism from conservative members of merkel 's broad coalition , who urged a stronger line against russia .
the government spokesman said merkel had discussed a range of issues with putin , including the situation in ukraine and the eu- russian summit may 17-18 .
germany currently holds the eu presidency .
putin expresses russian anger at estonian riots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots have been raging in tallinn since thursday night the chancellor also breached the topic of the escalating unrest in estonia , which reached a deadly peak saturday when a russian national was killed in the estonian capital during unrest sparked by the removal of a soviet-era war memorial .
a surge in anti-estonian sentiment was in evidence on the streets of moscow and other russian cities with protestors out in force , newspapers voicing outrage and shoppers boycotting goods from their baltic neighbour .
putin had voiced " serious concern " over the events in tallinn during the telephone conversation with gmerkel , a kremlin spokeswoman said .
violence over monument leads to a russian death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statue was removed under cover of darkness early friday the row over the removal of a soviet war memorial from tallinn 's centre erupted in riots that began there last thursday , leading to 900 arrests and the death of a russian citizen identified by officials only as dmitri .
estonians see the bronze memorial as a symbol of 50 years of soviet occupation following world war ii .
the estonian authorities removed the statue from the center of tallinn early friday after the first night of rioting , in which dmitri was killed .
the german government statement saturday said merkel had urged both putin and estonian prime minister andrus ansip to keep a lid on the row by showing restraint and restoring parliamentary contacts as soon as possible .
the german government had suggested that the parliaments of the two countries should engage in direct contact over the conflict regarding the removal of the soviet war memorial , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said .

" it is important that the military leaves the remit of democracy to the democratically elected government , " eu enlargement commissioner , ollie rehn , said in a statement .
his comments follows an army warning issued on friday that the military would defend turkey 's secularist system after parliament failed to approve the ruling party 's candidate for president .
" this is a test case if the turkish armed forces respect democratic secularism and the democratic arrangement of civil-military relations , " rehn said .
in friday 's first round of voting , the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- candidate , abdullah gul , narrowly failed to win .
gul , who is also foreign minister , secured 357 votes - just 10 short of the 367 , or two thirds of all deputies needed to win in the first round .
the main secular opposition party boycotted the vote and said it would challenge the election in court .
army blames akp for rising anti-secularism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army has led three coups since 1960 in its statement released late friday , the military accused the akp , the offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , of failing to prevent rising anti-secular activity in the country .
the turkish army , responsible for three past coups , warned that it is determined to defend the country 's secular system .
" the problem that recently came to the forefront of the presidential election process has focused on the issue of questioning secularism .
the turkish armed forces are observing this situation with concern , " the army said .
" the turkish armed forces ... will openly and clearly display their position and attitude when necessary .
no one should doubt this , " it warned .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has yet to respond to the army statement .
the akp 's nomination of gul has fanned unease in an increasingly polarised society where many fear the secular order is under threat from a growing islamist influence .
many suspect akp of an islamist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , left , with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan many are unconvinced by the akp 's arguments that it has disawoved its islamist past and fear the government will have a free hand to implement a suspected islamist agenda that will erode the separation of state and religion if gul is elected .
the turkish armed forces , which see themselves as the guardians of the secular system , seized power in 1960 , 1971 and 1980 and forced the resignation in 1997 of the country 's first islamist prime minister , necmettin erbakan .
the main opposition republican people 's party , which strongly opposes the idea of a former islamist becoming president , on friday evening petitioned the constitutional court to cancel the first round of voting , citing violation of a quorum rule .
if the court annuls the vote , general elections - originally scheduled for november 4 - must be called within 90 days .
if the constitutional court does not cancel the vote , parliament will hold a second round on wednesday , probably with a similar result , but gul is virtually certain to be elected in the third round on may 9 , when an absolute majority of 276 will suffice .
turkish media takes army threat seriously bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media says fast poiltical action will negate the army 's fears the turkish press on saturday urged the government to call early elections to prevent it from plunging into a deep crisis .
in a front-page editorial , the popular daily vatan urged all political parties to take the army statement seriously .
" the quickest way to save turkey and its future is to convene parliament at once , hold elections as speedily as possible and prove to the world that turkey is mature enough to resolve its problems democratically , " it said .
many commentators accused prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's akp of raising tensions and not seeking a consensus with the opposition on the choice for the presidency , which is a non-partisan office , but relying on his comfortable parliamentary majority to have his way .
erdogan 's detractors accuse him of abusing his nearly two-thirds parliamentary majority garnered with only one third of the vote in the 2002 vote - thanks to turkey 's much-criticized electoral system - to put an islamist in the presidency seen as the last bastion of secularism in turkey .
dozens of non-governmental organizations have called for a rally in istanbul sunday to show their support for the secular system , similar to one in ankara two weeks ago which drew up up to 1.5 million people , acording to some estimates .
the akp was born out of erbakan 's party , banned for anti-secular activities the year after it was ousted from power , but argues that it has since evolved and is committed to the secular system .
secularists cite its unsuccessful attempts to criminalise adultery , restrict alcohol sales and lift a ban islamic headsarves in government offices and universities as evidence that the party has not changed . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish presidential race divides country foreign minister abdullah gul 's bid to become turkish president is exposing divisions between the islamist-rooted government and its secular elite .

" as the league leaders looked back on a disasterous 2-1 defeat on friday which cut their lead to two points . virtually six years ago to the day on april 28 , 200 , schalke were in a similar position ahead of their fourth-from-last match as they had a two-point lead over bayern munich .
schalke 's draw in bochum at the time saw bayern draw level on points and a further defeat in stuttgart eventually led to schalke losing the championship on the final day of the season .
the only schalke player who played in that game , gerald asamoah , said earlier this week that it remained a painful memory .
" we lost the championship in bochum six years ago . "
the schalke fans must have been able to almost taste the ominous sense of history repeating as goals by zvjezdan misimovic and theofanis gekas gave relegation-troubled bochum a come-back victory after kevin kuranyi had put schalke ahead early in the game .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi 's opener was not enough in the end the defeat keeps schalke on 62 points , two more than werder bremen and four more than vfb stuttgart , although both have a game in hand .
bremen can move ahead of schalke on sunday with a victory at arminia bielefeld , while stuttgart have a chance of moving within a point of the leaders if they win at bottom club borussia mönchengladbach .
slomka blames ref for defeat schalke coach mirko slomka criticised the referee after the game saying that he had failed to give his side two penalties .
" it is a pity that a game and possibly even more is decided in such a manner , " the usually pragmatic coach said after the game .
" we no longer have it in our own hands .
i am no longer 100 per cent sure that we will win the championship , " he added .
a capacity crowd watching the ruhr derby on friday witnessed the league leaders having the best possible start when germany striker kuranyi headed them in front in the eighth minute from a freekick played into the area by christian pander .
a short while later asamoah could have put schalke two goals ahead , but his well-taken shot was brilliantly saved by czech goalkeeper jaroslav drobny .

worse was to follow as bundesliga top scorer gekas scored his 19th goal of the season four minutes from the break after being found by a cross from marcel maltritz .
schalke pushed forward in the second half in search of an equalizer as coach slomka brought on forwards halil altintop and soren larsen , as well as offensive midfielder levan kobiashvili .
kuranyi came close with a header against the upright in the 69th minute and they had a confident penalty appeal turned down a short while later .

the meeting , organized by the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies , adopted a resolution calling for a " fair and just solution " in ongoing cases relating to compensation claims or restitution demands for art works sold under duress or confiscated by the nazis .
" the institutions have to act and trace possible heirs , " julius h schoeps , director of the mendelssohn center , told german news agency dpa ahead of the conference .

the three-day meeting reminded germany of the commitments it made to the 1998 washington conference on nazi-confiscated art when it pledged to do everything in its power to identify paintings that had not been returned to their owners .

the two leaders had also discussed putin 's warning , issued to the russian parliament thursday , that russia would declare a moratorium on the 1990 conventional forces in europe treaty , if the us did not back down on the missile shield .
merkel and putin both attached great significance to relations between the european union and russia , the spokesman said .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has adopted a moderate tone in the controversy , pressing the case for the stationing of interceptor missiles in poland along with a radar station in the czech republic to be taken up at nato level .
the us initially preferred bilateral arrangements with poland and the czech republic .
steinmeier 's position came in for criticism from conservative members of merkel 's broad coalition , who urged a stronger line against russia .
the government spokesman said merkel had discussed a range of issues with putin , including the situation in ukraine and the eu- russian summit may 17-18 .
germany currently holds the eu presidency .

estonians see the bronze memorial as a symbol of 50 years of soviet occupation following world war ii .
the estonian authorities removed the statue from the center of tallinn early friday after the first night of rioting , in which dmitri was killed .
the german government statement saturday said merkel had urged both putin and estonian prime minister andrus ansip to keep a lid on the row by showing restraint and restoring parliamentary contacts as soon as possible .
the german government had suggested that the parliaments of the two countries should engage in direct contact over the conflict regarding the removal of the soviet war memorial , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said .

" in the next 48 hours all goods of estonian origin will be removed from the assortment of products offered by our shops , " the spokesman said .
newspapers also voiced their indignation .
" we are finally convinced .
estonia is a fascist state , " thundered the moskovsky kosmolets tabloid , which in its headline used a stylized " ss " symbol in place of the letter " s " in the word estonia .
the row marks a new low in relations between the countries , which have not seen eye-to-eye since the soviet union 's 1991 collapse and the restoration of estonia 's independence .

" it is important that the military leaves the remit of democracy to the democratically elected government , " eu enlargement commissioner , ollie rehn , said in a statement .
his comments follows an army warning issued on friday that the military would defend turkey 's secularist system after parliament failed to approve the ruling party 's candidate for president .
" this is a test case if the turkish armed forces respect democratic secularism and the democratic arrangement of civil-military relations , " rehn said .
in friday 's first round of voting , the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- candidate , abdullah gul , narrowly failed to win .
gul , who is also foreign minister , secured 357 votes - just 10 short of the 367 , or two thirds of all deputies needed to win in the first round .
the main secular opposition party boycotted the vote and said it would challenge the election in court .

the turkish army , responsible for three past coups , warned that it is determined to defend the country 's secular system .
" the problem that recently came to the forefront of the presidential election process has focused on the issue of questioning secularism .
the turkish armed forces are observing this situation with concern , " the army said .
" the turkish armed forces ... will openly and clearly display their position and attitude when necessary .
no one should doubt this , " it warned .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has yet to respond to the army statement .

the turkish armed forces , which see themselves as the guardians of the secular system , seized power in 1960 , 1971 and 1980 and forced the resignation in 1997 of the country 's first islamist prime minister , necmettin erbakan .
the main opposition republican people 's party , which strongly opposes the idea of a former islamist becoming president , on friday evening petitioned the constitutional court to cancel the first round of voting , citing violation of a quorum rule .

" the quickest way to save turkey and its future is to convene parliament at once , hold elections as speedily as possible and prove to the world that turkey is mature enough to resolve its problems democratically , " it said .
many commentators accused prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's akp of raising tensions and not seeking a consensus with the opposition on the choice for the presidency , which is a non-partisan office , but relying on his comfortable parliamentary majority to have his way .
erdogan 's detractors accuse him of abusing his nearly two-thirds parliamentary majority garnered with only one third of the vote in the 2002 vote - thanks to turkey 's much-criticized electoral system - to put an islamist in the presidency seen as the last bastion of secularism in turkey .
dozens of non-governmental organizations have called for a rally in istanbul sunday to show their support for the secular system , similar to one in ankara two weeks ago which drew up up to 1.5 million people , acording to some estimates .

the two leaders had also discussed putin 's warning , issued to the russian parliament thursday , that russia would declare a moratorium on the 1990 conventional forces in europe treaty , if the us did not back down on the missile shield .
merkel and putin both attached great significance to relations between the european union and russia , the spokesman said .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has adopted a moderate tone in the controversy , pressing the case for the stationing of interceptor missiles in poland along with a radar station in the czech republic to be taken up at nato level .
the us initially preferred bilateral arrangements with poland and the czech republic .
steinmeier 's position came in for criticism from conservative members of merkel 's broad coalition , who urged a stronger line against russia .
the government spokesman said merkel had discussed a range of issues with putin , including the situation in ukraine and the eu- russian summit may 17-18 .
germany currently holds the eu presidency .
putin expresses russian anger at estonian riots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots have been raging in tallinn since thursday night the chancellor also breached the topic of the escalating unrest in estonia , which reached a deadly peak saturday when a russian national was killed in the estonian capital during unrest sparked by the removal of a soviet-era war memorial .
a surge in anti-estonian sentiment was in evidence on the streets of moscow and other russian cities with protestors out in force , newspapers voicing outrage and shoppers boycotting goods from their baltic neighbour .
putin had voiced " serious concern " over the events in tallinn during the telephone conversation with gmerkel , a kremlin spokeswoman said .
violence over monument leads to a russian death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statue was removed under cover of darkness early friday the row over the removal of a soviet war memorial from tallinn 's centre erupted in riots that began there last thursday , leading to 900 arrests and the death of a russian citizen identified by officials only as dmitri .
estonians see the bronze memorial as a symbol of 50 years of soviet occupation following world war ii .
the estonian authorities removed the statue from the center of tallinn early friday after the first night of rioting , in which dmitri was killed .
the german government statement saturday said merkel had urged both putin and estonian prime minister andrus ansip to keep a lid on the row by showing restraint and restoring parliamentary contacts as soon as possible .
the german government had suggested that the parliaments of the two countries should engage in direct contact over the conflict regarding the removal of the soviet war memorial , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said .
demonstrators target estonian consulate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian and russian protestors clashed with each other and police but at the estonian consulate in moscow about 150 members of two pro-kremlin youth groups protested for a second day , chanting : " fascism will not win ! "
ria novosti news agency quoted a spokesman at the estonian consulate in moscow , franek persidski , as saying the consulate had temporarily ceased operations because of safety concerns .
in saint petersburg another 100 activists demonstrated outside the estonian consulate , city police said .
in the city of pskov , 20 kilometres -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- east of russia 's border with estonia , several dozen protesters brought an empty coffin to the estonian consulate , ria novosti reported .
they were stopped by police while attempting to unfurl a banner reading : " a spike in the head for the fascist beast , then the grave ! "
amid calls for retaliation against estonia , moscow mayor yury luzhkov urged " russian state and municipal organizations to freeze all forms of financial , economic , business and cultural cooperation with estonian state organizations , " ria-novosti reported .
embargo planned on estonian goods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the violence continues , russia takes steps against estonia the interfax news agency quoted the management of three major supermarket chains as saying they would no longer sell estonian goods .
" we are against the removal of the soldier-liberator in tallinn and consider such actions inadmissible , " interfax quoted a spokesman for the sedmoi kontinent supermarket chain as saying .
" in the next 48 hours all goods of estonian origin will be removed from the assortment of products offered by our shops , " the spokesman said .
newspapers also voiced their indignation .
" we are finally convinced .
estonia is a fascist state , " thundered the moskovsky kosmolets tabloid , which in its headline used a stylized " ss " symbol in place of the letter " s " in the word estonia .
the row marks a new low in relations between the countries , which have not seen eye-to-eye since the soviet union 's 1991 collapse and the restoration of estonia 's independence .
many russians consider the statue in tallinn to be a poignant memorial to the huge losses suffered by the soviet union in defeating nazism and have complained at the status of ethnic russians in estonia , alleging discrimination . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato calls for clarification as putin raises missile stakes nato called for russia to clarify whether it has actually frozen its application of a key arms treaty limiting the number of military forces in europe as president putin warned of an increase in the nuclear threat .

" it is important that the military leaves the remit of democracy to the democratically elected government , " eu enlargement commissioner , ollie rehn , said in a statement .
his comments follows an army warning issued on friday that the military would defend turkey 's secularist system after parliament failed to approve the ruling party 's candidate for president .
" this is a test case if the turkish armed forces respect democratic secularism and the democratic arrangement of civil-military relations , " rehn said .
in friday 's first round of voting , the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- candidate , abdullah gul , narrowly failed to win .
gul , who is also foreign minister , secured 357 votes - just 10 short of the 367 , or two thirds of all deputies needed to win in the first round .
the main secular opposition party boycotted the vote and said it would challenge the election in court .
army blames akp for rising anti-secularism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army has led three coups since 1960 in its statement released late friday , the military accused the akp , the offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , of failing to prevent rising anti-secular activity in the country .
the turkish army , responsible for three past coups , warned that it is determined to defend the country 's secular system .
" the problem that recently came to the forefront of the presidential election process has focused on the issue of questioning secularism .
the turkish armed forces are observing this situation with concern , " the army said .
" the turkish armed forces ... will openly and clearly display their position and attitude when necessary .
no one should doubt this , " it warned .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has yet to respond to the army statement .
the akp 's nomination of gul has fanned unease in an increasingly polarised society where many fear the secular order is under threat from a growing islamist influence .
many suspect akp of an islamist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , left , with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan many are unconvinced by the akp 's arguments that it has disawoved its islamist past and fear the government will have a free hand to implement a suspected islamist agenda that will erode the separation of state and religion if gul is elected .
the turkish armed forces , which see themselves as the guardians of the secular system , seized power in 1960 , 1971 and 1980 and forced the resignation in 1997 of the country 's first islamist prime minister , necmettin erbakan .
the main opposition republican people 's party , which strongly opposes the idea of a former islamist becoming president , on friday evening petitioned the constitutional court to cancel the first round of voting , citing violation of a quorum rule .
if the court annuls the vote , general elections - originally scheduled for november 4 - must be called within 90 days .
if the constitutional court does not cancel the vote , parliament will hold a second round on wednesday , probably with a similar result , but gul is virtually certain to be elected in the third round on may 9 , when an absolute majority of 276 will suffice .

in a front-page editorial , the popular daily vatan urged all political parties to take the army statement seriously .
" the quickest way to save turkey and its future is to convene parliament at once , hold elections as speedily as possible and prove to the world that turkey is mature enough to resolve its problems democratically , " it said .
many commentators accused prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's akp of raising tensions and not seeking a consensus with the opposition on the choice for the presidency , which is a non-partisan office , but relying on his comfortable parliamentary majority to have his way .
erdogan 's detractors accuse him of abusing his nearly two-thirds parliamentary majority garnered with only one third of the vote in the 2002 vote - thanks to turkey 's much-criticized electoral system - to put an islamist in the presidency seen as the last bastion of secularism in turkey .
dozens of non-governmental organizations have called for a rally in istanbul sunday to show their support for the secular system , similar to one in ankara two weeks ago which drew up up to 1.5 million people , acording to some estimates .

money is the key to success . " our vision is a world free of malaria within the next couple of years , " said jörg maas , the foundation 's executive director , at the launch of the european alliance against malaria in berlin .
the organizations started the initiative " to encourage donor governments , particularly in europe and the north , to provide more funding for the fight against malaria , " he said .
the alliance is made up of 10 organizations from britain , belgium , france , germany and spain , and includes the german red cross and the german foundation for world population .
malaria remains a major problem , especially for the world 's children .
the mosquito-borne disease kills up to three million people each year .
the vast majority of those deaths occur in sub-saharan africa , mostly among children under the age of five .
the disease is also a huge barrier to development .
in africa alone , malaria is thought to cause an estimated $ 12 billion in lost gdp each year .
at the same time , simple preventive measures could drastically reduce the number of malaria cases .
the use of bed nets treated with insecticide could bring about a 25 percent fall in mortality .
more to be done a key measure to quell the spread of the disease is the use of insecticide-treated bed nets .
they prevent mosquitoes carrying the disease from biting people and can reduce mortality by up to 25 percent alone for the cost of about $ 10 -lrb- 7 euros -rrb- per net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty percent of the world population is threatened by malaria the german red cross distributed 18,000 mosquito nets in sudan in december , but sending thousands of bed nets to africa was n't enough , said rudolf seiters , the organization 's head .
people also needed to be shown how to use the nets effectively .
other means to fight the disease could be improved .
" we need to make sure drugs to treat malaria are the most effective ones available to reduce death , " peter salama , head of global health at the united nations children 's fund , unicef , told dw-radio .
new combined treatments for malaria were developed in the 1990s in response to a resurgence of the disease and mounting evidence that the parasite carried by the mosquito was growing resistant to traditional " monotherapies " like chloroquine .
since then , funding for combined treatments has increased significantly through bilateral and multilateral aid , corporate assistance , and national government programs in malarial countries .
but difficulties in the drug purchase and delivery processes as well as distribution of mosquito nets persist .
combined efforts indeed , the main hindrance to eradicating the disease is a lack of money .
" there 's a global requirement of about $ 3 billion a year to scale up those interventions … and currently we have way below $ 1 billion per year for malaria resources , " said salama .
" so we really have a critical gap there of more than $ 2 billion a year . "
that 's where the european alliance against malaria could make a difference .
closer coordination between european governments could yield lasting results in the fight against malaria .
" all the means necessary to eradicate malaria are already available , but the quality of strategy is not good enough to reach the goal , " said the project 's coordinator , stecy yghemonos .
" so we think if european governments are more focused on the strategy , the situation can really be improved . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insecticide keeps mosquitos away improved strategy means not only increasing the overall amount of funding , but also ensuring the money is spent on the most effective programs , and sent where it 's most needed .
taking responsibility at the launch , germany 's development minister was critical of rich counties ' efforts to fight the disease .
" if malaria was a disease that was an immediate threat to the industrial countries , i 'm very sure that there would already be the appropriate medication that could be quickly employed , " heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said at the launch .
" but so far , malaria is a disease that mainly effects developing countries and that 's why it 's important that we draw attention to this situation and that we live up to our responsibility , for we can not leave people in these countries alone with this situation .

money is the key to success . " our vision is a world free of malaria within the next couple of years , " said jörg maas , the foundation 's executive director , at the launch of the european alliance against malaria in berlin .
the organizations started the initiative " to encourage donor governments , particularly in europe and the north , to provide more funding for the fight against malaria , " he said .
the alliance is made up of 10 organizations from britain , belgium , france , germany and spain , and includes the german red cross and the german foundation for world population .
malaria remains a major problem , especially for the world 's children .
the mosquito-borne disease kills up to three million people each year .
the vast majority of those deaths occur in sub-saharan africa , mostly among children under the age of five .
the disease is also a huge barrier to development .
in africa alone , malaria is thought to cause an estimated $ 12 billion in lost gdp each year .
at the same time , simple preventive measures could drastically reduce the number of malaria cases .
the use of bed nets treated with insecticide could bring about a 25 percent fall in mortality .
more to be done a key measure to quell the spread of the disease is the use of insecticide-treated bed nets .
they prevent mosquitoes carrying the disease from biting people and can reduce mortality by up to 25 percent alone for the cost of about $ 10 -lrb- 7 euros -rrb- per net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty percent of the world population is threatened by malaria the german red cross distributed 18,000 mosquito nets in sudan in december , but sending thousands of bed nets to africa was n't enough , said rudolf seiters , the organization 's head .
people also needed to be shown how to use the nets effectively .
other means to fight the disease could be improved .
" we need to make sure drugs to treat malaria are the most effective ones available to reduce death , " peter salama , head of global health at the united nations children 's fund , unicef , told dw-radio .
new combined treatments for malaria were developed in the 1990s in response to a resurgence of the disease and mounting evidence that the parasite carried by the mosquito was growing resistant to traditional " monotherapies " like chloroquine .
since then , funding for combined treatments has increased significantly through bilateral and multilateral aid , corporate assistance , and national government programs in malarial countries .
but difficulties in the drug purchase and delivery processes as well as distribution of mosquito nets persist .
combined efforts indeed , the main hindrance to eradicating the disease is a lack of money .
" there 's a global requirement of about $ 3 billion a year to scale up those interventions … and currently we have way below $ 1 billion per year for malaria resources , " said salama .
" so we really have a critical gap there of more than $ 2 billion a year . "
that 's where the european alliance against malaria could make a difference .
closer coordination between european governments could yield lasting results in the fight against malaria .
" all the means necessary to eradicate malaria are already available , but the quality of strategy is not good enough to reach the goal , " said the project 's coordinator , stecy yghemonos .
" so we think if european governments are more focused on the strategy , the situation can really be improved . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insecticide keeps mosquitos away improved strategy means not only increasing the overall amount of funding , but also ensuring the money is spent on the most effective programs , and sent where it 's most needed .
taking responsibility at the launch , germany 's development minister was critical of rich counties ' efforts to fight the disease .
" if malaria was a disease that was an immediate threat to the industrial countries , i 'm very sure that there would already be the appropriate medication that could be quickly employed , " heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said at the launch .
" but so far , malaria is a disease that mainly effects developing countries and that 's why it 's important that we draw attention to this situation and that we live up to our responsibility , for we can not leave people in these countries alone with this situation .

" i think that at this point in time to have also the usa open a channel of communication with iran would be worth thinking about ... on everything , " said solana .
he and larijani held talks in ankara on wednesday and thursday .
" we have to see how much the usa are ready to engage , " he said .
these were their first face-to-face meetings since the un security council imposed a second round of limited sanctions on iran in march over tehran 's refusal to halt uranium enrichment .
more talks are scheduled in two weeks .

these were their first face-to-face meetings since the un security council imposed a second round of limited sanctions on iran in march over tehran 's refusal to halt uranium enrichment .
more talks are scheduled in two weeks .
solana , in his talks with larijani , represented the five permanent members of the security council plus germany .
he said on friday that the talks were " constructive conversations . "
all sides need to be tenacious , says solana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani came to berlin for talks with the eu in september " they were constructive in the sense that it was some potential motion that we have to see if we can exploit in a next meeting we 'll have in about ten days , " he said .
" i do n't want to say at all that the difficulties are overcome , we have many important hurdles that have to be overcome , but we have to be tenacious . "
asked whether larijani and iran 's supreme leader ali khamenei were ready to speak to the united states , based on his conversations with larijani , solana replied : " i say without any hesitation , yes . "
solana was speaking friday after a brussels forum organised by the german marshall fund of the united states .
assistant under secretary of state dan fried , who was also at the brussels conference , said he was not in a position to announce any change in us policy .
" i 'm not going to announce any change to it , " he said .
solana and rice to discuss tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations over iran have improved between the eu and us " we 've been in a far better place working with europe about iran then when we were quarelling with europe about iran , which was the case a couple of years ago , " he added .
" the question of tactics in the way ahead is one -lrb- us secretary of state -rrb- condoleezza rice and solana will be discussing in the days ahead .
our position at the moment is well known . "
washington , which broke off diplomatic relations with iran in 1980 , accuses iran of wanting to develop nuclear weapons - which tehran denies - and of supporting insurgents in iraq .
rice may meet iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki at a conference on security in iraq in egypt on may 3-4 but iran has yet to confirm whether it will attend .
us president george w. bush has said rice , who is set to attend the conference , " could " hold bilateral talks with mottaki should iran decide to participate .

money is the key to success . " our vision is a world free of malaria within the next couple of years , " said jörg maas , the foundation 's executive director , at the launch of the european alliance against malaria in berlin .
the organizations started the initiative " to encourage donor governments , particularly in europe and the north , to provide more funding for the fight against malaria , " he said .
the alliance is made up of 10 organizations from britain , belgium , france , germany and spain , and includes the german red cross and the german foundation for world population .
malaria remains a major problem , especially for the world 's children .
the mosquito-borne disease kills up to three million people each year .
the vast majority of those deaths occur in sub-saharan africa , mostly among children under the age of five .
the disease is also a huge barrier to development .
in africa alone , malaria is thought to cause an estimated $ 12 billion in lost gdp each year .
at the same time , simple preventive measures could drastically reduce the number of malaria cases .
the use of bed nets treated with insecticide could bring about a 25 percent fall in mortality .
more to be done a key measure to quell the spread of the disease is the use of insecticide-treated bed nets .
they prevent mosquitoes carrying the disease from biting people and can reduce mortality by up to 25 percent alone for the cost of about $ 10 -lrb- 7 euros -rrb- per net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty percent of the world population is threatened by malaria the german red cross distributed 18,000 mosquito nets in sudan in december , but sending thousands of bed nets to africa was n't enough , said rudolf seiters , the organization 's head .
people also needed to be shown how to use the nets effectively .
other means to fight the disease could be improved .
" we need to make sure drugs to treat malaria are the most effective ones available to reduce death , " peter salama , head of global health at the united nations children 's fund , unicef , told dw-radio .
new combined treatments for malaria were developed in the 1990s in response to a resurgence of the disease and mounting evidence that the parasite carried by the mosquito was growing resistant to traditional " monotherapies " like chloroquine .
since then , funding for combined treatments has increased significantly through bilateral and multilateral aid , corporate assistance , and national government programs in malarial countries .
but difficulties in the drug purchase and delivery processes as well as distribution of mosquito nets persist .
combined efforts indeed , the main hindrance to eradicating the disease is a lack of money .
" there 's a global requirement of about $ 3 billion a year to scale up those interventions … and currently we have way below $ 1 billion per year for malaria resources , " said salama .
" so we really have a critical gap there of more than $ 2 billion a year . "
that 's where the european alliance against malaria could make a difference .
closer coordination between european governments could yield lasting results in the fight against malaria .
" all the means necessary to eradicate malaria are already available , but the quality of strategy is not good enough to reach the goal , " said the project 's coordinator , stecy yghemonos .
" so we think if european governments are more focused on the strategy , the situation can really be improved . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insecticide keeps mosquitos away improved strategy means not only increasing the overall amount of funding , but also ensuring the money is spent on the most effective programs , and sent where it 's most needed .
taking responsibility at the launch , germany 's development minister was critical of rich counties ' efforts to fight the disease .
" if malaria was a disease that was an immediate threat to the industrial countries , i 'm very sure that there would already be the appropriate medication that could be quickly employed , " heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said at the launch .
" but so far , malaria is a disease that mainly effects developing countries and that 's why it 's important that we draw attention to this situation and that we live up to our responsibility , for we can not leave people in these countries alone with this situation .

schalke 's draw in bochum at the time saw bayern draw level on points and a further defeat in stuttgart eventually led to schalke losing the championship on the final day of the season .

a capacity crowd watching the ruhr derby on friday witnessed the league leaders having the best possible start when germany striker kuranyi headed them in front in the eighth minute from a freekick played into the area by christian pander .

" as the league leaders looked back on a disasterous 2-1 defeat on friday which cut their lead to two points . virtually six years ago to the day on april 28 , 200 , schalke were in a similar position ahead of their fourth-from-last match as they had a two-point lead over bayern munich .
schalke 's draw in bochum at the time saw bayern draw level on points and a further defeat in stuttgart eventually led to schalke losing the championship on the final day of the season .
the only schalke player who played in that game , gerald asamoah , said earlier this week that it remained a painful memory .
" we lost the championship in bochum six years ago . "
the schalke fans must have been able to almost taste the ominous sense of history repeating as goals by zvjezdan misimovic and theofanis gekas gave relegation-troubled bochum a come-back victory after kevin kuranyi had put schalke ahead early in the game .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi 's opener was not enough in the end the defeat keeps schalke on 62 points , two more than werder bremen and four more than vfb stuttgart , although both have a game in hand .
bremen can move ahead of schalke on sunday with a victory at arminia bielefeld , while stuttgart have a chance of moving within a point of the leaders if they win at bottom club borussia mönchengladbach .
slomka blames ref for defeat schalke coach mirko slomka criticised the referee after the game saying that he had failed to give his side two penalties .
" it is a pity that a game and possibly even more is decided in such a manner , " the usually pragmatic coach said after the game .
" we no longer have it in our own hands .
i am no longer 100 per cent sure that we will win the championship , " he added .
a capacity crowd watching the ruhr derby on friday witnessed the league leaders having the best possible start when germany striker kuranyi headed them in front in the eighth minute from a freekick played into the area by christian pander .
a short while later asamoah could have put schalke two goals ahead , but his well-taken shot was brilliantly saved by czech goalkeeper jaroslav drobny .
bochum fight back rocks title hopefuls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the topsy-turvy game eventually went bochum 's way the visitors were made to pay for their missed chances as bosnian midfielder misimovic leveled matters in the 33rd minute with a header after two schalke defenders hindered each other .
worse was to follow as bundesliga top scorer gekas scored his 19th goal of the season four minutes from the break after being found by a cross from marcel maltritz .
schalke pushed forward in the second half in search of an equalizer as coach slomka brought on forwards halil altintop and soren larsen , as well as offensive midfielder levan kobiashvili .
kuranyi came close with a header against the upright in the 69th minute and they had a confident penalty appeal turned down a short while later .
the win mean that bochum move up four places into seventh place on 39 points and have , in all probability , escape relegation . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de local derbies could prove dangerous to schalke 's title chances bochum is geographically within walking distance for bundesliga leaders schalke 04 , but that does n't mean their match there will be a walk in the park as victory is a must for both sides in the ruhr area derby .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 28.04.2007 eu warns turkish army about meddling in presidential elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army sees itself as the guardian of the country 's secular system the european union warned the turkish army on saturday not to interfere in the country 's democratic process amid a dispute over the ruling party 's islamist-rooted candidate to be turkey 's next president . " it is important that the military leaves the remit of democracy to the democratically elected government , " eu enlargement commissioner , ollie rehn , said in a statement .
his comments follows an army warning issued on friday that the military would defend turkey 's secularist system after parliament failed to approve the ruling party 's candidate for president .
" this is a test case if the turkish armed forces respect democratic secularism and the democratic arrangement of civil-military relations , " rehn said .
in friday 's first round of voting , the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- candidate , abdullah gul , narrowly failed to win .
gul , who is also foreign minister , secured 357 votes - just 10 short of the 367 , or two thirds of all deputies needed to win in the first round .
the main secular opposition party boycotted the vote and said it would challenge the election in court .
army blames akp for rising anti-secularism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army has led three coups since 1960 in its statement released late friday , the military accused the akp , the offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , of failing to prevent rising anti-secular activity in the country .
the turkish army , responsible for three past coups , warned that it is determined to defend the country 's secular system .
" the problem that recently came to the forefront of the presidential election process has focused on the issue of questioning secularism .
the turkish armed forces are observing this situation with concern , " the army said .
" the turkish armed forces ... will openly and clearly display their position and attitude when necessary .
no one should doubt this , " it warned .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has yet to respond to the army statement .
the akp 's nomination of gul has fanned unease in an increasingly polarised society where many fear the secular order is under threat from a growing islamist influence .
many suspect akp of an islamist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , left , with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan many are unconvinced by the akp 's arguments that it has disawoved its islamist past and fear the government will have a free hand to implement a suspected islamist agenda that will erode the separation of state and religion if gul is elected .
the turkish armed forces , which see themselves as the guardians of the secular system , seized power in 1960 , 1971 and 1980 and forced the resignation in 1997 of the country 's first islamist prime minister , necmettin erbakan .
the main opposition republican people 's party , which strongly opposes the idea of a former islamist becoming president , on friday evening petitioned the constitutional court to cancel the first round of voting , citing violation of a quorum rule .
if the court annuls the vote , general elections - originally scheduled for november 4 - must be called within 90 days .
if the constitutional court does not cancel the vote , parliament will hold a second round on wednesday , probably with a similar result , but gul is virtually certain to be elected in the third round on may 9 , when an absolute majority of 276 will suffice .
turkish media takes army threat seriously bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media says fast poiltical action will negate the army 's fears the turkish press on saturday urged the government to call early elections to prevent it from plunging into a deep crisis .
in a front-page editorial , the popular daily vatan urged all political parties to take the army statement seriously .
" the quickest way to save turkey and its future is to convene parliament at once , hold elections as speedily as possible and prove to the world that turkey is mature enough to resolve its problems democratically , " it said .
many commentators accused prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's akp of raising tensions and not seeking a consensus with the opposition on the choice for the presidency , which is a non-partisan office , but relying on his comfortable parliamentary majority to have his way .
erdogan 's detractors accuse him of abusing his nearly two-thirds parliamentary majority garnered with only one third of the vote in the 2002 vote - thanks to turkey 's much-criticized electoral system - to put an islamist in the presidency seen as the last bastion of secularism in turkey .
dozens of non-governmental organizations have called for a rally in istanbul sunday to show their support for the secular system , similar to one in ankara two weeks ago which drew up up to 1.5 million people , acording to some estimates .
the akp was born out of erbakan 's party , banned for anti-secular activities the year after it was ousted from power , but argues that it has since evolved and is committed to the secular system .
secularists cite its unsuccessful attempts to criminalise adultery , restrict alcohol sales and lift a ban islamic headsarves in government offices and universities as evidence that the party has not changed . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish presidential race divides country foreign minister abdullah gul 's bid to become turkish president is exposing divisions between the islamist-rooted government and its secular elite .

" i think that at this point in time to have also the usa open a channel of communication with iran would be worth thinking about ... on everything , " said solana .
he and larijani held talks in ankara on wednesday and thursday .
" we have to see how much the usa are ready to engage , " he said .
these were their first face-to-face meetings since the un security council imposed a second round of limited sanctions on iran in march over tehran 's refusal to halt uranium enrichment .
more talks are scheduled in two weeks .
solana , in his talks with larijani , represented the five permanent members of the security council plus germany .
he said on friday that the talks were " constructive conversations . "
all sides need to be tenacious , says solana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani came to berlin for talks with the eu in september " they were constructive in the sense that it was some potential motion that we have to see if we can exploit in a next meeting we 'll have in about ten days , " he said .
" i do n't want to say at all that the difficulties are overcome , we have many important hurdles that have to be overcome , but we have to be tenacious . "
asked whether larijani and iran 's supreme leader ali khamenei were ready to speak to the united states , based on his conversations with larijani , solana replied : " i say without any hesitation , yes . "
solana was speaking friday after a brussels forum organised by the german marshall fund of the united states .
assistant under secretary of state dan fried , who was also at the brussels conference , said he was not in a position to announce any change in us policy .
" i 'm not going to announce any change to it , " he said .

" the question of tactics in the way ahead is one -lrb- us secretary of state -rrb- condoleezza rice and solana will be discussing in the days ahead .
our position at the moment is well known . "
washington , which broke off diplomatic relations with iran in 1980 , accuses iran of wanting to develop nuclear weapons - which tehran denies - and of supporting insurgents in iraq .
rice may meet iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki at a conference on security in iraq in egypt on may 3-4 but iran has yet to confirm whether it will attend .
us president george w. bush has said rice , who is set to attend the conference , " could " hold bilateral talks with mottaki should iran decide to participate .
but he said that there would be no one-to-one talks outside such a context or discussions about tehran 's nuclear program . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran expects " new ideas " from eu to end nuclear standoff iran 's nuclear negotiator ali larijani said wednesday that he expected new ideas from eu foreign policy chief javier solana on breaking the standoff over tehran 's disputed nuclear program .

" it is important that the military leaves the remit of democracy to the democratically elected government , " eu enlargement commissioner , ollie rehn , said in a statement .
his comments follows an army warning issued on friday that the military would defend turkey 's secularist system after parliament failed to approve the ruling party 's candidate for president .
" this is a test case if the turkish armed forces respect democratic secularism and the democratic arrangement of civil-military relations , " rehn said .
in friday 's first round of voting , the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- candidate , abdullah gul , narrowly failed to win .
gul , who is also foreign minister , secured 357 votes - just 10 short of the 367 , or two thirds of all deputies needed to win in the first round .
the main secular opposition party boycotted the vote and said it would challenge the election in court .
army blames akp for rising anti-secularism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army has led three coups since 1960 in its statement released late friday , the military accused the akp , the offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , of failing to prevent rising anti-secular activity in the country .
the turkish army , responsible for three past coups , warned that it is determined to defend the country 's secular system .
" the problem that recently came to the forefront of the presidential election process has focused on the issue of questioning secularism .
the turkish armed forces are observing this situation with concern , " the army said .
" the turkish armed forces ... will openly and clearly display their position and attitude when necessary .
no one should doubt this , " it warned .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has yet to respond to the army statement .
the akp 's nomination of gul has fanned unease in an increasingly polarised society where many fear the secular order is under threat from a growing islamist influence .
many suspect akp of an islamist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , left , with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan many are unconvinced by the akp 's arguments that it has disawoved its islamist past and fear the government will have a free hand to implement a suspected islamist agenda that will erode the separation of state and religion if gul is elected .
the turkish armed forces , which see themselves as the guardians of the secular system , seized power in 1960 , 1971 and 1980 and forced the resignation in 1997 of the country 's first islamist prime minister , necmettin erbakan .
the main opposition republican people 's party , which strongly opposes the idea of a former islamist becoming president , on friday evening petitioned the constitutional court to cancel the first round of voting , citing violation of a quorum rule .
if the court annuls the vote , general elections - originally scheduled for november 4 - must be called within 90 days .
if the constitutional court does not cancel the vote , parliament will hold a second round on wednesday , probably with a similar result , but gul is virtually certain to be elected in the third round on may 9 , when an absolute majority of 276 will suffice .
turkish media takes army threat seriously bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media says fast poiltical action will negate the army 's fears the turkish press on saturday urged the government to call early elections to prevent it from plunging into a deep crisis .
in a front-page editorial , the popular daily vatan urged all political parties to take the army statement seriously .
" the quickest way to save turkey and its future is to convene parliament at once , hold elections as speedily as possible and prove to the world that turkey is mature enough to resolve its problems democratically , " it said .
many commentators accused prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's akp of raising tensions and not seeking a consensus with the opposition on the choice for the presidency , which is a non-partisan office , but relying on his comfortable parliamentary majority to have his way .
erdogan 's detractors accuse him of abusing his nearly two-thirds parliamentary majority garnered with only one third of the vote in the 2002 vote - thanks to turkey 's much-criticized electoral system - to put an islamist in the presidency seen as the last bastion of secularism in turkey .
dozens of non-governmental organizations have called for a rally in istanbul sunday to show their support for the secular system , similar to one in ankara two weeks ago which drew up up to 1.5 million people , acording to some estimates .
the akp was born out of erbakan 's party , banned for anti-secular activities the year after it was ousted from power , but argues that it has since evolved and is committed to the secular system .
secularists cite its unsuccessful attempts to criminalise adultery , restrict alcohol sales and lift a ban islamic headsarves in government offices and universities as evidence that the party has not changed . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish presidential race divides country foreign minister abdullah gul 's bid to become turkish president is exposing divisions between the islamist-rooted government and its secular elite .

erdogan 's detractors accuse him of abusing his nearly two-thirds parliamentary majority garnered with only one third of the vote in the 2002 vote - thanks to turkey 's much-criticized electoral system - to put an islamist in the presidency seen as the last bastion of secularism in turkey .
dozens of non-governmental organizations have called for a rally in istanbul sunday to show their support for the secular system , similar to one in ankara two weeks ago which drew up up to 1.5 million people , acording to some estimates .
the akp was born out of erbakan 's party , banned for anti-secular activities the year after it was ousted from power , but argues that it has since evolved and is committed to the secular system .
secularists cite its unsuccessful attempts to criminalise adultery , restrict alcohol sales and lift a ban islamic headsarves in government offices and universities as evidence that the party has not changed . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish presidential race divides country foreign minister abdullah gul 's bid to become turkish president is exposing divisions between the islamist-rooted government and its secular elite .

" as the league leaders looked back on a disasterous 2-1 defeat on friday which cut their lead to two points . virtually six years ago to the day on april 28 , 200 , schalke were in a similar position ahead of their fourth-from-last match as they had a two-point lead over bayern munich .
schalke 's draw in bochum at the time saw bayern draw level on points and a further defeat in stuttgart eventually led to schalke losing the championship on the final day of the season .

“ we do not doubt that all the problems and concerns that have come to light now are due to poor funding , " gertz told dw-radio .

bad image hurts recruiting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent scandals have hurt recruiting efforts the poll is another huge blow to the bundeswehr , whose reputation has suffered badly in recent months because of scandals about working conditions and abuse of recruits .

under germany 's conscription law , young men have to serve in the bundeswehr or do social work for nine months .
for girls participation in both options is voluntary .
a sampling of young people on the streets of berlin elicited derisive comments about a career in the bundeswehr .
" i do n't like military things because i do n't like the hierarchies , " a woman said .
" i do n't like these military structures and i think nowadays that going to the military is a waste of time , " a young man said .

soldiers are aware of this type of criticism .
seven of 10 soldiers said they feel the government does not properly explain the purpose of foreign missions , according to the study .
almost the same number of soldiers complains that the armed a forces are poorly equipped for such tasks .

a shocking two-thirds of the soldiers would not recommend military service to friends and relatives . the poll of 45,000 soldiers of the german army showed that recent budget cuts and scandals have taken a serious toll on morale in the bundeswehr .
german soldiers are so unhappy with their work that many regret having ever joined the army , the study by the armed forces association shows .
two out of three said they feel let down by the government , especially by the defense ministry .
the armed forces association represents the interests of germany 's professional soldiers .
the chairman of the association , says he is not surprised by the result .
he blames the dissatisfaction on a massive lack of funding which began at the beginning of the 1990s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 28.04.2007 european alliance aims to rid the world of malaria großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mosquito nets are one way to halt malaria infection , but much more could be done ten organizations from five european countries have joined forces to put an end to the scourge of malaria within a few years .
money is the key to success . " our vision is a world free of malaria within the next couple of years , " said jörg maas , the foundation 's executive director , at the launch of the european alliance against malaria in berlin .
the organizations started the initiative " to encourage donor governments , particularly in europe and the north , to provide more funding for the fight against malaria , " he said .
the alliance is made up of 10 organizations from britain , belgium , france , germany and spain , and includes the german red cross and the german foundation for world population .
malaria remains a major problem , especially for the world 's children .
the mosquito-borne disease kills up to three million people each year .
the vast majority of those deaths occur in sub-saharan africa , mostly among children under the age of five .
the disease is also a huge barrier to development .
in africa alone , malaria is thought to cause an estimated $ 12 billion in lost gdp each year .
at the same time , simple preventive measures could drastically reduce the number of malaria cases .
the use of bed nets treated with insecticide could bring about a 25 percent fall in mortality .
more to be done a key measure to quell the spread of the disease is the use of insecticide-treated bed nets .
they prevent mosquitoes carrying the disease from biting people and can reduce mortality by up to 25 percent alone for the cost of about $ 10 -lrb- 7 euros -rrb- per net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty percent of the world population is threatened by malaria the german red cross distributed 18,000 mosquito nets in sudan in december , but sending thousands of bed nets to africa was n't enough , said rudolf seiters , the organization 's head .
people also needed to be shown how to use the nets effectively .
other means to fight the disease could be improved .
" we need to make sure drugs to treat malaria are the most effective ones available to reduce death , " peter salama , head of global health at the united nations children 's fund , unicef , told dw-radio .
new combined treatments for malaria were developed in the 1990s in response to a resurgence of the disease and mounting evidence that the parasite carried by the mosquito was growing resistant to traditional " monotherapies " like chloroquine .
since then , funding for combined treatments has increased significantly through bilateral and multilateral aid , corporate assistance , and national government programs in malarial countries .
but difficulties in the drug purchase and delivery processes as well as distribution of mosquito nets persist .
combined efforts indeed , the main hindrance to eradicating the disease is a lack of money .
" there 's a global requirement of about $ 3 billion a year to scale up those interventions … and currently we have way below $ 1 billion per year for malaria resources , " said salama .
" so we really have a critical gap there of more than $ 2 billion a year . "
that 's where the european alliance against malaria could make a difference .
closer coordination between european governments could yield lasting results in the fight against malaria .
" all the means necessary to eradicate malaria are already available , but the quality of strategy is not good enough to reach the goal , " said the project 's coordinator , stecy yghemonos .
" so we think if european governments are more focused on the strategy , the situation can really be improved . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insecticide keeps mosquitos away improved strategy means not only increasing the overall amount of funding , but also ensuring the money is spent on the most effective programs , and sent where it 's most needed .
taking responsibility at the launch , germany 's development minister was critical of rich counties ' efforts to fight the disease .
" if malaria was a disease that was an immediate threat to the industrial countries , i 'm very sure that there would already be the appropriate medication that could be quickly employed , " heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said at the launch .
" but so far , malaria is a disease that mainly effects developing countries and that 's why it 's important that we draw attention to this situation and that we live up to our responsibility , for we can not leave people in these countries alone with this situation .

money is the key to success . " our vision is a world free of malaria within the next couple of years , " said jörg maas , the foundation 's executive director , at the launch of the european alliance against malaria in berlin .
the organizations started the initiative " to encourage donor governments , particularly in europe and the north , to provide more funding for the fight against malaria , " he said .
the alliance is made up of 10 organizations from britain , belgium , france , germany and spain , and includes the german red cross and the german foundation for world population .
malaria remains a major problem , especially for the world 's children .
the mosquito-borne disease kills up to three million people each year .
the vast majority of those deaths occur in sub-saharan africa , mostly among children under the age of five .
the disease is also a huge barrier to development .
in africa alone , malaria is thought to cause an estimated $ 12 billion in lost gdp each year .
at the same time , simple preventive measures could drastically reduce the number of malaria cases .
the use of bed nets treated with insecticide could bring about a 25 percent fall in mortality .
more to be done a key measure to quell the spread of the disease is the use of insecticide-treated bed nets .
they prevent mosquitoes carrying the disease from biting people and can reduce mortality by up to 25 percent alone for the cost of about $ 10 -lrb- 7 euros -rrb- per net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty percent of the world population is threatened by malaria the german red cross distributed 18,000 mosquito nets in sudan in december , but sending thousands of bed nets to africa was n't enough , said rudolf seiters , the organization 's head .
people also needed to be shown how to use the nets effectively .
other means to fight the disease could be improved .
" we need to make sure drugs to treat malaria are the most effective ones available to reduce death , " peter salama , head of global health at the united nations children 's fund , unicef , told dw-radio .
new combined treatments for malaria were developed in the 1990s in response to a resurgence of the disease and mounting evidence that the parasite carried by the mosquito was growing resistant to traditional " monotherapies " like chloroquine .
since then , funding for combined treatments has increased significantly through bilateral and multilateral aid , corporate assistance , and national government programs in malarial countries .
but difficulties in the drug purchase and delivery processes as well as distribution of mosquito nets persist .
combined efforts indeed , the main hindrance to eradicating the disease is a lack of money .
" there 's a global requirement of about $ 3 billion a year to scale up those interventions … and currently we have way below $ 1 billion per year for malaria resources , " said salama .
" so we really have a critical gap there of more than $ 2 billion a year . "
that 's where the european alliance against malaria could make a difference .
closer coordination between european governments could yield lasting results in the fight against malaria .
" all the means necessary to eradicate malaria are already available , but the quality of strategy is not good enough to reach the goal , " said the project 's coordinator , stecy yghemonos .
" so we think if european governments are more focused on the strategy , the situation can really be improved . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insecticide keeps mosquitos away improved strategy means not only increasing the overall amount of funding , but also ensuring the money is spent on the most effective programs , and sent where it 's most needed .
taking responsibility at the launch , germany 's development minister was critical of rich counties ' efforts to fight the disease .
" if malaria was a disease that was an immediate threat to the industrial countries , i 'm very sure that there would already be the appropriate medication that could be quickly employed , " heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said at the launch .
" but so far , malaria is a disease that mainly effects developing countries and that 's why it 's important that we draw attention to this situation and that we live up to our responsibility , for we can not leave people in these countries alone with this situation .

the meeting , organized by the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies , adopted a resolution calling for a " fair and just solution " in ongoing cases relating to compensation claims or restitution demands for art works sold under duress or confiscated by the nazis .
" the institutions have to act and trace possible heirs , " julius h schoeps , director of the mendelssohn center , told german news agency dpa ahead of the conference .
forgotten commitments ?
the three-day meeting reminded germany of the commitments it made to the 1998 washington conference on nazi-confiscated art when it pledged to do everything in its power to identify paintings that had not been returned to their owners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz marc paintings are also thought to be the subjects of restitution claims german museums are concerned that they could loose some of their most important paintings because of a contentious law governing works of art confiscated from jews by the nazis .
experts estimate 100 paintings by german expressionists are subjects of restitution claims , among them works by ernst ludwig kirchner and franz marc , a founder of the blue rider group .
in a high-profile case last november , kirchner 's " berlin street scene " was sold at a new york auction for $ 38 million -lrb- 28 million euros -rrb- after being returned by a berlin museum to the granddaughter of its former owner , jewish art collector alfred hess . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany rejects request to return posters disowned by nazis a german government commission has ruled that some 4,000 posters worth millions should n't be returned to the family of a jew who the nazis stripped of his possessions .

the two leaders had also discussed putin 's warning , issued to the russian parliament thursday , that russia would declare a moratorium on the 1990 conventional forces in europe treaty , if the us did not back down on the missile shield .
merkel and putin both attached great significance to relations between the european union and russia , the spokesman said .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has adopted a moderate tone in the controversy , pressing the case for the stationing of interceptor missiles in poland along with a radar station in the czech republic to be taken up at nato level .
the us initially preferred bilateral arrangements with poland and the czech republic .
steinmeier 's position came in for criticism from conservative members of merkel 's broad coalition , who urged a stronger line against russia .
the government spokesman said merkel had discussed a range of issues with putin , including the situation in ukraine and the eu- russian summit may 17-18 .
germany currently holds the eu presidency .
putin expresses russian anger at estonian riots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots have been raging in tallinn since thursday night the chancellor also breached the topic of the escalating unrest in estonia , which reached a deadly peak saturday when a russian national was killed in the estonian capital during unrest sparked by the removal of a soviet-era war memorial .
a surge in anti-estonian sentiment was in evidence on the streets of moscow and other russian cities with protestors out in force , newspapers voicing outrage and shoppers boycotting goods from their baltic neighbour .
putin had voiced " serious concern " over the events in tallinn during the telephone conversation with gmerkel , a kremlin spokeswoman said .
violence over monument leads to a russian death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statue was removed under cover of darkness early friday the row over the removal of a soviet war memorial from tallinn 's centre erupted in riots that began there last thursday , leading to 900 arrests and the death of a russian citizen identified by officials only as dmitri .
estonians see the bronze memorial as a symbol of 50 years of soviet occupation following world war ii .
the estonian authorities removed the statue from the center of tallinn early friday after the first night of rioting , in which dmitri was killed .
the german government statement saturday said merkel had urged both putin and estonian prime minister andrus ansip to keep a lid on the row by showing restraint and restoring parliamentary contacts as soon as possible .
the german government had suggested that the parliaments of the two countries should engage in direct contact over the conflict regarding the removal of the soviet war memorial , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said .
demonstrators target estonian consulate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian and russian protestors clashed with each other and police but at the estonian consulate in moscow about 150 members of two pro-kremlin youth groups protested for a second day , chanting : " fascism will not win ! "
ria novosti news agency quoted a spokesman at the estonian consulate in moscow , franek persidski , as saying the consulate had temporarily ceased operations because of safety concerns .
in saint petersburg another 100 activists demonstrated outside the estonian consulate , city police said .
in the city of pskov , 20 kilometres -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- east of russia 's border with estonia , several dozen protesters brought an empty coffin to the estonian consulate , ria novosti reported .
they were stopped by police while attempting to unfurl a banner reading : " a spike in the head for the fascist beast , then the grave ! "
amid calls for retaliation against estonia , moscow mayor yury luzhkov urged " russian state and municipal organizations to freeze all forms of financial , economic , business and cultural cooperation with estonian state organizations , " ria-novosti reported .
embargo planned on estonian goods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the violence continues , russia takes steps against estonia the interfax news agency quoted the management of three major supermarket chains as saying they would no longer sell estonian goods .
" we are against the removal of the soldier-liberator in tallinn and consider such actions inadmissible , " interfax quoted a spokesman for the sedmoi kontinent supermarket chain as saying .
" in the next 48 hours all goods of estonian origin will be removed from the assortment of products offered by our shops , " the spokesman said .
newspapers also voiced their indignation .
" we are finally convinced .

" it is important that the military leaves the remit of democracy to the democratically elected government , " eu enlargement commissioner , ollie rehn , said in a statement .
his comments follows an army warning issued on friday that the military would defend turkey 's secularist system after parliament failed to approve the ruling party 's candidate for president .
" this is a test case if the turkish armed forces respect democratic secularism and the democratic arrangement of civil-military relations , " rehn said .
in friday 's first round of voting , the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- candidate , abdullah gul , narrowly failed to win .
gul , who is also foreign minister , secured 357 votes - just 10 short of the 367 , or two thirds of all deputies needed to win in the first round .
the main secular opposition party boycotted the vote and said it would challenge the election in court .
army blames akp for rising anti-secularism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army has led three coups since 1960 in its statement released late friday , the military accused the akp , the offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , of failing to prevent rising anti-secular activity in the country .
the turkish army , responsible for three past coups , warned that it is determined to defend the country 's secular system .
" the problem that recently came to the forefront of the presidential election process has focused on the issue of questioning secularism .
the turkish armed forces are observing this situation with concern , " the army said .
" the turkish armed forces ... will openly and clearly display their position and attitude when necessary .
no one should doubt this , " it warned .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has yet to respond to the army statement .
the akp 's nomination of gul has fanned unease in an increasingly polarised society where many fear the secular order is under threat from a growing islamist influence .
many suspect akp of an islamist agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , left , with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan many are unconvinced by the akp 's arguments that it has disawoved its islamist past and fear the government will have a free hand to implement a suspected islamist agenda that will erode the separation of state and religion if gul is elected .
the turkish armed forces , which see themselves as the guardians of the secular system , seized power in 1960 , 1971 and 1980 and forced the resignation in 1997 of the country 's first islamist prime minister , necmettin erbakan .
the main opposition republican people 's party , which strongly opposes the idea of a former islamist becoming president , on friday evening petitioned the constitutional court to cancel the first round of voting , citing violation of a quorum rule .
if the court annuls the vote , general elections - originally scheduled for november 4 - must be called within 90 days .
if the constitutional court does not cancel the vote , parliament will hold a second round on wednesday , probably with a similar result , but gul is virtually certain to be elected in the third round on may 9 , when an absolute majority of 276 will suffice .
turkish media takes army threat seriously bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media says fast poiltical action will negate the army 's fears the turkish press on saturday urged the government to call early elections to prevent it from plunging into a deep crisis .
in a front-page editorial , the popular daily vatan urged all political parties to take the army statement seriously .
" the quickest way to save turkey and its future is to convene parliament at once , hold elections as speedily as possible and prove to the world that turkey is mature enough to resolve its problems democratically , " it said .
many commentators accused prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's akp of raising tensions and not seeking a consensus with the opposition on the choice for the presidency , which is a non-partisan office , but relying on his comfortable parliamentary majority to have his way .
erdogan 's detractors accuse him of abusing his nearly two-thirds parliamentary majority garnered with only one third of the vote in the 2002 vote - thanks to turkey 's much-criticized electoral system - to put an islamist in the presidency seen as the last bastion of secularism in turkey .
dozens of non-governmental organizations have called for a rally in istanbul sunday to show their support for the secular system , similar to one in ankara two weeks ago which drew up up to 1.5 million people , acording to some estimates .
the akp was born out of erbakan 's party , banned for anti-secular activities the year after it was ousted from power , but argues that it has since evolved and is committed to the secular system .
secularists cite its unsuccessful attempts to criminalise adultery , restrict alcohol sales and lift a ban islamic headsarves in government offices and universities as evidence that the party has not changed . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish presidential race divides country foreign minister abdullah gul 's bid to become turkish president is exposing divisions between the islamist-rooted government and its secular elite .

the two leaders had also discussed putin 's warning , issued to the russian parliament thursday , that russia would declare a moratorium on the 1990 conventional forces in europe treaty , if the us did not back down on the missile shield .
merkel and putin both attached great significance to relations between the european union and russia , the spokesman said .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has adopted a moderate tone in the controversy , pressing the case for the stationing of interceptor missiles in poland along with a radar station in the czech republic to be taken up at nato level .
the us initially preferred bilateral arrangements with poland and the czech republic .
steinmeier 's position came in for criticism from conservative members of merkel 's broad coalition , who urged a stronger line against russia .
the government spokesman said merkel had discussed a range of issues with putin , including the situation in ukraine and the eu- russian summit may 17-18 .
germany currently holds the eu presidency .
putin expresses russian anger at estonian riots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots have been raging in tallinn since thursday night the chancellor also breached the topic of the escalating unrest in estonia , which reached a deadly peak saturday when a russian national was killed in the estonian capital during unrest sparked by the removal of a soviet-era war memorial .
a surge in anti-estonian sentiment was in evidence on the streets of moscow and other russian cities with protestors out in force , newspapers voicing outrage and shoppers boycotting goods from their baltic neighbour .
putin had voiced " serious concern " over the events in tallinn during the telephone conversation with gmerkel , a kremlin spokeswoman said .
violence over monument leads to a russian death bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statue was removed under cover of darkness early friday the row over the removal of a soviet war memorial from tallinn 's centre erupted in riots that began there last thursday , leading to 900 arrests and the death of a russian citizen identified by officials only as dmitri .
estonians see the bronze memorial as a symbol of 50 years of soviet occupation following world war ii .
the estonian authorities removed the statue from the center of tallinn early friday after the first night of rioting , in which dmitri was killed .
the german government statement saturday said merkel had urged both putin and estonian prime minister andrus ansip to keep a lid on the row by showing restraint and restoring parliamentary contacts as soon as possible .
the german government had suggested that the parliaments of the two countries should engage in direct contact over the conflict regarding the removal of the soviet war memorial , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said .
demonstrators target estonian consulate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian and russian protestors clashed with each other and police but at the estonian consulate in moscow about 150 members of two pro-kremlin youth groups protested for a second day , chanting : " fascism will not win ! "
ria novosti news agency quoted a spokesman at the estonian consulate in moscow , franek persidski , as saying the consulate had temporarily ceased operations because of safety concerns .
in saint petersburg another 100 activists demonstrated outside the estonian consulate , city police said .
in the city of pskov , 20 kilometres -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- east of russia 's border with estonia , several dozen protesters brought an empty coffin to the estonian consulate , ria novosti reported .
they were stopped by police while attempting to unfurl a banner reading : " a spike in the head for the fascist beast , then the grave ! "
amid calls for retaliation against estonia , moscow mayor yury luzhkov urged " russian state and municipal organizations to freeze all forms of financial , economic , business and cultural cooperation with estonian state organizations , " ria-novosti reported .
embargo planned on estonian goods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the violence continues , russia takes steps against estonia the interfax news agency quoted the management of three major supermarket chains as saying they would no longer sell estonian goods .
" we are against the removal of the soldier-liberator in tallinn and consider such actions inadmissible , " interfax quoted a spokesman for the sedmoi kontinent supermarket chain as saying .
" in the next 48 hours all goods of estonian origin will be removed from the assortment of products offered by our shops , " the spokesman said .
newspapers also voiced their indignation .
" we are finally convinced .

they said a revised code for non-broadcast adverts , such as those on the internet , did not go far enough .
the national union of teachers and the british heart foundation are among 10 groups highlighting " inconsistencies " with the rules governing tv adverts .
the industry said there was no need for more restrictions like those on tv ads .
the new code for non-broadcast adverts , including those appearing on websites , was unveiled this month by the committee of advertising practice -lrb- cap -rrb- .
its measures - to come into force on 1 july - do not include " rules to restrict the volume or frequency of food advertising to children " and failed to " differentiate between healthy and unhealthy foods " , said the 10 groups . "
the restrictions were an opportunity to finally make progress , but they have fallen well short of the mark " miranda watson , which ?
their letter , sent to health minister caroline flint , said there were " major omissions and inconsistencies " between rules for print and internet adverts compared with those for broadcast adverts , which are developed separately by industry regulatory ofcom .
firms accused the british heart foundation described the way food manufacturers target children on the internet as " unprincipled " and " unacceptable " .

they said a revised code for non-broadcast adverts , such as those on the internet , did not go far enough .
the national union of teachers and the british heart foundation are among 10 groups highlighting " inconsistencies " with the rules governing tv adverts .
the industry said there was no need for more restrictions like those on tv ads .
the new code for non-broadcast adverts , including those appearing on websites , was unveiled this month by the committee of advertising practice -lrb- cap -rrb- .
its measures - to come into force on 1 july - do not include " rules to restrict the volume or frequency of food advertising to children " and failed to " differentiate between healthy and unhealthy foods " , said the 10 groups .

food manufacturers and advertisers were using their own sites " to lure kids in to buy their unhealthy food products " , she said .
she added : " there are a lot of loopholes and there 's a lot of vagueness about exactly what restrictions are now in place , so it makes it very easy for food manufacturers and advertisers to continue doing what they 're doing at the moment . "

it has promised to monitor the impact of the code and restrictions already imposed on broadcasters .
advertisements for foods high in fat , sugar and salt have been banned by ofcom during or around tv programmes made for children , or programmes that would particularly appeal to seven to nine year olds , since the start of this month .
restrictions are due to be extended to children aged up to 15 next year , along with an outright ban on promoting junk food on dedicated children 's channels .

they said a revised code for non-broadcast adverts , such as those on the internet , did not go far enough .
the national union of teachers and the british heart foundation are among 10 groups highlighting " inconsistencies " with the rules governing tv adverts .

the new code for non-broadcast adverts , including those appearing on websites , was unveiled this month by the committee of advertising practice -lrb- cap -rrb- .
its measures - to come into force on 1 july - do not include " rules to restrict the volume or frequency of food advertising to children " and failed to " differentiate between healthy and unhealthy foods " , said the 10 groups .

professor lawrie challis told the daily telegraph children using wi-fi networks should be monitored until research into potential health risks is completed .
he says children should keep a safe distance from the embedded antennas .
the health protection agency has said wi-fi devices are of very low power - much lower than mobile phones .
prof challis , retired professor of physics at the university of nottingham , said : " with a desktop computer , the transmitter will be in the tower .
" this might be perhaps 20cms from your leg and the exposure would then be around one per cent of that from a mobile phone .
" however , if you put a laptop straight on your lap and are using wi-fi , you could be around two centimetres from the transmitter , and receiving comparable exposure to that from a mobile phone . "
' bigger problem ' prof challis added that children are much more sensitive than adults to dangers such as pollutants like lead and uv radiation .
" so if there should be a problem with mobiles , then it may be a bigger problem for children .
" since we advise that children should be discouraged from using mobile phones , we should also discourage children from placing their laptop on their lap when they are using wi-fi .
meanwhile , teachers have called for an investigation into whether there are any health risks from wireless computer networks in schools .
the professional association of teachers union is writing to the education secretary for a clarification on wi-fi safety .
many primary and secondary schools use wi-fi networks - but the pat believes there is insufficient long-term evidence to demonstrate whether such networks are safe .

gwent police have applied for £ 10,000 funding from the city 's community safety partnership to distribute the glasses to pubs and clubs .
it is part of a drive to reduce the number of glassing incidents after figures showed there were 24 recent attacks in the city centre alone .
there are 40 bars in the centre .
inspector talbot thrush from gwent police said the plans had " universal support " from all city centre bars and nightclubs , which can attract up to 12,000 drinkers .
" in 2005-6 there were 50 glassings in gwent with just under half of those in the city centre .
" they are serious assaults , they cause horrendous injuries and are very disfiguring .
" if we can get newport city centre licensed premises to switch to polycarbonate glasses , we can cut the levels of glassings in the force area by 50 % . "
our research has shown the majority of glassing attacks happen between 11pm and 1am insp talbot thrush he said if granted £ 10,000 it would allow the whole of the city centre to benefit from the distribution of polycarbonate glasses .
" polycarbonate is so robust , you could drive over it in a car and it would n't break so it means that the worst injury you could get would be a bruise .
" and it also means that there will be less glass breakages for the licensed premises to have to replace . "

a fragile transitional government there has been trying to destroy groups of fighters left over from the so-called islamic courts group which was in control of much of the country last year .
abdi shakur is a retired sea-captain .
abdi shakur and his brothers paid £ 10,000 for a ' technical ' , a pick-up truck with a heavy machine gun mounted on the back he spent his working life on merchant vessels steaming to and from the somali port of bossasso and is now enjoying what he described to me as half retirement .
he was helping us with translating while we were working in northern somalia .
" come and visit my family , " he said and we drove to his house on the outskirts of the port town .
it was a few weeks back and the full fury of the fighting in the capital mogadishu had not started , but already the threat of conflict breaking out was undeniable .
abdi shakur feared that once fighting began in mogadishu it would quickly spread .
" there will be shooting here in bossasso , and i am worried about my family , " he said , " but i can protect myself - i have guns - every somali who can afford it has guns , and last year my family bought a technical . "
abdi shakur and his brothers paid £ 10,000 - a vast fortune in somalia - for a " technical " , a pick-up truck with a heavy machine gun mounted on the back .
why on earth would abdi shakur and his family need a machine gun on wheels ?
" you ca n't be too careful in somalia , " he told me .
and this is what life is like for somalis who have lived for 16 years in a land run by warlords .
intense fighting i spoke to abdi shakur on the phone the other day .
the family technical had still not been used in anger but he said he was increasingly worried about his cousins in mogadishu .
the capital has been devastated in the past two weeks by intense fighting .
ethiopian forces in support of the transitional government , rooted out militia loyal to the union of islamic courts at the turn of the year .
in the past fortnight they have unleashed a devastating artillery and rocket barrage on obdurate remnants of islamic court fighters in the capital .
the islamists are fighting alongside members of a powerful somali clan , the hawiye , who are enemies of those controlling the transitional government .
mass migration it is a complicated and bloody struggle .
in the past few days more than 300 have been killed and since the turn of the year 2,000 have died , most of them civilians caught in crossfire .
many thousands have been injured .
the appalling violence has led to one of the largest mass migrations in recent times .
an increasing number of people continue to flee the volatile capital hundreds of thousands of people who were living in mogadishu have grabbed what few possessions they could carry and headed for places of safety .
some have moved to the outskirts of the capital away from the fighting .
others have gone out into the somali hinterland .
they have travelled into an environment that can not sustain them , into villages dotted along dusty roads in the scrubby , scruffy bush of southern and central somalia , into communities which were hit in the past year , first by drought and then by flooding .
there is little stored food , goat and cattle herds are only just recovering and the capacity to feed and care for thousands of displaced people does not exist .
and in the past few days the annual rains have started .
at the best of times somalia poses huge problems for aid agencies .
now it is , as one aid worker put it to me , " a total nightmare " .
fighting , poor infrastructure and flooded muddy roads are impeding the movement of food and medical supplies and the transitional government has been accused of deliberately blocking some aid because they feared it might end up in the hands of their enemies .
cholera is now seeping through the displaced thousands , picking off the young and the weak .
in the rain and misery , hundreds have died .
' islamist threat ' just a few months ago , mogadishu and much of somalia were enjoying their most stable period for 16 years .
under the brief control of the islamic courts union , the grip of the warlords was loosened and some of the basic expectations of an organised life were being restored .
schools were opening , police were being trained , roadblocks were removed and litter was even collected from the streets .
many somalis were unhappy with the more extreme rules of the islamic courts : closing down the cinemas , banning music and insisting women wear veils .
but the islamists were able to spread their power steadily through more of somalia and this alarmed the government in neighbouring ethiopia who have long feared a radical islamic group in control of the country .
it worried the americans too , who feared the islamic courts were harbouring al-qaeda elements .
so with tacit american approval and with other international governments looking on , ethiopia sent troops into somalia to support the weak transitional government .
ethiopia is now trapped .
it wants to get out of somalia , but can not go until what it calls the " islamist threat " is eliminated .
but every moment ethiopian troops spend in somalia stirs up more resentment and their presence acts as a compelling recruiting sergeant for insurgents , who say they will die trying to rid their country of the ethiopian invaders .

a fragile transitional government there has been trying to destroy groups of fighters left over from the so-called islamic courts group which was in control of much of the country last year .
abdi shakur is a retired sea-captain .
abdi shakur and his brothers paid £ 10,000 for a ' technical ' , a pick-up truck with a heavy machine gun mounted on the back he spent his working life on merchant vessels steaming to and from the somali port of bossasso and is now enjoying what he described to me as half retirement .
he was helping us with translating while we were working in northern somalia .
" come and visit my family , " he said and we drove to his house on the outskirts of the port town .
it was a few weeks back and the full fury of the fighting in the capital mogadishu had not started , but already the threat of conflict breaking out was undeniable .
abdi shakur feared that once fighting began in mogadishu it would quickly spread .
" there will be shooting here in bossasso , and i am worried about my family , " he said , " but i can protect myself - i have guns - every somali who can afford it has guns , and last year my family bought a technical . "
abdi shakur and his brothers paid £ 10,000 - a vast fortune in somalia - for a " technical " , a pick-up truck with a heavy machine gun mounted on the back .
why on earth would abdi shakur and his family need a machine gun on wheels ?
" you ca n't be too careful in somalia , " he told me .
and this is what life is like for somalis who have lived for 16 years in a land run by warlords .
intense fighting i spoke to abdi shakur on the phone the other day .
the family technical had still not been used in anger but he said he was increasingly worried about his cousins in mogadishu .
the capital has been devastated in the past two weeks by intense fighting .
ethiopian forces in support of the transitional government , rooted out militia loyal to the union of islamic courts at the turn of the year .
in the past fortnight they have unleashed a devastating artillery and rocket barrage on obdurate remnants of islamic court fighters in the capital .
the islamists are fighting alongside members of a powerful somali clan , the hawiye , who are enemies of those controlling the transitional government .
mass migration it is a complicated and bloody struggle .
in the past few days more than 300 have been killed and since the turn of the year 2,000 have died , most of them civilians caught in crossfire .
many thousands have been injured .
the appalling violence has led to one of the largest mass migrations in recent times .
an increasing number of people continue to flee the volatile capital hundreds of thousands of people who were living in mogadishu have grabbed what few possessions they could carry and headed for places of safety .
some have moved to the outskirts of the capital away from the fighting .

a fragile transitional government there has been trying to destroy groups of fighters left over from the so-called islamic courts group which was in control of much of the country last year .
abdi shakur is a retired sea-captain .
abdi shakur and his brothers paid £ 10,000 for a ' technical ' , a pick-up truck with a heavy machine gun mounted on the back he spent his working life on merchant vessels steaming to and from the somali port of bossasso and is now enjoying what he described to me as half retirement .
he was helping us with translating while we were working in northern somalia .
" come and visit my family , " he said and we drove to his house on the outskirts of the port town .
it was a few weeks back and the full fury of the fighting in the capital mogadishu had not started , but already the threat of conflict breaking out was undeniable .
abdi shakur feared that once fighting began in mogadishu it would quickly spread .
" there will be shooting here in bossasso , and i am worried about my family , " he said , " but i can protect myself - i have guns - every somali who can afford it has guns , and last year my family bought a technical . "
abdi shakur and his brothers paid £ 10,000 - a vast fortune in somalia - for a " technical " , a pick-up truck with a heavy machine gun mounted on the back .
why on earth would abdi shakur and his family need a machine gun on wheels ?
" you ca n't be too careful in somalia , " he told me .
and this is what life is like for somalis who have lived for 16 years in a land run by warlords .
intense fighting i spoke to abdi shakur on the phone the other day .
the family technical had still not been used in anger but he said he was increasingly worried about his cousins in mogadishu .
the capital has been devastated in the past two weeks by intense fighting .
ethiopian forces in support of the transitional government , rooted out militia loyal to the union of islamic courts at the turn of the year .
in the past fortnight they have unleashed a devastating artillery and rocket barrage on obdurate remnants of islamic court fighters in the capital .
the islamists are fighting alongside members of a powerful somali clan , the hawiye , who are enemies of those controlling the transitional government .
mass migration it is a complicated and bloody struggle .
in the past few days more than 300 have been killed and since the turn of the year 2,000 have died , most of them civilians caught in crossfire .
many thousands have been injured .
the appalling violence has led to one of the largest mass migrations in recent times .
an increasing number of people continue to flee the volatile capital hundreds of thousands of people who were living in mogadishu have grabbed what few possessions they could carry and headed for places of safety .
some have moved to the outskirts of the capital away from the fighting .
others have gone out into the somali hinterland .
they have travelled into an environment that can not sustain them , into villages dotted along dusty roads in the scrubby , scruffy bush of southern and central somalia , into communities which were hit in the past year , first by drought and then by flooding .
there is little stored food , goat and cattle herds are only just recovering and the capacity to feed and care for thousands of displaced people does not exist .
and in the past few days the annual rains have started .
at the best of times somalia poses huge problems for aid agencies .
now it is , as one aid worker put it to me , " a total nightmare " .
fighting , poor infrastructure and flooded muddy roads are impeding the movement of food and medical supplies and the transitional government has been accused of deliberately blocking some aid because they feared it might end up in the hands of their enemies .
cholera is now seeping through the displaced thousands , picking off the young and the weak .
in the rain and misery , hundreds have died .
' islamist threat ' just a few months ago , mogadishu and much of somalia were enjoying their most stable period for 16 years .
under the brief control of the islamic courts union , the grip of the warlords was loosened and some of the basic expectations of an organised life were being restored .
schools were opening , police were being trained , roadblocks were removed and litter was even collected from the streets .
many somalis were unhappy with the more extreme rules of the islamic courts : closing down the cinemas , banning music and insisting women wear veils .
but the islamists were able to spread their power steadily through more of somalia and this alarmed the government in neighbouring ethiopia who have long feared a radical islamic group in control of the country .
it worried the americans too , who feared the islamic courts were harbouring al-qaeda elements .
so with tacit american approval and with other international governments looking on , ethiopia sent troops into somalia to support the weak transitional government .
ethiopia is now trapped .
it wants to get out of somalia , but can not go until what it calls the " islamist threat " is eliminated .

secularism is fundamental to turkey 's identity as a nation .
turkey was founded in 1923 by mustafa kemal ataturk , a military general , in what had been the ottoman sultanate .
ataturk was determined that this mainly muslim nation would be a modern , secular country , and he introduced wide-ranging reforms , including the emancipation of women , the introduction of western dress , legal code and alphabet , and the abolition of islamic institutions .
turkey 's ruling elite and the powerful military have seen it as their job to protect what ataturk set up .
the army has not been afraid to intervene militarily whenever it sees fit - it has led three direct coups against elected governments in ankara . "
the staunchly secular elite of turkey believes a president whose wife wears an islamic headscarf would have ataturk turning in his grave " when , 10 years ago , turkey elected its first pro-islamic party to government - the welfare party - the military campaigned to force it out of office .
the following year the party was banned by the courts .
but despite the efforts of the establishment , it seems that islamic parties are popular in turkey , and in 2002 the justice and development -lrb- ak -rrb- party of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan won a landslide victory .
the party has its roots in political islam , but insists it respects the secular principles of the constitution .
the army has tolerated its position in government , but the prospect of one of its members taking up the highest post in the land is causing it great concern .
the staunchly secular elite of turkey believes a president whose wife wears an islamic headscarf would have ataturk turning in his grave .
