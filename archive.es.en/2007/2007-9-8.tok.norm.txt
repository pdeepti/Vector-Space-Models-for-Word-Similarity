yet though church and state are kept separate , many germans are asking themselves how much religious symbolism should influence their daily lives . the renaissance of religion is a phenomenon currently growing across the globe .
in germany , this development has raised many difficult questions , for example to what extent religious symbols should exist in public life . religion is a private affair in germany .
yet a cross made of brass hangs on the office wall of professor stefan muckel , head of the institute for ecclesiastical law at the university of cologne .
just opposite is a picture of pope benedict xvi .
according to muckel , the university does not have a problem with the cross , as staff can decorate their office as they choose to . but could he hang the cross on a classroom wall , as well ?
no , muckel said , because then it would become a problem of his neutrality .
in germany , certain public places , such as courtrooms or classrooms , need to ensure absolute neutrality .
expressing attachment towards any religious belief is prohibited . germany 's secular society contradicts itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decorations with a religious theme may not be permitted in a public office according to the constitution , germany is a secular , religiously and ideologically neutral nation , which separates church and state .
in practice , though , the two mix on many levels .
this differs from france , for example , where the separation of the two is much stricter . this contradiction is evident in various parts of german society .
there is no official state religion or a state church , for example .
yet the state cooperates with the major churches in many aspects , both materially and idealistically . muckel said the constitution allowed the state to collect taxes for the church , for example .
religion was also a regular subject in public schools , he said .
the church in germany is strongly involved in social services , as well , such as in kindergartens , schools and hospitals - with the support of government subsidies . " it 's no accident that the churches in the federal republic are the largest employers following the public service sector , " muckel said . religion is returning to people 's lives the catholic and protestant churches have been complaining about the many members leaving them in droves , putting the church in a perpetual crisis .
they said they are also suffering from the subsequent drop in church taxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama was welcomed like a superstar however , at the same time , there is a new development on the rise : religion 's return into german society - and it is not only limited to christianity . in june of this year , 500,000 people happily celebrated the german protestant church day in cologne .
in july , the red carpet was rolled out for the dalai lama in hamburg .
an audience of over 5,000 people took part in a buddhist seminar given by tibet 's spiritual leader .
another similar event was world youth day in cologne in 2005 , which was the largest international party germany had seen in decades . construction of a mosque is not a legal issue where there is religion , there are symbols , and religions express themselves through rituals and symbolism .
that is what they live on .
the question is : how much religious symbolism could a secular society such as germany 's tolerate without losing the nature of its being ? muckel said one example was the planned construction of a large mosque in cologne .
there were no real legal barriers to the plans , muckel said .
but a controversial discussion has erupted on a political level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are offended by the ban of headscarfs in public schools critics are questioning the height of the minaret and the size of dome .
the questions are endless : how conspicuous can the entire construction be ?
how much of a mosque can a liberal city such as cologne deal with ?
why are those people , who are against the mosque , bothered by it ?
why would the construction of a church be a lesser problem than that of a mosque ? the reaction to this criticism has not been lacking .
muslims feel they are being dealt with unfairly and that their basic religious rights are being violated . selected non-christian symbols are forbidden muslims in germany have said they felt unequal , because of the court rulings that resulted in a headscarf ban .
in most federal states , the bans in public places were adopted , but they were selective and unfair , muslim groups said . in berlin , for example , the symbols of all religious denominations are banned in classrooms , while in other federal states there are many clear differences .
christian and jewish symbols are allowed , for example , while a headscarf , a sign of islam , is forbidden . according to the ban , if a muslim teacher wears a headscarf during class time , the act is considered a demonstration of her religious commitment to a fundamental islam that oppresses women 's rights .
it also violated the religious neutrality of public schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can religious symbolic expression go ?
but teachers with a kippah on their head , a cross around their neck or wearing a catholic habit are allowed to teach in almost all federal states .
these symbols are a sign of western christian tradition , the state legislation said . the federal constitutional court has said it wanted " strict equality " for all religions .
but what does that mean for the fundamental principles of the states ' neutrality for all religions ? that question was going to be put in the center of the debate , gerd-ulrich kapteina , speaker for the düsseldorf administrative court , told deutsche welle .
on august 14 , the courts ruled against the headscarf for teachers in schools .
but kapteina said that differentiating between islamic and christian symbols was inadmissible . in addition to certain other public problems , the headscarf issue depicts the challenge the reanimation of religion puts onto a secular society .
germany has yet to find the answers . erning zhu -lrb- tip / sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are in the middle of this process and we hope that we can shape it so that what you fear - a break-up of the common foreign policy position of europe - does not come to pass , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amado said the issue of kosovo is one of the most important facing the eu while ministers meeting in viana do castelo were not keen to acknowledge the possibility of a failure by the troika , it is understood that " plan b " discussions were also held in the northern portuguese town .

" in fact , i 'd prefer to be united than see an individual solution to kosovo . " portuguese foreign minister luis amado , who is hosting the talks , said this week that kosovo 's status " is probably the greatest challenge with which the eu is confronted .

that 's a step belgrade , backed by russia 's veto in the un security council , has called unacceptable . " after the ahtisaari plan unfortunately did n't lead to the result we had hoped for , the prospects are certainly not better now , " steinmeier said . the province is under un administration since nato drove out serb security forces in 1999 . on friday , the ministers made little progress on settling a number of issues concerning a new reform treaty , just six weeks before the discussions on the draft version are due to be concluded . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's a step belgrade , backed by russia 's veto in the un security council , has called unacceptable .

" we are in the middle of this process and we hope that we can shape it so that what you fear - a break-up of the common foreign policy position of europe - does not come to pass , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amado said the issue of kosovo is one of the most important facing the eu while ministers meeting in viana do castelo were not keen to acknowledge the possibility of a failure by the troika , it is understood that " plan b " discussions were also held in the northern portuguese town . " we should not talk ourselves into a crisis , as we so often do , " steinmeier said , before adding that he did not have " too many expectations " for the troika 's success . eu unity crucial for balkans the bloc 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , insisted that the problem of kosovo " is not unsolvable , " and french foreign minister bernard kouchner warned colleagues against being tempted to go it alone on kosovo . " the main thing is to maintain unity , " kouchner told journalists .
" in fact , i 'd prefer to be united than see an individual solution to kosovo . " portuguese foreign minister luis amado , who is hosting the talks , said this week that kosovo 's status " is probably the greatest challenge with which the eu is confronted .

that 's a step belgrade , backed by russia 's veto in the un security council , has called unacceptable . " after the ahtisaari plan unfortunately did n't lead to the result we had hoped for , the prospects are certainly not better now , " steinmeier said . the province is under un administration since nato drove out serb security forces in 1999 . on friday , the ministers made little progress on settling a number of issues concerning a new reform treaty , just six weeks before the discussions on the draft version are due to be concluded . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the return of religion in search of germany 's religious identity ex-muslims demand right to renounce islamic faith promises of miracles attract millions to nigeria 's churches theologian küng : christianity gets on many people 's nerves religion -pipe- 08.09.2007 how many religious symbols can a secular society tolerate ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public places may completely forbid religious expression through symbols religion has found its way back into german society .
yet though church and state are kept separate , many germans are asking themselves how much religious symbolism should influence their daily lives . the renaissance of religion is a phenomenon currently growing across the globe .
in germany , this development has raised many difficult questions , for example to what extent religious symbols should exist in public life . religion is a private affair in germany .
yet a cross made of brass hangs on the office wall of professor stefan muckel , head of the institute for ecclesiastical law at the university of cologne .
just opposite is a picture of pope benedict xvi .
according to muckel , the university does not have a problem with the cross , as staff can decorate their office as they choose to . but could he hang the cross on a classroom wall , as well ?
no , muckel said , because then it would become a problem of his neutrality .
in germany , certain public places , such as courtrooms or classrooms , need to ensure absolute neutrality .
expressing attachment towards any religious belief is prohibited . germany 's secular society contradicts itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decorations with a religious theme may not be permitted in a public office according to the constitution , germany is a secular , religiously and ideologically neutral nation , which separates church and state .
in practice , though , the two mix on many levels .
this differs from france , for example , where the separation of the two is much stricter . this contradiction is evident in various parts of german society .
there is no official state religion or a state church , for example .
yet the state cooperates with the major churches in many aspects , both materially and idealistically . muckel said the constitution allowed the state to collect taxes for the church , for example .
religion was also a regular subject in public schools , he said .
the church in germany is strongly involved in social services , as well , such as in kindergartens , schools and hospitals - with the support of government subsidies . " it 's no accident that the churches in the federal republic are the largest employers following the public service sector , " muckel said . religion is returning to people 's lives the catholic and protestant churches have been complaining about the many members leaving them in droves , putting the church in a perpetual crisis .
they said they are also suffering from the subsequent drop in church taxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama was welcomed like a superstar however , at the same time , there is a new development on the rise : religion 's return into german society - and it is not only limited to christianity . in june of this year , 500,000 people happily celebrated the german protestant church day in cologne .
in july , the red carpet was rolled out for the dalai lama in hamburg .
an audience of over 5,000 people took part in a buddhist seminar given by tibet 's spiritual leader .
another similar event was world youth day in cologne in 2005 , which was the largest international party germany had seen in decades . construction of a mosque is not a legal issue where there is religion , there are symbols , and religions express themselves through rituals and symbolism .
that is what they live on .
the question is : how much religious symbolism could a secular society such as germany 's tolerate without losing the nature of its being ? muckel said one example was the planned construction of a large mosque in cologne .
there were no real legal barriers to the plans , muckel said .
but a controversial discussion has erupted on a political level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are offended by the ban of headscarfs in public schools critics are questioning the height of the minaret and the size of dome .
the questions are endless : how conspicuous can the entire construction be ?
how much of a mosque can a liberal city such as cologne deal with ?
why are those people , who are against the mosque , bothered by it ?
why would the construction of a church be a lesser problem than that of a mosque ? the reaction to this criticism has not been lacking .
muslims feel they are being dealt with unfairly and that their basic religious rights are being violated . selected non-christian symbols are forbidden muslims in germany have said they felt unequal , because of the court rulings that resulted in a headscarf ban .
in most federal states , the bans in public places were adopted , but they were selective and unfair , muslim groups said . in berlin , for example , the symbols of all religious denominations are banned in classrooms , while in other federal states there are many clear differences .
christian and jewish symbols are allowed , for example , while a headscarf , a sign of islam , is forbidden . according to the ban , if a muslim teacher wears a headscarf during class time , the act is considered a demonstration of her religious commitment to a fundamental islam that oppresses women 's rights .
it also violated the religious neutrality of public schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can religious symbolic expression go ?
but teachers with a kippah on their head , a cross around their neck or wearing a catholic habit are allowed to teach in almost all federal states .
these symbols are a sign of western christian tradition , the state legislation said . the federal constitutional court has said it wanted " strict equality " for all religions .
but what does that mean for the fundamental principles of the states ' neutrality for all religions ? that question was going to be put in the center of the debate , gerd-ulrich kapteina , speaker for the düsseldorf administrative court , told deutsche welle .
on august 14 , the courts ruled against the headscarf for teachers in schools .
but kapteina said that differentiating between islamic and christian symbols was inadmissible . in addition to certain other public problems , the headscarf issue depicts the challenge the reanimation of religion puts onto a secular society .
germany has yet to find the answers . erning zhu -lrb- tip / sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

christian and jewish symbols are allowed , for example , while a headscarf , a sign of islam , is forbidden . according to the ban , if a muslim teacher wears a headscarf during class time , the act is considered a demonstration of her religious commitment to a fundamental islam that oppresses women 's rights .
it also violated the religious neutrality of public schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can religious symbolic expression go ?

the question is : how much religious symbolism could a secular society such as germany 's tolerate without losing the nature of its being ? muckel said one example was the planned construction of a large mosque in cologne .
there were no real legal barriers to the plans , muckel said .
but a controversial discussion has erupted on a political level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are offended by the ban of headscarfs in public schools critics are questioning the height of the minaret and the size of dome .
the questions are endless : how conspicuous can the entire construction be ?
how much of a mosque can a liberal city such as cologne deal with ?
why are those people , who are against the mosque , bothered by it ?
why would the construction of a church be a lesser problem than that of a mosque ? the reaction to this criticism has not been lacking .
muslims feel they are being dealt with unfairly and that their basic religious rights are being violated . selected non-christian symbols are forbidden muslims in germany have said they felt unequal , because of the court rulings that resulted in a headscarf ban .
in most federal states , the bans in public places were adopted , but they were selective and unfair , muslim groups said . in berlin , for example , the symbols of all religious denominations are banned in classrooms , while in other federal states there are many clear differences .
christian and jewish symbols are allowed , for example , while a headscarf , a sign of islam , is forbidden . according to the ban , if a muslim teacher wears a headscarf during class time , the act is considered a demonstration of her religious commitment to a fundamental islam that oppresses women 's rights .
it also violated the religious neutrality of public schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can religious symbolic expression go ?
but teachers with a kippah on their head , a cross around their neck or wearing a catholic habit are allowed to teach in almost all federal states .
these symbols are a sign of western christian tradition , the state legislation said . the federal constitutional court has said it wanted " strict equality " for all religions .
but what does that mean for the fundamental principles of the states ' neutrality for all religions ? that question was going to be put in the center of the debate , gerd-ulrich kapteina , speaker for the düsseldorf administrative court , told deutsche welle .
on august 14 , the courts ruled against the headscarf for teachers in schools .
but kapteina said that differentiating between islamic and christian symbols was inadmissible . in addition to certain other public problems , the headscarf issue depicts the challenge the reanimation of religion puts onto a secular society .

yet though church and state are kept separate , many germans are asking themselves how much religious symbolism should influence their daily lives . the renaissance of religion is a phenomenon currently growing across the globe .
in germany , this development has raised many difficult questions , for example to what extent religious symbols should exist in public life . religion is a private affair in germany .
yet a cross made of brass hangs on the office wall of professor stefan muckel , head of the institute for ecclesiastical law at the university of cologne .
just opposite is a picture of pope benedict xvi .
according to muckel , the university does not have a problem with the cross , as staff can decorate their office as they choose to . but could he hang the cross on a classroom wall , as well ?
no , muckel said , because then it would become a problem of his neutrality .
in germany , certain public places , such as courtrooms or classrooms , need to ensure absolute neutrality .
expressing attachment towards any religious belief is prohibited . germany 's secular society contradicts itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decorations with a religious theme may not be permitted in a public office according to the constitution , germany is a secular , religiously and ideologically neutral nation , which separates church and state .
in practice , though , the two mix on many levels .
this differs from france , for example , where the separation of the two is much stricter . this contradiction is evident in various parts of german society .
there is no official state religion or a state church , for example .
yet the state cooperates with the major churches in many aspects , both materially and idealistically . muckel said the constitution allowed the state to collect taxes for the church , for example .
religion was also a regular subject in public schools , he said .
the church in germany is strongly involved in social services , as well , such as in kindergartens , schools and hospitals - with the support of government subsidies . " it 's no accident that the churches in the federal republic are the largest employers following the public service sector , " muckel said . religion is returning to people 's lives the catholic and protestant churches have been complaining about the many members leaving them in droves , putting the church in a perpetual crisis .
they said they are also suffering from the subsequent drop in church taxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama was welcomed like a superstar however , at the same time , there is a new development on the rise : religion 's return into german society - and it is not only limited to christianity . in june of this year , 500,000 people happily celebrated the german protestant church day in cologne .
in july , the red carpet was rolled out for the dalai lama in hamburg .
an audience of over 5,000 people took part in a buddhist seminar given by tibet 's spiritual leader .
another similar event was world youth day in cologne in 2005 , which was the largest international party germany had seen in decades . construction of a mosque is not a legal issue where there is religion , there are symbols , and religions express themselves through rituals and symbolism .
that is what they live on .
the question is : how much religious symbolism could a secular society such as germany 's tolerate without losing the nature of its being ? muckel said one example was the planned construction of a large mosque in cologne .
there were no real legal barriers to the plans , muckel said .
but a controversial discussion has erupted on a political level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are offended by the ban of headscarfs in public schools critics are questioning the height of the minaret and the size of dome .
the questions are endless : how conspicuous can the entire construction be ?
how much of a mosque can a liberal city such as cologne deal with ?
why are those people , who are against the mosque , bothered by it ?
why would the construction of a church be a lesser problem than that of a mosque ? the reaction to this criticism has not been lacking .
muslims feel they are being dealt with unfairly and that their basic religious rights are being violated . selected non-christian symbols are forbidden muslims in germany have said they felt unequal , because of the court rulings that resulted in a headscarf ban .
in most federal states , the bans in public places were adopted , but they were selective and unfair , muslim groups said . in berlin , for example , the symbols of all religious denominations are banned in classrooms , while in other federal states there are many clear differences .
christian and jewish symbols are allowed , for example , while a headscarf , a sign of islam , is forbidden . according to the ban , if a muslim teacher wears a headscarf during class time , the act is considered a demonstration of her religious commitment to a fundamental islam that oppresses women 's rights .
it also violated the religious neutrality of public schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can religious symbolic expression go ?
but teachers with a kippah on their head , a cross around their neck or wearing a catholic habit are allowed to teach in almost all federal states .
these symbols are a sign of western christian tradition , the state legislation said . the federal constitutional court has said it wanted " strict equality " for all religions .
but what does that mean for the fundamental principles of the states ' neutrality for all religions ? that question was going to be put in the center of the debate , gerd-ulrich kapteina , speaker for the düsseldorf administrative court , told deutsche welle .
on august 14 , the courts ruled against the headscarf for teachers in schools .
but kapteina said that differentiating between islamic and christian symbols was inadmissible . in addition to certain other public problems , the headscarf issue depicts the challenge the reanimation of religion puts onto a secular society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany 's political parties in crisis germany 's political parties in crisis german parties begin early search for future partners expert says germany 's parties must reinvent themselves cdu puts new twist on conservative politics politics -pipe- 08.09.2007 left party seeks eastern consolidation , western expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is bucking the trend and gaining members germany 's new left party already has more than 60,000 members .
but support still lags in western germany .
dw-world.de asked grassroots party members in western berlin how they plan to change that . on a cold , wet , late-august evening , klemens domning and kaspar scholemann stand in front of a school smoking and hoping to get a good turn-out for a discussion evening calling on the germany military to withdraw from afghanistan . the event is being held in wedding , a down-at-the-heels , working-class district in western berlin .
it 's the sort of area in which the left party - whose positions range from stringent pacifism to significant restrictions on business and an expansion of the social-welfare state - is looking to expand its base . the left party originated in the pds , the successor to socialist unity party in communist east germany .
earlier this year , it merged with the wasg -lrb- electoral alternative for labor and social justice -rrb- from the western part of the country . " it 's a matter of trying to better anchor ourselves , i.e. recruit more members , in western germany , " scholemann , a 27-year-old university student says .
" opinions differ about which segments of society we should be trying to address .
some favor the bourgeois , ecologic and civil-rights milieu , and others think we should emphasize social-welfare questions . " quo vadis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main base of support for the party remains in eastern germany in the 2005 national elections , the left party took 8.7 percent of the vote and became the second most powerful force in three german states - all in the eastern part of the country .
they 're part of the governing coalition in the city state of berlin but have lost support there while in government .
that raises the question of whether a party known for its uncompromising leftist views can - or even should - enter into the inevitable compromises that go with governing . " you have to take the path of compromise and pragmatism , " says domning , a freelance journalist in his mid-fifties .
" but you also should n't sell yourself cheaply .
you have to stay true to your principles and learn to say no . " a coalition at the national level with their closest political rivals , the social democrats , is not on the cards . " you do n't have to be in the government to give weight to demands , " scholemann says .
" my feeling is that a joint government with the spd , given their policies of drastic cuts in the social-benefits system , would be very difficult .
so i think that , for the foreseeable future , the left party will and should remain in the opposition . " a new form of serfdom ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long lines in unemployment offices may help the left party in the west in the school auditorium , around 50 people listen as three speakers argue that germany 's participation in the isaf mission in afghanistan is futile , indeed counterproductive .
that stance runs directly contrary to the policy of the spd - as does the left party 's insistence on reversing the cost-cutting reforms to the social-benefits system begun under ex-chancellor gerhard schröder and continued by the current grand coalition . those cuts , say left party members , amount to a dismantling of germany 's social-welfare system . " first and foremost and to put it bluntly , i want to see a return to social fairness in times of globalization when people are being forced to work for scandalous wages , " domning says .
" that 's a new form of serfdom . " the state has to re-embrace its pro-active function and stop being so dependent on lobbyists , " he continues .
" you do n't get to know any welfare recipients at the buffet table .
we do get to know them , and we want disadvantaged people to be able to take part in society again . " conservative beneficiaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine acrimoniously quit the spd in 2005 for most western germans , the left party remains an organ for easterners disgruntled with the effects of german reunification .
but many expect the party 's policies to increasingly appeal to have-nots in the western states , siphoning off voters from the left wing of the spd . " the party will stay the course and present itself as a leftist alternative in the debate about the social-welfare state , " said oskar niedermayer , a professor of political science at the free university of berlin .
" they 'll continue to try to depict all the other parties as neo-liberal . " that 's bad news for the spd , whose leftist credibility has suffered badly during its coalition of necessity with the conservatives .

yet though church and state are kept separate , many germans are asking themselves how much religious symbolism should influence their daily lives . the renaissance of religion is a phenomenon currently growing across the globe .
in germany , this development has raised many difficult questions , for example to what extent religious symbols should exist in public life . religion is a private affair in germany .
yet a cross made of brass hangs on the office wall of professor stefan muckel , head of the institute for ecclesiastical law at the university of cologne .
just opposite is a picture of pope benedict xvi .
according to muckel , the university does not have a problem with the cross , as staff can decorate their office as they choose to . but could he hang the cross on a classroom wall , as well ?
no , muckel said , because then it would become a problem of his neutrality .
in germany , certain public places , such as courtrooms or classrooms , need to ensure absolute neutrality .
expressing attachment towards any religious belief is prohibited . germany 's secular society contradicts itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decorations with a religious theme may not be permitted in a public office according to the constitution , germany is a secular , religiously and ideologically neutral nation , which separates church and state .
in practice , though , the two mix on many levels .
this differs from france , for example , where the separation of the two is much stricter . this contradiction is evident in various parts of german society .
there is no official state religion or a state church , for example .
yet the state cooperates with the major churches in many aspects , both materially and idealistically . muckel said the constitution allowed the state to collect taxes for the church , for example .
religion was also a regular subject in public schools , he said .
the church in germany is strongly involved in social services , as well , such as in kindergartens , schools and hospitals - with the support of government subsidies . " it 's no accident that the churches in the federal republic are the largest employers following the public service sector , " muckel said . religion is returning to people 's lives the catholic and protestant churches have been complaining about the many members leaving them in droves , putting the church in a perpetual crisis .
they said they are also suffering from the subsequent drop in church taxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama was welcomed like a superstar however , at the same time , there is a new development on the rise : religion 's return into german society - and it is not only limited to christianity . in june of this year , 500,000 people happily celebrated the german protestant church day in cologne .
in july , the red carpet was rolled out for the dalai lama in hamburg .
an audience of over 5,000 people took part in a buddhist seminar given by tibet 's spiritual leader .
another similar event was world youth day in cologne in 2005 , which was the largest international party germany had seen in decades . construction of a mosque is not a legal issue where there is religion , there are symbols , and religions express themselves through rituals and symbolism .
that is what they live on .
the question is : how much religious symbolism could a secular society such as germany 's tolerate without losing the nature of its being ? muckel said one example was the planned construction of a large mosque in cologne .
there were no real legal barriers to the plans , muckel said .
but a controversial discussion has erupted on a political level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are offended by the ban of headscarfs in public schools critics are questioning the height of the minaret and the size of dome .
the questions are endless : how conspicuous can the entire construction be ?
how much of a mosque can a liberal city such as cologne deal with ?
why are those people , who are against the mosque , bothered by it ?
why would the construction of a church be a lesser problem than that of a mosque ? the reaction to this criticism has not been lacking .
muslims feel they are being dealt with unfairly and that their basic religious rights are being violated . selected non-christian symbols are forbidden muslims in germany have said they felt unequal , because of the court rulings that resulted in a headscarf ban .
in most federal states , the bans in public places were adopted , but they were selective and unfair , muslim groups said . in berlin , for example , the symbols of all religious denominations are banned in classrooms , while in other federal states there are many clear differences .
christian and jewish symbols are allowed , for example , while a headscarf , a sign of islam , is forbidden . according to the ban , if a muslim teacher wears a headscarf during class time , the act is considered a demonstration of her religious commitment to a fundamental islam that oppresses women 's rights .
it also violated the religious neutrality of public schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can religious symbolic expression go ?
but teachers with a kippah on their head , a cross around their neck or wearing a catholic habit are allowed to teach in almost all federal states .
these symbols are a sign of western christian tradition , the state legislation said . the federal constitutional court has said it wanted " strict equality " for all religions .
but what does that mean for the fundamental principles of the states ' neutrality for all religions ? that question was going to be put in the center of the debate , gerd-ulrich kapteina , speaker for the düsseldorf administrative court , told deutsche welle .
on august 14 , the courts ruled against the headscarf for teachers in schools .
but kapteina said that differentiating between islamic and christian symbols was inadmissible . in addition to certain other public problems , the headscarf issue depicts the challenge the reanimation of religion puts onto a secular society .

yet though church and state are kept separate , many germans are asking themselves how much religious symbolism should influence their daily lives . the renaissance of religion is a phenomenon currently growing across the globe .
in germany , this development has raised many difficult questions , for example to what extent religious symbols should exist in public life . religion is a private affair in germany .
yet a cross made of brass hangs on the office wall of professor stefan muckel , head of the institute for ecclesiastical law at the university of cologne .
just opposite is a picture of pope benedict xvi .
according to muckel , the university does not have a problem with the cross , as staff can decorate their office as they choose to . but could he hang the cross on a classroom wall , as well ?
no , muckel said , because then it would become a problem of his neutrality .
in germany , certain public places , such as courtrooms or classrooms , need to ensure absolute neutrality .
expressing attachment towards any religious belief is prohibited . germany 's secular society contradicts itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decorations with a religious theme may not be permitted in a public office according to the constitution , germany is a secular , religiously and ideologically neutral nation , which separates church and state .
in practice , though , the two mix on many levels .
this differs from france , for example , where the separation of the two is much stricter . this contradiction is evident in various parts of german society .
there is no official state religion or a state church , for example .
yet the state cooperates with the major churches in many aspects , both materially and idealistically . muckel said the constitution allowed the state to collect taxes for the church , for example .
religion was also a regular subject in public schools , he said .
the church in germany is strongly involved in social services , as well , such as in kindergartens , schools and hospitals - with the support of government subsidies . " it 's no accident that the churches in the federal republic are the largest employers following the public service sector , " muckel said . religion is returning to people 's lives the catholic and protestant churches have been complaining about the many members leaving them in droves , putting the church in a perpetual crisis .

yet though church and state are kept separate , many germans are asking themselves how much religious symbolism should influence their daily lives . the renaissance of religion is a phenomenon currently growing across the globe .
in germany , this development has raised many difficult questions , for example to what extent religious symbols should exist in public life . religion is a private affair in germany .
yet a cross made of brass hangs on the office wall of professor stefan muckel , head of the institute for ecclesiastical law at the university of cologne .
just opposite is a picture of pope benedict xvi .
according to muckel , the university does not have a problem with the cross , as staff can decorate their office as they choose to . but could he hang the cross on a classroom wall , as well ?
no , muckel said , because then it would become a problem of his neutrality .
in germany , certain public places , such as courtrooms or classrooms , need to ensure absolute neutrality .
expressing attachment towards any religious belief is prohibited . germany 's secular society contradicts itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decorations with a religious theme may not be permitted in a public office according to the constitution , germany is a secular , religiously and ideologically neutral nation , which separates church and state .
in practice , though , the two mix on many levels .
this differs from france , for example , where the separation of the two is much stricter . this contradiction is evident in various parts of german society .
there is no official state religion or a state church , for example .
yet the state cooperates with the major churches in many aspects , both materially and idealistically . muckel said the constitution allowed the state to collect taxes for the church , for example .
religion was also a regular subject in public schools , he said .
the church in germany is strongly involved in social services , as well , such as in kindergartens , schools and hospitals - with the support of government subsidies . " it 's no accident that the churches in the federal republic are the largest employers following the public service sector , " muckel said . religion is returning to people 's lives the catholic and protestant churches have been complaining about the many members leaving them in droves , putting the church in a perpetual crisis .
they said they are also suffering from the subsequent drop in church taxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama was welcomed like a superstar however , at the same time , there is a new development on the rise : religion 's return into german society - and it is not only limited to christianity . in june of this year , 500,000 people happily celebrated the german protestant church day in cologne .
in july , the red carpet was rolled out for the dalai lama in hamburg .
an audience of over 5,000 people took part in a buddhist seminar given by tibet 's spiritual leader .
another similar event was world youth day in cologne in 2005 , which was the largest international party germany had seen in decades . construction of a mosque is not a legal issue where there is religion , there are symbols , and religions express themselves through rituals and symbolism .
that is what they live on .
the question is : how much religious symbolism could a secular society such as germany 's tolerate without losing the nature of its being ? muckel said one example was the planned construction of a large mosque in cologne .
there were no real legal barriers to the plans , muckel said .
but a controversial discussion has erupted on a political level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are offended by the ban of headscarfs in public schools critics are questioning the height of the minaret and the size of dome .
the questions are endless : how conspicuous can the entire construction be ?
how much of a mosque can a liberal city such as cologne deal with ?
why are those people , who are against the mosque , bothered by it ?
why would the construction of a church be a lesser problem than that of a mosque ? the reaction to this criticism has not been lacking .
muslims feel they are being dealt with unfairly and that their basic religious rights are being violated . selected non-christian symbols are forbidden muslims in germany have said they felt unequal , because of the court rulings that resulted in a headscarf ban .
in most federal states , the bans in public places were adopted , but they were selective and unfair , muslim groups said . in berlin , for example , the symbols of all religious denominations are banned in classrooms , while in other federal states there are many clear differences .
christian and jewish symbols are allowed , for example , while a headscarf , a sign of islam , is forbidden . according to the ban , if a muslim teacher wears a headscarf during class time , the act is considered a demonstration of her religious commitment to a fundamental islam that oppresses women 's rights .
it also violated the religious neutrality of public schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can religious symbolic expression go ?
but teachers with a kippah on their head , a cross around their neck or wearing a catholic habit are allowed to teach in almost all federal states .
these symbols are a sign of western christian tradition , the state legislation said . the federal constitutional court has said it wanted " strict equality " for all religions .
but what does that mean for the fundamental principles of the states ' neutrality for all religions ? that question was going to be put in the center of the debate , gerd-ulrich kapteina , speaker for the düsseldorf administrative court , told deutsche welle .
on august 14 , the courts ruled against the headscarf for teachers in schools .
but kapteina said that differentiating between islamic and christian symbols was inadmissible . in addition to certain other public problems , the headscarf issue depicts the challenge the reanimation of religion puts onto a secular society .

but support still lags in western germany .
dw-world.de asked grassroots party members in western berlin how they plan to change that . on a cold , wet , late-august evening , klemens domning and kaspar scholemann stand in front of a school smoking and hoping to get a good turn-out for a discussion evening calling on the germany military to withdraw from afghanistan . the event is being held in wedding , a down-at-the-heels , working-class district in western berlin .

yet though church and state are kept separate , many germans are asking themselves how much religious symbolism should influence their daily lives . the renaissance of religion is a phenomenon currently growing across the globe .
in germany , this development has raised many difficult questions , for example to what extent religious symbols should exist in public life . religion is a private affair in germany .
yet a cross made of brass hangs on the office wall of professor stefan muckel , head of the institute for ecclesiastical law at the university of cologne .
just opposite is a picture of pope benedict xvi .
according to muckel , the university does not have a problem with the cross , as staff can decorate their office as they choose to . but could he hang the cross on a classroom wall , as well ?
no , muckel said , because then it would become a problem of his neutrality .
in germany , certain public places , such as courtrooms or classrooms , need to ensure absolute neutrality .
expressing attachment towards any religious belief is prohibited . germany 's secular society contradicts itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decorations with a religious theme may not be permitted in a public office according to the constitution , germany is a secular , religiously and ideologically neutral nation , which separates church and state .
in practice , though , the two mix on many levels .
this differs from france , for example , where the separation of the two is much stricter . this contradiction is evident in various parts of german society .
there is no official state religion or a state church , for example .
yet the state cooperates with the major churches in many aspects , both materially and idealistically . muckel said the constitution allowed the state to collect taxes for the church , for example .
religion was also a regular subject in public schools , he said .
the church in germany is strongly involved in social services , as well , such as in kindergartens , schools and hospitals - with the support of government subsidies . " it 's no accident that the churches in the federal republic are the largest employers following the public service sector , " muckel said . religion is returning to people 's lives the catholic and protestant churches have been complaining about the many members leaving them in droves , putting the church in a perpetual crisis .
they said they are also suffering from the subsequent drop in church taxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama was welcomed like a superstar however , at the same time , there is a new development on the rise : religion 's return into german society - and it is not only limited to christianity . in june of this year , 500,000 people happily celebrated the german protestant church day in cologne .
in july , the red carpet was rolled out for the dalai lama in hamburg .
an audience of over 5,000 people took part in a buddhist seminar given by tibet 's spiritual leader .
another similar event was world youth day in cologne in 2005 , which was the largest international party germany had seen in decades . construction of a mosque is not a legal issue where there is religion , there are symbols , and religions express themselves through rituals and symbolism .
that is what they live on .
the question is : how much religious symbolism could a secular society such as germany 's tolerate without losing the nature of its being ? muckel said one example was the planned construction of a large mosque in cologne .
there were no real legal barriers to the plans , muckel said .
but a controversial discussion has erupted on a political level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are offended by the ban of headscarfs in public schools critics are questioning the height of the minaret and the size of dome .
the questions are endless : how conspicuous can the entire construction be ?
how much of a mosque can a liberal city such as cologne deal with ?
why are those people , who are against the mosque , bothered by it ?
why would the construction of a church be a lesser problem than that of a mosque ? the reaction to this criticism has not been lacking .
muslims feel they are being dealt with unfairly and that their basic religious rights are being violated . selected non-christian symbols are forbidden muslims in germany have said they felt unequal , because of the court rulings that resulted in a headscarf ban .
in most federal states , the bans in public places were adopted , but they were selective and unfair , muslim groups said . in berlin , for example , the symbols of all religious denominations are banned in classrooms , while in other federal states there are many clear differences .
christian and jewish symbols are allowed , for example , while a headscarf , a sign of islam , is forbidden . according to the ban , if a muslim teacher wears a headscarf during class time , the act is considered a demonstration of her religious commitment to a fundamental islam that oppresses women 's rights .
it also violated the religious neutrality of public schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can religious symbolic expression go ?
but teachers with a kippah on their head , a cross around their neck or wearing a catholic habit are allowed to teach in almost all federal states .
these symbols are a sign of western christian tradition , the state legislation said . the federal constitutional court has said it wanted " strict equality " for all religions .
but what does that mean for the fundamental principles of the states ' neutrality for all religions ? that question was going to be put in the center of the debate , gerd-ulrich kapteina , speaker for the düsseldorf administrative court , told deutsche welle .
on august 14 , the courts ruled against the headscarf for teachers in schools .
but kapteina said that differentiating between islamic and christian symbols was inadmissible . in addition to certain other public problems , the headscarf issue depicts the challenge the reanimation of religion puts onto a secular society .

" they 'll continue to try to depict all the other parties as neo-liberal . " that 's bad news for the spd , whose leftist credibility has suffered badly during its coalition of necessity with the conservatives .
the prospect of rapprochement with the left party is distant .
the policy gap is too wide , and the current spd leadership is loathe to work with oskar lafontaine , the former spd leader who deserted ranks to become the left party 's most prominent figure in western germany . ironically , the rise of the left party has proved a temporary boon for conservatives . " the cdu-csu profits in the short term from the fact that the spd shuts itself off from a possible coalition partner , " niedermayer said . " that will likely change in the medium term . " back in the auditorium , the audience nods in approval as one of the speakers ridicules the notion , put forward by former spd defense minister peter struck , that military engagement in afghanistan is crucial to germany ’ s national security . no one here is thinking about burying the hatchet with the social democrats .

yet though church and state are kept separate , many germans are asking themselves how much religious symbolism should influence their daily lives . the renaissance of religion is a phenomenon currently growing across the globe .
in germany , this development has raised many difficult questions , for example to what extent religious symbols should exist in public life . religion is a private affair in germany .
yet a cross made of brass hangs on the office wall of professor stefan muckel , head of the institute for ecclesiastical law at the university of cologne .
just opposite is a picture of pope benedict xvi .
according to muckel , the university does not have a problem with the cross , as staff can decorate their office as they choose to . but could he hang the cross on a classroom wall , as well ?
no , muckel said , because then it would become a problem of his neutrality .
in germany , certain public places , such as courtrooms or classrooms , need to ensure absolute neutrality .
expressing attachment towards any religious belief is prohibited . germany 's secular society contradicts itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decorations with a religious theme may not be permitted in a public office according to the constitution , germany is a secular , religiously and ideologically neutral nation , which separates church and state .
in practice , though , the two mix on many levels .
this differs from france , for example , where the separation of the two is much stricter . this contradiction is evident in various parts of german society .
there is no official state religion or a state church , for example .
yet the state cooperates with the major churches in many aspects , both materially and idealistically . muckel said the constitution allowed the state to collect taxes for the church , for example .
religion was also a regular subject in public schools , he said .
the church in germany is strongly involved in social services , as well , such as in kindergartens , schools and hospitals - with the support of government subsidies . " it 's no accident that the churches in the federal republic are the largest employers following the public service sector , " muckel said . religion is returning to people 's lives the catholic and protestant churches have been complaining about the many members leaving them in droves , putting the church in a perpetual crisis .
they said they are also suffering from the subsequent drop in church taxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama was welcomed like a superstar however , at the same time , there is a new development on the rise : religion 's return into german society - and it is not only limited to christianity . in june of this year , 500,000 people happily celebrated the german protestant church day in cologne .
in july , the red carpet was rolled out for the dalai lama in hamburg .
an audience of over 5,000 people took part in a buddhist seminar given by tibet 's spiritual leader .
another similar event was world youth day in cologne in 2005 , which was the largest international party germany had seen in decades . construction of a mosque is not a legal issue where there is religion , there are symbols , and religions express themselves through rituals and symbolism .
that is what they live on .
the question is : how much religious symbolism could a secular society such as germany 's tolerate without losing the nature of its being ? muckel said one example was the planned construction of a large mosque in cologne .
there were no real legal barriers to the plans , muckel said .
but a controversial discussion has erupted on a political level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are offended by the ban of headscarfs in public schools critics are questioning the height of the minaret and the size of dome .
the questions are endless : how conspicuous can the entire construction be ?
how much of a mosque can a liberal city such as cologne deal with ?
why are those people , who are against the mosque , bothered by it ?
why would the construction of a church be a lesser problem than that of a mosque ? the reaction to this criticism has not been lacking .
muslims feel they are being dealt with unfairly and that their basic religious rights are being violated . selected non-christian symbols are forbidden muslims in germany have said they felt unequal , because of the court rulings that resulted in a headscarf ban .
in most federal states , the bans in public places were adopted , but they were selective and unfair , muslim groups said . in berlin , for example , the symbols of all religious denominations are banned in classrooms , while in other federal states there are many clear differences .
christian and jewish symbols are allowed , for example , while a headscarf , a sign of islam , is forbidden . according to the ban , if a muslim teacher wears a headscarf during class time , the act is considered a demonstration of her religious commitment to a fundamental islam that oppresses women 's rights .
it also violated the religious neutrality of public schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can religious symbolic expression go ?
but teachers with a kippah on their head , a cross around their neck or wearing a catholic habit are allowed to teach in almost all federal states .
these symbols are a sign of western christian tradition , the state legislation said . the federal constitutional court has said it wanted " strict equality " for all religions .
but what does that mean for the fundamental principles of the states ' neutrality for all religions ? that question was going to be put in the center of the debate , gerd-ulrich kapteina , speaker for the düsseldorf administrative court , told deutsche welle .
on august 14 , the courts ruled against the headscarf for teachers in schools .
but kapteina said that differentiating between islamic and christian symbols was inadmissible . in addition to certain other public problems , the headscarf issue depicts the challenge the reanimation of religion puts onto a secular society .
germany has yet to find the answers . erning zhu -lrb- tip / sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 . " now poles will be able to chose if they want a modernized , growing poland or a poland ruled by a network of oligarchs , " prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski told reporters after the vote . months of political turmoil paved the way to the decision for a pre-term election , with the quarrelsome right-wing law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- minority government of prime minister kaczynski unable to forge a stable majority coalition with two smaller populist parties . but in a debate ahead of the dissolution ballot , pis politicians denied opposition allegations that their party had " capitulated " after a mere two years of its full four-year term in office . polls : elections unlikely to bring stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski said the election will be held in october opinion polls published this week showed the governing pis leading the opposition liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- .
but all recent surveys indicate that an independent majority government or a stable coalition administration is unlikely to emerge from the fresh ballot , likely condemning poland to continued political instability . there is concern both in poland and abroad that the wobbly state of poland 's domestic politics may destabilize its booming economy and wreak further havoc in its foreign policy , particularly with regard to the eu 's key goal of adopting a blanket constitutional treaty . allegations of undemocratic behavior have dogged prime minister kaczynski in recent weeks , with former coalition partners accusing him of using poland 's secret services and the justice ministry in attempts to eliminate them from politics . kaczynski has denied any wrong-doing . history of shaky leadership concerned about the health of poland 's democracy , former czech president vaclav havel recently went so far as to urge international observers to monitor elections in poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish campaign is sure to deal with the country 's relations with germany and the eu analysts have also pointed out that should law and justice win the fresh ballot , political power in poland will remain concentrated in hands of identical twin brothers for the near future . president lech kaczynski 's term in office expires in 2010 , while the full term of the new parliament after the upcoming election will end in the autumn of 2012 . the pre-term october election will be the seventh democratic ballot since the collapse of communism in 1989 . poles last went to the ballot box in september 2005 , giving kaczynski 's pis a narrow 2.9 percent victory over the rival po .

but support still lags in western germany .
dw-world.de asked grassroots party members in western berlin how they plan to change that . on a cold , wet , late-august evening , klemens domning and kaspar scholemann stand in front of a school smoking and hoping to get a good turn-out for a discussion evening calling on the germany military to withdraw from afghanistan . the event is being held in wedding , a down-at-the-heels , working-class district in western berlin .
it 's the sort of area in which the left party - whose positions range from stringent pacifism to significant restrictions on business and an expansion of the social-welfare state - is looking to expand its base . the left party originated in the pds , the successor to socialist unity party in communist east germany .
earlier this year , it merged with the wasg -lrb- electoral alternative for labor and social justice -rrb- from the western part of the country . " it 's a matter of trying to better anchor ourselves , i.e. recruit more members , in western germany , " scholemann , a 27-year-old university student says .
" opinions differ about which segments of society we should be trying to address .
some favor the bourgeois , ecologic and civil-rights milieu , and others think we should emphasize social-welfare questions . " quo vadis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main base of support for the party remains in eastern germany in the 2005 national elections , the left party took 8.7 percent of the vote and became the second most powerful force in three german states - all in the eastern part of the country .
they 're part of the governing coalition in the city state of berlin but have lost support there while in government .
that raises the question of whether a party known for its uncompromising leftist views can - or even should - enter into the inevitable compromises that go with governing . " you have to take the path of compromise and pragmatism , " says domning , a freelance journalist in his mid-fifties .
" but you also should n't sell yourself cheaply .
you have to stay true to your principles and learn to say no . " a coalition at the national level with their closest political rivals , the social democrats , is not on the cards . " you do n't have to be in the government to give weight to demands , " scholemann says .
" my feeling is that a joint government with the spd , given their policies of drastic cuts in the social-benefits system , would be very difficult .
so i think that , for the foreseeable future , the left party will and should remain in the opposition . " a new form of serfdom ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long lines in unemployment offices may help the left party in the west in the school auditorium , around 50 people listen as three speakers argue that germany 's participation in the isaf mission in afghanistan is futile , indeed counterproductive .
that stance runs directly contrary to the policy of the spd - as does the left party 's insistence on reversing the cost-cutting reforms to the social-benefits system begun under ex-chancellor gerhard schröder and continued by the current grand coalition . those cuts , say left party members , amount to a dismantling of germany 's social-welfare system . " first and foremost and to put it bluntly , i want to see a return to social fairness in times of globalization when people are being forced to work for scandalous wages , " domning says .
" that 's a new form of serfdom . " the state has to re-embrace its pro-active function and stop being so dependent on lobbyists , " he continues .
" you do n't get to know any welfare recipients at the buffet table .
we do get to know them , and we want disadvantaged people to be able to take part in society again . " conservative beneficiaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine acrimoniously quit the spd in 2005 for most western germans , the left party remains an organ for easterners disgruntled with the effects of german reunification .
but many expect the party 's policies to increasingly appeal to have-nots in the western states , siphoning off voters from the left wing of the spd . " the party will stay the course and present itself as a leftist alternative in the debate about the social-welfare state , " said oskar niedermayer , a professor of political science at the free university of berlin .
" they 'll continue to try to depict all the other parties as neo-liberal . " that 's bad news for the spd , whose leftist credibility has suffered badly during its coalition of necessity with the conservatives .
the prospect of rapprochement with the left party is distant .
the policy gap is too wide , and the current spd leadership is loathe to work with oskar lafontaine , the former spd leader who deserted ranks to become the left party 's most prominent figure in western germany . ironically , the rise of the left party has proved a temporary boon for conservatives . " the cdu-csu profits in the short term from the fact that the spd shuts itself off from a possible coalition partner , " niedermayer said . " that will likely change in the medium term . " back in the auditorium , the audience nods in approval as one of the speakers ridicules the notion , put forward by former spd defense minister peter struck , that military engagement in afghanistan is crucial to germany ’ s national security . no one here is thinking about burying the hatchet with the social democrats .

but support still lags in western germany .
dw-world.de asked grassroots party members in western berlin how they plan to change that . on a cold , wet , late-august evening , klemens domning and kaspar scholemann stand in front of a school smoking and hoping to get a good turn-out for a discussion evening calling on the germany military to withdraw from afghanistan . the event is being held in wedding , a down-at-the-heels , working-class district in western berlin .
it 's the sort of area in which the left party - whose positions range from stringent pacifism to significant restrictions on business and an expansion of the social-welfare state - is looking to expand its base . the left party originated in the pds , the successor to socialist unity party in communist east germany .
earlier this year , it merged with the wasg -lrb- electoral alternative for labor and social justice -rrb- from the western part of the country . " it 's a matter of trying to better anchor ourselves , i.e. recruit more members , in western germany , " scholemann , a 27-year-old university student says .
" opinions differ about which segments of society we should be trying to address .
some favor the bourgeois , ecologic and civil-rights milieu , and others think we should emphasize social-welfare questions . " quo vadis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main base of support for the party remains in eastern germany in the 2005 national elections , the left party took 8.7 percent of the vote and became the second most powerful force in three german states - all in the eastern part of the country .
they 're part of the governing coalition in the city state of berlin but have lost support there while in government .
that raises the question of whether a party known for its uncompromising leftist views can - or even should - enter into the inevitable compromises that go with governing . " you have to take the path of compromise and pragmatism , " says domning , a freelance journalist in his mid-fifties .
" but you also should n't sell yourself cheaply .
you have to stay true to your principles and learn to say no . " a coalition at the national level with their closest political rivals , the social democrats , is not on the cards . " you do n't have to be in the government to give weight to demands , " scholemann says .
" my feeling is that a joint government with the spd , given their policies of drastic cuts in the social-benefits system , would be very difficult .
so i think that , for the foreseeable future , the left party will and should remain in the opposition . " a new form of serfdom ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long lines in unemployment offices may help the left party in the west in the school auditorium , around 50 people listen as three speakers argue that germany 's participation in the isaf mission in afghanistan is futile , indeed counterproductive .

yet though church and state are kept separate , many germans are asking themselves how much religious symbolism should influence their daily lives . the renaissance of religion is a phenomenon currently growing across the globe .
in germany , this development has raised many difficult questions , for example to what extent religious symbols should exist in public life . religion is a private affair in germany .
yet a cross made of brass hangs on the office wall of professor stefan muckel , head of the institute for ecclesiastical law at the university of cologne .
just opposite is a picture of pope benedict xvi .
according to muckel , the university does not have a problem with the cross , as staff can decorate their office as they choose to . but could he hang the cross on a classroom wall , as well ?
no , muckel said , because then it would become a problem of his neutrality .
in germany , certain public places , such as courtrooms or classrooms , need to ensure absolute neutrality .
expressing attachment towards any religious belief is prohibited . germany 's secular society contradicts itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decorations with a religious theme may not be permitted in a public office according to the constitution , germany is a secular , religiously and ideologically neutral nation , which separates church and state .
in practice , though , the two mix on many levels .
this differs from france , for example , where the separation of the two is much stricter . this contradiction is evident in various parts of german society .
there is no official state religion or a state church , for example .
yet the state cooperates with the major churches in many aspects , both materially and idealistically . muckel said the constitution allowed the state to collect taxes for the church , for example .
religion was also a regular subject in public schools , he said .
the church in germany is strongly involved in social services , as well , such as in kindergartens , schools and hospitals - with the support of government subsidies . " it 's no accident that the churches in the federal republic are the largest employers following the public service sector , " muckel said . religion is returning to people 's lives the catholic and protestant churches have been complaining about the many members leaving them in droves , putting the church in a perpetual crisis .
they said they are also suffering from the subsequent drop in church taxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama was welcomed like a superstar however , at the same time , there is a new development on the rise : religion 's return into german society - and it is not only limited to christianity . in june of this year , 500,000 people happily celebrated the german protestant church day in cologne .
in july , the red carpet was rolled out for the dalai lama in hamburg .
an audience of over 5,000 people took part in a buddhist seminar given by tibet 's spiritual leader .
another similar event was world youth day in cologne in 2005 , which was the largest international party germany had seen in decades . construction of a mosque is not a legal issue where there is religion , there are symbols , and religions express themselves through rituals and symbolism .
that is what they live on .
the question is : how much religious symbolism could a secular society such as germany 's tolerate without losing the nature of its being ? muckel said one example was the planned construction of a large mosque in cologne .
there were no real legal barriers to the plans , muckel said .
but a controversial discussion has erupted on a political level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are offended by the ban of headscarfs in public schools critics are questioning the height of the minaret and the size of dome .
the questions are endless : how conspicuous can the entire construction be ?
how much of a mosque can a liberal city such as cologne deal with ?
why are those people , who are against the mosque , bothered by it ?
why would the construction of a church be a lesser problem than that of a mosque ? the reaction to this criticism has not been lacking .
muslims feel they are being dealt with unfairly and that their basic religious rights are being violated . selected non-christian symbols are forbidden muslims in germany have said they felt unequal , because of the court rulings that resulted in a headscarf ban .
in most federal states , the bans in public places were adopted , but they were selective and unfair , muslim groups said . in berlin , for example , the symbols of all religious denominations are banned in classrooms , while in other federal states there are many clear differences .
christian and jewish symbols are allowed , for example , while a headscarf , a sign of islam , is forbidden . according to the ban , if a muslim teacher wears a headscarf during class time , the act is considered a demonstration of her religious commitment to a fundamental islam that oppresses women 's rights .
it also violated the religious neutrality of public schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can religious symbolic expression go ?
but teachers with a kippah on their head , a cross around their neck or wearing a catholic habit are allowed to teach in almost all federal states .
these symbols are a sign of western christian tradition , the state legislation said . the federal constitutional court has said it wanted " strict equality " for all religions .
but what does that mean for the fundamental principles of the states ' neutrality for all religions ? that question was going to be put in the center of the debate , gerd-ulrich kapteina , speaker for the düsseldorf administrative court , told deutsche welle .
on august 14 , the courts ruled against the headscarf for teachers in schools .
but kapteina said that differentiating between islamic and christian symbols was inadmissible . in addition to certain other public problems , the headscarf issue depicts the challenge the reanimation of religion puts onto a secular society .

yet though church and state are kept separate , many germans are asking themselves how much religious symbolism should influence their daily lives . the renaissance of religion is a phenomenon currently growing across the globe .
in germany , this development has raised many difficult questions , for example to what extent religious symbols should exist in public life . religion is a private affair in germany .
yet a cross made of brass hangs on the office wall of professor stefan muckel , head of the institute for ecclesiastical law at the university of cologne .
just opposite is a picture of pope benedict xvi .
according to muckel , the university does not have a problem with the cross , as staff can decorate their office as they choose to . but could he hang the cross on a classroom wall , as well ?
no , muckel said , because then it would become a problem of his neutrality .

christian and jewish symbols are allowed , for example , while a headscarf , a sign of islam , is forbidden . according to the ban , if a muslim teacher wears a headscarf during class time , the act is considered a demonstration of her religious commitment to a fundamental islam that oppresses women 's rights .
it also violated the religious neutrality of public schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can religious symbolic expression go ?
but teachers with a kippah on their head , a cross around their neck or wearing a catholic habit are allowed to teach in almost all federal states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany 's political parties in crisis germany 's political parties in crisis german parties begin early search for future partners expert says germany 's parties must reinvent themselves cdu puts new twist on conservative politics politics -pipe- 08.09.2007 left party seeks eastern consolidation , western expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is bucking the trend and gaining members germany 's new left party already has more than 60,000 members .
but support still lags in western germany .
dw-world.de asked grassroots party members in western berlin how they plan to change that . on a cold , wet , late-august evening , klemens domning and kaspar scholemann stand in front of a school smoking and hoping to get a good turn-out for a discussion evening calling on the germany military to withdraw from afghanistan . the event is being held in wedding , a down-at-the-heels , working-class district in western berlin .
it 's the sort of area in which the left party - whose positions range from stringent pacifism to significant restrictions on business and an expansion of the social-welfare state - is looking to expand its base . the left party originated in the pds , the successor to socialist unity party in communist east germany .
earlier this year , it merged with the wasg -lrb- electoral alternative for labor and social justice -rrb- from the western part of the country . " it 's a matter of trying to better anchor ourselves , i.e. recruit more members , in western germany , " scholemann , a 27-year-old university student says .
" opinions differ about which segments of society we should be trying to address .
some favor the bourgeois , ecologic and civil-rights milieu , and others think we should emphasize social-welfare questions . " quo vadis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main base of support for the party remains in eastern germany in the 2005 national elections , the left party took 8.7 percent of the vote and became the second most powerful force in three german states - all in the eastern part of the country .
they 're part of the governing coalition in the city state of berlin but have lost support there while in government .
that raises the question of whether a party known for its uncompromising leftist views can - or even should - enter into the inevitable compromises that go with governing . " you have to take the path of compromise and pragmatism , " says domning , a freelance journalist in his mid-fifties .
" but you also should n't sell yourself cheaply .
you have to stay true to your principles and learn to say no . " a coalition at the national level with their closest political rivals , the social democrats , is not on the cards . " you do n't have to be in the government to give weight to demands , " scholemann says .
" my feeling is that a joint government with the spd , given their policies of drastic cuts in the social-benefits system , would be very difficult .
so i think that , for the foreseeable future , the left party will and should remain in the opposition . " a new form of serfdom ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long lines in unemployment offices may help the left party in the west in the school auditorium , around 50 people listen as three speakers argue that germany 's participation in the isaf mission in afghanistan is futile , indeed counterproductive .
that stance runs directly contrary to the policy of the spd - as does the left party 's insistence on reversing the cost-cutting reforms to the social-benefits system begun under ex-chancellor gerhard schröder and continued by the current grand coalition . those cuts , say left party members , amount to a dismantling of germany 's social-welfare system . " first and foremost and to put it bluntly , i want to see a return to social fairness in times of globalization when people are being forced to work for scandalous wages , " domning says .
" that 's a new form of serfdom . " the state has to re-embrace its pro-active function and stop being so dependent on lobbyists , " he continues .
" you do n't get to know any welfare recipients at the buffet table .
we do get to know them , and we want disadvantaged people to be able to take part in society again . " conservative beneficiaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine acrimoniously quit the spd in 2005 for most western germans , the left party remains an organ for easterners disgruntled with the effects of german reunification .
but many expect the party 's policies to increasingly appeal to have-nots in the western states , siphoning off voters from the left wing of the spd . " the party will stay the course and present itself as a leftist alternative in the debate about the social-welfare state , " said oskar niedermayer , a professor of political science at the free university of berlin .
" they 'll continue to try to depict all the other parties as neo-liberal . " that 's bad news for the spd , whose leftist credibility has suffered badly during its coalition of necessity with the conservatives .
the prospect of rapprochement with the left party is distant .
the policy gap is too wide , and the current spd leadership is loathe to work with oskar lafontaine , the former spd leader who deserted ranks to become the left party 's most prominent figure in western germany . ironically , the rise of the left party has proved a temporary boon for conservatives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany 's political parties in crisis germany 's political parties in crisis german parties begin early search for future partners expert says germany 's parties must reinvent themselves cdu puts new twist on conservative politics politics -pipe- 08.09.2007 left party seeks eastern consolidation , western expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is bucking the trend and gaining members germany 's new left party already has more than 60,000 members .
but support still lags in western germany .
dw-world.de asked grassroots party members in western berlin how they plan to change that . on a cold , wet , late-august evening , klemens domning and kaspar scholemann stand in front of a school smoking and hoping to get a good turn-out for a discussion evening calling on the germany military to withdraw from afghanistan . the event is being held in wedding , a down-at-the-heels , working-class district in western berlin .
it 's the sort of area in which the left party - whose positions range from stringent pacifism to significant restrictions on business and an expansion of the social-welfare state - is looking to expand its base . the left party originated in the pds , the successor to socialist unity party in communist east germany .
earlier this year , it merged with the wasg -lrb- electoral alternative for labor and social justice -rrb- from the western part of the country . " it 's a matter of trying to better anchor ourselves , i.e. recruit more members , in western germany , " scholemann , a 27-year-old university student says .
" opinions differ about which segments of society we should be trying to address .
some favor the bourgeois , ecologic and civil-rights milieu , and others think we should emphasize social-welfare questions . " quo vadis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main base of support for the party remains in eastern germany in the 2005 national elections , the left party took 8.7 percent of the vote and became the second most powerful force in three german states - all in the eastern part of the country .
they 're part of the governing coalition in the city state of berlin but have lost support there while in government .
that raises the question of whether a party known for its uncompromising leftist views can - or even should - enter into the inevitable compromises that go with governing . " you have to take the path of compromise and pragmatism , " says domning , a freelance journalist in his mid-fifties .
" but you also should n't sell yourself cheaply .
you have to stay true to your principles and learn to say no . " a coalition at the national level with their closest political rivals , the social democrats , is not on the cards . " you do n't have to be in the government to give weight to demands , " scholemann says .
" my feeling is that a joint government with the spd , given their policies of drastic cuts in the social-benefits system , would be very difficult .
so i think that , for the foreseeable future , the left party will and should remain in the opposition . " a new form of serfdom ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long lines in unemployment offices may help the left party in the west in the school auditorium , around 50 people listen as three speakers argue that germany 's participation in the isaf mission in afghanistan is futile , indeed counterproductive .
that stance runs directly contrary to the policy of the spd - as does the left party 's insistence on reversing the cost-cutting reforms to the social-benefits system begun under ex-chancellor gerhard schröder and continued by the current grand coalition . those cuts , say left party members , amount to a dismantling of germany 's social-welfare system . " first and foremost and to put it bluntly , i want to see a return to social fairness in times of globalization when people are being forced to work for scandalous wages , " domning says .
" that 's a new form of serfdom . " the state has to re-embrace its pro-active function and stop being so dependent on lobbyists , " he continues .
" you do n't get to know any welfare recipients at the buffet table .
we do get to know them , and we want disadvantaged people to be able to take part in society again . " conservative beneficiaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine acrimoniously quit the spd in 2005 for most western germans , the left party remains an organ for easterners disgruntled with the effects of german reunification .
but many expect the party 's policies to increasingly appeal to have-nots in the western states , siphoning off voters from the left wing of the spd . " the party will stay the course and present itself as a leftist alternative in the debate about the social-welfare state , " said oskar niedermayer , a professor of political science at the free university of berlin .
" they 'll continue to try to depict all the other parties as neo-liberal . " that 's bad news for the spd , whose leftist credibility has suffered badly during its coalition of necessity with the conservatives .
the prospect of rapprochement with the left party is distant .
the policy gap is too wide , and the current spd leadership is loathe to work with oskar lafontaine , the former spd leader who deserted ranks to become the left party 's most prominent figure in western germany . ironically , the rise of the left party has proved a temporary boon for conservatives . " the cdu-csu profits in the short term from the fact that the spd shuts itself off from a possible coalition partner , " niedermayer said . " that will likely change in the medium term . " back in the auditorium , the audience nods in approval as one of the speakers ridicules the notion , put forward by former spd defense minister peter struck , that military engagement in afghanistan is crucial to germany ’ s national security . no one here is thinking about burying the hatchet with the social democrats .
and for the left party 's grassroots , that situation is just fine . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are in the middle of this process and we hope that we can shape it so that what you fear - a break-up of the common foreign policy position of europe - does not come to pass , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amado said the issue of kosovo is one of the most important facing the eu while ministers meeting in viana do castelo were not keen to acknowledge the possibility of a failure by the troika , it is understood that " plan b " discussions were also held in the northern portuguese town .

that 's a step belgrade , backed by russia 's veto in the un security council , has called unacceptable . " after the ahtisaari plan unfortunately did n't lead to the result we had hoped for , the prospects are certainly not better now , " steinmeier said . the province is under un administration since nato drove out serb security forces in 1999 . on friday , the ministers made little progress on settling a number of issues concerning a new reform treaty , just six weeks before the discussions on the draft version are due to be concluded . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de asked grassroots party members in western berlin how they plan to change that . on a cold , wet , late-august evening , klemens domning and kaspar scholemann stand in front of a school smoking and hoping to get a good turn-out for a discussion evening calling on the germany military to withdraw from afghanistan . the event is being held in wedding , a down-at-the-heels , working-class district in western berlin .
it 's the sort of area in which the left party - whose positions range from stringent pacifism to significant restrictions on business and an expansion of the social-welfare state - is looking to expand its base . the left party originated in the pds , the successor to socialist unity party in communist east germany .
earlier this year , it merged with the wasg -lrb- electoral alternative for labor and social justice -rrb- from the western part of the country . " it 's a matter of trying to better anchor ourselves , i.e. recruit more members , in western germany , " scholemann , a 27-year-old university student says .
" opinions differ about which segments of society we should be trying to address .
some favor the bourgeois , ecologic and civil-rights milieu , and others think we should emphasize social-welfare questions . " quo vadis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main base of support for the party remains in eastern germany in the 2005 national elections , the left party took 8.7 percent of the vote and became the second most powerful force in three german states - all in the eastern part of the country .
they 're part of the governing coalition in the city state of berlin but have lost support there while in government .
that raises the question of whether a party known for its uncompromising leftist views can - or even should - enter into the inevitable compromises that go with governing . " you have to take the path of compromise and pragmatism , " says domning , a freelance journalist in his mid-fifties .
" but you also should n't sell yourself cheaply .
you have to stay true to your principles and learn to say no . " a coalition at the national level with their closest political rivals , the social democrats , is not on the cards . " you do n't have to be in the government to give weight to demands , " scholemann says .
" my feeling is that a joint government with the spd , given their policies of drastic cuts in the social-benefits system , would be very difficult .
so i think that , for the foreseeable future , the left party will and should remain in the opposition . " a new form of serfdom ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long lines in unemployment offices may help the left party in the west in the school auditorium , around 50 people listen as three speakers argue that germany 's participation in the isaf mission in afghanistan is futile , indeed counterproductive .
that stance runs directly contrary to the policy of the spd - as does the left party 's insistence on reversing the cost-cutting reforms to the social-benefits system begun under ex-chancellor gerhard schröder and continued by the current grand coalition . those cuts , say left party members , amount to a dismantling of germany 's social-welfare system . " first and foremost and to put it bluntly , i want to see a return to social fairness in times of globalization when people are being forced to work for scandalous wages , " domning says .
" that 's a new form of serfdom . " the state has to re-embrace its pro-active function and stop being so dependent on lobbyists , " he continues .
" you do n't get to know any welfare recipients at the buffet table .
we do get to know them , and we want disadvantaged people to be able to take part in society again . " conservative beneficiaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine acrimoniously quit the spd in 2005 for most western germans , the left party remains an organ for easterners disgruntled with the effects of german reunification .
but many expect the party 's policies to increasingly appeal to have-nots in the western states , siphoning off voters from the left wing of the spd . " the party will stay the course and present itself as a leftist alternative in the debate about the social-welfare state , " said oskar niedermayer , a professor of political science at the free university of berlin .
" they 'll continue to try to depict all the other parties as neo-liberal . " that 's bad news for the spd , whose leftist credibility has suffered badly during its coalition of necessity with the conservatives .
the prospect of rapprochement with the left party is distant .
the policy gap is too wide , and the current spd leadership is loathe to work with oskar lafontaine , the former spd leader who deserted ranks to become the left party 's most prominent figure in western germany . ironically , the rise of the left party has proved a temporary boon for conservatives . " the cdu-csu profits in the short term from the fact that the spd shuts itself off from a possible coalition partner , " niedermayer said . " that will likely change in the medium term . " back in the auditorium , the audience nods in approval as one of the speakers ridicules the notion , put forward by former spd defense minister peter struck , that military engagement in afghanistan is crucial to germany ’ s national security . no one here is thinking about burying the hatchet with the social democrats .

yet though church and state are kept separate , many germans are asking themselves how much religious symbolism should influence their daily lives . the renaissance of religion is a phenomenon currently growing across the globe .
in germany , this development has raised many difficult questions , for example to what extent religious symbols should exist in public life . religion is a private affair in germany .
yet a cross made of brass hangs on the office wall of professor stefan muckel , head of the institute for ecclesiastical law at the university of cologne .
just opposite is a picture of pope benedict xvi .
according to muckel , the university does not have a problem with the cross , as staff can decorate their office as they choose to . but could he hang the cross on a classroom wall , as well ?
no , muckel said , because then it would become a problem of his neutrality .
in germany , certain public places , such as courtrooms or classrooms , need to ensure absolute neutrality .
expressing attachment towards any religious belief is prohibited . germany 's secular society contradicts itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decorations with a religious theme may not be permitted in a public office according to the constitution , germany is a secular , religiously and ideologically neutral nation , which separates church and state .
in practice , though , the two mix on many levels .
this differs from france , for example , where the separation of the two is much stricter . this contradiction is evident in various parts of german society .
there is no official state religion or a state church , for example .
yet the state cooperates with the major churches in many aspects , both materially and idealistically . muckel said the constitution allowed the state to collect taxes for the church , for example .
religion was also a regular subject in public schools , he said .
the church in germany is strongly involved in social services , as well , such as in kindergartens , schools and hospitals - with the support of government subsidies . " it 's no accident that the churches in the federal republic are the largest employers following the public service sector , " muckel said . religion is returning to people 's lives the catholic and protestant churches have been complaining about the many members leaving them in droves , putting the church in a perpetual crisis .
they said they are also suffering from the subsequent drop in church taxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama was welcomed like a superstar however , at the same time , there is a new development on the rise : religion 's return into german society - and it is not only limited to christianity . in june of this year , 500,000 people happily celebrated the german protestant church day in cologne .
in july , the red carpet was rolled out for the dalai lama in hamburg .
an audience of over 5,000 people took part in a buddhist seminar given by tibet 's spiritual leader .
another similar event was world youth day in cologne in 2005 , which was the largest international party germany had seen in decades . construction of a mosque is not a legal issue where there is religion , there are symbols , and religions express themselves through rituals and symbolism .
that is what they live on .
the question is : how much religious symbolism could a secular society such as germany 's tolerate without losing the nature of its being ? muckel said one example was the planned construction of a large mosque in cologne .
there were no real legal barriers to the plans , muckel said .
but a controversial discussion has erupted on a political level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are offended by the ban of headscarfs in public schools critics are questioning the height of the minaret and the size of dome .
the questions are endless : how conspicuous can the entire construction be ?
how much of a mosque can a liberal city such as cologne deal with ?
why are those people , who are against the mosque , bothered by it ?
why would the construction of a church be a lesser problem than that of a mosque ? the reaction to this criticism has not been lacking .
muslims feel they are being dealt with unfairly and that their basic religious rights are being violated . selected non-christian symbols are forbidden muslims in germany have said they felt unequal , because of the court rulings that resulted in a headscarf ban .
in most federal states , the bans in public places were adopted , but they were selective and unfair , muslim groups said . in berlin , for example , the symbols of all religious denominations are banned in classrooms , while in other federal states there are many clear differences .
christian and jewish symbols are allowed , for example , while a headscarf , a sign of islam , is forbidden . according to the ban , if a muslim teacher wears a headscarf during class time , the act is considered a demonstration of her religious commitment to a fundamental islam that oppresses women 's rights .
it also violated the religious neutrality of public schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can religious symbolic expression go ?
but teachers with a kippah on their head , a cross around their neck or wearing a catholic habit are allowed to teach in almost all federal states .
these symbols are a sign of western christian tradition , the state legislation said . the federal constitutional court has said it wanted " strict equality " for all religions .
but what does that mean for the fundamental principles of the states ' neutrality for all religions ? that question was going to be put in the center of the debate , gerd-ulrich kapteina , speaker for the düsseldorf administrative court , told deutsche welle .
on august 14 , the courts ruled against the headscarf for teachers in schools .
but kapteina said that differentiating between islamic and christian symbols was inadmissible . in addition to certain other public problems , the headscarf issue depicts the challenge the reanimation of religion puts onto a secular society .

but support still lags in western germany .
dw-world.de asked grassroots party members in western berlin how they plan to change that . on a cold , wet , late-august evening , klemens domning and kaspar scholemann stand in front of a school smoking and hoping to get a good turn-out for a discussion evening calling on the germany military to withdraw from afghanistan . the event is being held in wedding , a down-at-the-heels , working-class district in western berlin .
it 's the sort of area in which the left party - whose positions range from stringent pacifism to significant restrictions on business and an expansion of the social-welfare state - is looking to expand its base . the left party originated in the pds , the successor to socialist unity party in communist east germany .
earlier this year , it merged with the wasg -lrb- electoral alternative for labor and social justice -rrb- from the western part of the country . " it 's a matter of trying to better anchor ourselves , i.e. recruit more members , in western germany , " scholemann , a 27-year-old university student says .
" opinions differ about which segments of society we should be trying to address .
some favor the bourgeois , ecologic and civil-rights milieu , and others think we should emphasize social-welfare questions . " quo vadis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main base of support for the party remains in eastern germany in the 2005 national elections , the left party took 8.7 percent of the vote and became the second most powerful force in three german states - all in the eastern part of the country .
they 're part of the governing coalition in the city state of berlin but have lost support there while in government .
that raises the question of whether a party known for its uncompromising leftist views can - or even should - enter into the inevitable compromises that go with governing . " you have to take the path of compromise and pragmatism , " says domning , a freelance journalist in his mid-fifties .
" but you also should n't sell yourself cheaply .
you have to stay true to your principles and learn to say no . " a coalition at the national level with their closest political rivals , the social democrats , is not on the cards . " you do n't have to be in the government to give weight to demands , " scholemann says .
" my feeling is that a joint government with the spd , given their policies of drastic cuts in the social-benefits system , would be very difficult .
so i think that , for the foreseeable future , the left party will and should remain in the opposition . " a new form of serfdom ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long lines in unemployment offices may help the left party in the west in the school auditorium , around 50 people listen as three speakers argue that germany 's participation in the isaf mission in afghanistan is futile , indeed counterproductive .
that stance runs directly contrary to the policy of the spd - as does the left party 's insistence on reversing the cost-cutting reforms to the social-benefits system begun under ex-chancellor gerhard schröder and continued by the current grand coalition . those cuts , say left party members , amount to a dismantling of germany 's social-welfare system . " first and foremost and to put it bluntly , i want to see a return to social fairness in times of globalization when people are being forced to work for scandalous wages , " domning says .
" that 's a new form of serfdom . " the state has to re-embrace its pro-active function and stop being so dependent on lobbyists , " he continues .
" you do n't get to know any welfare recipients at the buffet table .
we do get to know them , and we want disadvantaged people to be able to take part in society again . " conservative beneficiaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine acrimoniously quit the spd in 2005 for most western germans , the left party remains an organ for easterners disgruntled with the effects of german reunification .
but many expect the party 's policies to increasingly appeal to have-nots in the western states , siphoning off voters from the left wing of the spd . " the party will stay the course and present itself as a leftist alternative in the debate about the social-welfare state , " said oskar niedermayer , a professor of political science at the free university of berlin .
" they 'll continue to try to depict all the other parties as neo-liberal . " that 's bad news for the spd , whose leftist credibility has suffered badly during its coalition of necessity with the conservatives .
the prospect of rapprochement with the left party is distant .
the policy gap is too wide , and the current spd leadership is loathe to work with oskar lafontaine , the former spd leader who deserted ranks to become the left party 's most prominent figure in western germany . ironically , the rise of the left party has proved a temporary boon for conservatives . " the cdu-csu profits in the short term from the fact that the spd shuts itself off from a possible coalition partner , " niedermayer said . " that will likely change in the medium term . " back in the auditorium , the audience nods in approval as one of the speakers ridicules the notion , put forward by former spd defense minister peter struck , that military engagement in afghanistan is crucial to germany ’ s national security . no one here is thinking about burying the hatchet with the social democrats .
and for the left party 's grassroots , that situation is just fine . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet though church and state are kept separate , many germans are asking themselves how much religious symbolism should influence their daily lives . the renaissance of religion is a phenomenon currently growing across the globe .
in germany , this development has raised many difficult questions , for example to what extent religious symbols should exist in public life . religion is a private affair in germany .
yet a cross made of brass hangs on the office wall of professor stefan muckel , head of the institute for ecclesiastical law at the university of cologne .
just opposite is a picture of pope benedict xvi .
according to muckel , the university does not have a problem with the cross , as staff can decorate their office as they choose to . but could he hang the cross on a classroom wall , as well ?
no , muckel said , because then it would become a problem of his neutrality .
in germany , certain public places , such as courtrooms or classrooms , need to ensure absolute neutrality .
expressing attachment towards any religious belief is prohibited . germany 's secular society contradicts itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decorations with a religious theme may not be permitted in a public office according to the constitution , germany is a secular , religiously and ideologically neutral nation , which separates church and state .
in practice , though , the two mix on many levels .
this differs from france , for example , where the separation of the two is much stricter . this contradiction is evident in various parts of german society .
there is no official state religion or a state church , for example .
yet the state cooperates with the major churches in many aspects , both materially and idealistically . muckel said the constitution allowed the state to collect taxes for the church , for example .
religion was also a regular subject in public schools , he said .
the church in germany is strongly involved in social services , as well , such as in kindergartens , schools and hospitals - with the support of government subsidies . " it 's no accident that the churches in the federal republic are the largest employers following the public service sector , " muckel said . religion is returning to people 's lives the catholic and protestant churches have been complaining about the many members leaving them in droves , putting the church in a perpetual crisis .
they said they are also suffering from the subsequent drop in church taxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama was welcomed like a superstar however , at the same time , there is a new development on the rise : religion 's return into german society - and it is not only limited to christianity . in june of this year , 500,000 people happily celebrated the german protestant church day in cologne .
in july , the red carpet was rolled out for the dalai lama in hamburg .
an audience of over 5,000 people took part in a buddhist seminar given by tibet 's spiritual leader .
another similar event was world youth day in cologne in 2005 , which was the largest international party germany had seen in decades . construction of a mosque is not a legal issue where there is religion , there are symbols , and religions express themselves through rituals and symbolism .
that is what they live on .
the question is : how much religious symbolism could a secular society such as germany 's tolerate without losing the nature of its being ? muckel said one example was the planned construction of a large mosque in cologne .
there were no real legal barriers to the plans , muckel said .
but a controversial discussion has erupted on a political level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are offended by the ban of headscarfs in public schools critics are questioning the height of the minaret and the size of dome .
the questions are endless : how conspicuous can the entire construction be ?
how much of a mosque can a liberal city such as cologne deal with ?
why are those people , who are against the mosque , bothered by it ?
why would the construction of a church be a lesser problem than that of a mosque ? the reaction to this criticism has not been lacking .
muslims feel they are being dealt with unfairly and that their basic religious rights are being violated . selected non-christian symbols are forbidden muslims in germany have said they felt unequal , because of the court rulings that resulted in a headscarf ban .
in most federal states , the bans in public places were adopted , but they were selective and unfair , muslim groups said . in berlin , for example , the symbols of all religious denominations are banned in classrooms , while in other federal states there are many clear differences .
christian and jewish symbols are allowed , for example , while a headscarf , a sign of islam , is forbidden . according to the ban , if a muslim teacher wears a headscarf during class time , the act is considered a demonstration of her religious commitment to a fundamental islam that oppresses women 's rights .
it also violated the religious neutrality of public schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can religious symbolic expression go ?
but teachers with a kippah on their head , a cross around their neck or wearing a catholic habit are allowed to teach in almost all federal states .
these symbols are a sign of western christian tradition , the state legislation said . the federal constitutional court has said it wanted " strict equality " for all religions .
but what does that mean for the fundamental principles of the states ' neutrality for all religions ? that question was going to be put in the center of the debate , gerd-ulrich kapteina , speaker for the düsseldorf administrative court , told deutsche welle .
on august 14 , the courts ruled against the headscarf for teachers in schools .
but kapteina said that differentiating between islamic and christian symbols was inadmissible . in addition to certain other public problems , the headscarf issue depicts the challenge the reanimation of religion puts onto a secular society .

" we are in the middle of this process and we hope that we can shape it so that what you fear - a break-up of the common foreign policy position of europe - does not come to pass , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amado said the issue of kosovo is one of the most important facing the eu while ministers meeting in viana do castelo were not keen to acknowledge the possibility of a failure by the troika , it is understood that " plan b " discussions were also held in the northern portuguese town .

" the main thing is to maintain unity , " kouchner told journalists .
" in fact , i 'd prefer to be united than see an individual solution to kosovo . " portuguese foreign minister luis amado , who is hosting the talks , said this week that kosovo 's status " is probably the greatest challenge with which the eu is confronted .

that 's a step belgrade , backed by russia 's veto in the un security council , has called unacceptable . " after the ahtisaari plan unfortunately did n't lead to the result we had hoped for , the prospects are certainly not better now , " steinmeier said . the province is under un administration since nato drove out serb security forces in 1999 . on friday , the ministers made little progress on settling a number of issues concerning a new reform treaty , just six weeks before the discussions on the draft version are due to be concluded . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am sure that the peaceful muslims in our country do not want to see their religious community discredited by violent radicals , " she said in an interview appearing sunday in the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" that 's why i would like to see the communities become active against radicalization and give details to security officials when appropriate .

" i am sure that the peaceful muslims in our country do not want to see their religious community discredited by violent radicals , " she said in an interview appearing sunday in the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" that 's why i would like to see the communities become active against radicalization and give details to security officials when appropriate . " experts said the amount of explosive material the three had assembled would have been able to cause explosions far greater than those in london in july 2005 and in madrid in march 2004 . german prosecutor general monika harms declined to comment on the precise targets , but indications from the security forces were that establishments frequented by us citizens , including military personnel , would have been hit by a serious of coordinated car bombs . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but all recent surveys indicate that an independent majority government or a stable coalition administration is unlikely to emerge from the fresh ballot , likely condemning poland to continued political instability . there is concern both in poland and abroad that the wobbly state of poland 's domestic politics may destabilize its booming economy and wreak further havoc in its foreign policy , particularly with regard to the eu 's key goal of adopting a blanket constitutional treaty . allegations of undemocratic behavior have dogged prime minister kaczynski in recent weeks , with former coalition partners accusing him of using poland 's secret services and the justice ministry in attempts to eliminate them from politics . kaczynski has denied any wrong-doing . history of shaky leadership concerned about the health of poland 's democracy , former czech president vaclav havel recently went so far as to urge international observers to monitor elections in poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish campaign is sure to deal with the country 's relations with germany and the eu analysts have also pointed out that should law and justice win the fresh ballot , political power in poland will remain concentrated in hands of identical twin brothers for the near future . president lech kaczynski 's term in office expires in 2010 , while the full term of the new parliament after the upcoming election will end in the autumn of 2012 . the pre-term october election will be the seventh democratic ballot since the collapse of communism in 1989 . poles last went to the ballot box in september 2005 , giving kaczynski 's pis a narrow 2.9 percent victory over the rival po .
a regularly scheduled election was due to be held in the autumn of 2009 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am sure that the peaceful muslims in our country do not want to see their religious community discredited by violent radicals , " she said in an interview appearing sunday in the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" that 's why i would like to see the communities become active against radicalization and give details to security officials when appropriate .

he is accused of selling qualifications to the tune of nearly 185,000 euros . the law professor at leibniz university in the german city of hanover is also at the center of a scandal in which it is alleged he bumped up exam marks of two of his female students .
as well as exchanging sexual favors for favorable results , the professor is also accused of selling doctorates and conspiring with two managers of a business consulting firm who worked as go-betweens for fake degrees .

" we very much regret the matter , " leibniz university spokeswoman stefanie beier told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .

hanover prosecutors are charging the unnamed professor on 78 counts of corruption .
professor investigated after complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congratulations , doctor ...
the professor may have got away with his sex-for-grades and doctorates-for-cash scam had it not been for his apparent weakness for the ladies .
the randy prof came unstuck when other female students complained to the local examining authority , insisting that they should not have the professor marking their work after his unfair marking criteria became known .
the university began a probe on the back of the complaints which led to the suspension of the professor and his banning from university property .
fearing the professor might seek to flee justice , a hanover court ordered thursday that he remain in custody . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 . " now poles will be able to chose if they want a modernized , growing poland or a poland ruled by a network of oligarchs , " prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski told reporters after the vote . months of political turmoil paved the way to the decision for a pre-term election , with the quarrelsome right-wing law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- minority government of prime minister kaczynski unable to forge a stable majority coalition with two smaller populist parties . but in a debate ahead of the dissolution ballot , pis politicians denied opposition allegations that their party had " capitulated " after a mere two years of its full four-year term in office . polls : elections unlikely to bring stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski said the election will be held in october opinion polls published this week showed the governing pis leading the opposition liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- .
but all recent surveys indicate that an independent majority government or a stable coalition administration is unlikely to emerge from the fresh ballot , likely condemning poland to continued political instability . there is concern both in poland and abroad that the wobbly state of poland 's domestic politics may destabilize its booming economy and wreak further havoc in its foreign policy , particularly with regard to the eu 's key goal of adopting a blanket constitutional treaty . allegations of undemocratic behavior have dogged prime minister kaczynski in recent weeks , with former coalition partners accusing him of using poland 's secret services and the justice ministry in attempts to eliminate them from politics . kaczynski has denied any wrong-doing . history of shaky leadership concerned about the health of poland 's democracy , former czech president vaclav havel recently went so far as to urge international observers to monitor elections in poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish campaign is sure to deal with the country 's relations with germany and the eu analysts have also pointed out that should law and justice win the fresh ballot , political power in poland will remain concentrated in hands of identical twin brothers for the near future . president lech kaczynski 's term in office expires in 2010 , while the full term of the new parliament after the upcoming election will end in the autumn of 2012 . the pre-term october election will be the seventh democratic ballot since the collapse of communism in 1989 . poles last went to the ballot box in september 2005 , giving kaczynski 's pis a narrow 2.9 percent victory over the rival po .

he is accused of selling qualifications to the tune of nearly 185,000 euros . the law professor at leibniz university in the german city of hanover is also at the center of a scandal in which it is alleged he bumped up exam marks of two of his female students .
as well as exchanging sexual favors for favorable results , the professor is also accused of selling doctorates and conspiring with two managers of a business consulting firm who worked as go-betweens for fake degrees .
the managers are alleged to have paid the professor a total of 184,000 euros -lrb- $ 250,000 -rrb- for his assistance in securing qualifications for clients .
" we very much regret the matter , " leibniz university spokeswoman stefanie beier told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .

hanover prosecutors are charging the unnamed professor on 78 counts of corruption .
professor investigated after complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congratulations , doctor ...
the professor may have got away with his sex-for-grades and doctorates-for-cash scam had it not been for his apparent weakness for the ladies .
the randy prof came unstuck when other female students complained to the local examining authority , insisting that they should not have the professor marking their work after his unfair marking criteria became known .
the university began a probe on the back of the complaints which led to the suspension of the professor and his banning from university property .
fearing the professor might seek to flee justice , a hanover court ordered thursday that he remain in custody . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" now poles will be able to chose if they want a modernized , growing poland or a poland ruled by a network of oligarchs , " prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski told reporters after the vote . months of political turmoil paved the way to the decision for a pre-term election , with the quarrelsome right-wing law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- minority government of prime minister kaczynski unable to forge a stable majority coalition with two smaller populist parties . but in a debate ahead of the dissolution ballot , pis politicians denied opposition allegations that their party had " capitulated " after a mere two years of its full four-year term in office . polls : elections unlikely to bring stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski said the election will be held in october opinion polls published this week showed the governing pis leading the opposition liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- .
but all recent surveys indicate that an independent majority government or a stable coalition administration is unlikely to emerge from the fresh ballot , likely condemning poland to continued political instability . there is concern both in poland and abroad that the wobbly state of poland 's domestic politics may destabilize its booming economy and wreak further havoc in its foreign policy , particularly with regard to the eu 's key goal of adopting a blanket constitutional treaty . allegations of undemocratic behavior have dogged prime minister kaczynski in recent weeks , with former coalition partners accusing him of using poland 's secret services and the justice ministry in attempts to eliminate them from politics . kaczynski has denied any wrong-doing . history of shaky leadership concerned about the health of poland 's democracy , former czech president vaclav havel recently went so far as to urge international observers to monitor elections in poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish campaign is sure to deal with the country 's relations with germany and the eu analysts have also pointed out that should law and justice win the fresh ballot , political power in poland will remain concentrated in hands of identical twin brothers for the near future . president lech kaczynski 's term in office expires in 2010 , while the full term of the new parliament after the upcoming election will end in the autumn of 2012 . the pre-term october election will be the seventh democratic ballot since the collapse of communism in 1989 . poles last went to the ballot box in september 2005 , giving kaczynski 's pis a narrow 2.9 percent victory over the rival po .
a regularly scheduled election was due to be held in the autumn of 2009 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 . " now poles will be able to chose if they want a modernized , growing poland or a poland ruled by a network of oligarchs , " prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski told reporters after the vote . months of political turmoil paved the way to the decision for a pre-term election , with the quarrelsome right-wing law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- minority government of prime minister kaczynski unable to forge a stable majority coalition with two smaller populist parties . but in a debate ahead of the dissolution ballot , pis politicians denied opposition allegations that their party had " capitulated " after a mere two years of its full four-year term in office . polls : elections unlikely to bring stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski said the election will be held in october opinion polls published this week showed the governing pis leading the opposition liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- .
but all recent surveys indicate that an independent majority government or a stable coalition administration is unlikely to emerge from the fresh ballot , likely condemning poland to continued political instability . there is concern both in poland and abroad that the wobbly state of poland 's domestic politics may destabilize its booming economy and wreak further havoc in its foreign policy , particularly with regard to the eu 's key goal of adopting a blanket constitutional treaty . allegations of undemocratic behavior have dogged prime minister kaczynski in recent weeks , with former coalition partners accusing him of using poland 's secret services and the justice ministry in attempts to eliminate them from politics . kaczynski has denied any wrong-doing . history of shaky leadership concerned about the health of poland 's democracy , former czech president vaclav havel recently went so far as to urge international observers to monitor elections in poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish campaign is sure to deal with the country 's relations with germany and the eu analysts have also pointed out that should law and justice win the fresh ballot , political power in poland will remain concentrated in hands of identical twin brothers for the near future . president lech kaczynski 's term in office expires in 2010 , while the full term of the new parliament after the upcoming election will end in the autumn of 2012 . the pre-term october election will be the seventh democratic ballot since the collapse of communism in 1989 . poles last went to the ballot box in september 2005 , giving kaczynski 's pis a narrow 2.9 percent victory over the rival po .

he is accused of selling qualifications to the tune of nearly 185,000 euros . the law professor at leibniz university in the german city of hanover is also at the center of a scandal in which it is alleged he bumped up exam marks of two of his female students .
as well as exchanging sexual favors for favorable results , the professor is also accused of selling doctorates and conspiring with two managers of a business consulting firm who worked as go-betweens for fake degrees .
the managers are alleged to have paid the professor a total of 184,000 euros -lrb- $ 250,000 -rrb- for his assistance in securing qualifications for clients .
" we very much regret the matter , " leibniz university spokeswoman stefanie beier told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" but we assume that this is an isolated case of considerable criminal enterprise . "
hanover prosecutors are charging the unnamed professor on 78 counts of corruption .
professor investigated after complaints bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congratulations , doctor ...
the professor may have got away with his sex-for-grades and doctorates-for-cash scam had it not been for his apparent weakness for the ladies .
the randy prof came unstuck when other female students complained to the local examining authority , insisting that they should not have the professor marking their work after his unfair marking criteria became known .
the university began a probe on the back of the complaints which led to the suspension of the professor and his banning from university property .
fearing the professor might seek to flee justice , a hanover court ordered thursday that he remain in custody . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 . " now poles will be able to chose if they want a modernized , growing poland or a poland ruled by a network of oligarchs , " prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski told reporters after the vote . months of political turmoil paved the way to the decision for a pre-term election , with the quarrelsome right-wing law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- minority government of prime minister kaczynski unable to forge a stable majority coalition with two smaller populist parties . but in a debate ahead of the dissolution ballot , pis politicians denied opposition allegations that their party had " capitulated " after a mere two years of its full four-year term in office . polls : elections unlikely to bring stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski said the election will be held in october opinion polls published this week showed the governing pis leading the opposition liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- .
but all recent surveys indicate that an independent majority government or a stable coalition administration is unlikely to emerge from the fresh ballot , likely condemning poland to continued political instability . there is concern both in poland and abroad that the wobbly state of poland 's domestic politics may destabilize its booming economy and wreak further havoc in its foreign policy , particularly with regard to the eu 's key goal of adopting a blanket constitutional treaty . allegations of undemocratic behavior have dogged prime minister kaczynski in recent weeks , with former coalition partners accusing him of using poland 's secret services and the justice ministry in attempts to eliminate them from politics . kaczynski has denied any wrong-doing . history of shaky leadership concerned about the health of poland 's democracy , former czech president vaclav havel recently went so far as to urge international observers to monitor elections in poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish campaign is sure to deal with the country 's relations with germany and the eu analysts have also pointed out that should law and justice win the fresh ballot , political power in poland will remain concentrated in hands of identical twin brothers for the near future . president lech kaczynski 's term in office expires in 2010 , while the full term of the new parliament after the upcoming election will end in the autumn of 2012 . the pre-term october election will be the seventh democratic ballot since the collapse of communism in 1989 . poles last went to the ballot box in september 2005 , giving kaczynski 's pis a narrow 2.9 percent victory over the rival po .

11 , 2001 attacks in the united states . orders reportedly from pakistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the men collected a massive supply of hydrogen peroxide to fuel the planned explosion the three arrested suspects - two german converts to islam and a turk - were reported to have received their instructions from pakistan as well as detonators from syria . media reports said us investigators had helped tip off german investigators and track the men by monitoring internet traffic and that the three men received orders to act by sept .
15 . der spiegel newsmagazine reported that the federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- authorities moved against the alleged terrorists after believing the suspects caught wind of the investigation . the federal police officer , listening in to the suspects ' conversation via a bug planted in their car , heard local police say the men were " on a bka list " during a routine traffic stop , der spiegel reported . a spokeswoman for the federal prosecutors office did not comment on media reports regarding the failed bomb plot , but said the investigation was likely to last several months , barring an unexpected " ground-breaking development .

apart from the three arrested , two other hardcore members were still in germany , the mass-market bild zeitung reported . police , in most cases , did not have sufficient evidence to justify issuing arrest warrants against the suspects , ziercke said . " we 're not out of danger , " he told saturday 's die welt newspaper . the tagesspeigel newspaper said saturday , that terrorist leaders had chosen germany , which has not suffered an attack connected to radical islamist terrorists , in order to increase their own international reputation . germany refused to take part in the us-led iraq war but has nearly 3,000 troops stationed in afghanistan and has been on high alert for attacks . minister : muslims should fight radicalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries called on muslims to help identify violent radicals on the question of the radicalization of muslim converts - " homegrown terrorism " remains the subject of intense debate in germany - justice minister brigitte zypries said she was relying on muslims to report signs of radicalism to the authorities . " i am sure that the peaceful muslims in our country do not want to see their religious community discredited by violent radicals , " she said in an interview appearing sunday in the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" that 's why i would like to see the communities become active against radicalization and give details to security officials when appropriate . " experts said the amount of explosive material the three had assembled would have been able to cause explosions far greater than those in london in july 2005 and in madrid in march 2004 . german prosecutor general monika harms declined to comment on the precise targets , but indications from the security forces were that establishments frequented by us citizens , including military personnel , would have been hit by a serious of coordinated car bombs . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet though church and state are kept separate , many germans are asking themselves how much religious symbolism should influence their daily lives . the renaissance of religion is a phenomenon currently growing across the globe .
in germany , this development has raised many difficult questions , for example to what extent religious symbols should exist in public life . religion is a private affair in germany .
yet a cross made of brass hangs on the office wall of professor stefan muckel , head of the institute for ecclesiastical law at the university of cologne .
just opposite is a picture of pope benedict xvi .
according to muckel , the university does not have a problem with the cross , as staff can decorate their office as they choose to . but could he hang the cross on a classroom wall , as well ?
no , muckel said , because then it would become a problem of his neutrality .
in germany , certain public places , such as courtrooms or classrooms , need to ensure absolute neutrality .
expressing attachment towards any religious belief is prohibited . germany 's secular society contradicts itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decorations with a religious theme may not be permitted in a public office according to the constitution , germany is a secular , religiously and ideologically neutral nation , which separates church and state .
in practice , though , the two mix on many levels .
this differs from france , for example , where the separation of the two is much stricter . this contradiction is evident in various parts of german society .
there is no official state religion or a state church , for example .
yet the state cooperates with the major churches in many aspects , both materially and idealistically . muckel said the constitution allowed the state to collect taxes for the church , for example .
religion was also a regular subject in public schools , he said .
the church in germany is strongly involved in social services , as well , such as in kindergartens , schools and hospitals - with the support of government subsidies . " it 's no accident that the churches in the federal republic are the largest employers following the public service sector , " muckel said . religion is returning to people 's lives the catholic and protestant churches have been complaining about the many members leaving them in droves , putting the church in a perpetual crisis .
they said they are also suffering from the subsequent drop in church taxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama was welcomed like a superstar however , at the same time , there is a new development on the rise : religion 's return into german society - and it is not only limited to christianity . in june of this year , 500,000 people happily celebrated the german protestant church day in cologne .
in july , the red carpet was rolled out for the dalai lama in hamburg .
an audience of over 5,000 people took part in a buddhist seminar given by tibet 's spiritual leader .
another similar event was world youth day in cologne in 2005 , which was the largest international party germany had seen in decades . construction of a mosque is not a legal issue where there is religion , there are symbols , and religions express themselves through rituals and symbolism .
that is what they live on .
the question is : how much religious symbolism could a secular society such as germany 's tolerate without losing the nature of its being ? muckel said one example was the planned construction of a large mosque in cologne .
there were no real legal barriers to the plans , muckel said .
but a controversial discussion has erupted on a political level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are offended by the ban of headscarfs in public schools critics are questioning the height of the minaret and the size of dome .
the questions are endless : how conspicuous can the entire construction be ?
how much of a mosque can a liberal city such as cologne deal with ?
why are those people , who are against the mosque , bothered by it ?
why would the construction of a church be a lesser problem than that of a mosque ? the reaction to this criticism has not been lacking .
muslims feel they are being dealt with unfairly and that their basic religious rights are being violated . selected non-christian symbols are forbidden muslims in germany have said they felt unequal , because of the court rulings that resulted in a headscarf ban .
in most federal states , the bans in public places were adopted , but they were selective and unfair , muslim groups said . in berlin , for example , the symbols of all religious denominations are banned in classrooms , while in other federal states there are many clear differences .
christian and jewish symbols are allowed , for example , while a headscarf , a sign of islam , is forbidden . according to the ban , if a muslim teacher wears a headscarf during class time , the act is considered a demonstration of her religious commitment to a fundamental islam that oppresses women 's rights .
it also violated the religious neutrality of public schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can religious symbolic expression go ?
but teachers with a kippah on their head , a cross around their neck or wearing a catholic habit are allowed to teach in almost all federal states .
these symbols are a sign of western christian tradition , the state legislation said . the federal constitutional court has said it wanted " strict equality " for all religions .
but what does that mean for the fundamental principles of the states ' neutrality for all religions ? that question was going to be put in the center of the debate , gerd-ulrich kapteina , speaker for the düsseldorf administrative court , told deutsche welle .
on august 14 , the courts ruled against the headscarf for teachers in schools .
but kapteina said that differentiating between islamic and christian symbols was inadmissible . in addition to certain other public problems , the headscarf issue depicts the challenge the reanimation of religion puts onto a secular society .

" we are in the middle of this process and we hope that we can shape it so that what you fear - a break-up of the common foreign policy position of europe - does not come to pass , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amado said the issue of kosovo is one of the most important facing the eu while ministers meeting in viana do castelo were not keen to acknowledge the possibility of a failure by the troika , it is understood that " plan b " discussions were also held in the northern portuguese town . " we should not talk ourselves into a crisis , as we so often do , " steinmeier said , before adding that he did not have " too many expectations " for the troika 's success . eu unity crucial for balkans the bloc 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , insisted that the problem of kosovo " is not unsolvable , " and french foreign minister bernard kouchner warned colleagues against being tempted to go it alone on kosovo . " the main thing is to maintain unity , " kouchner told journalists .
" in fact , i 'd prefer to be united than see an individual solution to kosovo . " portuguese foreign minister luis amado , who is hosting the talks , said this week that kosovo 's status " is probably the greatest challenge with which the eu is confronted . " some european diplomats said a rift within in the bloc on the kosovo issue could damage the eu 's credibility on the international political stage . still divided over un plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international peacekeepers have kept watch in kosovo since 1999 a plan by un envoy martti ahtisaari for a supervised independence for kosovo is strongly opposed by serbia and moscow and is disliked by some eu members that have ethnic minorities of their own and which see it as setting a dangerous precedent . the ethnic albanians , who make up the majority of the population in the kosovo , have , however , called for complete independence from serbia .
that 's a step belgrade , backed by russia 's veto in the un security council , has called unacceptable . " after the ahtisaari plan unfortunately did n't lead to the result we had hoped for , the prospects are certainly not better now , " steinmeier said . the province is under un administration since nato drove out serb security forces in 1999 . on friday , the ministers made little progress on settling a number of issues concerning a new reform treaty , just six weeks before the discussions on the draft version are due to be concluded . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet though church and state are kept separate , many germans are asking themselves how much religious symbolism should influence their daily lives . the renaissance of religion is a phenomenon currently growing across the globe .
in germany , this development has raised many difficult questions , for example to what extent religious symbols should exist in public life . religion is a private affair in germany .
yet a cross made of brass hangs on the office wall of professor stefan muckel , head of the institute for ecclesiastical law at the university of cologne .
just opposite is a picture of pope benedict xvi .
according to muckel , the university does not have a problem with the cross , as staff can decorate their office as they choose to . but could he hang the cross on a classroom wall , as well ?
no , muckel said , because then it would become a problem of his neutrality .
in germany , certain public places , such as courtrooms or classrooms , need to ensure absolute neutrality .
expressing attachment towards any religious belief is prohibited . germany 's secular society contradicts itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decorations with a religious theme may not be permitted in a public office according to the constitution , germany is a secular , religiously and ideologically neutral nation , which separates church and state .
in practice , though , the two mix on many levels .
this differs from france , for example , where the separation of the two is much stricter . this contradiction is evident in various parts of german society .
there is no official state religion or a state church , for example .
yet the state cooperates with the major churches in many aspects , both materially and idealistically . muckel said the constitution allowed the state to collect taxes for the church , for example .
religion was also a regular subject in public schools , he said .
the church in germany is strongly involved in social services , as well , such as in kindergartens , schools and hospitals - with the support of government subsidies . " it 's no accident that the churches in the federal republic are the largest employers following the public service sector , " muckel said . religion is returning to people 's lives the catholic and protestant churches have been complaining about the many members leaving them in droves , putting the church in a perpetual crisis .
they said they are also suffering from the subsequent drop in church taxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama was welcomed like a superstar however , at the same time , there is a new development on the rise : religion 's return into german society - and it is not only limited to christianity . in june of this year , 500,000 people happily celebrated the german protestant church day in cologne .
in july , the red carpet was rolled out for the dalai lama in hamburg .
an audience of over 5,000 people took part in a buddhist seminar given by tibet 's spiritual leader .
another similar event was world youth day in cologne in 2005 , which was the largest international party germany had seen in decades . construction of a mosque is not a legal issue where there is religion , there are symbols , and religions express themselves through rituals and symbolism .
that is what they live on .
the question is : how much religious symbolism could a secular society such as germany 's tolerate without losing the nature of its being ? muckel said one example was the planned construction of a large mosque in cologne .
there were no real legal barriers to the plans , muckel said .
but a controversial discussion has erupted on a political level . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are offended by the ban of headscarfs in public schools critics are questioning the height of the minaret and the size of dome .
the questions are endless : how conspicuous can the entire construction be ?
how much of a mosque can a liberal city such as cologne deal with ?
why are those people , who are against the mosque , bothered by it ?
why would the construction of a church be a lesser problem than that of a mosque ? the reaction to this criticism has not been lacking .
muslims feel they are being dealt with unfairly and that their basic religious rights are being violated . selected non-christian symbols are forbidden muslims in germany have said they felt unequal , because of the court rulings that resulted in a headscarf ban .
in most federal states , the bans in public places were adopted , but they were selective and unfair , muslim groups said . in berlin , for example , the symbols of all religious denominations are banned in classrooms , while in other federal states there are many clear differences .
christian and jewish symbols are allowed , for example , while a headscarf , a sign of islam , is forbidden . according to the ban , if a muslim teacher wears a headscarf during class time , the act is considered a demonstration of her religious commitment to a fundamental islam that oppresses women 's rights .
it also violated the religious neutrality of public schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far can religious symbolic expression go ?
but teachers with a kippah on their head , a cross around their neck or wearing a catholic habit are allowed to teach in almost all federal states .
these symbols are a sign of western christian tradition , the state legislation said . the federal constitutional court has said it wanted " strict equality " for all religions .
but what does that mean for the fundamental principles of the states ' neutrality for all religions ? that question was going to be put in the center of the debate , gerd-ulrich kapteina , speaker for the düsseldorf administrative court , told deutsche welle .
on august 14 , the courts ruled against the headscarf for teachers in schools .
but kapteina said that differentiating between islamic and christian symbols was inadmissible . in addition to certain other public problems , the headscarf issue depicts the challenge the reanimation of religion puts onto a secular society .

gerry mccann was officially given " arguido " status about 12 hours after his wife kate .
they had been questioned separately for more than 24 hours .
no bail conditions or charges have been imposed and both deny any involvement in madeleine 's disappearance on 3 may .
earlier , a family spokesman said portuguese police believed kate mccann had killed her daughter accidentally .
asked whether the couple , both 39 , were still protesting their innocence , family spokesman david hughes said : " they certainly are . "
' very low ' mr mccann refused to speak to reporters as he left police headquarters in portimao after eight hours of questioning .
it is understood kate mccann was told she would only face two years in prison if she confessed .
she underwent a second day of questioning on friday .
under portuguese law , police are not allowed to publicly give details of ongoing investigations .
jon corner , a close family friend , said kate mccann had told him officers had tried to " cut her a deal " where she would only serve two years in jail .
he added that she was feeling " very down , very low " and " deflated " .
another family representative said officers believed that traces of four-year-old madeleine 's blood were in the mccanns ' car , hired 25 days after she vanished .
mr mccann arrived at the police headquarters at 1535 bst .
he was not questioned with mrs mccann , who left shortly afterwards .
' ordinary family ' the " suspect " status allows the authorities to put certain questions to mr and mrs mccann , and also gives them the right to remain silent .
arguido / arguida status officially a suspect bestowed by police or requested by individual right to remain silent right to a lawyer must report to police every five days the first formal suspect was robert murat , a british man living locally .
mr and mrs mccann have not been arrested or charged .
mccann family spokesman david hughes said : " she is suspected of accidentally killing her daughter . "
in his latest diary entry on a website publicising the search for madeleine , mr mccann wrote : " the suggestion that kate is involved in madeleine 's disappearance is ludicrous .
" anyone who knows anything about 3 may knows that kate is completely innocent .
we will fight this all the way and we will not stop looking for madeleine . "
meanwhile , friends of the family said that mrs mccann has been told by her lawyer that she could be charged in connection with the disappearance of her daughter .
it is understood that after questioning mrs mccann on thursday , police said they had 22 questions they wanted to ask her during friday 's interview .
samples the mccanns , from rothley , leicestershire , say they left madeleine in the family 's holiday apartment in praia da luz while they went to eat in a nearby restaurant .
mrs mccann had been interviewed by police the day after madeleine disappeared , but thursday was the first time her lawyer had been present .
in a statement released before her interview on thursday , she appealed to her daughter 's abductors , saying : " it is not too late - please let her go or call the police . "
she said : " we came to portugal an ordinary family of five .
we just want to know what happened on 3 may and want to be able to go home one family , reunited . "
a british sniffer dog picked up the scent of a dead body in the apartment and samples , including suspected traces of blood , have been recovered from the scene .
the uk 's forensic science service has spent the past month analysing them .

however , proposals to transfer executive and legislative government to sucre have resulted in demonstrations in both cities and a crisis for president evo morales .
consuelo de miranda is selling out of three items you might not expect to find in a pharmacy : vinegar , bicarbonate of soda and face masks .
her customers will sip the vinegar , dab the bicarbonate of soda under their eyes and wear the masks to reduce the effects of tear gas , which has been used by police to control demonstrators twice this week .
welcome to sucre .
a unesco world heritage site , whose famous white buildings are now daubed in red and black graffiti and where more than 100 hunger strikers are camped out in the main square .
but the fight is not against the so-called " white city " , it is for it .
protesters here want sucre - bolivia 's judicial seat of government , and the constitutional capital - to regain control of the legislative and executive branches of government , currently held by la paz , thus making it the sole capital .
it is a dispute , which has simmered since the country 's civil war in 1898 .
more than 100 years later , it is becoming the most serious crisis evo morales , bolivia 's first indigenous president , has faced since coming to power .
and the campaign is not confined to sucre .
the opposition parties in the eastern and western regions have united behind the cause , saying they are not just fighting for the capital , but for democracy as well .
they joined the sucre protesters after the constituent assembly , which was set up to re-write bolivia 's constitution , voted not to discuss sucre 's claim , a move that was criticised as undemocratic .
now the protesters cry " democracy yes , dictatorship no " as they stomp through the streets , increasingly with batons and sticks in their hands .
' democratic revolution ' but the picture can be confusing .
at a rally last week , i spotted a protester with a swastika on his rucksack .
when he told me he was marching for democracy , i asked what he meant .
he sniggered and shrugged .
" well can you tell me why you have a swastika on your back ? "
i persisted .
he looked at me blankly and said : " what 's a swastika ? "
democracy is still relatively new to bolivia , and many people do not know what it means .
evo morales certainly has the strongest democratic mandate of any bolivian president , having won almost 54 % of the vote .
he has promised social change for bolivia 's indigenous poor , in a process he calls " democratic revolution " .
but critics say he is side-stepping the law , excluding the middle classes , and relying on the armed forces to guarantee his government 's stability .
a factor that makes them nervous in the current climate .
obligation v rights there are also claims that this campaign for democracy displays a worrying disregard for freedom of expression . "
in bolivia , neutrality comes at a price " sitting in one of the only open bars in sucre during a recent stoppage , i was joined by a disgruntled frenchman , iusef abado .
" ' they are trying to make me close the office .
in my country , striking is a right not an obligation , " he said .
in bolivia , neutrality comes at a price .
some academic faculties at sucre 's university penalise students if they fail to join pro-capital demonstrations .
thousands of peasant farmers , or campesinos , continue to march in defence of the constituent assembly , which they see as their ticket to a better future .
but for those who are unwilling to stand up for that future , there are economic and social consequences .
art protest local artist felix arcienega is fiercely independent in his controversial views , and as such ostracised by both left and right .
two weeks ago he publicly displayed a drawing depicting the leaders of the sucre campaign as rats and likening them to the nazis .
the glass , in which the drawing was placed , was smashed .
arcienega was verbally insulted and threatened over the telephone .
when we meet he reminds me of a bolivian salvador dali , with his stern pout and maverick eyebrows , under a wide-brimmed hat .
but what he has to say is fairly straightforward .
" it was an act of artistic and cultural expression .
some people agreed with me and some people did n't , " he says .
" i wanted a healthy and friendly discussion .
but here there is a monopoly over public opinion . "
' bloodshed ' when i leave arcienega 's house , sucre 's skies are filled with black smoke .
fires are lit in the streets and riot police are poised to shoot their canisters of gas .
a group of students have tried to take over the building where the constituent assembly meets , in an effort to make the assembly discuss the capital issue .
" this is serious , " says one masked protester .
" the police are trying to repress us and people say the campesinos are coming .
there 's going to be bloodshed . "
just after midnight i am driven home by a local photographer .
when i tell him i have interviewed arcienega he shakes his head .
" that guy 's half mad " he says .
" he 's not really political .
he just wants to be original . "
my door closes to the distant sound of bangs and explosions and another day in bolivia 's fight for democracy .

protesters here want sucre - bolivia 's judicial seat of government , and the constitutional capital - to regain control of the legislative and executive branches of government , currently held by la paz , thus making it the sole capital .
it is a dispute , which has simmered since the country 's civil war in 1898 .
more than 100 years later , it is becoming the most serious crisis evo morales , bolivia 's first indigenous president , has faced since coming to power .
and the campaign is not confined to sucre .
the opposition parties in the eastern and western regions have united behind the cause , saying they are not just fighting for the capital , but for democracy as well .
they joined the sucre protesters after the constituent assembly , which was set up to re-write bolivia 's constitution , voted not to discuss sucre 's claim , a move that was criticised as undemocratic .
now the protesters cry " democracy yes , dictatorship no " as they stomp through the streets , increasingly with batons and sticks in their hands .
' democratic revolution ' but the picture can be confusing .
these days sucre 's skies are often filled with black smoke at a rally last week , i spotted a protester with a swastika on his rucksack .
when he told me he was marching for democracy , i asked what he meant .
he sniggered and shrugged .
" well can you tell me why you have a swastika on your back ? "
i persisted .
he looked at me blankly and said : " what 's a swastika ? "
democracy is still relatively new to bolivia , and many people do not know what it means .
evo morales certainly has the strongest democratic mandate of any bolivian president , having won almost 54 % of the vote .
he has promised social change for bolivia 's indigenous poor , in a process he calls " democratic revolution " .
but critics say he is side-stepping the law , excluding the middle classes , and relying on the armed forces to guarantee his government 's stability .
a factor that makes them nervous in the current climate .
obligation v rights there are also claims that this campaign for democracy displays a worrying disregard for freedom of expression .
in bolivia , neutrality comes at a price sitting in one of the only open bars in sucre during a recent stoppage , i was joined by a disgruntled frenchman , iusef abado .
" ' they are trying to make me close the office .
in my country , striking is a right not an obligation , " he said .
in bolivia , neutrality comes at a price .
some academic faculties at sucre 's university penalise students if they fail to join pro-capital demonstrations .
thousands of peasant farmers , or campesinos , continue to march in defence of the constituent assembly , which they see as their ticket to a better future .
but for those who are unwilling to stand up for that future , there are economic and social consequences .
art protest local artist felix arcienega is fiercely independent in his controversial views , and as such ostracised by both left and right .
evo morales came to power in december 2005 two weeks ago he publicly displayed a drawing depicting the leaders of the sucre campaign as rats and likening them to the nazis .
the glass , in which the drawing was placed , was smashed .
arcienega was verbally insulted and threatened over the telephone .
when we meet he reminds me of a bolivian salvador dali , with his stern pout and maverick eyebrows , under a wide-brimmed hat .
but what he has to say is fairly straightforward .
" it was an act of artistic and cultural expression .
some people agreed with me and some people did n't , " he says .
" i wanted a healthy and friendly discussion .
but here there is a monopoly over public opinion . "
' bloodshed ' when i leave arcienega 's house , sucre 's skies are filled with black smoke .
fires are lit in the streets and riot police are poised to shoot their canisters of gas .
a group of students have tried to take over the building where the constituent assembly meets , in an effort to make the assembly discuss the capital issue .
" this is serious , " says one masked protester .
" the police are trying to repress us and people say the campesinos are coming .
there 's going to be bloodshed . "
just after midnight i am driven home by a local photographer .
when i tell him i have interviewed arcienega he shakes his head .
" that guy 's half mad " he says .
" he 's not really political .
he just wants to be original . "
my door closes to the distant sound of bangs and explosions and another day in bolivia 's fight for democracy .
