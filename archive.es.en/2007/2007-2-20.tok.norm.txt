dw-world.de talked to him about what these two faltering giants need to do to regain their former dominance . dw-world.de : no one in germany knows these two clubs better than you do . paul breitner : i had the privilege of seeing real madrid from the inside .
it 's a long time ago , but i still follow what 's going on with the team and maintain my contacts there .
and i know bayern very well indeed .
they 're one of the top five clubs in the world . really ?
you would n't think so from looking at the current bundesliga table . you have to distinguish between the club and the current squad .
they 're two totally different animals .
you ca n't equate bayern with the results in any one season .
they 're still one of the best clubs in the world , and the same is true of real .
both teams have had turbulent seasons thus far , and the results have been disappointing .
but they 're still solid institutions . so why are n't they showing it on the pitch ? bayern munich and real madrid are at similar junctures in their history .
both are planning for the long term ; both are reinventing themselves , shaking up their squads .
both are in search of a new soccer identity because neither of them have been live up to their reputation as perennial favorites in their respective leagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madrid holds a slight advantage over munich in the champions league that must be a difficult situation for two clubs that are used to being on top . precisely because expectations are so high , you have to make changes .
what happens today is important for both bayern and real , but what happens tomorrow is more important .
they do n't just want to win their league titles .
they also aim at winning the champions league and their respective national cups .
they want it all .
that 's what makes them so special . what 's the main difference between the two ? money .
real madrid 's financial resources allow them to do short-term planning .
real can change the face of their squad overnight by buying two or three of the world 's top stars and still function in the long term .
bayern are forced to do things differently .
munich ca n't just quickly put together a squad of " galacticos . " what can we expect of baern 's new coach , ottmar hitzfeld ? hitzfeld has a different philosophy than his predecessor felix magath .
but it 's too early to expect anything of him as bayern 's new coach .
he needs time .
do n't expect to see a brand-new bayern munich in their champions league match against real on feb .

it 's the best there is .
this year the tie is even more interesting because the result will determine the rest of the season for both clubs .
the losing side will only have around 10 games left in its respective national league to win a title , otherwise they 'll end the season empty-handed .
that would truly be a year to forget . but if you were to go out of the champions league , you 'd be better able to concentrate on the national title . no one wants to lose , especially not real madrid and bayern munich .
the situation for both clubs is really dramatic because both of them only have a realistic chance of a title if they win the champions league . how do you beat real ?
and how do you beat bayern ? to beat clubs like these , you have play with great concentration over the full 90 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breitner also won the world cup with germany in 1974 who do you think will win the tie ? i have no idea .

dw-world.de talked to him about what these two faltering giants need to do to regain their former dominance . dw-world.de : no one in germany knows these two clubs better than you do . paul breitner : i had the privilege of seeing real madrid from the inside .
it 's a long time ago , but i still follow what 's going on with the team and maintain my contacts there .
and i know bayern very well indeed .
they 're one of the top five clubs in the world . really ?
you would n't think so from looking at the current bundesliga table . you have to distinguish between the club and the current squad .
they 're two totally different animals .
you ca n't equate bayern with the results in any one season .
they 're still one of the best clubs in the world , and the same is true of real .
both teams have had turbulent seasons thus far , and the results have been disappointing .
but they 're still solid institutions . so why are n't they showing it on the pitch ? bayern munich and real madrid are at similar junctures in their history .
both are planning for the long term ; both are reinventing themselves , shaking up their squads .
both are in search of a new soccer identity because neither of them have been live up to their reputation as perennial favorites in their respective leagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madrid holds a slight advantage over munich in the champions league that must be a difficult situation for two clubs that are used to being on top . precisely because expectations are so high , you have to make changes .
what happens today is important for both bayern and real , but what happens tomorrow is more important .
they do n't just want to win their league titles .
they also aim at winning the champions league and their respective national cups .
they want it all .
that 's what makes them so special . what 's the main difference between the two ? money .
real madrid 's financial resources allow them to do short-term planning .
real can change the face of their squad overnight by buying two or three of the world 's top stars and still function in the long term .
bayern are forced to do things differently .
munich ca n't just quickly put together a squad of " galacticos . " what can we expect of baern 's new coach , ottmar hitzfeld ? hitzfeld has a different philosophy than his predecessor felix magath .
but it 's too early to expect anything of him as bayern 's new coach .
he needs time .
do n't expect to see a brand-new bayern munich in their champions league match against real on feb .
20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul breitner - prolific goal-scorer and prolific grower of hair real madrid versus bayern munich is still a dream match-up for soccer fans . the fans wait for games like this the whole year .
it 's the best there is .
this year the tie is even more interesting because the result will determine the rest of the season for both clubs .
the losing side will only have around 10 games left in its respective national league to win a title , otherwise they 'll end the season empty-handed .
that would truly be a year to forget . but if you were to go out of the champions league , you 'd be better able to concentrate on the national title . no one wants to lose , especially not real madrid and bayern munich .
the situation for both clubs is really dramatic because both of them only have a realistic chance of a title if they win the champions league . how do you beat real ?
and how do you beat bayern ? to beat clubs like these , you have play with great concentration over the full 90 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breitner also won the world cup with germany in 1974 who do you think will win the tie ? i have no idea .
for me there 's no favorite .
normally i 'm not afraid of making predictions , but real and bayern are going through such turbulent phases and are miles away from their best form . are you just trying to avoid offending friends of yours in spain and germany ? not at all .
i 'm not embarrassed to say that i really like real madrid .
every bit as much as bayern munich .
i just do n't have a favorite right now , either emotionally or as a soccer analyst . daniel martínez interviewed paul breitner -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schalke slip as bayern fall off bundesliga pace nuremberg moved within a point of fourth-placed bayern munich and a possible champions league spot as a goal from michael beauchamp secured a 1-0 victory over energie cottbus sunday in the german bundesliga .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2007 making children happy the dutch way großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days are here again a recent report on the well-being of children and young people in the world 's advanced economies says the netherlands offers the best environment for children .
so what are dutch youngsters getting that others are not ? the research , which focused on material well-being , health and safety , education , peer and family relationships , behaviors and risks , and young people 's own subjective sense of well-being , to assess child happiness , proved beyond all doubt that the key to a happy child is a happy family .
and that is where the netherlands comes in . carolien gelauff of the netherlands youth institute said a lot of emphasis is put on the family . " the family is important , " she said .
" a lot of time is spent raising children , making sure they have a nice time growing up .
the notion of having happy childhood is common sense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating together is a part of family life yet , apparently not everywhere .
while more than 70 percent of 15 year-olds in the netherlands report that their parents spend time just talking to them several times per week , the figure in germany is just above 40 percent . similarly 90 percent of dutch children in the same age group said they eat the main meal of the day with their parents several times per week , whereas that number dips down to around the 65 percent mark in countries like britain and the us , where there is a greater likelihood of both parents being out at work all day . protected freedom rob van der beek , a father of two , said it is common in the netherlands for women to put their careers on hold while they invest in their families . " it is important to give children a warm and protective environment to grow up in , " he said .
" but within that , they should have the freedom to go and discover the world .
that is our way of thinking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning by doing ruut veenhoven , a professor of social conditions for human happiness at rotterdam 's erasmus university , agreed that such thinking is typical of the netherlands . " you could say the dominant philosophy is to allow children to be free to explore and become independent , " he said . subjective sense of well-being particularly interesting is the way in which young people in the netherlands perceive their own well-being .
in the study , children aged 11 , 13 and 15 were asked : here is a ladder .
the top of the ladder , 10 , is the best possible life for you and the bottom , 0 , is the worst possible life for you .
in general , where on the ladder do you feel you stand at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off to school more than 90 percent of dutch children rated themselves above the middle of the life satisfaction scale .
they do n't drink , smoke or have sex more than average , and the vast majority even claim to like school " a lot . " gelauff said schools are very child-friendly places . " achieving is important , but there is no sense in overdoing it , " she said .
" the world is a hard enough place when children grow up , so parents should be there for their children . " women at work unlike mothers in some other european countries , women in the netherlands tend to take long periods of leave after having a baby , and then when they do eventually go back , they often work shorter hours . " we are world champions at working part-time , " gelauff said .
" especially the women . " veenhoven believes this working trend is quite significant . " although it can not explain the differences to other countries entirely , there is some indication that the number of part-time working mothers contributes to child happiness , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the paternal program ?

so what are dutch youngsters getting that others are not ? the research , which focused on material well-being , health and safety , education , peer and family relationships , behaviors and risks , and young people 's own subjective sense of well-being , to assess child happiness , proved beyond all doubt that the key to a happy child is a happy family .

so what are dutch youngsters getting that others are not ? the research , which focused on material well-being , health and safety , education , peer and family relationships , behaviors and risks , and young people 's own subjective sense of well-being , to assess child happiness , proved beyond all doubt that the key to a happy child is a happy family .
and that is where the netherlands comes in . carolien gelauff of the netherlands youth institute said a lot of emphasis is put on the family . " the family is important , " she said .
" a lot of time is spent raising children , making sure they have a nice time growing up .
the notion of having happy childhood is common sense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating together is a part of family life yet , apparently not everywhere .
while more than 70 percent of 15 year-olds in the netherlands report that their parents spend time just talking to them several times per week , the figure in germany is just above 40 percent . similarly 90 percent of dutch children in the same age group said they eat the main meal of the day with their parents several times per week , whereas that number dips down to around the 65 percent mark in countries like britain and the us , where there is a greater likelihood of both parents being out at work all day . protected freedom rob van der beek , a father of two , said it is common in the netherlands for women to put their careers on hold while they invest in their families . " it is important to give children a warm and protective environment to grow up in , " he said .
" but within that , they should have the freedom to go and discover the world .
that is our way of thinking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning by doing ruut veenhoven , a professor of social conditions for human happiness at rotterdam 's erasmus university , agreed that such thinking is typical of the netherlands . " you could say the dominant philosophy is to allow children to be free to explore and become independent , " he said . subjective sense of well-being particularly interesting is the way in which young people in the netherlands perceive their own well-being .
in the study , children aged 11 , 13 and 15 were asked : here is a ladder .
the top of the ladder , 10 , is the best possible life for you and the bottom , 0 , is the worst possible life for you .
in general , where on the ladder do you feel you stand at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off to school more than 90 percent of dutch children rated themselves above the middle of the life satisfaction scale .
they do n't drink , smoke or have sex more than average , and the vast majority even claim to like school " a lot . " gelauff said schools are very child-friendly places . " achieving is important , but there is no sense in overdoing it , " she said .
" the world is a hard enough place when children grow up , so parents should be there for their children . " women at work unlike mothers in some other european countries , women in the netherlands tend to take long periods of leave after having a baby , and then when they do eventually go back , they often work shorter hours . " we are world champions at working part-time , " gelauff said .
" especially the women . " veenhoven believes this working trend is quite significant . " although it can not explain the differences to other countries entirely , there is some indication that the number of part-time working mothers contributes to child happiness , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the paternal program ?
the same options of shorter working hours are open to men too , although gelauff said it is less common . " men say it is not so easy for them because it is harder to build a career if you work part-time , but some men only work four days a week , " she said , adding that the paternal role has changed a lot in the past years .
" fathers are much more involved than in the old days .
they play with children , look after them , do sport with them , take them swimming and so on . " all of this contributes to what she describes as an overall necessity to " take children seriously and pay attention to their needs .

" he said in the speech broadcast on state television . ahmadinejad told the crowd of thousands the only scenario where iran could halt enrichment was if other nuclear powers suspended the process themselves . " if they say that our nuclear production plant and its fuel cycle should be shut down , this is no problem , " he said .
" but justice necessitates that those who want to negotiate should halt their own nuclear fuel cycles . " the day that iranians can use nuclear fuel and its production cycle fully in the agriculture , medicine and other areas , will be a big leap in the life of iranian people , " ahmadinejad added .

experts say the project is technically underdeveloped and politically risky . " we have agreed that our response to the -lrb- us -rrb- offer will most likely be positive , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on monday at a joint news conference in warsaw with his polish counterpart , jaroslaw kaczynski . the us had asked for permission to station parts of its global missile defense system in the two countries to hinder attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outcome is in the stars - the czech republic 's topolanek kaczynski defended the plans , saying that the missile shield would not be " aimed against any ' normal ' country . "
instead the system would be directed against countries " that do n't want to follow the rules of the modern world , " he added . the plans have provoked a rain of criticism from all over europe .
last week , russian president vladimir putin expressed outrage at the munich conference on security policy over the missile shield .
moscow sees it as a threat .

it 's a long time ago , but i still follow what 's going on with the team and maintain my contacts there .

they 're one of the top five clubs in the world . really ?
you would n't think so from looking at the current bundesliga table . you have to distinguish between the club and the current squad .
they 're two totally different animals .
you ca n't equate bayern with the results in any one season .

both teams have had turbulent seasons thus far , and the results have been disappointing .

this year the tie is even more interesting because the result will determine the rest of the season for both clubs .
the losing side will only have around 10 games left in its respective national league to win a title , otherwise they 'll end the season empty-handed .
that would truly be a year to forget . but if you were to go out of the champions league , you 'd be better able to concentrate on the national title . no one wants to lose , especially not real madrid and bayern munich .

" with airbus , it 's always a double-edged sword : political interests on the one hand , economics on the other , " said horst frey , a finance expert specializing in the automotive and aviation industries . de villepin said the issue of airbus cutbacks would be discussed at a meeting between german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac on friday , raising hopes of a prompt political settlement . germany however has denied that the planned meeting between chirac and merkel will turn into " an airbus summit .

" the paper said it was " understandable " that politicians were rowing over job cuts in view of the billions of euros of public money that had been invested in the company since the 1970s .
" but it 's not intelligent to get too fixed on one thing , " it added . french media too took a dim view of the political interference in airbus 's restructuring . the french le figaro newspaper spoke of a " franco-german divorce " of the airbus marriage .

experts say the project is technically underdeveloped and politically risky . " we have agreed that our response to the -lrb- us -rrb- offer will most likely be positive , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on monday at a joint news conference in warsaw with his polish counterpart , jaroslaw kaczynski . the us had asked for permission to station parts of its global missile defense system in the two countries to hinder attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outcome is in the stars - the czech republic 's topolanek kaczynski defended the plans , saying that the missile shield would not be " aimed against any ' normal ' country . "
instead the system would be directed against countries " that do n't want to follow the rules of the modern world , " he added . the plans have provoked a rain of criticism from all over europe .
last week , russian president vladimir putin expressed outrage at the munich conference on security policy over the missile shield .
moscow sees it as a threat .
general yuri baluyevsky , russian army chief of staff , speculated publicly about whether to withdraw from the 1987 intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty , which had led to the disarmament of medium-range missiles . neighborly relations german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung had criticized the us over the weekend for failing to discuss the plans with moscow .
iran did n't possess any intercontinental rockets that could reach the united states , steinmeier added . but the foreign minister took some of the edge off his comments on monday during a visit to azerbaijan . " as always when a new strategic system is introduced , it 's good to create transparency and to start a dialog as early as possible with those who will be affected , " he said in the azeri capital , baku . washington had subsequently started talks with moscow , he added . meanwhile , the plans are being hotly debated in poland and the czech republic .
two-thirds of czechs are opposed to a missile base , though they are n't particularly averse to having a radar station set up in their country . polish deputy prime minister andrzej lepper has rejected the project .
so far , the poles have too little information to go on , he has said .
lepper has also warned that the poles should not ignore the fears of russia , belarus and ukraine .
he has called for a referendum on the issue . reagan 's legacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czechs do n't want the missiles stationed on their territory the united states wants to build 10 silos for interceptor missiles in poland and an early warning radar station in the czech republic that would also supply intelligence . the national missile defense system -lrb- nmd -rrb- is a leftover from the strategic defense initiative , also known as " star wars , " that president ronald reagan wanted to use to destroy oncoming enemy rockets in outer space .
the project never got off the ground due to technical hurdles and exorbitantly high costs .
in 1999 , president bill clinton breathed new life into the project , focusing on shooting down missiles from the earth .

the rockets are supposed to destroy enemy long-range missiles in the earth 's atmosphere or in space .
the united states have already set up bases in alaska and california for the system to stop rockets from north korea .
poland and the czech republic , which would host the first nmd bases outside the us , would be the outposts against intercontinental projectiles from the middle east - that is , iran . technically and politically risky the system is supposed to be ready to use by 2011 .
but only half of the one dozen tests carried out have been successful .
even former defense minister donald rumsfeld admitted there were weaknesses . the nmd program is also risky politically .
otfried nassauer , director of the berlin information center for transatlantic security , said he could understand russia 's displeasure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the system 's called " son of star wars " the missile defense system could " cover parts of the possible flight paths of intercontinental missiles that are stationed in southern and southwestern russia , " the armaments expert told dw-world.de. as nato planned its expansion to the east , the alliance had guaranteed russia it would not station any important military capacities on the new members ' territory for the long-term , nassauer said . " now moscow feels betrayed because the biggest nato state does n't feel bound -lrb- to that guarantee -rrb- and wants to station national rather than nato capacities , " he said . steinmeier , too , recognizes that the united states unilaterally veering away from that guarantee could strain the political climate between the eu and russia , nassauer added . protection for whom ? in a joint article published in polish daily rzeczpospolita on monday , the polish and czech premiers pleaded their case for the controversial project . " joining the missile defense system will serve as passive protection from attacks … for all members of the transatlantic community , " they wrote . it 's a daring theory .
germany 's steinmeier stressed that the current discussion was only an issue of protecting us territory , and nato sees it that way , too . secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer described the defense system last week as purely a bilateral matter between the united states and the czech republic or poland . andreas leixnering -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany irked by us approach to missile shield american plans to station part of an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic without consulting russia met with criticism from german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , according to a media report .

he said iran would only halt the sensitive nuclear activity if the west suspended its own nuclear programs . " we are in favor of dialog .
but in order for us to talk they are imposing a condition that would deprive us of our right , " ahmadinejad said tuesday during a public rally in rasht , the capital of the northern gilan province . his comments come ahead of the expiration on wednesday of the latest un security council deadline for iran to halt sensitive uranium enrichment work as well as a un watchdog report friday on its compliance with this demand . " we say to them -lrb- the west -rrb- : how can your enrichment factories continue to work when you are asking for a suspension of our activities ? " he said in the speech broadcast on state television . ahmadinejad told the crowd of thousands the only scenario where iran could halt enrichment was if other nuclear powers suspended the process themselves . " if they say that our nuclear production plant and its fuel cycle should be shut down , this is no problem , " he said .
" but justice necessitates that those who want to negotiate should halt their own nuclear fuel cycles . " the day that iranians can use nuclear fuel and its production cycle fully in the agriculture , medicine and other areas , will be a big leap in the life of iranian people , " ahmadinejad added .
" if they think they can create division among iranians with their bullying , attempts and plots , they should know they are 100-percent wrong .
iranians have been standing strong and will defend their nuclear rights until the end . " elbaradei : six months away from enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei -lrb- l . -rrb-
larijani are expected to meet again tuesday iran 's nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , was to meet tuesday with the head of the un atomic watchdog , international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , before the agency releases a crucial report on the iranian program on friday . iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said in an interview in london 's financial times published on tuesday that iran may be able to enrich uranium on a mass scale in just six months , although it could still be 10 years away from the capacity to build a nuclear bomb . iran has moved feedstock gas needed to start uranium enrichment into a nuclear plant designed for industrial-level enrichment , diplomats told afp monday . iran transferred the uranium gas -lrb- uranium hexafluoride , uf6 -rrb- early this month from a conversion facility at isfahan into the underground natanz plant in central iran where it last month started installing centrifuge machines , the diplomats said . provocative acts while iran has not started running the centrifuges , bringing the uranium gas into the plant was " provocative " act as this is " not the act of a country that seeks compromise , " said non-proliferation analyst mark fitzpatrick from the london iiss think tank . the united states accuses iran of seeking a nuclear weapon , a charge denied by tehran , which insists its atomic program is peaceful in nature .
although washington has said it wants the nuclear standoff resolved through diplomacy , it has never ruled out military action to thwart iran 's atomic drive . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe wary of us defense system in poland , czech republic poland and the czech republic have voiced willingness for the us to install parts of a global missile defense system on their territory .

dw-world.de talked to him about what these two faltering giants need to do to regain their former dominance . dw-world.de : no one in germany knows these two clubs better than you do . paul breitner : i had the privilege of seeing real madrid from the inside .
it 's a long time ago , but i still follow what 's going on with the team and maintain my contacts there .
and i know bayern very well indeed .
they 're one of the top five clubs in the world . really ?
you would n't think so from looking at the current bundesliga table . you have to distinguish between the club and the current squad .
they 're two totally different animals .
you ca n't equate bayern with the results in any one season .
they 're still one of the best clubs in the world , and the same is true of real .
both teams have had turbulent seasons thus far , and the results have been disappointing .
but they 're still solid institutions . so why are n't they showing it on the pitch ? bayern munich and real madrid are at similar junctures in their history .
both are planning for the long term ; both are reinventing themselves , shaking up their squads .
both are in search of a new soccer identity because neither of them have been live up to their reputation as perennial favorites in their respective leagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madrid holds a slight advantage over munich in the champions league that must be a difficult situation for two clubs that are used to being on top . precisely because expectations are so high , you have to make changes .
what happens today is important for both bayern and real , but what happens tomorrow is more important .
they do n't just want to win their league titles .
they also aim at winning the champions league and their respective national cups .
they want it all .
that 's what makes them so special . what 's the main difference between the two ? money .
real madrid 's financial resources allow them to do short-term planning .
real can change the face of their squad overnight by buying two or three of the world 's top stars and still function in the long term .
bayern are forced to do things differently .
munich ca n't just quickly put together a squad of " galacticos . " what can we expect of baern 's new coach , ottmar hitzfeld ? hitzfeld has a different philosophy than his predecessor felix magath .
but it 's too early to expect anything of him as bayern 's new coach .
he needs time .
do n't expect to see a brand-new bayern munich in their champions league match against real on feb .
20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul breitner - prolific goal-scorer and prolific grower of hair real madrid versus bayern munich is still a dream match-up for soccer fans . the fans wait for games like this the whole year .
it 's the best there is .
this year the tie is even more interesting because the result will determine the rest of the season for both clubs .
the losing side will only have around 10 games left in its respective national league to win a title , otherwise they 'll end the season empty-handed .
that would truly be a year to forget . but if you were to go out of the champions league , you 'd be better able to concentrate on the national title . no one wants to lose , especially not real madrid and bayern munich .
the situation for both clubs is really dramatic because both of them only have a realistic chance of a title if they win the champions league . how do you beat real ?
and how do you beat bayern ? to beat clubs like these , you have play with great concentration over the full 90 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breitner also won the world cup with germany in 1974 who do you think will win the tie ? i have no idea .
for me there 's no favorite .
normally i 'm not afraid of making predictions , but real and bayern are going through such turbulent phases and are miles away from their best form . are you just trying to avoid offending friends of yours in spain and germany ? not at all .
i 'm not embarrassed to say that i really like real madrid .
every bit as much as bayern munich .
i just do n't have a favorite right now , either emotionally or as a soccer analyst . daniel martínez interviewed paul breitner -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schalke slip as bayern fall off bundesliga pace nuremberg moved within a point of fourth-placed bayern munich and a possible champions league spot as a goal from michael beauchamp secured a 1-0 victory over energie cottbus sunday in the german bundesliga .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2007 making children happy the dutch way großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days are here again a recent report on the well-being of children and young people in the world 's advanced economies says the netherlands offers the best environment for children .
so what are dutch youngsters getting that others are not ? the research , which focused on material well-being , health and safety , education , peer and family relationships , behaviors and risks , and young people 's own subjective sense of well-being , to assess child happiness , proved beyond all doubt that the key to a happy child is a happy family .
and that is where the netherlands comes in . carolien gelauff of the netherlands youth institute said a lot of emphasis is put on the family . " the family is important , " she said .
" a lot of time is spent raising children , making sure they have a nice time growing up .
the notion of having happy childhood is common sense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating together is a part of family life yet , apparently not everywhere .
while more than 70 percent of 15 year-olds in the netherlands report that their parents spend time just talking to them several times per week , the figure in germany is just above 40 percent . similarly 90 percent of dutch children in the same age group said they eat the main meal of the day with their parents several times per week , whereas that number dips down to around the 65 percent mark in countries like britain and the us , where there is a greater likelihood of both parents being out at work all day . protected freedom rob van der beek , a father of two , said it is common in the netherlands for women to put their careers on hold while they invest in their families . " it is important to give children a warm and protective environment to grow up in , " he said .
" but within that , they should have the freedom to go and discover the world .
that is our way of thinking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning by doing ruut veenhoven , a professor of social conditions for human happiness at rotterdam 's erasmus university , agreed that such thinking is typical of the netherlands . " you could say the dominant philosophy is to allow children to be free to explore and become independent , " he said . subjective sense of well-being particularly interesting is the way in which young people in the netherlands perceive their own well-being .
in the study , children aged 11 , 13 and 15 were asked : here is a ladder .
the top of the ladder , 10 , is the best possible life for you and the bottom , 0 , is the worst possible life for you .
in general , where on the ladder do you feel you stand at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off to school more than 90 percent of dutch children rated themselves above the middle of the life satisfaction scale .

it 's a long time ago , but i still follow what 's going on with the team and maintain my contacts there .
and i know bayern very well indeed .
they 're one of the top five clubs in the world . really ?
you would n't think so from looking at the current bundesliga table . you have to distinguish between the club and the current squad .
they 're two totally different animals .
you ca n't equate bayern with the results in any one season .
they 're still one of the best clubs in the world , and the same is true of real .
both teams have had turbulent seasons thus far , and the results have been disappointing .
but they 're still solid institutions . so why are n't they showing it on the pitch ? bayern munich and real madrid are at similar junctures in their history .
both are planning for the long term ; both are reinventing themselves , shaking up their squads .

it 's the best there is .
this year the tie is even more interesting because the result will determine the rest of the season for both clubs .
the losing side will only have around 10 games left in its respective national league to win a title , otherwise they 'll end the season empty-handed .
that would truly be a year to forget . but if you were to go out of the champions league , you 'd be better able to concentrate on the national title . no one wants to lose , especially not real madrid and bayern munich .

experts say the project is technically underdeveloped and politically risky . " we have agreed that our response to the -lrb- us -rrb- offer will most likely be positive , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on monday at a joint news conference in warsaw with his polish counterpart , jaroslaw kaczynski . the us had asked for permission to station parts of its global missile defense system in the two countries to hinder attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outcome is in the stars - the czech republic 's topolanek kaczynski defended the plans , saying that the missile shield would not be " aimed against any ' normal ' country . "
instead the system would be directed against countries " that do n't want to follow the rules of the modern world , " he added . the plans have provoked a rain of criticism from all over europe .
last week , russian president vladimir putin expressed outrage at the munich conference on security policy over the missile shield .
moscow sees it as a threat .
general yuri baluyevsky , russian army chief of staff , speculated publicly about whether to withdraw from the 1987 intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty , which had led to the disarmament of medium-range missiles . neighborly relations german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung had criticized the us over the weekend for failing to discuss the plans with moscow .
iran did n't possess any intercontinental rockets that could reach the united states , steinmeier added . but the foreign minister took some of the edge off his comments on monday during a visit to azerbaijan . " as always when a new strategic system is introduced , it 's good to create transparency and to start a dialog as early as possible with those who will be affected , " he said in the azeri capital , baku . washington had subsequently started talks with moscow , he added . meanwhile , the plans are being hotly debated in poland and the czech republic .
two-thirds of czechs are opposed to a missile base , though they are n't particularly averse to having a radar station set up in their country . polish deputy prime minister andrzej lepper has rejected the project .

the project never got off the ground due to technical hurdles and exorbitantly high costs .

the united states have already set up bases in alaska and california for the system to stop rockets from north korea .
poland and the czech republic , which would host the first nmd bases outside the us , would be the outposts against intercontinental projectiles from the middle east - that is , iran . technically and politically risky the system is supposed to be ready to use by 2011 .
but only half of the one dozen tests carried out have been successful .
even former defense minister donald rumsfeld admitted there were weaknesses . the nmd program is also risky politically .

" now moscow feels betrayed because the biggest nato state does n't feel bound -lrb- to that guarantee -rrb- and wants to station national rather than nato capacities , " he said . steinmeier , too , recognizes that the united states unilaterally veering away from that guarantee could strain the political climate between the eu and russia , nassauer added . protection for whom ? in a joint article published in polish daily rzeczpospolita on monday , the polish and czech premiers pleaded their case for the controversial project . " joining the missile defense system will serve as passive protection from attacks … for all members of the transatlantic community , " they wrote . it 's a daring theory .

airbus employs 20,000 people in each country . german politicians suspect toulouse-based airbus ' french management of forcing german workers to bear the brunt of the job cuts . " the french are fighting for their jobs and their future role , and we as germans can not and should not settle for playing second fiddle , " ditmar staffelt , spd member in parliament and former government coordinator for aerospace issues told reuters . restructuring on hold analysts point out that airbus is no stranger to conflicting national interests and political intereference . the airplane maker is owned by eads , a defence and aerospace company which is 58-percent controlled by french , german and spanish interests which are either state-owned companies or companies with close ties to the state . " with airbus , it 's always a double-edged sword : political interests on the one hand , economics on the other , " said horst frey , a finance expert specializing in the automotive and aviation industries . de villepin said the issue of airbus cutbacks would be discussed at a meeting between german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac on friday , raising hopes of a prompt political settlement . germany however has denied that the planned meeting between chirac and merkel will turn into " an airbus summit . " the franco-german deadlock comes on the heels of a delay of airbus 's radical turnaround strategy - known as " power 8 " - that was supposed to be announced tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois is hemmed in by conflicting political pressures airbus chief louis gallois stressed on monday that consensus was " urgently " needed to implement the " power 8 " restructuring plan aimed at saving 5.0 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- by 2010 and 2.0 billion euros per year thereafter . eads co-chief thomas enders - a german - rejected airbus chief executive and frenchman louis gallois 's scheme for germany and france sharing the work on the company 's a350 plane , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper suggested in its tuesday edition , because he believed that germany would be at a disadvantage . horst frey said the postponement " shows that the german side succeeded in developing a common strategy . " " this means that recommendations from the french side must now be reworked and the cards reshuffled at airbus , " he added . frey said the delay is certainly to germany 's advantage to renegotiate its position . " a disgrace " few agree however . the tuesday edition of germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung paper called the delay in publishing details of re-organizing plans a " disgrace , " with one editorial claiming that " it shows once again how big the danger is that airbus will collapse under the pressure of national interests . " the paper said it was " understandable " that politicians were rowing over job cuts in view of the billions of euros of public money that had been invested in the company since the 1970s .
" but it 's not intelligent to get too fixed on one thing , " it added . french media too took a dim view of the political interference in airbus 's restructuring . the french le figaro newspaper spoke of a " franco-german divorce " of the airbus marriage .
the influential french newspaper le monde ran a headline " airbus paralysed by egoism in paris and berlin " on tuesday , saying that disagreements between the two countries were , if anything , worsening . jobs on the line at the heart of the feuding lies the sensitive issue of jobs . airbus employs around 56,000 people , around 23,000 in germany and france each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both france and germany are battling to avoid massive job cuts trade unions in both countries have said they plan to dig in their heels and defend all the jobs .
employment also remains a key issue in upcoming french elections . one major bone of contention among french and german shareholders of parent company eads is where airbus ' new mid-sized , long-haul a350 xwb jet is to be assembled .
the plane is intended to be a rival to us aircraft manufacturer boeing 's mid-sized 787 and help airbus out of its financial quandary . boeing , for its part , seized first place in the global aircraft market in 2006 for the first time in five years . german workers are particularly fearful since their employer 's cost-cutting plans were triggered by embarrassing delays in airbus ' a380 superjumbo jet .
a plant in hamburg has been blamed for much of airbus 's operating loss for 2006 due to the delays , which cost parent company eads some five billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- in profits . unconfirmed reports have said some of the a380 production could be transferred to airbus plants in toulouse , france , which could also be the assembly site for the new a350 . arne von maydell , spokesperson for the department of economics and employment of the city of hamburg , said that hamburg " expected painful losses with regard to airbus jobs , " but said the city did not want to speculate how many could be at stake . " we will await airbus 's decision about restructuring , but i 'm optimistic that the company will distribute things fairly between germany and france , " he said . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus rescue delayed by new cross-border tensions european aircraft manufacturer airbus delayed announcing details of its long-awaited rescue plan on monday , pointing to renewed strains between germany and france over where cuts will fall .

" but it 's not intelligent to get too fixed on one thing , " it added . french media too took a dim view of the political interference in airbus 's restructuring . the french le figaro newspaper spoke of a " franco-german divorce " of the airbus marriage .
the influential french newspaper le monde ran a headline " airbus paralysed by egoism in paris and berlin " on tuesday , saying that disagreements between the two countries were , if anything , worsening . jobs on the line at the heart of the feuding lies the sensitive issue of jobs . airbus employs around 56,000 people , around 23,000 in germany and france each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both france and germany are battling to avoid massive job cuts trade unions in both countries have said they plan to dig in their heels and defend all the jobs .
employment also remains a key issue in upcoming french elections . one major bone of contention among french and german shareholders of parent company eads is where airbus ' new mid-sized , long-haul a350 xwb jet is to be assembled .
the plane is intended to be a rival to us aircraft manufacturer boeing 's mid-sized 787 and help airbus out of its financial quandary . boeing , for its part , seized first place in the global aircraft market in 2006 for the first time in five years . german workers are particularly fearful since their employer 's cost-cutting plans were triggered by embarrassing delays in airbus ' a380 superjumbo jet .
a plant in hamburg has been blamed for much of airbus 's operating loss for 2006 due to the delays , which cost parent company eads some five billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- in profits . unconfirmed reports have said some of the a380 production could be transferred to airbus plants in toulouse , france , which could also be the assembly site for the new a350 . arne von maydell , spokesperson for the department of economics and employment of the city of hamburg , said that hamburg " expected painful losses with regard to airbus jobs , " but said the city did not want to speculate how many could be at stake . " we will await airbus 's decision about restructuring , but i 'm optimistic that the company will distribute things fairly between germany and france , " he said . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus rescue delayed by new cross-border tensions european aircraft manufacturer airbus delayed announcing details of its long-awaited rescue plan on monday , pointing to renewed strains between germany and france over where cuts will fall .
-lrb- 19.02.2007 -rrb- germans call for parity in airbus restructuring program airbus may be looking for companies to take over production sites threatened with closure under a major restructuring plan , said german state leader christian wulff , after talks with execs from airbus parent firm eads .

so what are dutch youngsters getting that others are not ? the research , which focused on material well-being , health and safety , education , peer and family relationships , behaviors and risks , and young people 's own subjective sense of well-being , to assess child happiness , proved beyond all doubt that the key to a happy child is a happy family .
and that is where the netherlands comes in . carolien gelauff of the netherlands youth institute said a lot of emphasis is put on the family . " the family is important , " she said .
" a lot of time is spent raising children , making sure they have a nice time growing up .
the notion of having happy childhood is common sense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating together is a part of family life yet , apparently not everywhere .
while more than 70 percent of 15 year-olds in the netherlands report that their parents spend time just talking to them several times per week , the figure in germany is just above 40 percent . similarly 90 percent of dutch children in the same age group said they eat the main meal of the day with their parents several times per week , whereas that number dips down to around the 65 percent mark in countries like britain and the us , where there is a greater likelihood of both parents being out at work all day . protected freedom rob van der beek , a father of two , said it is common in the netherlands for women to put their careers on hold while they invest in their families . " it is important to give children a warm and protective environment to grow up in , " he said .
" but within that , they should have the freedom to go and discover the world .
that is our way of thinking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning by doing ruut veenhoven , a professor of social conditions for human happiness at rotterdam 's erasmus university , agreed that such thinking is typical of the netherlands . " you could say the dominant philosophy is to allow children to be free to explore and become independent , " he said . subjective sense of well-being particularly interesting is the way in which young people in the netherlands perceive their own well-being .
in the study , children aged 11 , 13 and 15 were asked : here is a ladder .
the top of the ladder , 10 , is the best possible life for you and the bottom , 0 , is the worst possible life for you .
in general , where on the ladder do you feel you stand at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off to school more than 90 percent of dutch children rated themselves above the middle of the life satisfaction scale .
they do n't drink , smoke or have sex more than average , and the vast majority even claim to like school " a lot . " gelauff said schools are very child-friendly places . " achieving is important , but there is no sense in overdoing it , " she said .
" the world is a hard enough place when children grow up , so parents should be there for their children . " women at work unlike mothers in some other european countries , women in the netherlands tend to take long periods of leave after having a baby , and then when they do eventually go back , they often work shorter hours . " we are world champions at working part-time , " gelauff said .
" especially the women . " veenhoven believes this working trend is quite significant . " although it can not explain the differences to other countries entirely , there is some indication that the number of part-time working mothers contributes to child happiness , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the paternal program ?
the same options of shorter working hours are open to men too , although gelauff said it is less common . " men say it is not so easy for them because it is harder to build a career if you work part-time , but some men only work four days a week , " she said , adding that the paternal role has changed a lot in the past years .
" fathers are much more involved than in the old days .
they play with children , look after them , do sport with them , take them swimming and so on . " all of this contributes to what she describes as an overall necessity to " take children seriously and pay attention to their needs .

so what are dutch youngsters getting that others are not ? the research , which focused on material well-being , health and safety , education , peer and family relationships , behaviors and risks , and young people 's own subjective sense of well-being , to assess child happiness , proved beyond all doubt that the key to a happy child is a happy family .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 20.02.2007 europe wary of us defense system in poland , czech republic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tests of the us missile defense system show room for improvement poland and the czech republic have voiced willingness for the us to install parts of a global missile defense system on their territory .
experts say the project is technically underdeveloped and politically risky . " we have agreed that our response to the -lrb- us -rrb- offer will most likely be positive , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on monday at a joint news conference in warsaw with his polish counterpart , jaroslaw kaczynski . the us had asked for permission to station parts of its global missile defense system in the two countries to hinder attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outcome is in the stars - the czech republic 's topolanek kaczynski defended the plans , saying that the missile shield would not be " aimed against any ' normal ' country . "
instead the system would be directed against countries " that do n't want to follow the rules of the modern world , " he added . the plans have provoked a rain of criticism from all over europe .
last week , russian president vladimir putin expressed outrage at the munich conference on security policy over the missile shield .
moscow sees it as a threat .
general yuri baluyevsky , russian army chief of staff , speculated publicly about whether to withdraw from the 1987 intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty , which had led to the disarmament of medium-range missiles . neighborly relations german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung had criticized the us over the weekend for failing to discuss the plans with moscow .
iran did n't possess any intercontinental rockets that could reach the united states , steinmeier added . but the foreign minister took some of the edge off his comments on monday during a visit to azerbaijan . " as always when a new strategic system is introduced , it 's good to create transparency and to start a dialog as early as possible with those who will be affected , " he said in the azeri capital , baku . washington had subsequently started talks with moscow , he added . meanwhile , the plans are being hotly debated in poland and the czech republic .
two-thirds of czechs are opposed to a missile base , though they are n't particularly averse to having a radar station set up in their country . polish deputy prime minister andrzej lepper has rejected the project .

experts say the project is technically underdeveloped and politically risky . " we have agreed that our response to the -lrb- us -rrb- offer will most likely be positive , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on monday at a joint news conference in warsaw with his polish counterpart , jaroslaw kaczynski . the us had asked for permission to station parts of its global missile defense system in the two countries to hinder attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outcome is in the stars - the czech republic 's topolanek kaczynski defended the plans , saying that the missile shield would not be " aimed against any ' normal ' country . "
instead the system would be directed against countries " that do n't want to follow the rules of the modern world , " he added . the plans have provoked a rain of criticism from all over europe .
last week , russian president vladimir putin expressed outrage at the munich conference on security policy over the missile shield .
moscow sees it as a threat .
general yuri baluyevsky , russian army chief of staff , speculated publicly about whether to withdraw from the 1987 intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty , which had led to the disarmament of medium-range missiles . neighborly relations german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung had criticized the us over the weekend for failing to discuss the plans with moscow .
iran did n't possess any intercontinental rockets that could reach the united states , steinmeier added . but the foreign minister took some of the edge off his comments on monday during a visit to azerbaijan . " as always when a new strategic system is introduced , it 's good to create transparency and to start a dialog as early as possible with those who will be affected , " he said in the azeri capital , baku . washington had subsequently started talks with moscow , he added . meanwhile , the plans are being hotly debated in poland and the czech republic .
two-thirds of czechs are opposed to a missile base , though they are n't particularly averse to having a radar station set up in their country . polish deputy prime minister andrzej lepper has rejected the project .
so far , the poles have too little information to go on , he has said .
lepper has also warned that the poles should not ignore the fears of russia , belarus and ukraine .
he has called for a referendum on the issue . reagan 's legacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czechs do n't want the missiles stationed on their territory the united states wants to build 10 silos for interceptor missiles in poland and an early warning radar station in the czech republic that would also supply intelligence . the national missile defense system -lrb- nmd -rrb- is a leftover from the strategic defense initiative , also known as " star wars , " that president ronald reagan wanted to use to destroy oncoming enemy rockets in outer space .
the project never got off the ground due to technical hurdles and exorbitantly high costs .
in 1999 , president bill clinton breathed new life into the project , focusing on shooting down missiles from the earth .
george w. bush has been a committed backer of the system since even before the sept .
11 attacks on new york and washington . with a budget of at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.6 billion euros -rrb- , nmd is the most expensive military project ever .
the rockets are supposed to destroy enemy long-range missiles in the earth 's atmosphere or in space .
the united states have already set up bases in alaska and california for the system to stop rockets from north korea .
poland and the czech republic , which would host the first nmd bases outside the us , would be the outposts against intercontinental projectiles from the middle east - that is , iran . technically and politically risky the system is supposed to be ready to use by 2011 .
but only half of the one dozen tests carried out have been successful .
even former defense minister donald rumsfeld admitted there were weaknesses . the nmd program is also risky politically .
otfried nassauer , director of the berlin information center for transatlantic security , said he could understand russia 's displeasure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the system 's called " son of star wars " the missile defense system could " cover parts of the possible flight paths of intercontinental missiles that are stationed in southern and southwestern russia , " the armaments expert told dw-world.de. as nato planned its expansion to the east , the alliance had guaranteed russia it would not station any important military capacities on the new members ' territory for the long-term , nassauer said . " now moscow feels betrayed because the biggest nato state does n't feel bound -lrb- to that guarantee -rrb- and wants to station national rather than nato capacities , " he said . steinmeier , too , recognizes that the united states unilaterally veering away from that guarantee could strain the political climate between the eu and russia , nassauer added . protection for whom ? in a joint article published in polish daily rzeczpospolita on monday , the polish and czech premiers pleaded their case for the controversial project . " joining the missile defense system will serve as passive protection from attacks … for all members of the transatlantic community , " they wrote . it 's a daring theory .
germany 's steinmeier stressed that the current discussion was only an issue of protecting us territory , and nato sees it that way , too . secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer described the defense system last week as purely a bilateral matter between the united states and the czech republic or poland . andreas leixnering -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany irked by us approach to missile shield american plans to station part of an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic without consulting russia met with criticism from german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , according to a media report .

what better reason to leave the car at home ? berlin 's public transport authority , the bvg , has a reputation for unorthodoxy .
they have staged an underground short-film festival and hosted occasional parties on trams , buses and trains .
now they 've set up an on-line page where love-besotted urbanites can post personal ads to those special strangers who stole their hearts on the subway . users specify the date , the time and the number of the subway line where their eye was caught - as well as a clear description so the person in question can recognize her- or himself .
the web site even offers advice to would-be recipients of smitten declarations of passion , including what to wear and how to flash that enchanting smile . " we 're doing this to create good-will , of course , " said bvg press spokesman klaus wazlak .
" it 's a small way of showing our human side and depicting public transport as a positive space . " and of counteracting germany 's declining birthrates ?
" no , no , " wazlak said .
" that 's probably beyond our capabilities . " cold fries , flaming hearts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are these berlin commuters heading toward new romance ?
the bvg launched the new page on february 14 - valentine 's day - and almost a week later less than 50 people had responded .
but its initiators are n't discouraged . " it 's not just the number of messages , " wazlak said .
" today alone we 've had around 20,000 hits .
and we think word-of-mouth will do the rest . " indeed , the messages posted thus far make for interesting reading .
users have fallen for ticket inspectors and have written in looking for " the blond mohawk with the black earlobes " or " anna , the violinist from bremen , with the cold french fries . " " i 'm the hunchback with the case of the sniffles " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's new double-decker house of love some of the responses read like miniature romance novels .
" i see you every morning , when you get on in königs wusterhausen , " wrote one user .
" i always see you in the bus and on the train , and i hope you notice me , too . " a moving tale of silent , unrequited longing - or so you might think until you read the next message from this user , which seems to proclaim an equally fervent passion for another commuter heading in the opposite direction . some of the postings verge on monty python .
" o , blue-eyed creature with the thinning hair , " wrote one man .
" you gleefully smeared your kebab across your transparent blouse and impishly smiled at me .
please contact me .
i 'm the hunchback with the slight case of the sniffles and the stack of newspapers under his arm . "
" i do n't think the hunchback has much of a chance , " wazlak said .
" if he 's real . " but the bvg does n't mind if there are some jokes geting mixed among missives from genuine lonely hearts . " that 's also part of the fun , " wazlak said . with such a healthy sense of humor , here 's hoping for the first bvg-mediated marriage - but preferably not between a blond punk with black earlobes and a newspaper-bearing hunchback ! jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happiness is … love and vacation valentine 's day is the day of love .

he said iran would only halt the sensitive nuclear activity if the west suspended its own nuclear programs . " we are in favor of dialog .
but in order for us to talk they are imposing a condition that would deprive us of our right , " ahmadinejad said tuesday during a public rally in rasht , the capital of the northern gilan province . his comments come ahead of the expiration on wednesday of the latest un security council deadline for iran to halt sensitive uranium enrichment work as well as a un watchdog report friday on its compliance with this demand . " we say to them -lrb- the west -rrb- : how can your enrichment factories continue to work when you are asking for a suspension of our activities ? " he said in the speech broadcast on state television . ahmadinejad told the crowd of thousands the only scenario where iran could halt enrichment was if other nuclear powers suspended the process themselves . " if they say that our nuclear production plant and its fuel cycle should be shut down , this is no problem , " he said .
" but justice necessitates that those who want to negotiate should halt their own nuclear fuel cycles .

dw-world.de talked to him about what these two faltering giants need to do to regain their former dominance . dw-world.de : no one in germany knows these two clubs better than you do . paul breitner : i had the privilege of seeing real madrid from the inside .
it 's a long time ago , but i still follow what 's going on with the team and maintain my contacts there .
and i know bayern very well indeed .
they 're one of the top five clubs in the world . really ?
you would n't think so from looking at the current bundesliga table . you have to distinguish between the club and the current squad .
they 're two totally different animals .
you ca n't equate bayern with the results in any one season .
they 're still one of the best clubs in the world , and the same is true of real .
both teams have had turbulent seasons thus far , and the results have been disappointing .
but they 're still solid institutions . so why are n't they showing it on the pitch ? bayern munich and real madrid are at similar junctures in their history .
both are planning for the long term ; both are reinventing themselves , shaking up their squads .
both are in search of a new soccer identity because neither of them have been live up to their reputation as perennial favorites in their respective leagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madrid holds a slight advantage over munich in the champions league that must be a difficult situation for two clubs that are used to being on top . precisely because expectations are so high , you have to make changes .
what happens today is important for both bayern and real , but what happens tomorrow is more important .
they do n't just want to win their league titles .
they also aim at winning the champions league and their respective national cups .
they want it all .
that 's what makes them so special . what 's the main difference between the two ? money .
real madrid 's financial resources allow them to do short-term planning .
real can change the face of their squad overnight by buying two or three of the world 's top stars and still function in the long term .
bayern are forced to do things differently .
munich ca n't just quickly put together a squad of " galacticos . " what can we expect of baern 's new coach , ottmar hitzfeld ? hitzfeld has a different philosophy than his predecessor felix magath .
but it 's too early to expect anything of him as bayern 's new coach .
he needs time .
do n't expect to see a brand-new bayern munich in their champions league match against real on feb .
20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul breitner - prolific goal-scorer and prolific grower of hair real madrid versus bayern munich is still a dream match-up for soccer fans . the fans wait for games like this the whole year .
it 's the best there is .
this year the tie is even more interesting because the result will determine the rest of the season for both clubs .
the losing side will only have around 10 games left in its respective national league to win a title , otherwise they 'll end the season empty-handed .
that would truly be a year to forget . but if you were to go out of the champions league , you 'd be better able to concentrate on the national title . no one wants to lose , especially not real madrid and bayern munich .
the situation for both clubs is really dramatic because both of them only have a realistic chance of a title if they win the champions league . how do you beat real ?
and how do you beat bayern ? to beat clubs like these , you have play with great concentration over the full 90 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breitner also won the world cup with germany in 1974 who do you think will win the tie ? i have no idea .
for me there 's no favorite .
normally i 'm not afraid of making predictions , but real and bayern are going through such turbulent phases and are miles away from their best form . are you just trying to avoid offending friends of yours in spain and germany ? not at all .
i 'm not embarrassed to say that i really like real madrid .
every bit as much as bayern munich .
i just do n't have a favorite right now , either emotionally or as a soccer analyst . daniel martínez interviewed paul breitner -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schalke slip as bayern fall off bundesliga pace nuremberg moved within a point of fourth-placed bayern munich and a possible champions league spot as a goal from michael beauchamp secured a 1-0 victory over energie cottbus sunday in the german bundesliga .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2007 making children happy the dutch way großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days are here again a recent report on the well-being of children and young people in the world 's advanced economies says the netherlands offers the best environment for children .
so what are dutch youngsters getting that others are not ? the research , which focused on material well-being , health and safety , education , peer and family relationships , behaviors and risks , and young people 's own subjective sense of well-being , to assess child happiness , proved beyond all doubt that the key to a happy child is a happy family .
and that is where the netherlands comes in . carolien gelauff of the netherlands youth institute said a lot of emphasis is put on the family . " the family is important , " she said .
" a lot of time is spent raising children , making sure they have a nice time growing up .
the notion of having happy childhood is common sense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating together is a part of family life yet , apparently not everywhere .
while more than 70 percent of 15 year-olds in the netherlands report that their parents spend time just talking to them several times per week , the figure in germany is just above 40 percent . similarly 90 percent of dutch children in the same age group said they eat the main meal of the day with their parents several times per week , whereas that number dips down to around the 65 percent mark in countries like britain and the us , where there is a greater likelihood of both parents being out at work all day . protected freedom rob van der beek , a father of two , said it is common in the netherlands for women to put their careers on hold while they invest in their families . " it is important to give children a warm and protective environment to grow up in , " he said .
" but within that , they should have the freedom to go and discover the world .
that is our way of thinking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning by doing ruut veenhoven , a professor of social conditions for human happiness at rotterdam 's erasmus university , agreed that such thinking is typical of the netherlands . " you could say the dominant philosophy is to allow children to be free to explore and become independent , " he said . subjective sense of well-being particularly interesting is the way in which young people in the netherlands perceive their own well-being .
in the study , children aged 11 , 13 and 15 were asked : here is a ladder .
the top of the ladder , 10 , is the best possible life for you and the bottom , 0 , is the worst possible life for you .
in general , where on the ladder do you feel you stand at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off to school more than 90 percent of dutch children rated themselves above the middle of the life satisfaction scale .
they do n't drink , smoke or have sex more than average , and the vast majority even claim to like school " a lot . " gelauff said schools are very child-friendly places . " achieving is important , but there is no sense in overdoing it , " she said .
" the world is a hard enough place when children grow up , so parents should be there for their children . " women at work unlike mothers in some other european countries , women in the netherlands tend to take long periods of leave after having a baby , and then when they do eventually go back , they often work shorter hours . " we are world champions at working part-time , " gelauff said .
" especially the women . " veenhoven believes this working trend is quite significant . " although it can not explain the differences to other countries entirely , there is some indication that the number of part-time working mothers contributes to child happiness , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the paternal program ?
the same options of shorter working hours are open to men too , although gelauff said it is less common . " men say it is not so easy for them because it is harder to build a career if you work part-time , but some men only work four days a week , " she said , adding that the paternal role has changed a lot in the past years .
" fathers are much more involved than in the old days .
they play with children , look after them , do sport with them , take them swimming and so on . " all of this contributes to what she describes as an overall necessity to " take children seriously and pay attention to their needs .

he said iran would only halt the sensitive nuclear activity if the west suspended its own nuclear programs . " we are in favor of dialog .
but in order for us to talk they are imposing a condition that would deprive us of our right , " ahmadinejad said tuesday during a public rally in rasht , the capital of the northern gilan province . his comments come ahead of the expiration on wednesday of the latest un security council deadline for iran to halt sensitive uranium enrichment work as well as a un watchdog report friday on its compliance with this demand . " we say to them -lrb- the west -rrb- : how can your enrichment factories continue to work when you are asking for a suspension of our activities ? " he said in the speech broadcast on state television . ahmadinejad told the crowd of thousands the only scenario where iran could halt enrichment was if other nuclear powers suspended the process themselves . " if they say that our nuclear production plant and its fuel cycle should be shut down , this is no problem , " he said .
" but justice necessitates that those who want to negotiate should halt their own nuclear fuel cycles . " the day that iranians can use nuclear fuel and its production cycle fully in the agriculture , medicine and other areas , will be a big leap in the life of iranian people , " ahmadinejad added .
" if they think they can create division among iranians with their bullying , attempts and plots , they should know they are 100-percent wrong .
iranians have been standing strong and will defend their nuclear rights until the end . " elbaradei : six months away from enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei -lrb- l . -rrb-
larijani are expected to meet again tuesday iran 's nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , was to meet tuesday with the head of the un atomic watchdog , international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , before the agency releases a crucial report on the iranian program on friday . iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said in an interview in london 's financial times published on tuesday that iran may be able to enrich uranium on a mass scale in just six months , although it could still be 10 years away from the capacity to build a nuclear bomb . iran has moved feedstock gas needed to start uranium enrichment into a nuclear plant designed for industrial-level enrichment , diplomats told afp monday . iran transferred the uranium gas -lrb- uranium hexafluoride , uf6 -rrb- early this month from a conversion facility at isfahan into the underground natanz plant in central iran where it last month started installing centrifuge machines , the diplomats said . provocative acts while iran has not started running the centrifuges , bringing the uranium gas into the plant was " provocative " act as this is " not the act of a country that seeks compromise , " said non-proliferation analyst mark fitzpatrick from the london iiss think tank . the united states accuses iran of seeking a nuclear weapon , a charge denied by tehran , which insists its atomic program is peaceful in nature .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2007 making children happy the dutch way großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days are here again a recent report on the well-being of children and young people in the world 's advanced economies says the netherlands offers the best environment for children .
so what are dutch youngsters getting that others are not ? the research , which focused on material well-being , health and safety , education , peer and family relationships , behaviors and risks , and young people 's own subjective sense of well-being , to assess child happiness , proved beyond all doubt that the key to a happy child is a happy family .
and that is where the netherlands comes in . carolien gelauff of the netherlands youth institute said a lot of emphasis is put on the family . " the family is important , " she said .
" a lot of time is spent raising children , making sure they have a nice time growing up .
the notion of having happy childhood is common sense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating together is a part of family life yet , apparently not everywhere .
while more than 70 percent of 15 year-olds in the netherlands report that their parents spend time just talking to them several times per week , the figure in germany is just above 40 percent . similarly 90 percent of dutch children in the same age group said they eat the main meal of the day with their parents several times per week , whereas that number dips down to around the 65 percent mark in countries like britain and the us , where there is a greater likelihood of both parents being out at work all day . protected freedom rob van der beek , a father of two , said it is common in the netherlands for women to put their careers on hold while they invest in their families . " it is important to give children a warm and protective environment to grow up in , " he said .
" but within that , they should have the freedom to go and discover the world .
that is our way of thinking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning by doing ruut veenhoven , a professor of social conditions for human happiness at rotterdam 's erasmus university , agreed that such thinking is typical of the netherlands . " you could say the dominant philosophy is to allow children to be free to explore and become independent , " he said . subjective sense of well-being particularly interesting is the way in which young people in the netherlands perceive their own well-being .
in the study , children aged 11 , 13 and 15 were asked : here is a ladder .
the top of the ladder , 10 , is the best possible life for you and the bottom , 0 , is the worst possible life for you .
in general , where on the ladder do you feel you stand at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off to school more than 90 percent of dutch children rated themselves above the middle of the life satisfaction scale .
they do n't drink , smoke or have sex more than average , and the vast majority even claim to like school " a lot . " gelauff said schools are very child-friendly places . " achieving is important , but there is no sense in overdoing it , " she said .
" the world is a hard enough place when children grow up , so parents should be there for their children . " women at work unlike mothers in some other european countries , women in the netherlands tend to take long periods of leave after having a baby , and then when they do eventually go back , they often work shorter hours . " we are world champions at working part-time , " gelauff said .
" especially the women . " veenhoven believes this working trend is quite significant . " although it can not explain the differences to other countries entirely , there is some indication that the number of part-time working mothers contributes to child happiness , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the paternal program ?
the same options of shorter working hours are open to men too , although gelauff said it is less common . " men say it is not so easy for them because it is harder to build a career if you work part-time , but some men only work four days a week , " she said , adding that the paternal role has changed a lot in the past years .
" fathers are much more involved than in the old days .
they play with children , look after them , do sport with them , take them swimming and so on . " all of this contributes to what she describes as an overall necessity to " take children seriously and pay attention to their needs .

airbus employs 20,000 people in each country . german politicians suspect toulouse-based airbus ' french management of forcing german workers to bear the brunt of the job cuts . " the french are fighting for their jobs and their future role , and we as germans can not and should not settle for playing second fiddle , " ditmar staffelt , spd member in parliament and former government coordinator for aerospace issues told reuters . restructuring on hold analysts point out that airbus is no stranger to conflicting national interests and political intereference . the airplane maker is owned by eads , a defence and aerospace company which is 58-percent controlled by french , german and spanish interests which are either state-owned companies or companies with close ties to the state . " with airbus , it 's always a double-edged sword : political interests on the one hand , economics on the other , " said horst frey , a finance expert specializing in the automotive and aviation industries . de villepin said the issue of airbus cutbacks would be discussed at a meeting between german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac on friday , raising hopes of a prompt political settlement . germany however has denied that the planned meeting between chirac and merkel will turn into " an airbus summit . " the franco-german deadlock comes on the heels of a delay of airbus 's radical turnaround strategy - known as " power 8 " - that was supposed to be announced tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois is hemmed in by conflicting political pressures airbus chief louis gallois stressed on monday that consensus was " urgently " needed to implement the " power 8 " restructuring plan aimed at saving 5.0 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- by 2010 and 2.0 billion euros per year thereafter . eads co-chief thomas enders - a german - rejected airbus chief executive and frenchman louis gallois 's scheme for germany and france sharing the work on the company 's a350 plane , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper suggested in its tuesday edition , because he believed that germany would be at a disadvantage . horst frey said the postponement " shows that the german side succeeded in developing a common strategy . " " this means that recommendations from the french side must now be reworked and the cards reshuffled at airbus , " he added . frey said the delay is certainly to germany 's advantage to renegotiate its position . " a disgrace " few agree however . the tuesday edition of germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung paper called the delay in publishing details of re-organizing plans a " disgrace , " with one editorial claiming that " it shows once again how big the danger is that airbus will collapse under the pressure of national interests . " the paper said it was " understandable " that politicians were rowing over job cuts in view of the billions of euros of public money that had been invested in the company since the 1970s .
" but it 's not intelligent to get too fixed on one thing , " it added . french media too took a dim view of the political interference in airbus 's restructuring . the french le figaro newspaper spoke of a " franco-german divorce " of the airbus marriage .
the influential french newspaper le monde ran a headline " airbus paralysed by egoism in paris and berlin " on tuesday , saying that disagreements between the two countries were , if anything , worsening . jobs on the line at the heart of the feuding lies the sensitive issue of jobs . airbus employs around 56,000 people , around 23,000 in germany and france each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both france and germany are battling to avoid massive job cuts trade unions in both countries have said they plan to dig in their heels and defend all the jobs .
employment also remains a key issue in upcoming french elections . one major bone of contention among french and german shareholders of parent company eads is where airbus ' new mid-sized , long-haul a350 xwb jet is to be assembled .
the plane is intended to be a rival to us aircraft manufacturer boeing 's mid-sized 787 and help airbus out of its financial quandary . boeing , for its part , seized first place in the global aircraft market in 2006 for the first time in five years . german workers are particularly fearful since their employer 's cost-cutting plans were triggered by embarrassing delays in airbus ' a380 superjumbo jet .
a plant in hamburg has been blamed for much of airbus 's operating loss for 2006 due to the delays , which cost parent company eads some five billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- in profits . unconfirmed reports have said some of the a380 production could be transferred to airbus plants in toulouse , france , which could also be the assembly site for the new a350 . arne von maydell , spokesperson for the department of economics and employment of the city of hamburg , said that hamburg " expected painful losses with regard to airbus jobs , " but said the city did not want to speculate how many could be at stake . " we will await airbus 's decision about restructuring , but i 'm optimistic that the company will distribute things fairly between germany and france , " he said . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus rescue delayed by new cross-border tensions european aircraft manufacturer airbus delayed announcing details of its long-awaited rescue plan on monday , pointing to renewed strains between germany and france over where cuts will fall .

he said iran would only halt the sensitive nuclear activity if the west suspended its own nuclear programs . " we are in favor of dialog .
but in order for us to talk they are imposing a condition that would deprive us of our right , " ahmadinejad said tuesday during a public rally in rasht , the capital of the northern gilan province . his comments come ahead of the expiration on wednesday of the latest un security council deadline for iran to halt sensitive uranium enrichment work as well as a un watchdog report friday on its compliance with this demand . " we say to them -lrb- the west -rrb- : how can your enrichment factories continue to work when you are asking for a suspension of our activities ? " he said in the speech broadcast on state television . ahmadinejad told the crowd of thousands the only scenario where iran could halt enrichment was if other nuclear powers suspended the process themselves . " if they say that our nuclear production plant and its fuel cycle should be shut down , this is no problem , " he said .
" but justice necessitates that those who want to negotiate should halt their own nuclear fuel cycles . " the day that iranians can use nuclear fuel and its production cycle fully in the agriculture , medicine and other areas , will be a big leap in the life of iranian people , " ahmadinejad added .
" if they think they can create division among iranians with their bullying , attempts and plots , they should know they are 100-percent wrong .
iranians have been standing strong and will defend their nuclear rights until the end . " elbaradei : six months away from enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei -lrb- l . -rrb-
larijani are expected to meet again tuesday iran 's nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , was to meet tuesday with the head of the un atomic watchdog , international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , before the agency releases a crucial report on the iranian program on friday . iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said in an interview in london 's financial times published on tuesday that iran may be able to enrich uranium on a mass scale in just six months , although it could still be 10 years away from the capacity to build a nuclear bomb . iran has moved feedstock gas needed to start uranium enrichment into a nuclear plant designed for industrial-level enrichment , diplomats told afp monday . iran transferred the uranium gas -lrb- uranium hexafluoride , uf6 -rrb- early this month from a conversion facility at isfahan into the underground natanz plant in central iran where it last month started installing centrifuge machines , the diplomats said . provocative acts while iran has not started running the centrifuges , bringing the uranium gas into the plant was " provocative " act as this is " not the act of a country that seeks compromise , " said non-proliferation analyst mark fitzpatrick from the london iiss think tank . the united states accuses iran of seeking a nuclear weapon , a charge denied by tehran , which insists its atomic program is peaceful in nature .
although washington has said it wants the nuclear standoff resolved through diplomacy , it has never ruled out military action to thwart iran 's atomic drive . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe wary of us defense system in poland , czech republic poland and the czech republic have voiced willingness for the us to install parts of a global missile defense system on their territory .
experts say the project is technically underdeveloped and politically risky .
-lrb- 20.02.2007 -rrb- iran faces eu punishment for nuclear obstinacy even while hoping for a new window of opportunity to start negotiations with tehran , eu ministers agreed monday to imposing sanctions against iran for continuing its uranium enrichment program .
-lrb- 12.02.2007 -rrb- iran rejects west 's key demand on nuclear drive president mahmoud ahmadinejad said iran was ready to negotiate to end the standoff over its nuclear program but vowed that tehran would never agree to the west 's most critical demand .
-lrb- 11.02.2007 -rrb- feedback do you think it 's reasonable for the iranian president to insist tehran will only stop uranium enrichment if the west halts its nuclear programs ?

experts say the project is technically underdeveloped and politically risky . " we have agreed that our response to the -lrb- us -rrb- offer will most likely be positive , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on monday at a joint news conference in warsaw with his polish counterpart , jaroslaw kaczynski . the us had asked for permission to station parts of its global missile defense system in the two countries to hinder attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outcome is in the stars - the czech republic 's topolanek kaczynski defended the plans , saying that the missile shield would not be " aimed against any ' normal ' country . "
instead the system would be directed against countries " that do n't want to follow the rules of the modern world , " he added . the plans have provoked a rain of criticism from all over europe .
last week , russian president vladimir putin expressed outrage at the munich conference on security policy over the missile shield .
moscow sees it as a threat .
general yuri baluyevsky , russian army chief of staff , speculated publicly about whether to withdraw from the 1987 intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty , which had led to the disarmament of medium-range missiles . neighborly relations german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung had criticized the us over the weekend for failing to discuss the plans with moscow .
iran did n't possess any intercontinental rockets that could reach the united states , steinmeier added . but the foreign minister took some of the edge off his comments on monday during a visit to azerbaijan . " as always when a new strategic system is introduced , it 's good to create transparency and to start a dialog as early as possible with those who will be affected , " he said in the azeri capital , baku . washington had subsequently started talks with moscow , he added . meanwhile , the plans are being hotly debated in poland and the czech republic .

the project never got off the ground due to technical hurdles and exorbitantly high costs .

the united states have already set up bases in alaska and california for the system to stop rockets from north korea .
poland and the czech republic , which would host the first nmd bases outside the us , would be the outposts against intercontinental projectiles from the middle east - that is , iran . technically and politically risky the system is supposed to be ready to use by 2011 .

dw-world.de talked to him about what these two faltering giants need to do to regain their former dominance . dw-world.de : no one in germany knows these two clubs better than you do . paul breitner : i had the privilege of seeing real madrid from the inside .
it 's a long time ago , but i still follow what 's going on with the team and maintain my contacts there .
and i know bayern very well indeed .
they 're one of the top five clubs in the world . really ?
you would n't think so from looking at the current bundesliga table . you have to distinguish between the club and the current squad .
they 're two totally different animals .
you ca n't equate bayern with the results in any one season .
they 're still one of the best clubs in the world , and the same is true of real .
both teams have had turbulent seasons thus far , and the results have been disappointing .
but they 're still solid institutions . so why are n't they showing it on the pitch ? bayern munich and real madrid are at similar junctures in their history .
both are planning for the long term ; both are reinventing themselves , shaking up their squads .
both are in search of a new soccer identity because neither of them have been live up to their reputation as perennial favorites in their respective leagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madrid holds a slight advantage over munich in the champions league that must be a difficult situation for two clubs that are used to being on top . precisely because expectations are so high , you have to make changes .
what happens today is important for both bayern and real , but what happens tomorrow is more important .
they do n't just want to win their league titles .
they also aim at winning the champions league and their respective national cups .
they want it all .
that 's what makes them so special . what 's the main difference between the two ? money .
real madrid 's financial resources allow them to do short-term planning .
real can change the face of their squad overnight by buying two or three of the world 's top stars and still function in the long term .
bayern are forced to do things differently .

it 's the best there is .
this year the tie is even more interesting because the result will determine the rest of the season for both clubs .
the losing side will only have around 10 games left in its respective national league to win a title , otherwise they 'll end the season empty-handed .
that would truly be a year to forget . but if you were to go out of the champions league , you 'd be better able to concentrate on the national title . no one wants to lose , especially not real madrid and bayern munich .
the situation for both clubs is really dramatic because both of them only have a realistic chance of a title if they win the champions league . how do you beat real ?
and how do you beat bayern ? to beat clubs like these , you have play with great concentration over the full 90 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breitner also won the world cup with germany in 1974 who do you think will win the tie ? i have no idea .
for me there 's no favorite .
normally i 'm not afraid of making predictions , but real and bayern are going through such turbulent phases and are miles away from their best form . are you just trying to avoid offending friends of yours in spain and germany ? not at all .
i 'm not embarrassed to say that i really like real madrid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2007 making children happy the dutch way großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days are here again a recent report on the well-being of children and young people in the world 's advanced economies says the netherlands offers the best environment for children .
so what are dutch youngsters getting that others are not ? the research , which focused on material well-being , health and safety , education , peer and family relationships , behaviors and risks , and young people 's own subjective sense of well-being , to assess child happiness , proved beyond all doubt that the key to a happy child is a happy family .
and that is where the netherlands comes in . carolien gelauff of the netherlands youth institute said a lot of emphasis is put on the family . " the family is important , " she said .
" a lot of time is spent raising children , making sure they have a nice time growing up .
the notion of having happy childhood is common sense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating together is a part of family life yet , apparently not everywhere .
while more than 70 percent of 15 year-olds in the netherlands report that their parents spend time just talking to them several times per week , the figure in germany is just above 40 percent . similarly 90 percent of dutch children in the same age group said they eat the main meal of the day with their parents several times per week , whereas that number dips down to around the 65 percent mark in countries like britain and the us , where there is a greater likelihood of both parents being out at work all day . protected freedom rob van der beek , a father of two , said it is common in the netherlands for women to put their careers on hold while they invest in their families . " it is important to give children a warm and protective environment to grow up in , " he said .
" but within that , they should have the freedom to go and discover the world .
that is our way of thinking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning by doing ruut veenhoven , a professor of social conditions for human happiness at rotterdam 's erasmus university , agreed that such thinking is typical of the netherlands . " you could say the dominant philosophy is to allow children to be free to explore and become independent , " he said . subjective sense of well-being particularly interesting is the way in which young people in the netherlands perceive their own well-being .
in the study , children aged 11 , 13 and 15 were asked : here is a ladder .
the top of the ladder , 10 , is the best possible life for you and the bottom , 0 , is the worst possible life for you .
in general , where on the ladder do you feel you stand at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off to school more than 90 percent of dutch children rated themselves above the middle of the life satisfaction scale .
they do n't drink , smoke or have sex more than average , and the vast majority even claim to like school " a lot . " gelauff said schools are very child-friendly places . " achieving is important , but there is no sense in overdoing it , " she said .
" the world is a hard enough place when children grow up , so parents should be there for their children . " women at work unlike mothers in some other european countries , women in the netherlands tend to take long periods of leave after having a baby , and then when they do eventually go back , they often work shorter hours . " we are world champions at working part-time , " gelauff said .
" especially the women . " veenhoven believes this working trend is quite significant . " although it can not explain the differences to other countries entirely , there is some indication that the number of part-time working mothers contributes to child happiness , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the paternal program ?
the same options of shorter working hours are open to men too , although gelauff said it is less common . " men say it is not so easy for them because it is harder to build a career if you work part-time , but some men only work four days a week , " she said , adding that the paternal role has changed a lot in the past years .
" fathers are much more involved than in the old days .
they play with children , look after them , do sport with them , take them swimming and so on .

so what are dutch youngsters getting that others are not ? the research , which focused on material well-being , health and safety , education , peer and family relationships , behaviors and risks , and young people 's own subjective sense of well-being , to assess child happiness , proved beyond all doubt that the key to a happy child is a happy family .
and that is where the netherlands comes in . carolien gelauff of the netherlands youth institute said a lot of emphasis is put on the family . " the family is important , " she said .
" a lot of time is spent raising children , making sure they have a nice time growing up .
the notion of having happy childhood is common sense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating together is a part of family life yet , apparently not everywhere .
while more than 70 percent of 15 year-olds in the netherlands report that their parents spend time just talking to them several times per week , the figure in germany is just above 40 percent . similarly 90 percent of dutch children in the same age group said they eat the main meal of the day with their parents several times per week , whereas that number dips down to around the 65 percent mark in countries like britain and the us , where there is a greater likelihood of both parents being out at work all day . protected freedom rob van der beek , a father of two , said it is common in the netherlands for women to put their careers on hold while they invest in their families .

" you could say the dominant philosophy is to allow children to be free to explore and become independent , " he said . subjective sense of well-being particularly interesting is the way in which young people in the netherlands perceive their own well-being .
in the study , children aged 11 , 13 and 15 were asked : here is a ladder .
the top of the ladder , 10 , is the best possible life for you and the bottom , 0 , is the worst possible life for you .
in general , where on the ladder do you feel you stand at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off to school more than 90 percent of dutch children rated themselves above the middle of the life satisfaction scale .
they do n't drink , smoke or have sex more than average , and the vast majority even claim to like school " a lot . " gelauff said schools are very child-friendly places . " achieving is important , but there is no sense in overdoing it , " she said .
" the world is a hard enough place when children grow up , so parents should be there for their children . " women at work unlike mothers in some other european countries , women in the netherlands tend to take long periods of leave after having a baby , and then when they do eventually go back , they often work shorter hours .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2007 making children happy the dutch way großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days are here again a recent report on the well-being of children and young people in the world 's advanced economies says the netherlands offers the best environment for children .
so what are dutch youngsters getting that others are not ? the research , which focused on material well-being , health and safety , education , peer and family relationships , behaviors and risks , and young people 's own subjective sense of well-being , to assess child happiness , proved beyond all doubt that the key to a happy child is a happy family .
and that is where the netherlands comes in . carolien gelauff of the netherlands youth institute said a lot of emphasis is put on the family . " the family is important , " she said .
" a lot of time is spent raising children , making sure they have a nice time growing up .
the notion of having happy childhood is common sense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating together is a part of family life yet , apparently not everywhere .
while more than 70 percent of 15 year-olds in the netherlands report that their parents spend time just talking to them several times per week , the figure in germany is just above 40 percent . similarly 90 percent of dutch children in the same age group said they eat the main meal of the day with their parents several times per week , whereas that number dips down to around the 65 percent mark in countries like britain and the us , where there is a greater likelihood of both parents being out at work all day . protected freedom rob van der beek , a father of two , said it is common in the netherlands for women to put their careers on hold while they invest in their families . " it is important to give children a warm and protective environment to grow up in , " he said .
" but within that , they should have the freedom to go and discover the world .
that is our way of thinking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning by doing ruut veenhoven , a professor of social conditions for human happiness at rotterdam 's erasmus university , agreed that such thinking is typical of the netherlands . " you could say the dominant philosophy is to allow children to be free to explore and become independent , " he said . subjective sense of well-being particularly interesting is the way in which young people in the netherlands perceive their own well-being .
in the study , children aged 11 , 13 and 15 were asked : here is a ladder .
the top of the ladder , 10 , is the best possible life for you and the bottom , 0 , is the worst possible life for you .
in general , where on the ladder do you feel you stand at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off to school more than 90 percent of dutch children rated themselves above the middle of the life satisfaction scale .
they do n't drink , smoke or have sex more than average , and the vast majority even claim to like school " a lot . " gelauff said schools are very child-friendly places . " achieving is important , but there is no sense in overdoing it , " she said .
" the world is a hard enough place when children grow up , so parents should be there for their children . " women at work unlike mothers in some other european countries , women in the netherlands tend to take long periods of leave after having a baby , and then when they do eventually go back , they often work shorter hours . " we are world champions at working part-time , " gelauff said .
" especially the women . " veenhoven believes this working trend is quite significant . " although it can not explain the differences to other countries entirely , there is some indication that the number of part-time working mothers contributes to child happiness , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the paternal program ?
the same options of shorter working hours are open to men too , although gelauff said it is less common . " men say it is not so easy for them because it is harder to build a career if you work part-time , but some men only work four days a week , " she said , adding that the paternal role has changed a lot in the past years .
" fathers are much more involved than in the old days .
they play with children , look after them , do sport with them , take them swimming and so on . " all of this contributes to what she describes as an overall necessity to " take children seriously and pay attention to their needs .

experts say the project is technically underdeveloped and politically risky . " we have agreed that our response to the -lrb- us -rrb- offer will most likely be positive , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on monday at a joint news conference in warsaw with his polish counterpart , jaroslaw kaczynski . the us had asked for permission to station parts of its global missile defense system in the two countries to hinder attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outcome is in the stars - the czech republic 's topolanek kaczynski defended the plans , saying that the missile shield would not be " aimed against any ' normal ' country . "
instead the system would be directed against countries " that do n't want to follow the rules of the modern world , " he added . the plans have provoked a rain of criticism from all over europe .
last week , russian president vladimir putin expressed outrage at the munich conference on security policy over the missile shield .
moscow sees it as a threat .
general yuri baluyevsky , russian army chief of staff , speculated publicly about whether to withdraw from the 1987 intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty , which had led to the disarmament of medium-range missiles . neighborly relations german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung had criticized the us over the weekend for failing to discuss the plans with moscow .
iran did n't possess any intercontinental rockets that could reach the united states , steinmeier added . but the foreign minister took some of the edge off his comments on monday during a visit to azerbaijan . " as always when a new strategic system is introduced , it 's good to create transparency and to start a dialog as early as possible with those who will be affected , " he said in the azeri capital , baku . washington had subsequently started talks with moscow , he added . meanwhile , the plans are being hotly debated in poland and the czech republic .
two-thirds of czechs are opposed to a missile base , though they are n't particularly averse to having a radar station set up in their country . polish deputy prime minister andrzej lepper has rejected the project .
so far , the poles have too little information to go on , he has said .
lepper has also warned that the poles should not ignore the fears of russia , belarus and ukraine .
he has called for a referendum on the issue . reagan 's legacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czechs do n't want the missiles stationed on their territory the united states wants to build 10 silos for interceptor missiles in poland and an early warning radar station in the czech republic that would also supply intelligence . the national missile defense system -lrb- nmd -rrb- is a leftover from the strategic defense initiative , also known as " star wars , " that president ronald reagan wanted to use to destroy oncoming enemy rockets in outer space .
the project never got off the ground due to technical hurdles and exorbitantly high costs .
in 1999 , president bill clinton breathed new life into the project , focusing on shooting down missiles from the earth .

the rockets are supposed to destroy enemy long-range missiles in the earth 's atmosphere or in space .
the united states have already set up bases in alaska and california for the system to stop rockets from north korea .
poland and the czech republic , which would host the first nmd bases outside the us , would be the outposts against intercontinental projectiles from the middle east - that is , iran . technically and politically risky the system is supposed to be ready to use by 2011 .
but only half of the one dozen tests carried out have been successful .
even former defense minister donald rumsfeld admitted there were weaknesses . the nmd program is also risky politically .
otfried nassauer , director of the berlin information center for transatlantic security , said he could understand russia 's displeasure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the system 's called " son of star wars " the missile defense system could " cover parts of the possible flight paths of intercontinental missiles that are stationed in southern and southwestern russia , " the armaments expert told dw-world.de. as nato planned its expansion to the east , the alliance had guaranteed russia it would not station any important military capacities on the new members ' territory for the long-term , nassauer said . " now moscow feels betrayed because the biggest nato state does n't feel bound -lrb- to that guarantee -rrb- and wants to station national rather than nato capacities , " he said . steinmeier , too , recognizes that the united states unilaterally veering away from that guarantee could strain the political climate between the eu and russia , nassauer added . protection for whom ? in a joint article published in polish daily rzeczpospolita on monday , the polish and czech premiers pleaded their case for the controversial project . " joining the missile defense system will serve as passive protection from attacks … for all members of the transatlantic community , " they wrote . it 's a daring theory .

it 's the final step in a long legal battle . attorney endrik wilhelm said the siblings , patrick s. and susan k. , would be filing their historic appeal after a district court in dresden refused to override a jail sentence patrick faces .
the case , wilhelm told the daily dresdner neueste nachrichten newspaper , would be to challenge the constitutionality of paragraph 173 of the german criminal code , which outlaws sexual relations between close relatives . the siblings have been in and out of the courts for the past five years .
in 2002 patrick s. was given a suspended sentence of one year in prison for sleeping with his sister .
in 2004 he served 10 months in jail for violating the terms of the original conviction , and in 2005 he was sentenced to two-and-a-half years incarceration for incest . susan k. never received any jail time since she was always tried as an adolescent .

he said iran would only halt the sensitive nuclear activity if the west suspended its own nuclear programs . " we are in favor of dialog .
but in order for us to talk they are imposing a condition that would deprive us of our right , " ahmadinejad said tuesday during a public rally in rasht , the capital of the northern gilan province . his comments come ahead of the expiration on wednesday of the latest un security council deadline for iran to halt sensitive uranium enrichment work as well as a un watchdog report friday on its compliance with this demand . " we say to them -lrb- the west -rrb- : how can your enrichment factories continue to work when you are asking for a suspension of our activities ? " he said in the speech broadcast on state television . ahmadinejad told the crowd of thousands the only scenario where iran could halt enrichment was if other nuclear powers suspended the process themselves . " if they say that our nuclear production plant and its fuel cycle should be shut down , this is no problem , " he said .
" but justice necessitates that those who want to negotiate should halt their own nuclear fuel cycles . " the day that iranians can use nuclear fuel and its production cycle fully in the agriculture , medicine and other areas , will be a big leap in the life of iranian people , " ahmadinejad added .
" if they think they can create division among iranians with their bullying , attempts and plots , they should know they are 100-percent wrong .
iranians have been standing strong and will defend their nuclear rights until the end . " elbaradei : six months away from enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei -lrb- l . -rrb-
larijani are expected to meet again tuesday iran 's nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , was to meet tuesday with the head of the un atomic watchdog , international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , before the agency releases a crucial report on the iranian program on friday . iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said in an interview in london 's financial times published on tuesday that iran may be able to enrich uranium on a mass scale in just six months , although it could still be 10 years away from the capacity to build a nuclear bomb . iran has moved feedstock gas needed to start uranium enrichment into a nuclear plant designed for industrial-level enrichment , diplomats told afp monday . iran transferred the uranium gas -lrb- uranium hexafluoride , uf6 -rrb- early this month from a conversion facility at isfahan into the underground natanz plant in central iran where it last month started installing centrifuge machines , the diplomats said . provocative acts while iran has not started running the centrifuges , bringing the uranium gas into the plant was " provocative " act as this is " not the act of a country that seeks compromise , " said non-proliferation analyst mark fitzpatrick from the london iiss think tank . the united states accuses iran of seeking a nuclear weapon , a charge denied by tehran , which insists its atomic program is peaceful in nature .
although washington has said it wants the nuclear standoff resolved through diplomacy , it has never ruled out military action to thwart iran 's atomic drive . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe wary of us defense system in poland , czech republic poland and the czech republic have voiced willingness for the us to install parts of a global missile defense system on their territory .
experts say the project is technically underdeveloped and politically risky .
-lrb- 20.02.2007 -rrb- iran faces eu punishment for nuclear obstinacy even while hoping for a new window of opportunity to start negotiations with tehran , eu ministers agreed monday to imposing sanctions against iran for continuing its uranium enrichment program .
-lrb- 12.02.2007 -rrb- iran rejects west 's key demand on nuclear drive president mahmoud ahmadinejad said iran was ready to negotiate to end the standoff over its nuclear program but vowed that tehran would never agree to the west 's most critical demand .

airbus employs 20,000 people in each country . german politicians suspect toulouse-based airbus ' french management of forcing german workers to bear the brunt of the job cuts . " the french are fighting for their jobs and their future role , and we as germans can not and should not settle for playing second fiddle , " ditmar staffelt , spd member in parliament and former government coordinator for aerospace issues told reuters . restructuring on hold analysts point out that airbus is no stranger to conflicting national interests and political intereference . the airplane maker is owned by eads , a defence and aerospace company which is 58-percent controlled by french , german and spanish interests which are either state-owned companies or companies with close ties to the state . " with airbus , it 's always a double-edged sword : political interests on the one hand , economics on the other , " said horst frey , a finance expert specializing in the automotive and aviation industries . de villepin said the issue of airbus cutbacks would be discussed at a meeting between german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac on friday , raising hopes of a prompt political settlement . germany however has denied that the planned meeting between chirac and merkel will turn into " an airbus summit . " the franco-german deadlock comes on the heels of a delay of airbus 's radical turnaround strategy - known as " power 8 " - that was supposed to be announced tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois is hemmed in by conflicting political pressures airbus chief louis gallois stressed on monday that consensus was " urgently " needed to implement the " power 8 " restructuring plan aimed at saving 5.0 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- by 2010 and 2.0 billion euros per year thereafter . eads co-chief thomas enders - a german - rejected airbus chief executive and frenchman louis gallois 's scheme for germany and france sharing the work on the company 's a350 plane , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper suggested in its tuesday edition , because he believed that germany would be at a disadvantage . horst frey said the postponement " shows that the german side succeeded in developing a common strategy . " " this means that recommendations from the french side must now be reworked and the cards reshuffled at airbus , " he added . frey said the delay is certainly to germany 's advantage to renegotiate its position . " a disgrace " few agree however . the tuesday edition of germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung paper called the delay in publishing details of re-organizing plans a " disgrace , " with one editorial claiming that " it shows once again how big the danger is that airbus will collapse under the pressure of national interests . " the paper said it was " understandable " that politicians were rowing over job cuts in view of the billions of euros of public money that had been invested in the company since the 1970s .

dw-world.de talked to him about what these two faltering giants need to do to regain their former dominance . dw-world.de : no one in germany knows these two clubs better than you do . paul breitner : i had the privilege of seeing real madrid from the inside .
it 's a long time ago , but i still follow what 's going on with the team and maintain my contacts there .
and i know bayern very well indeed .
they 're one of the top five clubs in the world . really ?
you would n't think so from looking at the current bundesliga table . you have to distinguish between the club and the current squad .
they 're two totally different animals .
you ca n't equate bayern with the results in any one season .
they 're still one of the best clubs in the world , and the same is true of real .
both teams have had turbulent seasons thus far , and the results have been disappointing .
but they 're still solid institutions . so why are n't they showing it on the pitch ? bayern munich and real madrid are at similar junctures in their history .
both are planning for the long term ; both are reinventing themselves , shaking up their squads .
both are in search of a new soccer identity because neither of them have been live up to their reputation as perennial favorites in their respective leagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madrid holds a slight advantage over munich in the champions league that must be a difficult situation for two clubs that are used to being on top . precisely because expectations are so high , you have to make changes .
what happens today is important for both bayern and real , but what happens tomorrow is more important .
they do n't just want to win their league titles .
they also aim at winning the champions league and their respective national cups .
they want it all .
that 's what makes them so special . what 's the main difference between the two ? money .
real madrid 's financial resources allow them to do short-term planning .
real can change the face of their squad overnight by buying two or three of the world 's top stars and still function in the long term .
bayern are forced to do things differently .
munich ca n't just quickly put together a squad of " galacticos . " what can we expect of baern 's new coach , ottmar hitzfeld ? hitzfeld has a different philosophy than his predecessor felix magath .
but it 's too early to expect anything of him as bayern 's new coach .
he needs time .
do n't expect to see a brand-new bayern munich in their champions league match against real on feb .
20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul breitner - prolific goal-scorer and prolific grower of hair real madrid versus bayern munich is still a dream match-up for soccer fans . the fans wait for games like this the whole year .
it 's the best there is .
this year the tie is even more interesting because the result will determine the rest of the season for both clubs .
the losing side will only have around 10 games left in its respective national league to win a title , otherwise they 'll end the season empty-handed .
that would truly be a year to forget . but if you were to go out of the champions league , you 'd be better able to concentrate on the national title . no one wants to lose , especially not real madrid and bayern munich .
the situation for both clubs is really dramatic because both of them only have a realistic chance of a title if they win the champions league . how do you beat real ?
and how do you beat bayern ? to beat clubs like these , you have play with great concentration over the full 90 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breitner also won the world cup with germany in 1974 who do you think will win the tie ? i have no idea .
for me there 's no favorite .
normally i 'm not afraid of making predictions , but real and bayern are going through such turbulent phases and are miles away from their best form . are you just trying to avoid offending friends of yours in spain and germany ? not at all .
i 'm not embarrassed to say that i really like real madrid .
every bit as much as bayern munich .
i just do n't have a favorite right now , either emotionally or as a soccer analyst . daniel martínez interviewed paul breitner -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schalke slip as bayern fall off bundesliga pace nuremberg moved within a point of fourth-placed bayern munich and a possible champions league spot as a goal from michael beauchamp secured a 1-0 victory over energie cottbus sunday in the german bundesliga .

what better reason to leave the car at home ? berlin 's public transport authority , the bvg , has a reputation for unorthodoxy .
they have staged an underground short-film festival and hosted occasional parties on trams , buses and trains .
now they 've set up an on-line page where love-besotted urbanites can post personal ads to those special strangers who stole their hearts on the subway . users specify the date , the time and the number of the subway line where their eye was caught - as well as a clear description so the person in question can recognize her- or himself .
the web site even offers advice to would-be recipients of smitten declarations of passion , including what to wear and how to flash that enchanting smile . " we 're doing this to create good-will , of course , " said bvg press spokesman klaus wazlak .
" it 's a small way of showing our human side and depicting public transport as a positive space . " and of counteracting germany 's declining birthrates ?
" no , no , " wazlak said .
" that 's probably beyond our capabilities . " cold fries , flaming hearts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are these berlin commuters heading toward new romance ?
the bvg launched the new page on february 14 - valentine 's day - and almost a week later less than 50 people had responded .
but its initiators are n't discouraged . " it 's not just the number of messages , " wazlak said .
" today alone we 've had around 20,000 hits .
and we think word-of-mouth will do the rest . " indeed , the messages posted thus far make for interesting reading .
users have fallen for ticket inspectors and have written in looking for " the blond mohawk with the black earlobes " or " anna , the violinist from bremen , with the cold french fries . " " i 'm the hunchback with the case of the sniffles " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's new double-decker house of love some of the responses read like miniature romance novels .
" i see you every morning , when you get on in königs wusterhausen , " wrote one user .
" i always see you in the bus and on the train , and i hope you notice me , too . " a moving tale of silent , unrequited longing - or so you might think until you read the next message from this user , which seems to proclaim an equally fervent passion for another commuter heading in the opposite direction . some of the postings verge on monty python .

airbus employs 20,000 people in each country . german politicians suspect toulouse-based airbus ' french management of forcing german workers to bear the brunt of the job cuts . " the french are fighting for their jobs and their future role , and we as germans can not and should not settle for playing second fiddle , " ditmar staffelt , spd member in parliament and former government coordinator for aerospace issues told reuters . restructuring on hold analysts point out that airbus is no stranger to conflicting national interests and political intereference . the airplane maker is owned by eads , a defence and aerospace company which is 58-percent controlled by french , german and spanish interests which are either state-owned companies or companies with close ties to the state . " with airbus , it 's always a double-edged sword : political interests on the one hand , economics on the other , " said horst frey , a finance expert specializing in the automotive and aviation industries . de villepin said the issue of airbus cutbacks would be discussed at a meeting between german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac on friday , raising hopes of a prompt political settlement . germany however has denied that the planned meeting between chirac and merkel will turn into " an airbus summit . " the franco-german deadlock comes on the heels of a delay of airbus 's radical turnaround strategy - known as " power 8 " - that was supposed to be announced tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois is hemmed in by conflicting political pressures airbus chief louis gallois stressed on monday that consensus was " urgently " needed to implement the " power 8 " restructuring plan aimed at saving 5.0 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- by 2010 and 2.0 billion euros per year thereafter . eads co-chief thomas enders - a german - rejected airbus chief executive and frenchman louis gallois 's scheme for germany and france sharing the work on the company 's a350 plane , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper suggested in its tuesday edition , because he believed that germany would be at a disadvantage . horst frey said the postponement " shows that the german side succeeded in developing a common strategy . " " this means that recommendations from the french side must now be reworked and the cards reshuffled at airbus , " he added . frey said the delay is certainly to germany 's advantage to renegotiate its position . " a disgrace " few agree however . the tuesday edition of germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung paper called the delay in publishing details of re-organizing plans a " disgrace , " with one editorial claiming that " it shows once again how big the danger is that airbus will collapse under the pressure of national interests . " the paper said it was " understandable " that politicians were rowing over job cuts in view of the billions of euros of public money that had been invested in the company since the 1970s .
" but it 's not intelligent to get too fixed on one thing , " it added . french media too took a dim view of the political interference in airbus 's restructuring . the french le figaro newspaper spoke of a " franco-german divorce " of the airbus marriage .
the influential french newspaper le monde ran a headline " airbus paralysed by egoism in paris and berlin " on tuesday , saying that disagreements between the two countries were , if anything , worsening . jobs on the line at the heart of the feuding lies the sensitive issue of jobs . airbus employs around 56,000 people , around 23,000 in germany and france each . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both france and germany are battling to avoid massive job cuts trade unions in both countries have said they plan to dig in their heels and defend all the jobs .

dw-world.de talked to him about what these two faltering giants need to do to regain their former dominance . dw-world.de : no one in germany knows these two clubs better than you do . paul breitner : i had the privilege of seeing real madrid from the inside .
it 's a long time ago , but i still follow what 's going on with the team and maintain my contacts there .
and i know bayern very well indeed .
they 're one of the top five clubs in the world . really ?
you would n't think so from looking at the current bundesliga table . you have to distinguish between the club and the current squad .
they 're two totally different animals .
you ca n't equate bayern with the results in any one season .
they 're still one of the best clubs in the world , and the same is true of real .
both teams have had turbulent seasons thus far , and the results have been disappointing .
but they 're still solid institutions . so why are n't they showing it on the pitch ? bayern munich and real madrid are at similar junctures in their history .
both are planning for the long term ; both are reinventing themselves , shaking up their squads .
both are in search of a new soccer identity because neither of them have been live up to their reputation as perennial favorites in their respective leagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madrid holds a slight advantage over munich in the champions league that must be a difficult situation for two clubs that are used to being on top . precisely because expectations are so high , you have to make changes .
what happens today is important for both bayern and real , but what happens tomorrow is more important .
they do n't just want to win their league titles .
they also aim at winning the champions league and their respective national cups .
they want it all .
that 's what makes them so special . what 's the main difference between the two ? money .
real madrid 's financial resources allow them to do short-term planning .
real can change the face of their squad overnight by buying two or three of the world 's top stars and still function in the long term .
bayern are forced to do things differently .
munich ca n't just quickly put together a squad of " galacticos . " what can we expect of baern 's new coach , ottmar hitzfeld ? hitzfeld has a different philosophy than his predecessor felix magath .
but it 's too early to expect anything of him as bayern 's new coach .
he needs time .
do n't expect to see a brand-new bayern munich in their champions league match against real on feb .
20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul breitner - prolific goal-scorer and prolific grower of hair real madrid versus bayern munich is still a dream match-up for soccer fans . the fans wait for games like this the whole year .
it 's the best there is .
this year the tie is even more interesting because the result will determine the rest of the season for both clubs .
the losing side will only have around 10 games left in its respective national league to win a title , otherwise they 'll end the season empty-handed .
that would truly be a year to forget . but if you were to go out of the champions league , you 'd be better able to concentrate on the national title . no one wants to lose , especially not real madrid and bayern munich .
the situation for both clubs is really dramatic because both of them only have a realistic chance of a title if they win the champions league . how do you beat real ?
and how do you beat bayern ? to beat clubs like these , you have play with great concentration over the full 90 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breitner also won the world cup with germany in 1974 who do you think will win the tie ? i have no idea .
for me there 's no favorite .
normally i 'm not afraid of making predictions , but real and bayern are going through such turbulent phases and are miles away from their best form . are you just trying to avoid offending friends of yours in spain and germany ? not at all .
i 'm not embarrassed to say that i really like real madrid .
every bit as much as bayern munich .

so what are dutch youngsters getting that others are not ? the research , which focused on material well-being , health and safety , education , peer and family relationships , behaviors and risks , and young people 's own subjective sense of well-being , to assess child happiness , proved beyond all doubt that the key to a happy child is a happy family .

while more than 70 percent of 15 year-olds in the netherlands report that their parents spend time just talking to them several times per week , the figure in germany is just above 40 percent . similarly 90 percent of dutch children in the same age group said they eat the main meal of the day with their parents several times per week , whereas that number dips down to around the 65 percent mark in countries like britain and the us , where there is a greater likelihood of both parents being out at work all day . protected freedom rob van der beek , a father of two , said it is common in the netherlands for women to put their careers on hold while they invest in their families .

" the world is a hard enough place when children grow up , so parents should be there for their children . " women at work unlike mothers in some other european countries , women in the netherlands tend to take long periods of leave after having a baby , and then when they do eventually go back , they often work shorter hours . " we are world champions at working part-time , " gelauff said .
" especially the women . " veenhoven believes this working trend is quite significant .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2007 making children happy the dutch way großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days are here again a recent report on the well-being of children and young people in the world 's advanced economies says the netherlands offers the best environment for children .
so what are dutch youngsters getting that others are not ? the research , which focused on material well-being , health and safety , education , peer and family relationships , behaviors and risks , and young people 's own subjective sense of well-being , to assess child happiness , proved beyond all doubt that the key to a happy child is a happy family .
and that is where the netherlands comes in . carolien gelauff of the netherlands youth institute said a lot of emphasis is put on the family . " the family is important , " she said .
" a lot of time is spent raising children , making sure they have a nice time growing up .
the notion of having happy childhood is common sense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating together is a part of family life yet , apparently not everywhere .
while more than 70 percent of 15 year-olds in the netherlands report that their parents spend time just talking to them several times per week , the figure in germany is just above 40 percent . similarly 90 percent of dutch children in the same age group said they eat the main meal of the day with their parents several times per week , whereas that number dips down to around the 65 percent mark in countries like britain and the us , where there is a greater likelihood of both parents being out at work all day . protected freedom rob van der beek , a father of two , said it is common in the netherlands for women to put their careers on hold while they invest in their families . " it is important to give children a warm and protective environment to grow up in , " he said .
" but within that , they should have the freedom to go and discover the world .
that is our way of thinking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning by doing ruut veenhoven , a professor of social conditions for human happiness at rotterdam 's erasmus university , agreed that such thinking is typical of the netherlands . " you could say the dominant philosophy is to allow children to be free to explore and become independent , " he said . subjective sense of well-being particularly interesting is the way in which young people in the netherlands perceive their own well-being .
in the study , children aged 11 , 13 and 15 were asked : here is a ladder .
the top of the ladder , 10 , is the best possible life for you and the bottom , 0 , is the worst possible life for you .
in general , where on the ladder do you feel you stand at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off to school more than 90 percent of dutch children rated themselves above the middle of the life satisfaction scale .
they do n't drink , smoke or have sex more than average , and the vast majority even claim to like school " a lot . " gelauff said schools are very child-friendly places . " achieving is important , but there is no sense in overdoing it , " she said .
" the world is a hard enough place when children grow up , so parents should be there for their children . " women at work unlike mothers in some other european countries , women in the netherlands tend to take long periods of leave after having a baby , and then when they do eventually go back , they often work shorter hours . " we are world champions at working part-time , " gelauff said .
" especially the women . " veenhoven believes this working trend is quite significant . " although it can not explain the differences to other countries entirely , there is some indication that the number of part-time working mothers contributes to child happiness , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the paternal program ?
the same options of shorter working hours are open to men too , although gelauff said it is less common . " men say it is not so easy for them because it is harder to build a career if you work part-time , but some men only work four days a week , " she said , adding that the paternal role has changed a lot in the past years .
" fathers are much more involved than in the old days .
they play with children , look after them , do sport with them , take them swimming and so on . " all of this contributes to what she describes as an overall necessity to " take children seriously and pay attention to their needs .

so what are dutch youngsters getting that others are not ? the research , which focused on material well-being , health and safety , education , peer and family relationships , behaviors and risks , and young people 's own subjective sense of well-being , to assess child happiness , proved beyond all doubt that the key to a happy child is a happy family .
and that is where the netherlands comes in . carolien gelauff of the netherlands youth institute said a lot of emphasis is put on the family . " the family is important , " she said .
" a lot of time is spent raising children , making sure they have a nice time growing up .
the notion of having happy childhood is common sense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating together is a part of family life yet , apparently not everywhere .
while more than 70 percent of 15 year-olds in the netherlands report that their parents spend time just talking to them several times per week , the figure in germany is just above 40 percent . similarly 90 percent of dutch children in the same age group said they eat the main meal of the day with their parents several times per week , whereas that number dips down to around the 65 percent mark in countries like britain and the us , where there is a greater likelihood of both parents being out at work all day . protected freedom rob van der beek , a father of two , said it is common in the netherlands for women to put their careers on hold while they invest in their families . " it is important to give children a warm and protective environment to grow up in , " he said .
" but within that , they should have the freedom to go and discover the world .
that is our way of thinking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning by doing ruut veenhoven , a professor of social conditions for human happiness at rotterdam 's erasmus university , agreed that such thinking is typical of the netherlands . " you could say the dominant philosophy is to allow children to be free to explore and become independent , " he said . subjective sense of well-being particularly interesting is the way in which young people in the netherlands perceive their own well-being .
in the study , children aged 11 , 13 and 15 were asked : here is a ladder .
the top of the ladder , 10 , is the best possible life for you and the bottom , 0 , is the worst possible life for you .
in general , where on the ladder do you feel you stand at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off to school more than 90 percent of dutch children rated themselves above the middle of the life satisfaction scale .
they do n't drink , smoke or have sex more than average , and the vast majority even claim to like school " a lot . " gelauff said schools are very child-friendly places . " achieving is important , but there is no sense in overdoing it , " she said .
" the world is a hard enough place when children grow up , so parents should be there for their children . " women at work unlike mothers in some other european countries , women in the netherlands tend to take long periods of leave after having a baby , and then when they do eventually go back , they often work shorter hours . " we are world champions at working part-time , " gelauff said .
" especially the women . " veenhoven believes this working trend is quite significant . " although it can not explain the differences to other countries entirely , there is some indication that the number of part-time working mothers contributes to child happiness , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the paternal program ?
the same options of shorter working hours are open to men too , although gelauff said it is less common . " men say it is not so easy for them because it is harder to build a career if you work part-time , but some men only work four days a week , " she said , adding that the paternal role has changed a lot in the past years .
" fathers are much more involved than in the old days .
they play with children , look after them , do sport with them , take them swimming and so on . " all of this contributes to what she describes as an overall necessity to " take children seriously and pay attention to their needs .

he said iran would only halt the sensitive nuclear activity if the west suspended its own nuclear programs . " we are in favor of dialog .
but in order for us to talk they are imposing a condition that would deprive us of our right , " ahmadinejad said tuesday during a public rally in rasht , the capital of the northern gilan province . his comments come ahead of the expiration on wednesday of the latest un security council deadline for iran to halt sensitive uranium enrichment work as well as a un watchdog report friday on its compliance with this demand . " we say to them -lrb- the west -rrb- : how can your enrichment factories continue to work when you are asking for a suspension of our activities ? " he said in the speech broadcast on state television . ahmadinejad told the crowd of thousands the only scenario where iran could halt enrichment was if other nuclear powers suspended the process themselves . " if they say that our nuclear production plant and its fuel cycle should be shut down , this is no problem , " he said .
" but justice necessitates that those who want to negotiate should halt their own nuclear fuel cycles . " the day that iranians can use nuclear fuel and its production cycle fully in the agriculture , medicine and other areas , will be a big leap in the life of iranian people , " ahmadinejad added .
" if they think they can create division among iranians with their bullying , attempts and plots , they should know they are 100-percent wrong .
iranians have been standing strong and will defend their nuclear rights until the end . " elbaradei : six months away from enrichment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei -lrb- l . -rrb-
larijani are expected to meet again tuesday iran 's nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , was to meet tuesday with the head of the un atomic watchdog , international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , before the agency releases a crucial report on the iranian program on friday . iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said in an interview in london 's financial times published on tuesday that iran may be able to enrich uranium on a mass scale in just six months , although it could still be 10 years away from the capacity to build a nuclear bomb . iran has moved feedstock gas needed to start uranium enrichment into a nuclear plant designed for industrial-level enrichment , diplomats told afp monday . iran transferred the uranium gas -lrb- uranium hexafluoride , uf6 -rrb- early this month from a conversion facility at isfahan into the underground natanz plant in central iran where it last month started installing centrifuge machines , the diplomats said . provocative acts while iran has not started running the centrifuges , bringing the uranium gas into the plant was " provocative " act as this is " not the act of a country that seeks compromise , " said non-proliferation analyst mark fitzpatrick from the london iiss think tank . the united states accuses iran of seeking a nuclear weapon , a charge denied by tehran , which insists its atomic program is peaceful in nature .
although washington has said it wants the nuclear standoff resolved through diplomacy , it has never ruled out military action to thwart iran 's atomic drive . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe wary of us defense system in poland , czech republic poland and the czech republic have voiced willingness for the us to install parts of a global missile defense system on their territory .

-lrb- 20.02.2007 -rrb- iran faces eu punishment for nuclear obstinacy even while hoping for a new window of opportunity to start negotiations with tehran , eu ministers agreed monday to imposing sanctions against iran for continuing its uranium enrichment program .

both are in search of a new soccer identity because neither of them have been live up to their reputation as perennial favorites in their respective leagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madrid holds a slight advantage over munich in the champions league that must be a difficult situation for two clubs that are used to being on top . precisely because expectations are so high , you have to make changes .
what happens today is important for both bayern and real , but what happens tomorrow is more important .
they do n't just want to win their league titles .
they also aim at winning the champions league and their respective national cups .
they want it all .
that 's what makes them so special . what 's the main difference between the two ? money .
real madrid 's financial resources allow them to do short-term planning .
real can change the face of their squad overnight by buying two or three of the world 's top stars and still function in the long term .
bayern are forced to do things differently .
munich ca n't just quickly put together a squad of " galacticos . " what can we expect of baern 's new coach , ottmar hitzfeld ? hitzfeld has a different philosophy than his predecessor felix magath .
but it 's too early to expect anything of him as bayern 's new coach .
he needs time .
do n't expect to see a brand-new bayern munich in their champions league match against real on feb .
20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul breitner - prolific goal-scorer and prolific grower of hair real madrid versus bayern munich is still a dream match-up for soccer fans . the fans wait for games like this the whole year .
it 's the best there is .
this year the tie is even more interesting because the result will determine the rest of the season for both clubs .
the losing side will only have around 10 games left in its respective national league to win a title , otherwise they 'll end the season empty-handed .
that would truly be a year to forget . but if you were to go out of the champions league , you 'd be better able to concentrate on the national title . no one wants to lose , especially not real madrid and bayern munich .
the situation for both clubs is really dramatic because both of them only have a realistic chance of a title if they win the champions league . how do you beat real ?
and how do you beat bayern ? to beat clubs like these , you have play with great concentration over the full 90 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breitner also won the world cup with germany in 1974 who do you think will win the tie ? i have no idea .
for me there 's no favorite .
normally i 'm not afraid of making predictions , but real and bayern are going through such turbulent phases and are miles away from their best form . are you just trying to avoid offending friends of yours in spain and germany ? not at all .
i 'm not embarrassed to say that i really like real madrid .
every bit as much as bayern munich .
i just do n't have a favorite right now , either emotionally or as a soccer analyst . daniel martínez interviewed paul breitner -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schalke slip as bayern fall off bundesliga pace nuremberg moved within a point of fourth-placed bayern munich and a possible champions league spot as a goal from michael beauchamp secured a 1-0 victory over energie cottbus sunday in the german bundesliga .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2007 making children happy the dutch way großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days are here again a recent report on the well-being of children and young people in the world 's advanced economies says the netherlands offers the best environment for children .
so what are dutch youngsters getting that others are not ? the research , which focused on material well-being , health and safety , education , peer and family relationships , behaviors and risks , and young people 's own subjective sense of well-being , to assess child happiness , proved beyond all doubt that the key to a happy child is a happy family .
and that is where the netherlands comes in . carolien gelauff of the netherlands youth institute said a lot of emphasis is put on the family . " the family is important , " she said .
" a lot of time is spent raising children , making sure they have a nice time growing up .
the notion of having happy childhood is common sense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating together is a part of family life yet , apparently not everywhere .
while more than 70 percent of 15 year-olds in the netherlands report that their parents spend time just talking to them several times per week , the figure in germany is just above 40 percent . similarly 90 percent of dutch children in the same age group said they eat the main meal of the day with their parents several times per week , whereas that number dips down to around the 65 percent mark in countries like britain and the us , where there is a greater likelihood of both parents being out at work all day . protected freedom rob van der beek , a father of two , said it is common in the netherlands for women to put their careers on hold while they invest in their families . " it is important to give children a warm and protective environment to grow up in , " he said .
" but within that , they should have the freedom to go and discover the world .
that is our way of thinking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning by doing ruut veenhoven , a professor of social conditions for human happiness at rotterdam 's erasmus university , agreed that such thinking is typical of the netherlands . " you could say the dominant philosophy is to allow children to be free to explore and become independent , " he said . subjective sense of well-being particularly interesting is the way in which young people in the netherlands perceive their own well-being .
in the study , children aged 11 , 13 and 15 were asked : here is a ladder .
the top of the ladder , 10 , is the best possible life for you and the bottom , 0 , is the worst possible life for you .
in general , where on the ladder do you feel you stand at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off to school more than 90 percent of dutch children rated themselves above the middle of the life satisfaction scale .
they do n't drink , smoke or have sex more than average , and the vast majority even claim to like school " a lot . " gelauff said schools are very child-friendly places . " achieving is important , but there is no sense in overdoing it , " she said .
" the world is a hard enough place when children grow up , so parents should be there for their children . " women at work unlike mothers in some other european countries , women in the netherlands tend to take long periods of leave after having a baby , and then when they do eventually go back , they often work shorter hours . " we are world champions at working part-time , " gelauff said .
" especially the women . " veenhoven believes this working trend is quite significant . " although it can not explain the differences to other countries entirely , there is some indication that the number of part-time working mothers contributes to child happiness , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the paternal program ?
the same options of shorter working hours are open to men too , although gelauff said it is less common . " men say it is not so easy for them because it is harder to build a career if you work part-time , but some men only work four days a week , " she said , adding that the paternal role has changed a lot in the past years .
" fathers are much more involved than in the old days .
they play with children , look after them , do sport with them , take them swimming and so on . " all of this contributes to what she describes as an overall necessity to " take children seriously and pay attention to their needs .

experts say the project is technically underdeveloped and politically risky . " we have agreed that our response to the -lrb- us -rrb- offer will most likely be positive , " czech prime minister mirek topolanek said on monday at a joint news conference in warsaw with his polish counterpart , jaroslaw kaczynski . the us had asked for permission to station parts of its global missile defense system in the two countries to hinder attacks from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outcome is in the stars - the czech republic 's topolanek kaczynski defended the plans , saying that the missile shield would not be " aimed against any ' normal ' country . "
instead the system would be directed against countries " that do n't want to follow the rules of the modern world , " he added . the plans have provoked a rain of criticism from all over europe .
last week , russian president vladimir putin expressed outrage at the munich conference on security policy over the missile shield .
moscow sees it as a threat .
general yuri baluyevsky , russian army chief of staff , speculated publicly about whether to withdraw from the 1987 intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty , which had led to the disarmament of medium-range missiles . neighborly relations german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and defense minister franz josef jung had criticized the us over the weekend for failing to discuss the plans with moscow .
iran did n't possess any intercontinental rockets that could reach the united states , steinmeier added . but the foreign minister took some of the edge off his comments on monday during a visit to azerbaijan . " as always when a new strategic system is introduced , it 's good to create transparency and to start a dialog as early as possible with those who will be affected , " he said in the azeri capital , baku . washington had subsequently started talks with moscow , he added . meanwhile , the plans are being hotly debated in poland and the czech republic .
two-thirds of czechs are opposed to a missile base , though they are n't particularly averse to having a radar station set up in their country . polish deputy prime minister andrzej lepper has rejected the project .
so far , the poles have too little information to go on , he has said .
lepper has also warned that the poles should not ignore the fears of russia , belarus and ukraine .
he has called for a referendum on the issue . reagan 's legacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czechs do n't want the missiles stationed on their territory the united states wants to build 10 silos for interceptor missiles in poland and an early warning radar station in the czech republic that would also supply intelligence . the national missile defense system -lrb- nmd -rrb- is a leftover from the strategic defense initiative , also known as " star wars , " that president ronald reagan wanted to use to destroy oncoming enemy rockets in outer space .
the project never got off the ground due to technical hurdles and exorbitantly high costs .
in 1999 , president bill clinton breathed new life into the project , focusing on shooting down missiles from the earth .
george w. bush has been a committed backer of the system since even before the sept .
11 attacks on new york and washington . with a budget of at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.6 billion euros -rrb- , nmd is the most expensive military project ever .
the rockets are supposed to destroy enemy long-range missiles in the earth 's atmosphere or in space .
the united states have already set up bases in alaska and california for the system to stop rockets from north korea .
poland and the czech republic , which would host the first nmd bases outside the us , would be the outposts against intercontinental projectiles from the middle east - that is , iran . technically and politically risky the system is supposed to be ready to use by 2011 .
but only half of the one dozen tests carried out have been successful .
even former defense minister donald rumsfeld admitted there were weaknesses . the nmd program is also risky politically .
otfried nassauer , director of the berlin information center for transatlantic security , said he could understand russia 's displeasure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the system 's called " son of star wars " the missile defense system could " cover parts of the possible flight paths of intercontinental missiles that are stationed in southern and southwestern russia , " the armaments expert told dw-world.de. as nato planned its expansion to the east , the alliance had guaranteed russia it would not station any important military capacities on the new members ' territory for the long-term , nassauer said .

it 's the final step in a long legal battle . attorney endrik wilhelm said the siblings , patrick s. and susan k. , would be filing their historic appeal after a district court in dresden refused to override a jail sentence patrick faces .
the case , wilhelm told the daily dresdner neueste nachrichten newspaper , would be to challenge the constitutionality of paragraph 173 of the german criminal code , which outlaws sexual relations between close relatives . the siblings have been in and out of the courts for the past five years .
in 2002 patrick s. was given a suspended sentence of one year in prison for sleeping with his sister .
in 2004 he served 10 months in jail for violating the terms of the original conviction , and in 2005 he was sentenced to two-and-a-half years incarceration for incest . susan k. never received any jail time since she was always tried as an adolescent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2007 making children happy the dutch way großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy days are here again a recent report on the well-being of children and young people in the world 's advanced economies says the netherlands offers the best environment for children .
so what are dutch youngsters getting that others are not ? the research , which focused on material well-being , health and safety , education , peer and family relationships , behaviors and risks , and young people 's own subjective sense of well-being , to assess child happiness , proved beyond all doubt that the key to a happy child is a happy family .
and that is where the netherlands comes in . carolien gelauff of the netherlands youth institute said a lot of emphasis is put on the family . " the family is important , " she said .
" a lot of time is spent raising children , making sure they have a nice time growing up .
the notion of having happy childhood is common sense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eating together is a part of family life yet , apparently not everywhere .
while more than 70 percent of 15 year-olds in the netherlands report that their parents spend time just talking to them several times per week , the figure in germany is just above 40 percent . similarly 90 percent of dutch children in the same age group said they eat the main meal of the day with their parents several times per week , whereas that number dips down to around the 65 percent mark in countries like britain and the us , where there is a greater likelihood of both parents being out at work all day . protected freedom rob van der beek , a father of two , said it is common in the netherlands for women to put their careers on hold while they invest in their families . " it is important to give children a warm and protective environment to grow up in , " he said .
" but within that , they should have the freedom to go and discover the world .
that is our way of thinking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning by doing ruut veenhoven , a professor of social conditions for human happiness at rotterdam 's erasmus university , agreed that such thinking is typical of the netherlands . " you could say the dominant philosophy is to allow children to be free to explore and become independent , " he said . subjective sense of well-being particularly interesting is the way in which young people in the netherlands perceive their own well-being .
in the study , children aged 11 , 13 and 15 were asked : here is a ladder .
the top of the ladder , 10 , is the best possible life for you and the bottom , 0 , is the worst possible life for you .
in general , where on the ladder do you feel you stand at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off to school more than 90 percent of dutch children rated themselves above the middle of the life satisfaction scale .
they do n't drink , smoke or have sex more than average , and the vast majority even claim to like school " a lot . " gelauff said schools are very child-friendly places . " achieving is important , but there is no sense in overdoing it , " she said .
" the world is a hard enough place when children grow up , so parents should be there for their children . " women at work unlike mothers in some other european countries , women in the netherlands tend to take long periods of leave after having a baby , and then when they do eventually go back , they often work shorter hours . " we are world champions at working part-time , " gelauff said .
" especially the women . " veenhoven believes this working trend is quite significant . " although it can not explain the differences to other countries entirely , there is some indication that the number of part-time working mothers contributes to child happiness , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the paternal program ?
the same options of shorter working hours are open to men too , although gelauff said it is less common . " men say it is not so easy for them because it is harder to build a career if you work part-time , but some men only work four days a week , " she said , adding that the paternal role has changed a lot in the past years .
" fathers are much more involved than in the old days .
they play with children , look after them , do sport with them , take them swimming and so on . " all of this contributes to what she describes as an overall necessity to " take children seriously and pay attention to their needs .

some critics say not enough money is spent on the right kind of skills the government agency charged with closing the nation 's skills gap receives more money than the royal navy .

" in our industry , it 's a waste of time because most of the people that apply to us for a job have reached the same level of education that the scheme trains people to reach , " she says , adding that the bar has been set too low for government help with skills training .

the league one side is now getting its stewards trained under the new scheme - including people who have been doing the job for 20 to 30 years .
some of the club 's experienced staff feel they already have the skills they are being trained in .
professor frank corfield , of the university of london , has studied the train to gain initiative .
he said the pilot projects for the scheme showed a high proportion of firms would have carried out the training anyway .
funding ' anomalies ' even when the money does go to companies which would be hard to reach , he says his research shows that " as soon as the money stops , the training stops " .

ministers hope to plug the skills gap " the lsc needs to change its funding methodology to address the skills gap rather than give the students any course they want , " said jim branney , a senior lecturer at grimsby institute .
however , lsc national director of strategy rob wye insists that initiatives such as train to gain are moves towards a new demand-led system .

more than 1.5m people have signed a petition against uk government road pricing proposals to combat congestion .
in wales , the assembly government will decide if they are introduced .
assembly economic minister andrew davies has told the week in week out programme it may not be " relevant " to have an all-wales scheme .
the proposals by the uk government may mean motorists will have to purchase tracking devices for their cars and pay a monthly bill to use them .
it 'll -lrb- road pricing -rrb- make it difficult to continue in the business bernard simpson , courier feasibility studies suggest this could cost drivers up to £ 25 a month , but uk transport minister stephen ladyman has stressed no decisions have yet been taken about how the system will work .
the petition , which comes to an end on tuesday , calls the policy " sinister and wrong " and claims the charge would be unfair to poorer people and those who live away from their families .
it may well be that we can deal with the problems of congestion locally transport minister andrew davies the assembly government is " in discussions " with the department for transport , although it is " still very early days " , said mr davies .
he said congestion would have to be dealt with as it was causing " huge problems " economically and environmentally .
' major problem ' " the biggest problem we have in congestion is in geographically a fairly small area , it 's in the newport-cardiff area , and the south east valleys and around the m4 , " he said .
" that is where we have the major problem with congestion , so , to deal with that , would we want an all-wales scheme ?
" i think the jury is out on that , and personally , it may not be relevant to have an all-wales scheme , it may well be that we can deal with the problems of congestion locally , " he said .
one of the people who signed the petition was cardiff courier bernard simpson , who drives 70,000 miles a year .
he said : " there 's only so much you can take .
it 'll make it difficult to continue in the business . "

ireland will roll out the " food dudes " in all its primary schools , showing it is cool to eat fruit and vegetables .
but prof fergus lowe of the university of wales , bangor , said it was frustrating that the programme was not being used more widely in the uk .
the welsh assembly government said it had had a trial , but other healthy eating schemes were in place .
the programme , developed at the university 's school of psychology , features video characters which gain the " life force " by eating foods such as carrots , broccoli and raspberries , and overcome the junk food foes , known as the junk punks .
ireland led the way with the smoking ban , however , and hopefully this is a case of them leading the way again prof fergus lowe the irish government has decided to bring in the food dudes in every primary school in the country over the next seven years .
" we are delighted the irish government have had the foresight to adopt the programme , " said prof lowe .
" we believe this programme has a vital role to play in resolving the growing obesity problem facing many industrialised nations . "
but prof lowe said he had been surprised that the programme was not being taken up more widely .

ireland will roll out the " food dudes " in all its primary schools , showing it is cool to eat fruit and vegetables .

the welsh assembly government said it had had a trial , but other healthy eating schemes were in place .
the programme , developed at the university 's school of psychology , features video characters which gain the " life force " by eating foods such as carrots , broccoli and raspberries , and overcome the junk food foes , known as the junk punks .
ireland led the way with the smoking ban , however , and hopefully this is a case of them leading the way again prof fergus lowe the irish government has decided to bring in the food dudes in every primary school in the country over the next seven years .
" we are delighted the irish government have had the foresight to adopt the programme , " said prof lowe .
" we believe this programme has a vital role to play in resolving the growing obesity problem facing many industrialised nations . "
but prof lowe said he had been surprised that the programme was not being taken up more widely .

he told the bbc 's newsnight that as well as tony blair 's e-mail to those who signed a petition opposing the scheme , there will be local debates .
the petition , which closes at midnight , has been backed by 1.6m people on the downing street website .
it says tolls are " sinister and wrong " and unfair to poorer people .
specifically , the petition calls for the scrapping of " planned vehicle tracking and road-pricing policy " .
tony blair has revealed that he intends to send an e-mail to the people who have signed the online petition , telling them that charges for using the roads are " surely part of the answer " to solving the growing problems of congestion .
the petition was so popular that at one point it crashed the prime minister 's website . "
at least there will now be a debate and i welcome that " peter roberts e-petitions and democracy it appears on a new section of downing street 's website , which was set up in november to allow anyone to address and deliver a petition directly to the prime minister .
speaking during a debate on newsnight , the transport secretary said the government would " engage " with those who backed the petition .
he added that the government would have a debate " based on the facts " , rather than " myths " that he said had been " propagated alongside the petition " .
' public 's attention ' mr ladyman said there would have to be a period of consultation and debates and a bill through parliament even before a local pilot scheme could go ahead .
" between now and a national scheme there would be two general elections so there will be plenty of opportunities to engage people and win them over .
and if we ca n't win them over , it ca n't go ahead , " he said .
among those taking part in the newsnight debate was the man who started the petition - peter roberts , a 46-year-old account manager from telford .
he said : " before the petition , the government seemed to be trying to sneak this in through the back door .
" but at least there 's going to be a debate and i welcome that . "
asked whether he believed the government was now listening as a result of the coverage of the issue , he said : " i 'm not so sure they are listening but at least we 've got their attention . "
later , on gmtv he suggested free school buses , park and ride schemes and the re-phasing of traffic lights were alternative solutions to solve road congestion .
he said road charging would be " destroying people 's social lives " .
" at the end of the day if you are going to pay per mile you are not going to do these things . "

he told the bbc 's newsnight that as well as tony blair 's e-mail to those who signed a petition opposing the scheme , there will be local debates .
the petition , which closes at midnight , has been backed by 1.6m people on the downing street website .
it says tolls are " sinister and wrong " and unfair to poorer people .
specifically , the petition calls for the scrapping of " planned vehicle tracking and road-pricing policy " .
tony blair has revealed that he intends to send an e-mail to the people who have signed the online petition , telling them that charges for using the roads are " surely part of the answer " to solving the growing problems of congestion .
the petition was so popular that at one point it crashed the prime minister 's website .

speaking during a debate on newsnight , the transport secretary said the government would " engage " with those who backed the petition .
he added that the government would have a debate " based on the facts " , rather than " myths " that he said had been " propagated alongside the petition " .
' public 's attention ' mr ladyman said there would have to be a period of consultation and debates and a bill through parliament even before a local pilot scheme could go ahead .
" between now and a national scheme there would be two general elections so there will be plenty of opportunities to engage people and win them over .
and if we ca n't win them over , it ca n't go ahead , " he said .
among those taking part in the newsnight debate was the man who started the petition - peter roberts , a 46-year-old account manager from telford .

at present , developers have not been able to create games characters with photo-realistic faces and expressions .
david kunkler producer for obsidian entertainment and makers of neverwinter nights 2 , said games are currently in an " uncanny valley . "
" they look strange - they 're too close to real , but not quite real , " he added .
" give us another year or two , and we 'll be able to completely get across that uncanny valley , " he told bbc world service 's digital planet programme .
getting emotional this super-realism , where human characters look completely convincing , has been seen as an elusive next step forward for game programmers for a few years now .
but with motion-capture methods - where computers read sensors which monitor the movements of an actor - rapidly being perfected , it will not be long before it becomes part of the gaming world .
elements of hollywood have been drawn into making the next generation of consoles ian livingstone , eidos " people are doing motion capture very well , getting the ' exactly right ' facial expressions - eyes moving correctly , every little crease , wrinkle and nod - really coming across , " mr kunkler said .
" that 's when we 're going to be able to fool the player into thinking , ' this is a real actor ' - and that 's when we 're going to move to emotional content in games . "
this ability to capture human emotions will be particularly important for serious games designed to help train people for real-life situations .
using these developments , it is hoped that these games will help demonstrate the subtleties of human body language in complex , dangerous situations .
" there are many simulation approaches which train soldiers , for example , for when they have to communicate with people in iraq , " said professor alexander nareyek , from games lab at the national university of singapore .
" they have to understand the emotions displayed by these virtual actors , and train to cope with emotional and challenging situations . "
for developers , this trend towards super-real characters - together with a growing feeling that better writing and acting within games is essential - will bring together a new dimension of emotion to gaming .
" we will be able to play with people 's emotions - we can make them laugh , we can make them cry , we can make them sad , " said ian livingstone of eidos , which made the highly-successful tomb raider series of games .

at present , developers have not been able to create games characters with photo-realistic faces and expressions .
david kunkler producer for obsidian entertainment and makers of neverwinter nights 2 , said games are currently in an " uncanny valley . "
" they look strange - they 're too close to real , but not quite real , " he added .
" give us another year or two , and we 'll be able to completely get across that uncanny valley , " he told bbc world service 's digital planet programme .
getting emotional this super-realism , where human characters look completely convincing , has been seen as an elusive next step forward for game programmers for a few years now .
but with motion-capture methods - where computers read sensors which monitor the movements of an actor - rapidly being perfected , it will not be long before it becomes part of the gaming world . "
elements of hollywood have been drawn into making the next generation of consoles " ian livingstone , eidos " people are doing motion capture very well , getting the ' exactly right ' facial expressions - eyes moving correctly , every little crease , wrinkle and nod - really coming across , " mr kunkler said .
" that 's when we 're going to be able to fool the player into thinking , ' this is a real actor ' - and that 's when we 're going to move to emotional content in games . "
this ability to capture human emotions will be particularly important for serious games designed to help train people for real-life situations .
using these developments , it is hoped that these games will help demonstrate the subtleties of human body language in complex , dangerous situations .
" there are many simulation approaches which train soldiers , for example , for when they have to communicate with people in iraq , " said professor alexander nareyek , from games lab at the national university of singapore .
" they have to understand the emotions displayed by these virtual actors , and train to cope with emotional and challenging situations . "
for developers , this trend towards super-real characters - together with a growing feeling that better writing and acting within games is essential - will bring together a new dimension of emotion to gaming .
" we will be able to play with people 's emotions - we can make them laugh , we can make them cry , we can make them sad , " said ian livingstone of eidos , which made the highly-successful tomb raider series of games .
" therefore , elements of hollywood have been drawn into making the next generation of consoles . "

he was a senior team leader at lockerbie when a pan am jumbo jet with 258 passengers crashed on the town in the scottish borders in 1988 .
his team found the aircraft 's black box recorder .
heavy - the nickname by which friends and colleagues know him - was also involved in the hunt for survivors when a chinook helicopter crashed on mull of kintyre in 1994 .
the four raf crew and 25 terrorism experts , who had been flying from northern ireland , died .
shortly after he was first admitted to the raf 's search and rescue service his first call-out was to help trace a downed viscount aircraft .

the 54-year-old said : " it was five finger gully in lochaber .

however , he still admits to being unnerved by the extreme conditions in the scottish hills .
describing a rescue effort in the cairngorms last year , he said : " i had just finished my shift and went down to glenmore lodge to see what i could do to help .
" up on the hill the winds were gusting 60-80mph .
" a helicopter took myself and others and landed at 3,000ft .

seven times heavy said he understood climbers ' , mountaineers ' and hill walkers ' passion for mountains .
brought up in ayr , his church of scotland minister father regularly took him for walks in the southern uplands , arran and glencoe .
he has climbed all scotland 's munros seven times .
heavy said : " to do this job you have to love the mountains . "
but the actions of a minority continue to surprise him .
" the mobile phone is fantastic , but some people think it is the answer to everything , " he said .
" remember there you 're not always going to get a signal and always have the batteries charged - a number of times i 've been speaking to someone needing assistance and their battery fails .

a strange incident on the cobbler , a hill near arrochar , one summer stands out .
