is n't it time berlin jumped ship ? germany 's role in operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- has long been controversial .
in the wake of the sept .
11 attacks , then chancellor gerhard schröder pledged the us unconditional solidarity and military support in its war on terror .
when his coalition partner , the green party , dug its heels in , schröder resorted to a vote of confidence in the german parliament to force the bundestag 's pacifist members to swallow a bundeswehr dispatch to afghanistan - and won by a narrow margin . back then , germany offered almost 4,000 troops to help out the americans in their fight against al qaeda and its allies , primarily in afghanistan .
unlike the isaf mission , which is mandated by united nations security council resolutions , operation enduring freedom is based on the us right to self-defense against terrorism - which is , granted , recognized by the security council . # b # nonetheless , six years since the launch of this mission , it is time to ask how long the right to self-defense remains a legitimate argument .
if the us is prepared to maintain its war on terror indefinitely , then the german role in the conflict needs to be defined once and for all .
this has yet to happen . according to the bundestag mandate , elite german special forces -lrb- ksk -rrb- have been deployed to afghanistan .
to this day , the precise nature of their mission is still a secret - for reasons of security , says berlin . all this mystery makes it almost impossible to assess germany 's participation in oef .
one member of parliament recently complained that the bundestag is denied information , while the government insists it has no information to share on operation enduring freedom .
for the last six years , berlin has maintained unreserved loyalty to the undertaking , despite the fact that washington apparently provides military updates only sporadically .
the number of civilian lives claimed in afghanistan is also information that tends to be swept under the carpet . but facts are all there is to go on .
ksk forces have not been in afghanistan since germany 's change of government two years ago . the country 's current contribution to oef is 250 marines stationed on the horn of africa , which still cost berlin some 65 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- this year alone .
past experience suggests that the german frigates do little to deter potential terrorists .
so why is berlin still faithful to operation enduring freedom ? berlin 's argument that it is unwilling to leave its allies in the lurch is a specious one .
more to the point , it is unwilling to anger washington .
germany 's involvement in operation enduring freedom does not make the world a safer place .
it is high time berlin abandoned it . nina werkhäuser covers foreign , defense and security policy affairs for dw-radio . -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

12 , to extend the country 's mission in afghanistan by one year .
-lrb- 12.10.2007 -rrb- " we 're falling behind in our commitment to afghanistan " in an interview with dw-tv , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke about the need to step up efforts to rebuild afghanistan , settle the future of kosovo and heal tensions with poland .

many times , the reason is long forgotten in the horror which follows .
luckily , no one will have to face the shame of one breaking out over apple wine . it was set to be the biggest battle over eu designations since the infamous champagne war of 2005 and the equally distressing feta incident of 2002 .
but , somewhat ironically considering the nature of the dispute in the first place , common sense has prevailed to end the apfelwein rebellion of 2007 before any sap was spilt . the german campaign , led by hesse premier roland koch with support from federal agriculture minister horst seehofer , was ready to storm the gates of the eurocrat fortresses in brussels to fight for the right to have the traditional cider-like brew recognized as a wine . the eu claimed that the regional drink fell foul of a proposal from the european commission to use the term " wine " purely for grape products . koch and seehofer target euro madness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch : " madness " an outraged koch vehemently defended his state 's brew and the drums of conflict began to sound . " we will not allow our traditional name to be sacrificed to regulatory madness in brussels , " koch ranted earlier this week .
" we will fight with all the means at our disposal for our apple wine . " seehofer , obviously seeing the worth in throwing his federal weight behind such an affront to german tradition , joined what he called a " justified " cause . " the minister definitely wants to save the terms apfelwein and obstwein -lsb- fruit wine -rsb- , while it should be made clear to consumers that these are not grape products , " seehofer bravely stated - through a spokesperson - to a gaggle of unpatriotic reporters . anyone who has found the sour tasting regional icon to be unpalatable may appreciate the german efforts out of principle alone .
apfelwein , which is also known under various other terms like " ebbelwoi " and " apfelmost , " is seen as an oddity in the rest of the country and those who have no love of its taste would struggle to defend it . devastation averted eu peacemakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt was awash with apfelwein as peace broke out but this fight was about the name and not the taste .
thankfully , for once at least , the european commission saw sense .
apfelwein , it was announced on tuesday , will remain a wine after all . " in the context of the negotiations on the wine reform we will find a solution to allow apfelwein and other fruit and berry wines to continue to be marketed as they are now - namely as fruit wines , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said in a statement that will surely be quoted when she picks up her future nobel peace prize for averting the conflict . " contrary to what i have read in the newspapers over recent days , it was never our intention to stop the production of these products , " she said , adding that germany and brussels would work for a compromise at a meeting of farm ministers in december . reports suggest that the state of emergency in hesse has since been scaled back . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thankfully , for once at least , the european commission saw sense .
apfelwein , it was announced on tuesday , will remain a wine after all . " in the context of the negotiations on the wine reform we will find a solution to allow apfelwein and other fruit and berry wines to continue to be marketed as they are now - namely as fruit wines , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said in a statement that will surely be quoted when she picks up her future nobel peace prize for averting the conflict . " contrary to what i have read in the newspapers over recent days , it was never our intention to stop the production of these products , " she said , adding that germany and brussels would work for a compromise at a meeting of farm ministers in december . reports suggest that the state of emergency in hesse has since been scaled back . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 . barroso was the first high-level international visitor to travel to warsaw to congratulate tusk , whose center-right civic platform party and its allies are expected to form a coalition government later this week after winning legislative elections on oct .
21 . eu leaders have been barely able to contain their relief at the demise of outgoing prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's conservative government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk is expected to be named prime minister on friday " today , i was able to congratulate personally donald tusk , my good friend , for his victory , for the victory of his party in the parliamentary elections , " barroso told reporters at a press conference after the meeting . tusk campaigned on a promise to help the eu 's largest post-communist member catch up with richer western european countries , and said poland could become like ireland , where eu entry triggered an economic boom . pro-eu course further promises include improving strained relations with poland 's neighbors ; taking advantage of the country 's strong economic growth ; adopting the euro in the next six years , and re-examining a us plan to place parts of an anti-missile shield in poland . tusk has also said special attention would be paid to german-polish ties , which have taken a battering in recent years . " one can be certain that the government will take a very strong pro-european direction , and european relations will be intensified , " tusk said after the meeting .

they pointed out that disagreement was likely over the us plan to place an anti-missile shield in poland .

8 , georgian president mikhail saakashvili he set a date of jan .
5 , media reports from the capital tbilisi said .
saakashvili said he decided to hold the vote , originally scheduled for late 2008 , " to receive the trust of the people . " " i , as president of this nation , take this decision and make this proposal to hold a vote of confidence on my mandate , to receive unambiguous support from you to continue building our country , " he said . " the president 's statement is a victory for the georgian people , " said david zurabishvili , one of the leaders of the democratic front .
" the role of the opposition was only to bring the idea of the people to the president . " the opposition is now conferring to find a candidate to run against saakashvili . according to the georgian constitution , the president is elected for a five-year term and the early election will still require parliamentary approval .
a pro-saakashvili majority in parliament is expected to quickly endorse his decision . after six days of opposition protests , prime minister zurab nogaideli said on wednesday that saakashvili had declared a state of emergency in the capital tbilisi because of " an attempt at a state coup . " meanwhile , economic development minister georgi arvaladze said in a televised statement that saakashvili had imposed restrictions on public gatherings and the media , closing all television networks except state-controlled stations . post-revolution disillusionment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators have been calling for new elections for days the move came after a further day of running battles between riot police and demonstrators demanding the resignation of saakashvili , who came to power in the peaceful 2003 " rose revolution . "
the violence erupted when unarmed police attempted to disperse a rally on rustaveli avenue near parliament , in the center of the ancient city . accusing the president of corruption , political killings and failing to address widespread poverty in the country , the protestors had called for early elections . " we are demanding saakashvili 's resignation after such terrible and savage use of force , " said levan berdenishvili , a leader of the opposition .
" such uncivilized methods can not be allowed by any state . " saakashvili has repeatedly stressed that he will not resign and said he intends to run for re-election . " i , as the leader of this nation , need your mandate to cope with any external threat , to manage any pressure and to do away with an attempt to annex georgia 's territory , " he said . the afp news agency reported that according to health officials , some 500 people had been hospitalized wednesday after clashes with police , who fired rubber bullets , tear gas , and water cannons .
most were released after being treated for minor injuries and exposure to tear gas . later , the pro-opposition imedi television station went off air after an anchor said that government special forces had entered the broadcaster 's building . " anti-russian hysteria " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests started a week ago " high-ranking officials in russian special services are behind this , " said saakashvili in a televised national address , adding that they were " trying to gain a foothold among some of the radical opposition parties . " saakashvili announced that several russian diplomats would be expelled for engaging in " subversive , espionage activity in georgia . "
three diplomats were due for expulsion , according to interfax news agency . dismissing the claims as " anti-russian hysteria , " the russian foreign ministry described the accusations as irresponsible and said that any expulsion of russian diplomats would elicit an " appropriate response . " georgia , which frequently accuses russia of causing trouble in the former soviet republic which has cultivated close ties with washington in recent years , also recalled its ambassador from moscow , the foreign ministry revealed . staunchly pro-western , saakashvili has angered moscow with his push to join nato and his attempts to regain sovereignty over two breakaway pro-russian provinces . international concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili gave in to protesters ' demands the white house said it was " concerned " by the unrest in georgia , urging the government and opposition to resolve their differences peacefully and to shun steps that could provoke violence . " neither side ... should take any steps that would be deliberately provocative to the other and could lead to violence , " state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters . the european union 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , called for restraint , saying " political differences should be resolved within the democratic institutions .

8 , georgian president mikhail saakashvili he set a date of jan .
5 , media reports from the capital tbilisi said .
saakashvili said he decided to hold the vote , originally scheduled for late 2008 , " to receive the trust of the people . " " i , as president of this nation , take this decision and make this proposal to hold a vote of confidence on my mandate , to receive unambiguous support from you to continue building our country , " he said . " the president 's statement is a victory for the georgian people , " said david zurabishvili , one of the leaders of the democratic front .
" the role of the opposition was only to bring the idea of the people to the president . " the opposition is now conferring to find a candidate to run against saakashvili . according to the georgian constitution , the president is elected for a five-year term and the early election will still require parliamentary approval .
a pro-saakashvili majority in parliament is expected to quickly endorse his decision . after six days of opposition protests , prime minister zurab nogaideli said on wednesday that saakashvili had declared a state of emergency in the capital tbilisi because of " an attempt at a state coup . " meanwhile , economic development minister georgi arvaladze said in a televised statement that saakashvili had imposed restrictions on public gatherings and the media , closing all television networks except state-controlled stations . post-revolution disillusionment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators have been calling for new elections for days the move came after a further day of running battles between riot police and demonstrators demanding the resignation of saakashvili , who came to power in the peaceful 2003 " rose revolution . "
the violence erupted when unarmed police attempted to disperse a rally on rustaveli avenue near parliament , in the center of the ancient city . accusing the president of corruption , political killings and failing to address widespread poverty in the country , the protestors had called for early elections . " we are demanding saakashvili 's resignation after such terrible and savage use of force , " said levan berdenishvili , a leader of the opposition .
" such uncivilized methods can not be allowed by any state . " saakashvili has repeatedly stressed that he will not resign and said he intends to run for re-election . " i , as the leader of this nation , need your mandate to cope with any external threat , to manage any pressure and to do away with an attempt to annex georgia 's territory , " he said . the afp news agency reported that according to health officials , some 500 people had been hospitalized wednesday after clashes with police , who fired rubber bullets , tear gas , and water cannons .
most were released after being treated for minor injuries and exposure to tear gas . later , the pro-opposition imedi television station went off air after an anchor said that government special forces had entered the broadcaster 's building . " anti-russian hysteria " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests started a week ago " high-ranking officials in russian special services are behind this , " said saakashvili in a televised national address , adding that they were " trying to gain a foothold among some of the radical opposition parties . " saakashvili announced that several russian diplomats would be expelled for engaging in " subversive , espionage activity in georgia . "
three diplomats were due for expulsion , according to interfax news agency . dismissing the claims as " anti-russian hysteria , " the russian foreign ministry described the accusations as irresponsible and said that any expulsion of russian diplomats would elicit an " appropriate response . " georgia , which frequently accuses russia of causing trouble in the former soviet republic which has cultivated close ties with washington in recent years , also recalled its ambassador from moscow , the foreign ministry revealed . staunchly pro-western , saakashvili has angered moscow with his push to join nato and his attempts to regain sovereignty over two breakaway pro-russian provinces . international concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili gave in to protesters ' demands the white house said it was " concerned " by the unrest in georgia , urging the government and opposition to resolve their differences peacefully and to shun steps that could provoke violence . " neither side ... should take any steps that would be deliberately provocative to the other and could lead to violence , " state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters . the european union 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , called for restraint , saying " political differences should be resolved within the democratic institutions .

's original sceptical friend just after french president nicolas sarkozy flies out of the us , german chancellor angela merkel flies in .
both european leaders have sought to improve their ties with the us , but the trio does n't agree on everything . dw-radio spoke with john hulsman , an alfred von oppenheim scholar in residence at the german council on foreign relations in berlin . dw-radio : a lot has been said about how nicolas sarkozy in france and angela merkel in germany have turned around their relationships with the us since the iraq invasion .
how aligned is europe now with washington on international issues ? john hulsman : the fascinating thing about the big three , and i 'd throw the united kingdom in there as well , is that they are all coming to a similar position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could merkel , sarkozy and brown usher in a new era of eu-us relations ?
mr. sarkozy looked at the chirac presidency and saw that france had absolutely no stake in the middle east after opposing the americans over iraq .
that he was , in effect , too far away from america to be a major decision player - and that 's one thing french presidents , regardless of their politics , all want to be .
so he needs to move closer to america to matter . gordon brown has the opposite problem .
tony blair moved too close to president bush and it ruined his premiership , so gordon brown moved slightly away from the united states , while retaining close ties . and they both row to an island where they find angela merkel who staked out this position of " skeptical friendship " ahead of time .
which is that of course we support america .
of course america 's an ally , and we share values but that does n't mean we 're your lapdog and we 're going to agree with you issue after issue . german chancellor angela merkel arrives in the us on friday .
do you think she ’ ll receive a warm a welcome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush share a mutual respect for each other yes , president bush thinks extremely highly of chancellor merkel .
she 's proven to be not flamboyant , not showy but to get the job done diplomatically behind closed doors .
again -lsb- she has -rsb- this kind of european view of skeptical friendship .
that we need the united states , we must work with them but that we 're not going to be their lapdog .
this is really her invention . the atmospherics after chancellor schröder were awful , and chancellor merkel entered very clear and in a straight way by saying that america remains a great ally of germany but that does n't mean she 's in favor of guantanamo bay , renditions , torture , etc . what will chancellor merkel be talking about in her discussions with president bush ? it 's a number of issues that i do n't think grab attention but really matter .
for instance , her plans to free up currency flows between europe and the united states by talking about common regulations .
this is an issue that will take years - if not decades - to negotiate but will actually help both european and american economies immensely .
in the absence of a free trade deal this may be the closest we can get to actually improving cooperation between our two huge and important economies . certainly the other issue will be chancellor merkel 's signature issue , which is climate change .
can we reach some sort of post-kyoto protocol ?
this again is going to take a very long time and probably wo n't be decided until president bush has a successor .
but she has moved the president to say things like " actually climate change is a problem , " and that was a huge change from when president bush came into office .
that 's entirely due to chancellor angela merkel chipping away at him from outside and -lsb- california -rsb- governor arnold schwarzenegger chipping away at president bush from within the country . interview : nathan wiktop -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many times , the reason is long forgotten in the horror which follows .
luckily , no one will have to face the shame of one breaking out over apple wine . it was set to be the biggest battle over eu designations since the infamous champagne war of 2005 and the equally distressing feta incident of 2002 .
but , somewhat ironically considering the nature of the dispute in the first place , common sense has prevailed to end the apfelwein rebellion of 2007 before any sap was spilt . the german campaign , led by hesse premier roland koch with support from federal agriculture minister horst seehofer , was ready to storm the gates of the eurocrat fortresses in brussels to fight for the right to have the traditional cider-like brew recognized as a wine . the eu claimed that the regional drink fell foul of a proposal from the european commission to use the term " wine " purely for grape products . koch and seehofer target euro madness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch : " madness " an outraged koch vehemently defended his state 's brew and the drums of conflict began to sound . " we will not allow our traditional name to be sacrificed to regulatory madness in brussels , " koch ranted earlier this week .
" we will fight with all the means at our disposal for our apple wine . " seehofer , obviously seeing the worth in throwing his federal weight behind such an affront to german tradition , joined what he called a " justified " cause . " the minister definitely wants to save the terms apfelwein and obstwein -lsb- fruit wine -rsb- , while it should be made clear to consumers that these are not grape products , " seehofer bravely stated - through a spokesperson - to a gaggle of unpatriotic reporters . anyone who has found the sour tasting regional icon to be unpalatable may appreciate the german efforts out of principle alone .
apfelwein , which is also known under various other terms like " ebbelwoi " and " apfelmost , " is seen as an oddity in the rest of the country and those who have no love of its taste would struggle to defend it . devastation averted eu peacemakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt was awash with apfelwein as peace broke out but this fight was about the name and not the taste .
thankfully , for once at least , the european commission saw sense .
apfelwein , it was announced on tuesday , will remain a wine after all . " in the context of the negotiations on the wine reform we will find a solution to allow apfelwein and other fruit and berry wines to continue to be marketed as they are now - namely as fruit wines , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said in a statement that will surely be quoted when she picks up her future nobel peace prize for averting the conflict . " contrary to what i have read in the newspapers over recent days , it was never our intention to stop the production of these products , " she said , adding that germany and brussels would work for a compromise at a meeting of farm ministers in december . reports suggest that the state of emergency in hesse has since been scaled back . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both european leaders have sought to improve their ties with the us , but the trio does n't agree on everything . dw-radio spoke with john hulsman , an alfred von oppenheim scholar in residence at the german council on foreign relations in berlin . dw-radio : a lot has been said about how nicolas sarkozy in france and angela merkel in germany have turned around their relationships with the us since the iraq invasion .

mr. sarkozy looked at the chirac presidency and saw that france had absolutely no stake in the middle east after opposing the americans over iraq .

's original sceptical friend just after french president nicolas sarkozy flies out of the us , german chancellor angela merkel flies in .
both european leaders have sought to improve their ties with the us , but the trio does n't agree on everything . dw-radio spoke with john hulsman , an alfred von oppenheim scholar in residence at the german council on foreign relations in berlin . dw-radio : a lot has been said about how nicolas sarkozy in france and angela merkel in germany have turned around their relationships with the us since the iraq invasion .
how aligned is europe now with washington on international issues ? john hulsman : the fascinating thing about the big three , and i 'd throw the united kingdom in there as well , is that they are all coming to a similar position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could merkel , sarkozy and brown usher in a new era of eu-us relations ?
mr. sarkozy looked at the chirac presidency and saw that france had absolutely no stake in the middle east after opposing the americans over iraq .
that he was , in effect , too far away from america to be a major decision player - and that 's one thing french presidents , regardless of their politics , all want to be .
so he needs to move closer to america to matter . gordon brown has the opposite problem .
tony blair moved too close to president bush and it ruined his premiership , so gordon brown moved slightly away from the united states , while retaining close ties . and they both row to an island where they find angela merkel who staked out this position of " skeptical friendship " ahead of time .
which is that of course we support america .
of course america 's an ally , and we share values but that does n't mean we 're your lapdog and we 're going to agree with you issue after issue . german chancellor angela merkel arrives in the us on friday .
do you think she ’ ll receive a warm a welcome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush share a mutual respect for each other yes , president bush thinks extremely highly of chancellor merkel .
she 's proven to be not flamboyant , not showy but to get the job done diplomatically behind closed doors .
again -lsb- she has -rsb- this kind of european view of skeptical friendship .
that we need the united states , we must work with them but that we 're not going to be their lapdog .
this is really her invention . the atmospherics after chancellor schröder were awful , and chancellor merkel entered very clear and in a straight way by saying that america remains a great ally of germany but that does n't mean she 's in favor of guantanamo bay , renditions , torture , etc . what will chancellor merkel be talking about in her discussions with president bush ? it 's a number of issues that i do n't think grab attention but really matter .
for instance , her plans to free up currency flows between europe and the united states by talking about common regulations .
this is an issue that will take years - if not decades - to negotiate but will actually help both european and american economies immensely .
in the absence of a free trade deal this may be the closest we can get to actually improving cooperation between our two huge and important economies . certainly the other issue will be chancellor merkel 's signature issue , which is climate change .
can we reach some sort of post-kyoto protocol ?
this again is going to take a very long time and probably wo n't be decided until president bush has a successor .
but she has moved the president to say things like " actually climate change is a problem , " and that was a huge change from when president bush came into office .
that 's entirely due to chancellor angela merkel chipping away at him from outside and -lsb- california -rsb- governor arnold schwarzenegger chipping away at president bush from within the country . interview : nathan wiktop -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 .
germany took seventh place . according to the gender gap report , released by the world economic forum , germany successfully narrowed its gender gap from a year ago .
but because other countries made even greater progress , germany 's overall ranking dropped , from fifth place to seventh . the wef study measures international gender equality by looking at four key areas : women 's economic participation in society ; their levels of health and education ; and their political empowerment .
economist saadia zahidi , one of the authors of the report , noted that while germany 's lowest rating was in the area of economic participation , " its scores make it a high-ranking country compared to others , particularly in europe . " as in 2006 , the top-most ranks were swept by a brace of scandinavian nations .
but germany " is actually doing much better in comparison to other countries , especially countries like italy , france or malta , " which fell much lower down in the rankings overall , zahidi said . dw-world.de spoke with zahidi about the purpose , and potential pitfalls , of carrying out a sweeping gender study . dw-world.de : the concept of a gender gap report is a fairly new one .
can you explain its purpose ? saadia zahidi : the global gender gap index tries to examine the gap between women and men in various areas .
it is looking at gaps , rather than levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zahidi : " countries should capitalize on half their resources " for example having an index that tells a country like bangladesh that it has lower levels of education than sweden is not very useful , they already know that .
they 're a poor country .
what this index tries to answer is , for example , whether bangladesh has a bigger gap on education than a comparable country such as pakistan . everything we do is rewarding parity .
it is not rewarding women 's supremacy over men , or men 's supremacy over women .
it is rewarding countries that aim to distribute their resources equally between women and men . so how does one measure parity ? a key feature of the index is that it has a fixed scale , with " zero " being inequality , and " one " being equality .
a score of 0.75 can be approximately interpreted as meaning , 75 percent of the gap in that country has been closed .
it is all relative to a benchmark , which is the number " one . "
it allows us to track the changes over time . statistical data is notoriously slippery .
do you think your report gives an accurate picture of the state of gender equality in the world ? the report is actually based on 14 different variables , 13 of which come from hard data sources , like the united nations development program , the international labor organization and the world health organization .
this is all hard statistics , which simply look at things such as labor force participation rates , or the number of women ministers , or literacy rates . all we have done is provide a framework that allows us to look at these hard facts in such a way that gives you an idea of where this country stands in terms of gap , compared to other countries in the world .
so yes , i think it does provide an accurate picture . why gather this information ?
who uses it ? we 've tried to make it something that is going to be useful for general awareness , and we believe the rankings will help do that .
but because we 've provided a lot of details , it is also a reference tool for international organizations and national governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education levels are compared in the study it has also become a catalyst for academic research .
quite a lot of academics contact us for details from the index , wondering about the connections between certain policies and their outcomes . germany ranked seventh overall this year , and scored relatively well in terms of economic participation .
but newspapers here are full of articles about glass ceilings , a stubborn wage gap , and social education practices that make it hard for mothers to re-enter the work force .
how does that add up ? in our study we look at the overall workplace participation rate .
in the global statistics , it appears germany is doing well in terms of labor force participation of women , whereas italy and france are not doing as well . how many women actually go back into the workplace after having children is n't something we include in the index .
but we do provide information on the length of paid maternity leave , which is 14 weeks in germany , and the maternity benefits , which is that the wages are 100 percent paid , partly by social security up to a certain level , and the rest by the employer . how meaningful is this kind of measurement ?
the philippines , where women 's situation is not usually thought of as being very good , was ranked sixth - right above germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , unlike saudi arabia , women are commonly active in politics that goes back to what i said earlier : the index looks at gaps , not levels .
so we 're not worried about what is the overall level of resources in the philippines compared to that in the united kingdom .
what we do show is that relatively speaking , those resources are being divided more equitably in the philippines as compared to in the uk . … as to whether this is meaningful , it may not be - except to be a striking example of how this could be a priority for all countries , whether rich or poor . are the relative wealth or poverty of the 128 countries you include reflected in the study ? what we have done is divide rankings by income groups ; low income compared to low income countries , high income to high income . … we find that within each of these income groups there are countries that perform very well , and others that perform poorly . in the high income group , for example , sweden does extremely well , but saudi arabia does very poorly .
or in the lower and lower-middle group , there are countries like philippines and tanzania that do very well , but also countries like pakistan and yemen that do badly . it all goes a long way toward showing that gender equality is not a luxury good , and that it is something all countries can aspire towards . do most countries see gender equality as an ideal to be strived for ? that is one of the key messages we are trying to spread with this report .
clearly this is a human rights challenge , but it is also an economic challenge .
countries that are not capitalizing on half of their resource pool will be undermining their competitive potential in the long run .
this is definitely one of the key messages we highlight in this report . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 .
germany took seventh place . according to the gender gap report , released by the world economic forum , germany successfully narrowed its gender gap from a year ago .
but because other countries made even greater progress , germany 's overall ranking dropped , from fifth place to seventh . the wef study measures international gender equality by looking at four key areas : women 's economic participation in society ; their levels of health and education ; and their political empowerment .
economist saadia zahidi , one of the authors of the report , noted that while germany 's lowest rating was in the area of economic participation , " its scores make it a high-ranking country compared to others , particularly in europe . " as in 2006 , the top-most ranks were swept by a brace of scandinavian nations .
but germany " is actually doing much better in comparison to other countries , especially countries like italy , france or malta , " which fell much lower down in the rankings overall , zahidi said . dw-world.de spoke with zahidi about the purpose , and potential pitfalls , of carrying out a sweeping gender study . dw-world.de : the concept of a gender gap report is a fairly new one .
can you explain its purpose ? saadia zahidi : the global gender gap index tries to examine the gap between women and men in various areas .
it is looking at gaps , rather than levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zahidi : " countries should capitalize on half their resources " for example having an index that tells a country like bangladesh that it has lower levels of education than sweden is not very useful , they already know that .
they 're a poor country .
what this index tries to answer is , for example , whether bangladesh has a bigger gap on education than a comparable country such as pakistan . everything we do is rewarding parity .
it is not rewarding women 's supremacy over men , or men 's supremacy over women .
it is rewarding countries that aim to distribute their resources equally between women and men . so how does one measure parity ? a key feature of the index is that it has a fixed scale , with " zero " being inequality , and " one " being equality .
a score of 0.75 can be approximately interpreted as meaning , 75 percent of the gap in that country has been closed .
it is all relative to a benchmark , which is the number " one . "
it allows us to track the changes over time . statistical data is notoriously slippery .
do you think your report gives an accurate picture of the state of gender equality in the world ? the report is actually based on 14 different variables , 13 of which come from hard data sources , like the united nations development program , the international labor organization and the world health organization .
this is all hard statistics , which simply look at things such as labor force participation rates , or the number of women ministers , or literacy rates . all we have done is provide a framework that allows us to look at these hard facts in such a way that gives you an idea of where this country stands in terms of gap , compared to other countries in the world .
so yes , i think it does provide an accurate picture . why gather this information ?
who uses it ? we 've tried to make it something that is going to be useful for general awareness , and we believe the rankings will help do that .
but because we 've provided a lot of details , it is also a reference tool for international organizations and national governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education levels are compared in the study it has also become a catalyst for academic research .
quite a lot of academics contact us for details from the index , wondering about the connections between certain policies and their outcomes . germany ranked seventh overall this year , and scored relatively well in terms of economic participation .
but newspapers here are full of articles about glass ceilings , a stubborn wage gap , and social education practices that make it hard for mothers to re-enter the work force .
how does that add up ? in our study we look at the overall workplace participation rate .
in the global statistics , it appears germany is doing well in terms of labor force participation of women , whereas italy and france are not doing as well . how many women actually go back into the workplace after having children is n't something we include in the index .
but we do provide information on the length of paid maternity leave , which is 14 weeks in germany , and the maternity benefits , which is that the wages are 100 percent paid , partly by social security up to a certain level , and the rest by the employer . how meaningful is this kind of measurement ?
the philippines , where women 's situation is not usually thought of as being very good , was ranked sixth - right above germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , unlike saudi arabia , women are commonly active in politics that goes back to what i said earlier : the index looks at gaps , not levels .
so we 're not worried about what is the overall level of resources in the philippines compared to that in the united kingdom .
what we do show is that relatively speaking , those resources are being divided more equitably in the philippines as compared to in the uk . … as to whether this is meaningful , it may not be - except to be a striking example of how this could be a priority for all countries , whether rich or poor . are the relative wealth or poverty of the 128 countries you include reflected in the study ? what we have done is divide rankings by income groups ; low income compared to low income countries , high income to high income . … we find that within each of these income groups there are countries that perform very well , and others that perform poorly . in the high income group , for example , sweden does extremely well , but saudi arabia does very poorly .
or in the lower and lower-middle group , there are countries like philippines and tanzania that do very well , but also countries like pakistan and yemen that do badly . it all goes a long way toward showing that gender equality is not a luxury good , and that it is something all countries can aspire towards . do most countries see gender equality as an ideal to be strived for ? that is one of the key messages we are trying to spread with this report .
clearly this is a human rights challenge , but it is also an economic challenge .
countries that are not capitalizing on half of their resource pool will be undermining their competitive potential in the long run .
this is definitely one of the key messages we highlight in this report . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is all hard statistics , which simply look at things such as labor force participation rates , or the number of women ministers , or literacy rates . all we have done is provide a framework that allows us to look at these hard facts in such a way that gives you an idea of where this country stands in terms of gap , compared to other countries in the world .
so yes , i think it does provide an accurate picture . why gather this information ?
who uses it ? we 've tried to make it something that is going to be useful for general awareness , and we believe the rankings will help do that .
but because we 've provided a lot of details , it is also a reference tool for international organizations and national governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education levels are compared in the study it has also become a catalyst for academic research .
quite a lot of academics contact us for details from the index , wondering about the connections between certain policies and their outcomes . germany ranked seventh overall this year , and scored relatively well in terms of economic participation .
but newspapers here are full of articles about glass ceilings , a stubborn wage gap , and social education practices that make it hard for mothers to re-enter the work force .
how does that add up ? in our study we look at the overall workplace participation rate .
in the global statistics , it appears germany is doing well in terms of labor force participation of women , whereas italy and france are not doing as well . how many women actually go back into the workplace after having children is n't something we include in the index .
but we do provide information on the length of paid maternity leave , which is 14 weeks in germany , and the maternity benefits , which is that the wages are 100 percent paid , partly by social security up to a certain level , and the rest by the employer . how meaningful is this kind of measurement ?

so we 're not worried about what is the overall level of resources in the philippines compared to that in the united kingdom .
what we do show is that relatively speaking , those resources are being divided more equitably in the philippines as compared to in the uk . … as to whether this is meaningful , it may not be - except to be a striking example of how this could be a priority for all countries , whether rich or poor . are the relative wealth or poverty of the 128 countries you include reflected in the study ? what we have done is divide rankings by income groups ; low income compared to low income countries , high income to high income . … we find that within each of these income groups there are countries that perform very well , and others that perform poorly . in the high income group , for example , sweden does extremely well , but saudi arabia does very poorly .
or in the lower and lower-middle group , there are countries like philippines and tanzania that do very well , but also countries like pakistan and yemen that do badly . it all goes a long way toward showing that gender equality is not a luxury good , and that it is something all countries can aspire towards . do most countries see gender equality as an ideal to be strived for ? that is one of the key messages we are trying to spread with this report .
clearly this is a human rights challenge , but it is also an economic challenge .

8 .
germany took seventh place . according to the gender gap report , released by the world economic forum , germany successfully narrowed its gender gap from a year ago .
but because other countries made even greater progress , germany 's overall ranking dropped , from fifth place to seventh . the wef study measures international gender equality by looking at four key areas : women 's economic participation in society ; their levels of health and education ; and their political empowerment .
economist saadia zahidi , one of the authors of the report , noted that while germany 's lowest rating was in the area of economic participation , " its scores make it a high-ranking country compared to others , particularly in europe . " as in 2006 , the top-most ranks were swept by a brace of scandinavian nations .
but germany " is actually doing much better in comparison to other countries , especially countries like italy , france or malta , " which fell much lower down in the rankings overall , zahidi said . dw-world.de spoke with zahidi about the purpose , and potential pitfalls , of carrying out a sweeping gender study . dw-world.de : the concept of a gender gap report is a fairly new one .
can you explain its purpose ? saadia zahidi : the global gender gap index tries to examine the gap between women and men in various areas .
it is looking at gaps , rather than levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zahidi : " countries should capitalize on half their resources " for example having an index that tells a country like bangladesh that it has lower levels of education than sweden is not very useful , they already know that .
they 're a poor country .
what this index tries to answer is , for example , whether bangladesh has a bigger gap on education than a comparable country such as pakistan . everything we do is rewarding parity .
it is not rewarding women 's supremacy over men , or men 's supremacy over women .
it is rewarding countries that aim to distribute their resources equally between women and men . so how does one measure parity ? a key feature of the index is that it has a fixed scale , with " zero " being inequality , and " one " being equality .
a score of 0.75 can be approximately interpreted as meaning , 75 percent of the gap in that country has been closed .
it is all relative to a benchmark , which is the number " one . "
it allows us to track the changes over time . statistical data is notoriously slippery .
do you think your report gives an accurate picture of the state of gender equality in the world ? the report is actually based on 14 different variables , 13 of which come from hard data sources , like the united nations development program , the international labor organization and the world health organization .

8 .
germany took seventh place . according to the gender gap report , released by the world economic forum , germany successfully narrowed its gender gap from a year ago .
but because other countries made even greater progress , germany 's overall ranking dropped , from fifth place to seventh . the wef study measures international gender equality by looking at four key areas : women 's economic participation in society ; their levels of health and education ; and their political empowerment .
economist saadia zahidi , one of the authors of the report , noted that while germany 's lowest rating was in the area of economic participation , " its scores make it a high-ranking country compared to others , particularly in europe . " as in 2006 , the top-most ranks were swept by a brace of scandinavian nations .
but germany " is actually doing much better in comparison to other countries , especially countries like italy , france or malta , " which fell much lower down in the rankings overall , zahidi said . dw-world.de spoke with zahidi about the purpose , and potential pitfalls , of carrying out a sweeping gender study . dw-world.de : the concept of a gender gap report is a fairly new one .
can you explain its purpose ? saadia zahidi : the global gender gap index tries to examine the gap between women and men in various areas .
it is looking at gaps , rather than levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zahidi : " countries should capitalize on half their resources " for example having an index that tells a country like bangladesh that it has lower levels of education than sweden is not very useful , they already know that .
they 're a poor country .
what this index tries to answer is , for example , whether bangladesh has a bigger gap on education than a comparable country such as pakistan . everything we do is rewarding parity .
it is not rewarding women 's supremacy over men , or men 's supremacy over women .
it is rewarding countries that aim to distribute their resources equally between women and men . so how does one measure parity ? a key feature of the index is that it has a fixed scale , with " zero " being inequality , and " one " being equality .
a score of 0.75 can be approximately interpreted as meaning , 75 percent of the gap in that country has been closed .
it is all relative to a benchmark , which is the number " one . "
it allows us to track the changes over time . statistical data is notoriously slippery .
do you think your report gives an accurate picture of the state of gender equality in the world ? the report is actually based on 14 different variables , 13 of which come from hard data sources , like the united nations development program , the international labor organization and the world health organization .
this is all hard statistics , which simply look at things such as labor force participation rates , or the number of women ministers , or literacy rates . all we have done is provide a framework that allows us to look at these hard facts in such a way that gives you an idea of where this country stands in terms of gap , compared to other countries in the world .
so yes , i think it does provide an accurate picture . why gather this information ?
who uses it ? we 've tried to make it something that is going to be useful for general awareness , and we believe the rankings will help do that .
but because we 've provided a lot of details , it is also a reference tool for international organizations and national governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education levels are compared in the study it has also become a catalyst for academic research .
quite a lot of academics contact us for details from the index , wondering about the connections between certain policies and their outcomes . germany ranked seventh overall this year , and scored relatively well in terms of economic participation .
but newspapers here are full of articles about glass ceilings , a stubborn wage gap , and social education practices that make it hard for mothers to re-enter the work force .
how does that add up ? in our study we look at the overall workplace participation rate .
in the global statistics , it appears germany is doing well in terms of labor force participation of women , whereas italy and france are not doing as well . how many women actually go back into the workplace after having children is n't something we include in the index .
but we do provide information on the length of paid maternity leave , which is 14 weeks in germany , and the maternity benefits , which is that the wages are 100 percent paid , partly by social security up to a certain level , and the rest by the employer . how meaningful is this kind of measurement ?
the philippines , where women 's situation is not usually thought of as being very good , was ranked sixth - right above germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , unlike saudi arabia , women are commonly active in politics that goes back to what i said earlier : the index looks at gaps , not levels .
so we 're not worried about what is the overall level of resources in the philippines compared to that in the united kingdom .
what we do show is that relatively speaking , those resources are being divided more equitably in the philippines as compared to in the uk . … as to whether this is meaningful , it may not be - except to be a striking example of how this could be a priority for all countries , whether rich or poor . are the relative wealth or poverty of the 128 countries you include reflected in the study ? what we have done is divide rankings by income groups ; low income compared to low income countries , high income to high income . … we find that within each of these income groups there are countries that perform very well , and others that perform poorly . in the high income group , for example , sweden does extremely well , but saudi arabia does very poorly .
or in the lower and lower-middle group , there are countries like philippines and tanzania that do very well , but also countries like pakistan and yemen that do badly . it all goes a long way toward showing that gender equality is not a luxury good , and that it is something all countries can aspire towards . do most countries see gender equality as an ideal to be strived for ? that is one of the key messages we are trying to spread with this report .
clearly this is a human rights challenge , but it is also an economic challenge .
countries that are not capitalizing on half of their resource pool will be undermining their competitive potential in the long run .
this is definitely one of the key messages we highlight in this report . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is all hard statistics , which simply look at things such as labor force participation rates , or the number of women ministers , or literacy rates . all we have done is provide a framework that allows us to look at these hard facts in such a way that gives you an idea of where this country stands in terms of gap , compared to other countries in the world .
so yes , i think it does provide an accurate picture . why gather this information ?
who uses it ? we 've tried to make it something that is going to be useful for general awareness , and we believe the rankings will help do that .
but because we 've provided a lot of details , it is also a reference tool for international organizations and national governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education levels are compared in the study it has also become a catalyst for academic research .
quite a lot of academics contact us for details from the index , wondering about the connections between certain policies and their outcomes . germany ranked seventh overall this year , and scored relatively well in terms of economic participation .
but newspapers here are full of articles about glass ceilings , a stubborn wage gap , and social education practices that make it hard for mothers to re-enter the work force .
how does that add up ? in our study we look at the overall workplace participation rate .
in the global statistics , it appears germany is doing well in terms of labor force participation of women , whereas italy and france are not doing as well . how many women actually go back into the workplace after having children is n't something we include in the index .
but we do provide information on the length of paid maternity leave , which is 14 weeks in germany , and the maternity benefits , which is that the wages are 100 percent paid , partly by social security up to a certain level , and the rest by the employer . how meaningful is this kind of measurement ?
the philippines , where women 's situation is not usually thought of as being very good , was ranked sixth - right above germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , unlike saudi arabia , women are commonly active in politics that goes back to what i said earlier : the index looks at gaps , not levels .
so we 're not worried about what is the overall level of resources in the philippines compared to that in the united kingdom .
what we do show is that relatively speaking , those resources are being divided more equitably in the philippines as compared to in the uk . … as to whether this is meaningful , it may not be - except to be a striking example of how this could be a priority for all countries , whether rich or poor . are the relative wealth or poverty of the 128 countries you include reflected in the study ? what we have done is divide rankings by income groups ; low income compared to low income countries , high income to high income . … we find that within each of these income groups there are countries that perform very well , and others that perform poorly . in the high income group , for example , sweden does extremely well , but saudi arabia does very poorly .
or in the lower and lower-middle group , there are countries like philippines and tanzania that do very well , but also countries like pakistan and yemen that do badly . it all goes a long way toward showing that gender equality is not a luxury good , and that it is something all countries can aspire towards . do most countries see gender equality as an ideal to be strived for ? that is one of the key messages we are trying to spread with this report .
clearly this is a human rights challenge , but it is also an economic challenge .
countries that are not capitalizing on half of their resource pool will be undermining their competitive potential in the long run .
this is definitely one of the key messages we highlight in this report . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 .
germany took seventh place . according to the gender gap report , released by the world economic forum , germany successfully narrowed its gender gap from a year ago .
but because other countries made even greater progress , germany 's overall ranking dropped , from fifth place to seventh . the wef study measures international gender equality by looking at four key areas : women 's economic participation in society ; their levels of health and education ; and their political empowerment .
economist saadia zahidi , one of the authors of the report , noted that while germany 's lowest rating was in the area of economic participation , " its scores make it a high-ranking country compared to others , particularly in europe . " as in 2006 , the top-most ranks were swept by a brace of scandinavian nations .
but germany " is actually doing much better in comparison to other countries , especially countries like italy , france or malta , " which fell much lower down in the rankings overall , zahidi said . dw-world.de spoke with zahidi about the purpose , and potential pitfalls , of carrying out a sweeping gender study . dw-world.de : the concept of a gender gap report is a fairly new one .
can you explain its purpose ? saadia zahidi : the global gender gap index tries to examine the gap between women and men in various areas .
it is looking at gaps , rather than levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zahidi : " countries should capitalize on half their resources " for example having an index that tells a country like bangladesh that it has lower levels of education than sweden is not very useful , they already know that .
they 're a poor country .
what this index tries to answer is , for example , whether bangladesh has a bigger gap on education than a comparable country such as pakistan . everything we do is rewarding parity .
it is not rewarding women 's supremacy over men , or men 's supremacy over women .
it is rewarding countries that aim to distribute their resources equally between women and men . so how does one measure parity ? a key feature of the index is that it has a fixed scale , with " zero " being inequality , and " one " being equality .
a score of 0.75 can be approximately interpreted as meaning , 75 percent of the gap in that country has been closed .
it is all relative to a benchmark , which is the number " one . "
it allows us to track the changes over time . statistical data is notoriously slippery .
do you think your report gives an accurate picture of the state of gender equality in the world ? the report is actually based on 14 different variables , 13 of which come from hard data sources , like the united nations development program , the international labor organization and the world health organization .

's original sceptical friend just after french president nicolas sarkozy flies out of the us , german chancellor angela merkel flies in .
both european leaders have sought to improve their ties with the us , but the trio does n't agree on everything . dw-radio spoke with john hulsman , an alfred von oppenheim scholar in residence at the german council on foreign relations in berlin . dw-radio : a lot has been said about how nicolas sarkozy in france and angela merkel in germany have turned around their relationships with the us since the iraq invasion .
how aligned is europe now with washington on international issues ? john hulsman : the fascinating thing about the big three , and i 'd throw the united kingdom in there as well , is that they are all coming to a similar position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could merkel , sarkozy and brown usher in a new era of eu-us relations ?
mr. sarkozy looked at the chirac presidency and saw that france had absolutely no stake in the middle east after opposing the americans over iraq .
that he was , in effect , too far away from america to be a major decision player - and that 's one thing french presidents , regardless of their politics , all want to be .
so he needs to move closer to america to matter . gordon brown has the opposite problem .
tony blair moved too close to president bush and it ruined his premiership , so gordon brown moved slightly away from the united states , while retaining close ties . and they both row to an island where they find angela merkel who staked out this position of " skeptical friendship " ahead of time .
which is that of course we support america .
of course america 's an ally , and we share values but that does n't mean we 're your lapdog and we 're going to agree with you issue after issue . german chancellor angela merkel arrives in the us on friday .
do you think she ’ ll receive a warm a welcome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush share a mutual respect for each other yes , president bush thinks extremely highly of chancellor merkel .
she 's proven to be not flamboyant , not showy but to get the job done diplomatically behind closed doors .
again -lsb- she has -rsb- this kind of european view of skeptical friendship .
that we need the united states , we must work with them but that we 're not going to be their lapdog .
this is really her invention . the atmospherics after chancellor schröder were awful , and chancellor merkel entered very clear and in a straight way by saying that america remains a great ally of germany but that does n't mean she 's in favor of guantanamo bay , renditions , torture , etc . what will chancellor merkel be talking about in her discussions with president bush ? it 's a number of issues that i do n't think grab attention but really matter .
for instance , her plans to free up currency flows between europe and the united states by talking about common regulations .
this is an issue that will take years - if not decades - to negotiate but will actually help both european and american economies immensely .
in the absence of a free trade deal this may be the closest we can get to actually improving cooperation between our two huge and important economies . certainly the other issue will be chancellor merkel 's signature issue , which is climate change .
can we reach some sort of post-kyoto protocol ?
this again is going to take a very long time and probably wo n't be decided until president bush has a successor .
but she has moved the president to say things like " actually climate change is a problem , " and that was a huge change from when president bush came into office .

's original sceptical friend just after french president nicolas sarkozy flies out of the us , german chancellor angela merkel flies in .
both european leaders have sought to improve their ties with the us , but the trio does n't agree on everything . dw-radio spoke with john hulsman , an alfred von oppenheim scholar in residence at the german council on foreign relations in berlin . dw-radio : a lot has been said about how nicolas sarkozy in france and angela merkel in germany have turned around their relationships with the us since the iraq invasion .
how aligned is europe now with washington on international issues ? john hulsman : the fascinating thing about the big three , and i 'd throw the united kingdom in there as well , is that they are all coming to a similar position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could merkel , sarkozy and brown usher in a new era of eu-us relations ?
mr. sarkozy looked at the chirac presidency and saw that france had absolutely no stake in the middle east after opposing the americans over iraq .
that he was , in effect , too far away from america to be a major decision player - and that 's one thing french presidents , regardless of their politics , all want to be .
so he needs to move closer to america to matter . gordon brown has the opposite problem .
tony blair moved too close to president bush and it ruined his premiership , so gordon brown moved slightly away from the united states , while retaining close ties . and they both row to an island where they find angela merkel who staked out this position of " skeptical friendship " ahead of time .
which is that of course we support america .
of course america 's an ally , and we share values but that does n't mean we 're your lapdog and we 're going to agree with you issue after issue . german chancellor angela merkel arrives in the us on friday .
do you think she ’ ll receive a warm a welcome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush share a mutual respect for each other yes , president bush thinks extremely highly of chancellor merkel .
she 's proven to be not flamboyant , not showy but to get the job done diplomatically behind closed doors .
again -lsb- she has -rsb- this kind of european view of skeptical friendship .
that we need the united states , we must work with them but that we 're not going to be their lapdog .
this is really her invention . the atmospherics after chancellor schröder were awful , and chancellor merkel entered very clear and in a straight way by saying that america remains a great ally of germany but that does n't mean she 's in favor of guantanamo bay , renditions , torture , etc . what will chancellor merkel be talking about in her discussions with president bush ? it 's a number of issues that i do n't think grab attention but really matter .
for instance , her plans to free up currency flows between europe and the united states by talking about common regulations .
this is an issue that will take years - if not decades - to negotiate but will actually help both european and american economies immensely .
in the absence of a free trade deal this may be the closest we can get to actually improving cooperation between our two huge and important economies . certainly the other issue will be chancellor merkel 's signature issue , which is climate change .
can we reach some sort of post-kyoto protocol ?
this again is going to take a very long time and probably wo n't be decided until president bush has a successor .
but she has moved the president to say things like " actually climate change is a problem , " and that was a huge change from when president bush came into office .
that 's entirely due to chancellor angela merkel chipping away at him from outside and -lsb- california -rsb- governor arnold schwarzenegger chipping away at president bush from within the country . interview : nathan wiktop -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 08.11.2007 no sap spilt as peace breaks out in apfelwein war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tanks were called back from the belgian border after apfelwein was saved people go to war over many things ; religion , land , resources .
many times , the reason is long forgotten in the horror which follows .
luckily , no one will have to face the shame of one breaking out over apple wine . it was set to be the biggest battle over eu designations since the infamous champagne war of 2005 and the equally distressing feta incident of 2002 .
but , somewhat ironically considering the nature of the dispute in the first place , common sense has prevailed to end the apfelwein rebellion of 2007 before any sap was spilt . the german campaign , led by hesse premier roland koch with support from federal agriculture minister horst seehofer , was ready to storm the gates of the eurocrat fortresses in brussels to fight for the right to have the traditional cider-like brew recognized as a wine . the eu claimed that the regional drink fell foul of a proposal from the european commission to use the term " wine " purely for grape products . koch and seehofer target euro madness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch : " madness " an outraged koch vehemently defended his state 's brew and the drums of conflict began to sound . " we will not allow our traditional name to be sacrificed to regulatory madness in brussels , " koch ranted earlier this week .
" we will fight with all the means at our disposal for our apple wine . " seehofer , obviously seeing the worth in throwing his federal weight behind such an affront to german tradition , joined what he called a " justified " cause . " the minister definitely wants to save the terms apfelwein and obstwein -lsb- fruit wine -rsb- , while it should be made clear to consumers that these are not grape products , " seehofer bravely stated - through a spokesperson - to a gaggle of unpatriotic reporters . anyone who has found the sour tasting regional icon to be unpalatable may appreciate the german efforts out of principle alone .
apfelwein , which is also known under various other terms like " ebbelwoi " and " apfelmost , " is seen as an oddity in the rest of the country and those who have no love of its taste would struggle to defend it . devastation averted eu peacemakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt was awash with apfelwein as peace broke out but this fight was about the name and not the taste .
thankfully , for once at least , the european commission saw sense .
apfelwein , it was announced on tuesday , will remain a wine after all . " in the context of the negotiations on the wine reform we will find a solution to allow apfelwein and other fruit and berry wines to continue to be marketed as they are now - namely as fruit wines , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said in a statement that will surely be quoted when she picks up her future nobel peace prize for averting the conflict . " contrary to what i have read in the newspapers over recent days , it was never our intention to stop the production of these products , " she said , adding that germany and brussels would work for a compromise at a meeting of farm ministers in december . reports suggest that the state of emergency in hesse has since been scaled back . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many times , the reason is long forgotten in the horror which follows .
luckily , no one will have to face the shame of one breaking out over apple wine . it was set to be the biggest battle over eu designations since the infamous champagne war of 2005 and the equally distressing feta incident of 2002 .
but , somewhat ironically considering the nature of the dispute in the first place , common sense has prevailed to end the apfelwein rebellion of 2007 before any sap was spilt . the german campaign , led by hesse premier roland koch with support from federal agriculture minister horst seehofer , was ready to storm the gates of the eurocrat fortresses in brussels to fight for the right to have the traditional cider-like brew recognized as a wine . the eu claimed that the regional drink fell foul of a proposal from the european commission to use the term " wine " purely for grape products . koch and seehofer target euro madness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch : " madness " an outraged koch vehemently defended his state 's brew and the drums of conflict began to sound . " we will not allow our traditional name to be sacrificed to regulatory madness in brussels , " koch ranted earlier this week .
" we will fight with all the means at our disposal for our apple wine . " seehofer , obviously seeing the worth in throwing his federal weight behind such an affront to german tradition , joined what he called a " justified " cause . " the minister definitely wants to save the terms apfelwein and obstwein -lsb- fruit wine -rsb- , while it should be made clear to consumers that these are not grape products , " seehofer bravely stated - through a spokesperson - to a gaggle of unpatriotic reporters . anyone who has found the sour tasting regional icon to be unpalatable may appreciate the german efforts out of principle alone .
apfelwein , which is also known under various other terms like " ebbelwoi " and " apfelmost , " is seen as an oddity in the rest of the country and those who have no love of its taste would struggle to defend it . devastation averted eu peacemakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt was awash with apfelwein as peace broke out but this fight was about the name and not the taste .
thankfully , for once at least , the european commission saw sense .
apfelwein , it was announced on tuesday , will remain a wine after all . " in the context of the negotiations on the wine reform we will find a solution to allow apfelwein and other fruit and berry wines to continue to be marketed as they are now - namely as fruit wines , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said in a statement that will surely be quoted when she picks up her future nobel peace prize for averting the conflict . " contrary to what i have read in the newspapers over recent days , it was never our intention to stop the production of these products , " she said , adding that germany and brussels would work for a compromise at a meeting of farm ministers in december . reports suggest that the state of emergency in hesse has since been scaled back . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when his coalition partner , the green party , dug its heels in , schröder resorted to a vote of confidence in the german parliament to force the bundestag 's pacifist members to swallow a bundeswehr dispatch to afghanistan - and won by a narrow margin . back then , germany offered almost 4,000 troops to help out the americans in their fight against al qaeda and its allies , primarily in afghanistan .

this has yet to happen . according to the bundestag mandate , elite german special forces -lrb- ksk -rrb- have been deployed to afghanistan .
to this day , the precise nature of their mission is still a secret - for reasons of security , says berlin . all this mystery makes it almost impossible to assess germany 's participation in oef .
one member of parliament recently complained that the bundestag is denied information , while the government insists it has no information to share on operation enduring freedom .
for the last six years , berlin has maintained unreserved loyalty to the undertaking , despite the fact that washington apparently provides military updates only sporadically .
the number of civilian lives claimed in afghanistan is also information that tends to be swept under the carpet . but facts are all there is to go on .

past experience suggests that the german frigates do little to deter potential terrorists .

8 , that an internal probe had uncovered questionable transactions totaling 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- - nearly three times the amount previously estimated . earlier reports put the estimated amount linked to the scandal at 449 million euros and said the corruption was limited to the electronics giant 's former communications branch .
the new sum , however , is said to include other siemens division as well . siemens has already dismissed 140 employees and an additional 330 have received penalties of other kinds , ceo peter löscher said thursday . " we are glad that we have taken another important step in clearing up the past , " he said .
" we have to do business as well and as cleanly as we can . " external auditors had found questionable sums totaling more than 1 billion euros in august , but siemens refused to comment at that time , saying their internal probe was still underway . most of the money is reported to have disappeared into secret bank accounts for use as bribes in securing contracts outside germany , the munich-based conglomerate said . revenues rise despite scandal stress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo peter löscher presented his company 's progress report in munich the company 's confession coincided with the release of a relatively bright quarterly report on thursday . revenue grew by 9 percent to 20.2 billion euros while operating profits rose 166 percent in the last quarter of the 2006-2007 fiscal year , which ended on sept .
30 , siemens said in a statement .
growth was particularly strong in the asia-pacific regions . at the same time , however , the group posted a net loss of 74 million euros , compared to the same period last year .
the loss can be attributed to 1 billion euros in taxes on the sale of its vds subsidiary to the continental automotive group as well 201 million euros in fines in connection with the bribery scandal . löscher is also scheduled to meets with officials from the us securities and exchange commission .
the wall street watchdog may also impose hefty finds on the company , which is listed on the new york stock exchange as well as in frankfurt . investors , however , seemed pleased with the company 's transparency .

's original sceptical friend just after french president nicolas sarkozy flies out of the us , german chancellor angela merkel flies in .
both european leaders have sought to improve their ties with the us , but the trio does n't agree on everything . dw-radio spoke with john hulsman , an alfred von oppenheim scholar in residence at the german council on foreign relations in berlin . dw-radio : a lot has been said about how nicolas sarkozy in france and angela merkel in germany have turned around their relationships with the us since the iraq invasion .
how aligned is europe now with washington on international issues ? john hulsman : the fascinating thing about the big three , and i 'd throw the united kingdom in there as well , is that they are all coming to a similar position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could merkel , sarkozy and brown usher in a new era of eu-us relations ?
mr. sarkozy looked at the chirac presidency and saw that france had absolutely no stake in the middle east after opposing the americans over iraq .
that he was , in effect , too far away from america to be a major decision player - and that 's one thing french presidents , regardless of their politics , all want to be .
so he needs to move closer to america to matter . gordon brown has the opposite problem .
tony blair moved too close to president bush and it ruined his premiership , so gordon brown moved slightly away from the united states , while retaining close ties . and they both row to an island where they find angela merkel who staked out this position of " skeptical friendship " ahead of time .
which is that of course we support america .
of course america 's an ally , and we share values but that does n't mean we 're your lapdog and we 're going to agree with you issue after issue . german chancellor angela merkel arrives in the us on friday .
do you think she ’ ll receive a warm a welcome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush share a mutual respect for each other yes , president bush thinks extremely highly of chancellor merkel .
she 's proven to be not flamboyant , not showy but to get the job done diplomatically behind closed doors .
again -lsb- she has -rsb- this kind of european view of skeptical friendship .
that we need the united states , we must work with them but that we 're not going to be their lapdog .
this is really her invention . the atmospherics after chancellor schröder were awful , and chancellor merkel entered very clear and in a straight way by saying that america remains a great ally of germany but that does n't mean she 's in favor of guantanamo bay , renditions , torture , etc . what will chancellor merkel be talking about in her discussions with president bush ? it 's a number of issues that i do n't think grab attention but really matter .
for instance , her plans to free up currency flows between europe and the united states by talking about common regulations .
this is an issue that will take years - if not decades - to negotiate but will actually help both european and american economies immensely .
in the absence of a free trade deal this may be the closest we can get to actually improving cooperation between our two huge and important economies . certainly the other issue will be chancellor merkel 's signature issue , which is climate change .
can we reach some sort of post-kyoto protocol ?
this again is going to take a very long time and probably wo n't be decided until president bush has a successor .
but she has moved the president to say things like " actually climate change is a problem , " and that was a huge change from when president bush came into office .

mr. sarkozy looked at the chirac presidency and saw that france had absolutely no stake in the middle east after opposing the americans over iraq .
that he was , in effect , too far away from america to be a major decision player - and that 's one thing french presidents , regardless of their politics , all want to be .
so he needs to move closer to america to matter . gordon brown has the opposite problem .
tony blair moved too close to president bush and it ruined his premiership , so gordon brown moved slightly away from the united states , while retaining close ties . and they both row to an island where they find angela merkel who staked out this position of " skeptical friendship " ahead of time .
which is that of course we support america .
of course america 's an ally , and we share values but that does n't mean we 're your lapdog and we 're going to agree with you issue after issue . german chancellor angela merkel arrives in the us on friday .

she 's proven to be not flamboyant , not showy but to get the job done diplomatically behind closed doors .
again -lsb- she has -rsb- this kind of european view of skeptical friendship .
that we need the united states , we must work with them but that we 're not going to be their lapdog .
this is really her invention . the atmospherics after chancellor schröder were awful , and chancellor merkel entered very clear and in a straight way by saying that america remains a great ally of germany but that does n't mean she 's in favor of guantanamo bay , renditions , torture , etc . what will chancellor merkel be talking about in her discussions with president bush ? it 's a number of issues that i do n't think grab attention but really matter .
for instance , her plans to free up currency flows between europe and the united states by talking about common regulations .
this is an issue that will take years - if not decades - to negotiate but will actually help both european and american economies immensely .
in the absence of a free trade deal this may be the closest we can get to actually improving cooperation between our two huge and important economies . certainly the other issue will be chancellor merkel 's signature issue , which is climate change .
can we reach some sort of post-kyoto protocol ?

" one can be certain that the government will take a very strong pro-european direction , and european relations will be intensified , " tusk said after the meeting .

some experts fear there are already signs of imminent clashes with the new government . as leader of the law and justice party , jaroslaw kaczynski was frequently at odds with other members of the 27-nation eu bloc . tusk has accused the kaczynski twins of damaging relations with major international partners and of isolating poland from the rest of europe . the outgoing government was widely seen in europe as a troublemaker , blocking talks on a new partnership agreement with moscow in 2005 and alluding to world war ii during negotiations on the new eu reform treaty . good for brussels , bad for washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-polish ties have been strained of late tusk and barroso did not reveal whether they had discussed the european treaty or the charter of fundamental rights , reuters reported . the kaczynskis rejected adoption of the charter , saying it could violate poland 's christian-oriented value system . outgoing foreign minister anna fotyga said adopting the charter would pave the way for gay marriage and euthanasia , both strongly opposed by predominantly catholic poles . meanwhile , some observers predicted that poland 's pro-european course may cost the country its friendship with washington .
they pointed out that disagreement was likely over the us plan to place an anti-missile shield in poland .

8 .
germany took seventh place . according to the gender gap report , released by the world economic forum , germany successfully narrowed its gender gap from a year ago .
but because other countries made even greater progress , germany 's overall ranking dropped , from fifth place to seventh . the wef study measures international gender equality by looking at four key areas : women 's economic participation in society ; their levels of health and education ; and their political empowerment .
economist saadia zahidi , one of the authors of the report , noted that while germany 's lowest rating was in the area of economic participation , " its scores make it a high-ranking country compared to others , particularly in europe . " as in 2006 , the top-most ranks were swept by a brace of scandinavian nations .
but germany " is actually doing much better in comparison to other countries , especially countries like italy , france or malta , " which fell much lower down in the rankings overall , zahidi said . dw-world.de spoke with zahidi about the purpose , and potential pitfalls , of carrying out a sweeping gender study . dw-world.de : the concept of a gender gap report is a fairly new one .
can you explain its purpose ? saadia zahidi : the global gender gap index tries to examine the gap between women and men in various areas .
it is looking at gaps , rather than levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zahidi : " countries should capitalize on half their resources " for example having an index that tells a country like bangladesh that it has lower levels of education than sweden is not very useful , they already know that .
they 're a poor country .
what this index tries to answer is , for example , whether bangladesh has a bigger gap on education than a comparable country such as pakistan . everything we do is rewarding parity .
it is not rewarding women 's supremacy over men , or men 's supremacy over women .
it is rewarding countries that aim to distribute their resources equally between women and men . so how does one measure parity ? a key feature of the index is that it has a fixed scale , with " zero " being inequality , and " one " being equality .
a score of 0.75 can be approximately interpreted as meaning , 75 percent of the gap in that country has been closed .
it is all relative to a benchmark , which is the number " one . "
it allows us to track the changes over time . statistical data is notoriously slippery .
do you think your report gives an accurate picture of the state of gender equality in the world ? the report is actually based on 14 different variables , 13 of which come from hard data sources , like the united nations development program , the international labor organization and the world health organization .
this is all hard statistics , which simply look at things such as labor force participation rates , or the number of women ministers , or literacy rates . all we have done is provide a framework that allows us to look at these hard facts in such a way that gives you an idea of where this country stands in terms of gap , compared to other countries in the world .
so yes , i think it does provide an accurate picture . why gather this information ?
who uses it ? we 've tried to make it something that is going to be useful for general awareness , and we believe the rankings will help do that .
but because we 've provided a lot of details , it is also a reference tool for international organizations and national governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education levels are compared in the study it has also become a catalyst for academic research .
quite a lot of academics contact us for details from the index , wondering about the connections between certain policies and their outcomes . germany ranked seventh overall this year , and scored relatively well in terms of economic participation .
but newspapers here are full of articles about glass ceilings , a stubborn wage gap , and social education practices that make it hard for mothers to re-enter the work force .
how does that add up ? in our study we look at the overall workplace participation rate .
in the global statistics , it appears germany is doing well in terms of labor force participation of women , whereas italy and france are not doing as well . how many women actually go back into the workplace after having children is n't something we include in the index .
but we do provide information on the length of paid maternity leave , which is 14 weeks in germany , and the maternity benefits , which is that the wages are 100 percent paid , partly by social security up to a certain level , and the rest by the employer . how meaningful is this kind of measurement ?
the philippines , where women 's situation is not usually thought of as being very good , was ranked sixth - right above germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , unlike saudi arabia , women are commonly active in politics that goes back to what i said earlier : the index looks at gaps , not levels .
so we 're not worried about what is the overall level of resources in the philippines compared to that in the united kingdom .
what we do show is that relatively speaking , those resources are being divided more equitably in the philippines as compared to in the uk . … as to whether this is meaningful , it may not be - except to be a striking example of how this could be a priority for all countries , whether rich or poor . are the relative wealth or poverty of the 128 countries you include reflected in the study ? what we have done is divide rankings by income groups ; low income compared to low income countries , high income to high income . … we find that within each of these income groups there are countries that perform very well , and others that perform poorly . in the high income group , for example , sweden does extremely well , but saudi arabia does very poorly .
or in the lower and lower-middle group , there are countries like philippines and tanzania that do very well , but also countries like pakistan and yemen that do badly . it all goes a long way toward showing that gender equality is not a luxury good , and that it is something all countries can aspire towards . do most countries see gender equality as an ideal to be strived for ? that is one of the key messages we are trying to spread with this report .
clearly this is a human rights challenge , but it is also an economic challenge .
countries that are not capitalizing on half of their resource pool will be undermining their competitive potential in the long run .
this is definitely one of the key messages we highlight in this report . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 .
germany took seventh place . according to the gender gap report , released by the world economic forum , germany successfully narrowed its gender gap from a year ago .
but because other countries made even greater progress , germany 's overall ranking dropped , from fifth place to seventh . the wef study measures international gender equality by looking at four key areas : women 's economic participation in society ; their levels of health and education ; and their political empowerment .
economist saadia zahidi , one of the authors of the report , noted that while germany 's lowest rating was in the area of economic participation , " its scores make it a high-ranking country compared to others , particularly in europe . " as in 2006 , the top-most ranks were swept by a brace of scandinavian nations .
but germany " is actually doing much better in comparison to other countries , especially countries like italy , france or malta , " which fell much lower down in the rankings overall , zahidi said . dw-world.de spoke with zahidi about the purpose , and potential pitfalls , of carrying out a sweeping gender study . dw-world.de : the concept of a gender gap report is a fairly new one .
can you explain its purpose ? saadia zahidi : the global gender gap index tries to examine the gap between women and men in various areas .
it is looking at gaps , rather than levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zahidi : " countries should capitalize on half their resources " for example having an index that tells a country like bangladesh that it has lower levels of education than sweden is not very useful , they already know that .
they 're a poor country .
what this index tries to answer is , for example , whether bangladesh has a bigger gap on education than a comparable country such as pakistan . everything we do is rewarding parity .
it is not rewarding women 's supremacy over men , or men 's supremacy over women .
it is rewarding countries that aim to distribute their resources equally between women and men . so how does one measure parity ? a key feature of the index is that it has a fixed scale , with " zero " being inequality , and " one " being equality .
a score of 0.75 can be approximately interpreted as meaning , 75 percent of the gap in that country has been closed .
it is all relative to a benchmark , which is the number " one . "
it allows us to track the changes over time . statistical data is notoriously slippery .
do you think your report gives an accurate picture of the state of gender equality in the world ? the report is actually based on 14 different variables , 13 of which come from hard data sources , like the united nations development program , the international labor organization and the world health organization .
this is all hard statistics , which simply look at things such as labor force participation rates , or the number of women ministers , or literacy rates . all we have done is provide a framework that allows us to look at these hard facts in such a way that gives you an idea of where this country stands in terms of gap , compared to other countries in the world .
so yes , i think it does provide an accurate picture . why gather this information ?
who uses it ? we 've tried to make it something that is going to be useful for general awareness , and we believe the rankings will help do that .
but because we 've provided a lot of details , it is also a reference tool for international organizations and national governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education levels are compared in the study it has also become a catalyst for academic research .
quite a lot of academics contact us for details from the index , wondering about the connections between certain policies and their outcomes . germany ranked seventh overall this year , and scored relatively well in terms of economic participation .
but newspapers here are full of articles about glass ceilings , a stubborn wage gap , and social education practices that make it hard for mothers to re-enter the work force .
how does that add up ? in our study we look at the overall workplace participation rate .
in the global statistics , it appears germany is doing well in terms of labor force participation of women , whereas italy and france are not doing as well . how many women actually go back into the workplace after having children is n't something we include in the index .
but we do provide information on the length of paid maternity leave , which is 14 weeks in germany , and the maternity benefits , which is that the wages are 100 percent paid , partly by social security up to a certain level , and the rest by the employer . how meaningful is this kind of measurement ?
the philippines , where women 's situation is not usually thought of as being very good , was ranked sixth - right above germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , unlike saudi arabia , women are commonly active in politics that goes back to what i said earlier : the index looks at gaps , not levels .
so we 're not worried about what is the overall level of resources in the philippines compared to that in the united kingdom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 08.11.2007 expert calls gender gap a human rights challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study examined women 's empowerment the world economic forum published the results of its gender gap report , measuring the level of gender parity in 128 countries , on thursday , nov .
8 .
germany took seventh place . according to the gender gap report , released by the world economic forum , germany successfully narrowed its gender gap from a year ago .
but because other countries made even greater progress , germany 's overall ranking dropped , from fifth place to seventh . the wef study measures international gender equality by looking at four key areas : women 's economic participation in society ; their levels of health and education ; and their political empowerment .
economist saadia zahidi , one of the authors of the report , noted that while germany 's lowest rating was in the area of economic participation , " its scores make it a high-ranking country compared to others , particularly in europe . " as in 2006 , the top-most ranks were swept by a brace of scandinavian nations .
but germany " is actually doing much better in comparison to other countries , especially countries like italy , france or malta , " which fell much lower down in the rankings overall , zahidi said . dw-world.de spoke with zahidi about the purpose , and potential pitfalls , of carrying out a sweeping gender study . dw-world.de : the concept of a gender gap report is a fairly new one .
can you explain its purpose ? saadia zahidi : the global gender gap index tries to examine the gap between women and men in various areas .
it is looking at gaps , rather than levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zahidi : " countries should capitalize on half their resources " for example having an index that tells a country like bangladesh that it has lower levels of education than sweden is not very useful , they already know that .
they 're a poor country .
what this index tries to answer is , for example , whether bangladesh has a bigger gap on education than a comparable country such as pakistan . everything we do is rewarding parity .
it is not rewarding women 's supremacy over men , or men 's supremacy over women .
it is rewarding countries that aim to distribute their resources equally between women and men . so how does one measure parity ? a key feature of the index is that it has a fixed scale , with " zero " being inequality , and " one " being equality .
a score of 0.75 can be approximately interpreted as meaning , 75 percent of the gap in that country has been closed .
it is all relative to a benchmark , which is the number " one . "
it allows us to track the changes over time . statistical data is notoriously slippery .
do you think your report gives an accurate picture of the state of gender equality in the world ? the report is actually based on 14 different variables , 13 of which come from hard data sources , like the united nations development program , the international labor organization and the world health organization .
this is all hard statistics , which simply look at things such as labor force participation rates , or the number of women ministers , or literacy rates . all we have done is provide a framework that allows us to look at these hard facts in such a way that gives you an idea of where this country stands in terms of gap , compared to other countries in the world .
so yes , i think it does provide an accurate picture . why gather this information ?
who uses it ? we 've tried to make it something that is going to be useful for general awareness , and we believe the rankings will help do that .
but because we 've provided a lot of details , it is also a reference tool for international organizations and national governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education levels are compared in the study it has also become a catalyst for academic research .
quite a lot of academics contact us for details from the index , wondering about the connections between certain policies and their outcomes . germany ranked seventh overall this year , and scored relatively well in terms of economic participation .
but newspapers here are full of articles about glass ceilings , a stubborn wage gap , and social education practices that make it hard for mothers to re-enter the work force .
how does that add up ? in our study we look at the overall workplace participation rate .
in the global statistics , it appears germany is doing well in terms of labor force participation of women , whereas italy and france are not doing as well . how many women actually go back into the workplace after having children is n't something we include in the index .
but we do provide information on the length of paid maternity leave , which is 14 weeks in germany , and the maternity benefits , which is that the wages are 100 percent paid , partly by social security up to a certain level , and the rest by the employer . how meaningful is this kind of measurement ?
the philippines , where women 's situation is not usually thought of as being very good , was ranked sixth - right above germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , unlike saudi arabia , women are commonly active in politics that goes back to what i said earlier : the index looks at gaps , not levels .
so we 're not worried about what is the overall level of resources in the philippines compared to that in the united kingdom .
what we do show is that relatively speaking , those resources are being divided more equitably in the philippines as compared to in the uk . … as to whether this is meaningful , it may not be - except to be a striking example of how this could be a priority for all countries , whether rich or poor . are the relative wealth or poverty of the 128 countries you include reflected in the study ? what we have done is divide rankings by income groups ; low income compared to low income countries , high income to high income . … we find that within each of these income groups there are countries that perform very well , and others that perform poorly . in the high income group , for example , sweden does extremely well , but saudi arabia does very poorly .
or in the lower and lower-middle group , there are countries like philippines and tanzania that do very well , but also countries like pakistan and yemen that do badly . it all goes a long way toward showing that gender equality is not a luxury good , and that it is something all countries can aspire towards . do most countries see gender equality as an ideal to be strived for ? that is one of the key messages we are trying to spread with this report .
clearly this is a human rights challenge , but it is also an economic challenge .
countries that are not capitalizing on half of their resource pool will be undermining their competitive potential in the long run .
this is definitely one of the key messages we highlight in this report . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , that an internal probe had uncovered questionable transactions totaling 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- - nearly three times the amount previously estimated . earlier reports put the estimated amount linked to the scandal at 449 million euros and said the corruption was limited to the electronics giant 's former communications branch .
the new sum , however , is said to include other siemens division as well . siemens has already dismissed 140 employees and an additional 330 have received penalties of other kinds , ceo peter löscher said thursday . " we are glad that we have taken another important step in clearing up the past , " he said .
" we have to do business as well and as cleanly as we can . " external auditors had found questionable sums totaling more than 1 billion euros in august , but siemens refused to comment at that time , saying their internal probe was still underway . most of the money is reported to have disappeared into secret bank accounts for use as bribes in securing contracts outside germany , the munich-based conglomerate said . revenues rise despite scandal stress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo peter löscher presented his company 's progress report in munich the company 's confession coincided with the release of a relatively bright quarterly report on thursday . revenue grew by 9 percent to 20.2 billion euros while operating profits rose 166 percent in the last quarter of the 2006-2007 fiscal year , which ended on sept .
30 , siemens said in a statement .
growth was particularly strong in the asia-pacific regions . at the same time , however , the group posted a net loss of 74 million euros , compared to the same period last year .
the loss can be attributed to 1 billion euros in taxes on the sale of its vds subsidiary to the continental automotive group as well 201 million euros in fines in connection with the bribery scandal . löscher is also scheduled to meets with officials from the us securities and exchange commission .
the wall street watchdog may also impose hefty finds on the company , which is listed on the new york stock exchange as well as in frankfurt . investors , however , seemed pleased with the company 's transparency .

's original sceptical friend just after french president nicolas sarkozy flies out of the us , german chancellor angela merkel flies in .
both european leaders have sought to improve their ties with the us , but the trio does n't agree on everything . dw-radio spoke with john hulsman , an alfred von oppenheim scholar in residence at the german council on foreign relations in berlin . dw-radio : a lot has been said about how nicolas sarkozy in france and angela merkel in germany have turned around their relationships with the us since the iraq invasion .
how aligned is europe now with washington on international issues ? john hulsman : the fascinating thing about the big three , and i 'd throw the united kingdom in there as well , is that they are all coming to a similar position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could merkel , sarkozy and brown usher in a new era of eu-us relations ?
mr. sarkozy looked at the chirac presidency and saw that france had absolutely no stake in the middle east after opposing the americans over iraq .
that he was , in effect , too far away from america to be a major decision player - and that 's one thing french presidents , regardless of their politics , all want to be .
so he needs to move closer to america to matter . gordon brown has the opposite problem .
tony blair moved too close to president bush and it ruined his premiership , so gordon brown moved slightly away from the united states , while retaining close ties . and they both row to an island where they find angela merkel who staked out this position of " skeptical friendship " ahead of time .
which is that of course we support america .
of course america 's an ally , and we share values but that does n't mean we 're your lapdog and we 're going to agree with you issue after issue . german chancellor angela merkel arrives in the us on friday .
do you think she ’ ll receive a warm a welcome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush share a mutual respect for each other yes , president bush thinks extremely highly of chancellor merkel .
she 's proven to be not flamboyant , not showy but to get the job done diplomatically behind closed doors .
again -lsb- she has -rsb- this kind of european view of skeptical friendship .
that we need the united states , we must work with them but that we 're not going to be their lapdog .
this is really her invention . the atmospherics after chancellor schröder were awful , and chancellor merkel entered very clear and in a straight way by saying that america remains a great ally of germany but that does n't mean she 's in favor of guantanamo bay , renditions , torture , etc . what will chancellor merkel be talking about in her discussions with president bush ? it 's a number of issues that i do n't think grab attention but really matter .
for instance , her plans to free up currency flows between europe and the united states by talking about common regulations .
this is an issue that will take years - if not decades - to negotiate but will actually help both european and american economies immensely .
in the absence of a free trade deal this may be the closest we can get to actually improving cooperation between our two huge and important economies . certainly the other issue will be chancellor merkel 's signature issue , which is climate change .
can we reach some sort of post-kyoto protocol ?
this again is going to take a very long time and probably wo n't be decided until president bush has a successor .
but she has moved the president to say things like " actually climate change is a problem , " and that was a huge change from when president bush came into office .
that 's entirely due to chancellor angela merkel chipping away at him from outside and -lsb- california -rsb- governor arnold schwarzenegger chipping away at president bush from within the country . interview : nathan wiktop -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the wake of the sept .
11 attacks , then chancellor gerhard schröder pledged the us unconditional solidarity and military support in its war on terror .
when his coalition partner , the green party , dug its heels in , schröder resorted to a vote of confidence in the german parliament to force the bundestag 's pacifist members to swallow a bundeswehr dispatch to afghanistan - and won by a narrow margin . back then , germany offered almost 4,000 troops to help out the americans in their fight against al qaeda and its allies , primarily in afghanistan .
unlike the isaf mission , which is mandated by united nations security council resolutions , operation enduring freedom is based on the us right to self-defense against terrorism - which is , granted , recognized by the security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nina werkhäuser nonetheless , six years since the launch of this mission , it is time to ask how long the right to self-defense remains a legitimate argument .
if the us is prepared to maintain its war on terror indefinitely , then the german role in the conflict needs to be defined once and for all .
this has yet to happen . according to the bundestag mandate , elite german special forces -lrb- ksk -rrb- have been deployed to afghanistan .
to this day , the precise nature of their mission is still a secret - for reasons of security , says berlin . all this mystery makes it almost impossible to assess germany 's participation in oef .
one member of parliament recently complained that the bundestag is denied information , while the government insists it has no information to share on operation enduring freedom .
for the last six years , berlin has maintained unreserved loyalty to the undertaking , despite the fact that washington apparently provides military updates only sporadically .
the number of civilian lives claimed in afghanistan is also information that tends to be swept under the carpet . but facts are all there is to go on .
ksk forces have not been in afghanistan since germany 's change of government two years ago . the country 's current contribution to oef is 250 marines stationed on the horn of africa , which still cost berlin some 65 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- this year alone .
past experience suggests that the german frigates do little to deter potential terrorists .
so why is berlin still faithful to operation enduring freedom ? berlin 's argument that it is unwilling to leave its allies in the lurch is a specious one .
more to the point , it is unwilling to anger washington .

" the minister definitely wants to save the terms apfelwein and obstwein -lsb- fruit wine -rsb- , while it should be made clear to consumers that these are not grape products , " seehofer bravely stated - through a spokesperson - to a gaggle of unpatriotic reporters . anyone who has found the sour tasting regional icon to be unpalatable may appreciate the german efforts out of principle alone .

but , somewhat ironically considering the nature of the dispute in the first place , common sense has prevailed to end the apfelwein rebellion of 2007 before any sap was spilt . the german campaign , led by hesse premier roland koch with support from federal agriculture minister horst seehofer , was ready to storm the gates of the eurocrat fortresses in brussels to fight for the right to have the traditional cider-like brew recognized as a wine . the eu claimed that the regional drink fell foul of a proposal from the european commission to use the term " wine " purely for grape products . koch and seehofer target euro madness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch : " madness " an outraged koch vehemently defended his state 's brew and the drums of conflict began to sound . " we will not allow our traditional name to be sacrificed to regulatory madness in brussels , " koch ranted earlier this week .
" we will fight with all the means at our disposal for our apple wine . " seehofer , obviously seeing the worth in throwing his federal weight behind such an affront to german tradition , joined what he called a " justified " cause . " the minister definitely wants to save the terms apfelwein and obstwein -lsb- fruit wine -rsb- , while it should be made clear to consumers that these are not grape products , " seehofer bravely stated - through a spokesperson - to a gaggle of unpatriotic reporters . anyone who has found the sour tasting regional icon to be unpalatable may appreciate the german efforts out of principle alone .
apfelwein , which is also known under various other terms like " ebbelwoi " and " apfelmost , " is seen as an oddity in the rest of the country and those who have no love of its taste would struggle to defend it . devastation averted eu peacemakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt was awash with apfelwein as peace broke out but this fight was about the name and not the taste .
thankfully , for once at least , the european commission saw sense .
apfelwein , it was announced on tuesday , will remain a wine after all . " in the context of the negotiations on the wine reform we will find a solution to allow apfelwein and other fruit and berry wines to continue to be marketed as they are now - namely as fruit wines , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said in a statement that will surely be quoted when she picks up her future nobel peace prize for averting the conflict . " contrary to what i have read in the newspapers over recent days , it was never our intention to stop the production of these products , " she said , adding that germany and brussels would work for a compromise at a meeting of farm ministers in december . reports suggest that the state of emergency in hesse has since been scaled back . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is n't it time berlin jumped ship ? germany 's role in operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- has long been controversial .
in the wake of the sept .
11 attacks , then chancellor gerhard schröder pledged the us unconditional solidarity and military support in its war on terror .
when his coalition partner , the green party , dug its heels in , schröder resorted to a vote of confidence in the german parliament to force the bundestag 's pacifist members to swallow a bundeswehr dispatch to afghanistan - and won by a narrow margin . back then , germany offered almost 4,000 troops to help out the americans in their fight against al qaeda and its allies , primarily in afghanistan .
unlike the isaf mission , which is mandated by united nations security council resolutions , operation enduring freedom is based on the us right to self-defense against terrorism - which is , granted , recognized by the security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nina werkhäuser nonetheless , six years since the launch of this mission , it is time to ask how long the right to self-defense remains a legitimate argument .
if the us is prepared to maintain its war on terror indefinitely , then the german role in the conflict needs to be defined once and for all .
this has yet to happen . according to the bundestag mandate , elite german special forces -lrb- ksk -rrb- have been deployed to afghanistan .
to this day , the precise nature of their mission is still a secret - for reasons of security , says berlin . all this mystery makes it almost impossible to assess germany 's participation in oef .
one member of parliament recently complained that the bundestag is denied information , while the government insists it has no information to share on operation enduring freedom .
for the last six years , berlin has maintained unreserved loyalty to the undertaking , despite the fact that washington apparently provides military updates only sporadically .
the number of civilian lives claimed in afghanistan is also information that tends to be swept under the carpet . but facts are all there is to go on .
ksk forces have not been in afghanistan since germany 's change of government two years ago . the country 's current contribution to oef is 250 marines stationed on the horn of africa , which still cost berlin some 65 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- this year alone .
past experience suggests that the german frigates do little to deter potential terrorists .
so why is berlin still faithful to operation enduring freedom ? berlin 's argument that it is unwilling to leave its allies in the lurch is a specious one .
more to the point , it is unwilling to anger washington .
germany 's involvement in operation enduring freedom does not make the world a safer place .
it is high time berlin abandoned it . nina werkhäuser covers foreign , defense and security policy affairs for dw-radio . -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , georgian president mikhail saakashvili he set a date of jan .
5 , media reports from the capital tbilisi said .
saakashvili said he decided to hold the vote , originally scheduled for late 2008 , " to receive the trust of the people . " " i , as president of this nation , take this decision and make this proposal to hold a vote of confidence on my mandate , to receive unambiguous support from you to continue building our country , " he said . " the president 's statement is a victory for the georgian people , " said david zurabishvili , one of the leaders of the democratic front .
" the role of the opposition was only to bring the idea of the people to the president . " the opposition is now conferring to find a candidate to run against saakashvili . according to the georgian constitution , the president is elected for a five-year term and the early election will still require parliamentary approval .
a pro-saakashvili majority in parliament is expected to quickly endorse his decision . after six days of opposition protests , prime minister zurab nogaideli said on wednesday that saakashvili had declared a state of emergency in the capital tbilisi because of " an attempt at a state coup . " meanwhile , economic development minister georgi arvaladze said in a televised statement that saakashvili had imposed restrictions on public gatherings and the media , closing all television networks except state-controlled stations . post-revolution disillusionment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators have been calling for new elections for days the move came after a further day of running battles between riot police and demonstrators demanding the resignation of saakashvili , who came to power in the peaceful 2003 " rose revolution . "
the violence erupted when unarmed police attempted to disperse a rally on rustaveli avenue near parliament , in the center of the ancient city . accusing the president of corruption , political killings and failing to address widespread poverty in the country , the protestors had called for early elections . " we are demanding saakashvili 's resignation after such terrible and savage use of force , " said levan berdenishvili , a leader of the opposition .
" such uncivilized methods can not be allowed by any state . " saakashvili has repeatedly stressed that he will not resign and said he intends to run for re-election . " i , as the leader of this nation , need your mandate to cope with any external threat , to manage any pressure and to do away with an attempt to annex georgia 's territory , " he said . the afp news agency reported that according to health officials , some 500 people had been hospitalized wednesday after clashes with police , who fired rubber bullets , tear gas , and water cannons .
most were released after being treated for minor injuries and exposure to tear gas . later , the pro-opposition imedi television station went off air after an anchor said that government special forces had entered the broadcaster 's building . " anti-russian hysteria " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests started a week ago " high-ranking officials in russian special services are behind this , " said saakashvili in a televised national address , adding that they were " trying to gain a foothold among some of the radical opposition parties . " saakashvili announced that several russian diplomats would be expelled for engaging in " subversive , espionage activity in georgia . "
three diplomats were due for expulsion , according to interfax news agency . dismissing the claims as " anti-russian hysteria , " the russian foreign ministry described the accusations as irresponsible and said that any expulsion of russian diplomats would elicit an " appropriate response . " georgia , which frequently accuses russia of causing trouble in the former soviet republic which has cultivated close ties with washington in recent years , also recalled its ambassador from moscow , the foreign ministry revealed . staunchly pro-western , saakashvili has angered moscow with his push to join nato and his attempts to regain sovereignty over two breakaway pro-russian provinces . international concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili gave in to protesters ' demands the white house said it was " concerned " by the unrest in georgia , urging the government and opposition to resolve their differences peacefully and to shun steps that could provoke violence . " neither side ... should take any steps that would be deliberately provocative to the other and could lead to violence , " state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters . the european union 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , called for restraint , saying " political differences should be resolved within the democratic institutions .

" " i , as president of this nation , take this decision and make this proposal to hold a vote of confidence on my mandate , to receive unambiguous support from you to continue building our country , " he said . " the president 's statement is a victory for the georgian people , " said david zurabishvili , one of the leaders of the democratic front .
" the role of the opposition was only to bring the idea of the people to the president . " the opposition is now conferring to find a candidate to run against saakashvili . according to the georgian constitution , the president is elected for a five-year term and the early election will still require parliamentary approval .
a pro-saakashvili majority in parliament is expected to quickly endorse his decision . after six days of opposition protests , prime minister zurab nogaideli said on wednesday that saakashvili had declared a state of emergency in the capital tbilisi because of " an attempt at a state coup .

" we are demanding saakashvili 's resignation after such terrible and savage use of force , " said levan berdenishvili , a leader of the opposition .
" such uncivilized methods can not be allowed by any state . " saakashvili has repeatedly stressed that he will not resign and said he intends to run for re-election . " i , as the leader of this nation , need your mandate to cope with any external threat , to manage any pressure and to do away with an attempt to annex georgia 's territory , " he said . the afp news agency reported that according to health officials , some 500 people had been hospitalized wednesday after clashes with police , who fired rubber bullets , tear gas , and water cannons .

three diplomats were due for expulsion , according to interfax news agency . dismissing the claims as " anti-russian hysteria , " the russian foreign ministry described the accusations as irresponsible and said that any expulsion of russian diplomats would elicit an " appropriate response . " georgia , which frequently accuses russia of causing trouble in the former soviet republic which has cultivated close ties with washington in recent years , also recalled its ambassador from moscow , the foreign ministry revealed . staunchly pro-western , saakashvili has angered moscow with his push to join nato and his attempts to regain sovereignty over two breakaway pro-russian provinces . international concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili gave in to protesters ' demands the white house said it was " concerned " by the unrest in georgia , urging the government and opposition to resolve their differences peacefully and to shun steps that could provoke violence .

's original sceptical friend just after french president nicolas sarkozy flies out of the us , german chancellor angela merkel flies in .
both european leaders have sought to improve their ties with the us , but the trio does n't agree on everything . dw-radio spoke with john hulsman , an alfred von oppenheim scholar in residence at the german council on foreign relations in berlin . dw-radio : a lot has been said about how nicolas sarkozy in france and angela merkel in germany have turned around their relationships with the us since the iraq invasion .
how aligned is europe now with washington on international issues ? john hulsman : the fascinating thing about the big three , and i 'd throw the united kingdom in there as well , is that they are all coming to a similar position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could merkel , sarkozy and brown usher in a new era of eu-us relations ?
mr. sarkozy looked at the chirac presidency and saw that france had absolutely no stake in the middle east after opposing the americans over iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 08.11.2007 opinion : germany has no role to play in enduring freedom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by extending its participation in operation enduring freedom , germany is not making the world a safer place , said dw 's nina werkhäuser .
is n't it time berlin jumped ship ? germany 's role in operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- has long been controversial .
in the wake of the sept .
11 attacks , then chancellor gerhard schröder pledged the us unconditional solidarity and military support in its war on terror .
when his coalition partner , the green party , dug its heels in , schröder resorted to a vote of confidence in the german parliament to force the bundestag 's pacifist members to swallow a bundeswehr dispatch to afghanistan - and won by a narrow margin . back then , germany offered almost 4,000 troops to help out the americans in their fight against al qaeda and its allies , primarily in afghanistan .
unlike the isaf mission , which is mandated by united nations security council resolutions , operation enduring freedom is based on the us right to self-defense against terrorism - which is , granted , recognized by the security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nina werkhäuser nonetheless , six years since the launch of this mission , it is time to ask how long the right to self-defense remains a legitimate argument .
if the us is prepared to maintain its war on terror indefinitely , then the german role in the conflict needs to be defined once and for all .
this has yet to happen . according to the bundestag mandate , elite german special forces -lrb- ksk -rrb- have been deployed to afghanistan .
to this day , the precise nature of their mission is still a secret - for reasons of security , says berlin . all this mystery makes it almost impossible to assess germany 's participation in oef .
one member of parliament recently complained that the bundestag is denied information , while the government insists it has no information to share on operation enduring freedom .
for the last six years , berlin has maintained unreserved loyalty to the undertaking , despite the fact that washington apparently provides military updates only sporadically .
the number of civilian lives claimed in afghanistan is also information that tends to be swept under the carpet . but facts are all there is to go on .
ksk forces have not been in afghanistan since germany 's change of government two years ago . the country 's current contribution to oef is 250 marines stationed on the horn of africa , which still cost berlin some 65 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- this year alone .
past experience suggests that the german frigates do little to deter potential terrorists .
so why is berlin still faithful to operation enduring freedom ? berlin 's argument that it is unwilling to leave its allies in the lurch is a specious one .
more to the point , it is unwilling to anger washington .
germany 's involvement in operation enduring freedom does not make the world a safer place .

8 .
germany took seventh place . according to the gender gap report , released by the world economic forum , germany successfully narrowed its gender gap from a year ago .
but because other countries made even greater progress , germany 's overall ranking dropped , from fifth place to seventh . the wef study measures international gender equality by looking at four key areas : women 's economic participation in society ; their levels of health and education ; and their political empowerment .
economist saadia zahidi , one of the authors of the report , noted that while germany 's lowest rating was in the area of economic participation , " its scores make it a high-ranking country compared to others , particularly in europe . " as in 2006 , the top-most ranks were swept by a brace of scandinavian nations .
but germany " is actually doing much better in comparison to other countries , especially countries like italy , france or malta , " which fell much lower down in the rankings overall , zahidi said . dw-world.de spoke with zahidi about the purpose , and potential pitfalls , of carrying out a sweeping gender study . dw-world.de : the concept of a gender gap report is a fairly new one .
can you explain its purpose ? saadia zahidi : the global gender gap index tries to examine the gap between women and men in various areas .
it is looking at gaps , rather than levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zahidi : " countries should capitalize on half their resources " for example having an index that tells a country like bangladesh that it has lower levels of education than sweden is not very useful , they already know that .
they 're a poor country .
what this index tries to answer is , for example , whether bangladesh has a bigger gap on education than a comparable country such as pakistan . everything we do is rewarding parity .
it is not rewarding women 's supremacy over men , or men 's supremacy over women .
it is rewarding countries that aim to distribute their resources equally between women and men . so how does one measure parity ? a key feature of the index is that it has a fixed scale , with " zero " being inequality , and " one " being equality .
a score of 0.75 can be approximately interpreted as meaning , 75 percent of the gap in that country has been closed .
it is all relative to a benchmark , which is the number " one . "
it allows us to track the changes over time . statistical data is notoriously slippery .
do you think your report gives an accurate picture of the state of gender equality in the world ? the report is actually based on 14 different variables , 13 of which come from hard data sources , like the united nations development program , the international labor organization and the world health organization .
this is all hard statistics , which simply look at things such as labor force participation rates , or the number of women ministers , or literacy rates . all we have done is provide a framework that allows us to look at these hard facts in such a way that gives you an idea of where this country stands in terms of gap , compared to other countries in the world .
so yes , i think it does provide an accurate picture . why gather this information ?
who uses it ? we 've tried to make it something that is going to be useful for general awareness , and we believe the rankings will help do that .
but because we 've provided a lot of details , it is also a reference tool for international organizations and national governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education levels are compared in the study it has also become a catalyst for academic research .
quite a lot of academics contact us for details from the index , wondering about the connections between certain policies and their outcomes . germany ranked seventh overall this year , and scored relatively well in terms of economic participation .
but newspapers here are full of articles about glass ceilings , a stubborn wage gap , and social education practices that make it hard for mothers to re-enter the work force .
how does that add up ? in our study we look at the overall workplace participation rate .
in the global statistics , it appears germany is doing well in terms of labor force participation of women , whereas italy and france are not doing as well . how many women actually go back into the workplace after having children is n't something we include in the index .
but we do provide information on the length of paid maternity leave , which is 14 weeks in germany , and the maternity benefits , which is that the wages are 100 percent paid , partly by social security up to a certain level , and the rest by the employer . how meaningful is this kind of measurement ?
the philippines , where women 's situation is not usually thought of as being very good , was ranked sixth - right above germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , unlike saudi arabia , women are commonly active in politics that goes back to what i said earlier : the index looks at gaps , not levels .
so we 're not worried about what is the overall level of resources in the philippines compared to that in the united kingdom .
what we do show is that relatively speaking , those resources are being divided more equitably in the philippines as compared to in the uk . … as to whether this is meaningful , it may not be - except to be a striking example of how this could be a priority for all countries , whether rich or poor . are the relative wealth or poverty of the 128 countries you include reflected in the study ? what we have done is divide rankings by income groups ; low income compared to low income countries , high income to high income . … we find that within each of these income groups there are countries that perform very well , and others that perform poorly . in the high income group , for example , sweden does extremely well , but saudi arabia does very poorly .
or in the lower and lower-middle group , there are countries like philippines and tanzania that do very well , but also countries like pakistan and yemen that do badly . it all goes a long way toward showing that gender equality is not a luxury good , and that it is something all countries can aspire towards . do most countries see gender equality as an ideal to be strived for ? that is one of the key messages we are trying to spread with this report .
clearly this is a human rights challenge , but it is also an economic challenge .
countries that are not capitalizing on half of their resource pool will be undermining their competitive potential in the long run .
this is definitely one of the key messages we highlight in this report . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many times , the reason is long forgotten in the horror which follows .
luckily , no one will have to face the shame of one breaking out over apple wine . it was set to be the biggest battle over eu designations since the infamous champagne war of 2005 and the equally distressing feta incident of 2002 .
but , somewhat ironically considering the nature of the dispute in the first place , common sense has prevailed to end the apfelwein rebellion of 2007 before any sap was spilt . the german campaign , led by hesse premier roland koch with support from federal agriculture minister horst seehofer , was ready to storm the gates of the eurocrat fortresses in brussels to fight for the right to have the traditional cider-like brew recognized as a wine . the eu claimed that the regional drink fell foul of a proposal from the european commission to use the term " wine " purely for grape products . koch and seehofer target euro madness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch : " madness " an outraged koch vehemently defended his state 's brew and the drums of conflict began to sound .

" the minister definitely wants to save the terms apfelwein and obstwein -lsb- fruit wine -rsb- , while it should be made clear to consumers that these are not grape products , " seehofer bravely stated - through a spokesperson - to a gaggle of unpatriotic reporters . anyone who has found the sour tasting regional icon to be unpalatable may appreciate the german efforts out of principle alone .
apfelwein , which is also known under various other terms like " ebbelwoi " and " apfelmost , " is seen as an oddity in the rest of the country and those who have no love of its taste would struggle to defend it . devastation averted eu peacemakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt was awash with apfelwein as peace broke out but this fight was about the name and not the taste .
thankfully , for once at least , the european commission saw sense .
apfelwein , it was announced on tuesday , will remain a wine after all . " in the context of the negotiations on the wine reform we will find a solution to allow apfelwein and other fruit and berry wines to continue to be marketed as they are now - namely as fruit wines , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said in a statement that will surely be quoted when she picks up her future nobel peace prize for averting the conflict .

8 .
germany took seventh place . according to the gender gap report , released by the world economic forum , germany successfully narrowed its gender gap from a year ago .
but because other countries made even greater progress , germany 's overall ranking dropped , from fifth place to seventh . the wef study measures international gender equality by looking at four key areas : women 's economic participation in society ; their levels of health and education ; and their political empowerment .
economist saadia zahidi , one of the authors of the report , noted that while germany 's lowest rating was in the area of economic participation , " its scores make it a high-ranking country compared to others , particularly in europe . " as in 2006 , the top-most ranks were swept by a brace of scandinavian nations .
but germany " is actually doing much better in comparison to other countries , especially countries like italy , france or malta , " which fell much lower down in the rankings overall , zahidi said . dw-world.de spoke with zahidi about the purpose , and potential pitfalls , of carrying out a sweeping gender study . dw-world.de : the concept of a gender gap report is a fairly new one .
can you explain its purpose ? saadia zahidi : the global gender gap index tries to examine the gap between women and men in various areas .
it is looking at gaps , rather than levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zahidi : " countries should capitalize on half their resources " for example having an index that tells a country like bangladesh that it has lower levels of education than sweden is not very useful , they already know that .
they 're a poor country .
what this index tries to answer is , for example , whether bangladesh has a bigger gap on education than a comparable country such as pakistan . everything we do is rewarding parity .
it is not rewarding women 's supremacy over men , or men 's supremacy over women .
it is rewarding countries that aim to distribute their resources equally between women and men . so how does one measure parity ? a key feature of the index is that it has a fixed scale , with " zero " being inequality , and " one " being equality .
a score of 0.75 can be approximately interpreted as meaning , 75 percent of the gap in that country has been closed .
it is all relative to a benchmark , which is the number " one . "
it allows us to track the changes over time . statistical data is notoriously slippery .
do you think your report gives an accurate picture of the state of gender equality in the world ? the report is actually based on 14 different variables , 13 of which come from hard data sources , like the united nations development program , the international labor organization and the world health organization .
this is all hard statistics , which simply look at things such as labor force participation rates , or the number of women ministers , or literacy rates . all we have done is provide a framework that allows us to look at these hard facts in such a way that gives you an idea of where this country stands in terms of gap , compared to other countries in the world .
so yes , i think it does provide an accurate picture . why gather this information ?
who uses it ? we 've tried to make it something that is going to be useful for general awareness , and we believe the rankings will help do that .
but because we 've provided a lot of details , it is also a reference tool for international organizations and national governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education levels are compared in the study it has also become a catalyst for academic research .
quite a lot of academics contact us for details from the index , wondering about the connections between certain policies and their outcomes . germany ranked seventh overall this year , and scored relatively well in terms of economic participation .
but newspapers here are full of articles about glass ceilings , a stubborn wage gap , and social education practices that make it hard for mothers to re-enter the work force .
how does that add up ? in our study we look at the overall workplace participation rate .
in the global statistics , it appears germany is doing well in terms of labor force participation of women , whereas italy and france are not doing as well . how many women actually go back into the workplace after having children is n't something we include in the index .
but we do provide information on the length of paid maternity leave , which is 14 weeks in germany , and the maternity benefits , which is that the wages are 100 percent paid , partly by social security up to a certain level , and the rest by the employer . how meaningful is this kind of measurement ?
the philippines , where women 's situation is not usually thought of as being very good , was ranked sixth - right above germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , unlike saudi arabia , women are commonly active in politics that goes back to what i said earlier : the index looks at gaps , not levels .
so we 're not worried about what is the overall level of resources in the philippines compared to that in the united kingdom .
what we do show is that relatively speaking , those resources are being divided more equitably in the philippines as compared to in the uk . … as to whether this is meaningful , it may not be - except to be a striking example of how this could be a priority for all countries , whether rich or poor . are the relative wealth or poverty of the 128 countries you include reflected in the study ? what we have done is divide rankings by income groups ; low income compared to low income countries , high income to high income . … we find that within each of these income groups there are countries that perform very well , and others that perform poorly . in the high income group , for example , sweden does extremely well , but saudi arabia does very poorly .
or in the lower and lower-middle group , there are countries like philippines and tanzania that do very well , but also countries like pakistan and yemen that do badly . it all goes a long way toward showing that gender equality is not a luxury good , and that it is something all countries can aspire towards . do most countries see gender equality as an ideal to be strived for ? that is one of the key messages we are trying to spread with this report .
clearly this is a human rights challenge , but it is also an economic challenge .
countries that are not capitalizing on half of their resource pool will be undermining their competitive potential in the long run .
this is definitely one of the key messages we highlight in this report . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , that an internal probe had uncovered questionable transactions totaling 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- - nearly three times the amount previously estimated . earlier reports put the estimated amount linked to the scandal at 449 million euros and said the corruption was limited to the electronics giant 's former communications branch .
the new sum , however , is said to include other siemens division as well . siemens has already dismissed 140 employees and an additional 330 have received penalties of other kinds , ceo peter löscher said thursday . " we are glad that we have taken another important step in clearing up the past , " he said .
" we have to do business as well and as cleanly as we can . " external auditors had found questionable sums totaling more than 1 billion euros in august , but siemens refused to comment at that time , saying their internal probe was still underway . most of the money is reported to have disappeared into secret bank accounts for use as bribes in securing contracts outside germany , the munich-based conglomerate said . revenues rise despite scandal stress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo peter löscher presented his company 's progress report in munich the company 's confession coincided with the release of a relatively bright quarterly report on thursday . revenue grew by 9 percent to 20.2 billion euros while operating profits rose 166 percent in the last quarter of the 2006-2007 fiscal year , which ended on sept .
30 , siemens said in a statement .
growth was particularly strong in the asia-pacific regions . at the same time , however , the group posted a net loss of 74 million euros , compared to the same period last year .

is n't it time berlin jumped ship ? germany 's role in operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- has long been controversial .
in the wake of the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 08.11.2007 expert calls gender gap a human rights challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study examined women 's empowerment the world economic forum published the results of its gender gap report , measuring the level of gender parity in 128 countries , on thursday , nov .
8 .
germany took seventh place . according to the gender gap report , released by the world economic forum , germany successfully narrowed its gender gap from a year ago .
but because other countries made even greater progress , germany 's overall ranking dropped , from fifth place to seventh . the wef study measures international gender equality by looking at four key areas : women 's economic participation in society ; their levels of health and education ; and their political empowerment .
economist saadia zahidi , one of the authors of the report , noted that while germany 's lowest rating was in the area of economic participation , " its scores make it a high-ranking country compared to others , particularly in europe . " as in 2006 , the top-most ranks were swept by a brace of scandinavian nations .
but germany " is actually doing much better in comparison to other countries , especially countries like italy , france or malta , " which fell much lower down in the rankings overall , zahidi said . dw-world.de spoke with zahidi about the purpose , and potential pitfalls , of carrying out a sweeping gender study . dw-world.de : the concept of a gender gap report is a fairly new one .
can you explain its purpose ? saadia zahidi : the global gender gap index tries to examine the gap between women and men in various areas .
it is looking at gaps , rather than levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zahidi : " countries should capitalize on half their resources " for example having an index that tells a country like bangladesh that it has lower levels of education than sweden is not very useful , they already know that .
they 're a poor country .
what this index tries to answer is , for example , whether bangladesh has a bigger gap on education than a comparable country such as pakistan . everything we do is rewarding parity .
it is not rewarding women 's supremacy over men , or men 's supremacy over women .
it is rewarding countries that aim to distribute their resources equally between women and men . so how does one measure parity ? a key feature of the index is that it has a fixed scale , with " zero " being inequality , and " one " being equality .
a score of 0.75 can be approximately interpreted as meaning , 75 percent of the gap in that country has been closed .
it is all relative to a benchmark , which is the number " one . "
it allows us to track the changes over time . statistical data is notoriously slippery .
do you think your report gives an accurate picture of the state of gender equality in the world ? the report is actually based on 14 different variables , 13 of which come from hard data sources , like the united nations development program , the international labor organization and the world health organization .
this is all hard statistics , which simply look at things such as labor force participation rates , or the number of women ministers , or literacy rates . all we have done is provide a framework that allows us to look at these hard facts in such a way that gives you an idea of where this country stands in terms of gap , compared to other countries in the world .
so yes , i think it does provide an accurate picture . why gather this information ?
who uses it ? we 've tried to make it something that is going to be useful for general awareness , and we believe the rankings will help do that .
but because we 've provided a lot of details , it is also a reference tool for international organizations and national governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education levels are compared in the study it has also become a catalyst for academic research .
quite a lot of academics contact us for details from the index , wondering about the connections between certain policies and their outcomes . germany ranked seventh overall this year , and scored relatively well in terms of economic participation .
but newspapers here are full of articles about glass ceilings , a stubborn wage gap , and social education practices that make it hard for mothers to re-enter the work force .
how does that add up ? in our study we look at the overall workplace participation rate .
in the global statistics , it appears germany is doing well in terms of labor force participation of women , whereas italy and france are not doing as well . how many women actually go back into the workplace after having children is n't something we include in the index .
but we do provide information on the length of paid maternity leave , which is 14 weeks in germany , and the maternity benefits , which is that the wages are 100 percent paid , partly by social security up to a certain level , and the rest by the employer . how meaningful is this kind of measurement ?
the philippines , where women 's situation is not usually thought of as being very good , was ranked sixth - right above germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , unlike saudi arabia , women are commonly active in politics that goes back to what i said earlier : the index looks at gaps , not levels .
so we 're not worried about what is the overall level of resources in the philippines compared to that in the united kingdom .
what we do show is that relatively speaking , those resources are being divided more equitably in the philippines as compared to in the uk . … as to whether this is meaningful , it may not be - except to be a striking example of how this could be a priority for all countries , whether rich or poor . are the relative wealth or poverty of the 128 countries you include reflected in the study ? what we have done is divide rankings by income groups ; low income compared to low income countries , high income to high income . … we find that within each of these income groups there are countries that perform very well , and others that perform poorly . in the high income group , for example , sweden does extremely well , but saudi arabia does very poorly .
or in the lower and lower-middle group , there are countries like philippines and tanzania that do very well , but also countries like pakistan and yemen that do badly . it all goes a long way toward showing that gender equality is not a luxury good , and that it is something all countries can aspire towards . do most countries see gender equality as an ideal to be strived for ? that is one of the key messages we are trying to spread with this report .
clearly this is a human rights challenge , but it is also an economic challenge .
countries that are not capitalizing on half of their resource pool will be undermining their competitive potential in the long run .
this is definitely one of the key messages we highlight in this report . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

's original sceptical friend just after french president nicolas sarkozy flies out of the us , german chancellor angela merkel flies in .
both european leaders have sought to improve their ties with the us , but the trio does n't agree on everything . dw-radio spoke with john hulsman , an alfred von oppenheim scholar in residence at the german council on foreign relations in berlin . dw-radio : a lot has been said about how nicolas sarkozy in france and angela merkel in germany have turned around their relationships with the us since the iraq invasion .
how aligned is europe now with washington on international issues ? john hulsman : the fascinating thing about the big three , and i 'd throw the united kingdom in there as well , is that they are all coming to a similar position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could merkel , sarkozy and brown usher in a new era of eu-us relations ?
mr. sarkozy looked at the chirac presidency and saw that france had absolutely no stake in the middle east after opposing the americans over iraq .
that he was , in effect , too far away from america to be a major decision player - and that 's one thing french presidents , regardless of their politics , all want to be .
so he needs to move closer to america to matter . gordon brown has the opposite problem .
tony blair moved too close to president bush and it ruined his premiership , so gordon brown moved slightly away from the united states , while retaining close ties . and they both row to an island where they find angela merkel who staked out this position of " skeptical friendship " ahead of time .
which is that of course we support america .
of course america 's an ally , and we share values but that does n't mean we 're your lapdog and we 're going to agree with you issue after issue . german chancellor angela merkel arrives in the us on friday .
do you think she ’ ll receive a warm a welcome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush share a mutual respect for each other yes , president bush thinks extremely highly of chancellor merkel .
she 's proven to be not flamboyant , not showy but to get the job done diplomatically behind closed doors .
again -lsb- she has -rsb- this kind of european view of skeptical friendship .
that we need the united states , we must work with them but that we 're not going to be their lapdog .
this is really her invention . the atmospherics after chancellor schröder were awful , and chancellor merkel entered very clear and in a straight way by saying that america remains a great ally of germany but that does n't mean she 's in favor of guantanamo bay , renditions , torture , etc . what will chancellor merkel be talking about in her discussions with president bush ? it 's a number of issues that i do n't think grab attention but really matter .
for instance , her plans to free up currency flows between europe and the united states by talking about common regulations .
this is an issue that will take years - if not decades - to negotiate but will actually help both european and american economies immensely .
in the absence of a free trade deal this may be the closest we can get to actually improving cooperation between our two huge and important economies . certainly the other issue will be chancellor merkel 's signature issue , which is climate change .
can we reach some sort of post-kyoto protocol ?
this again is going to take a very long time and probably wo n't be decided until president bush has a successor .
but she has moved the president to say things like " actually climate change is a problem , " and that was a huge change from when president bush came into office .
that 's entirely due to chancellor angela merkel chipping away at him from outside and -lsb- california -rsb- governor arnold schwarzenegger chipping away at president bush from within the country . interview : nathan wiktop -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 , media reports from the capital tbilisi said .
saakashvili said he decided to hold the vote , originally scheduled for late 2008 , " to receive the trust of the people . " " i , as president of this nation , take this decision and make this proposal to hold a vote of confidence on my mandate , to receive unambiguous support from you to continue building our country , " he said . " the president 's statement is a victory for the georgian people , " said david zurabishvili , one of the leaders of the democratic front .
" the role of the opposition was only to bring the idea of the people to the president . " the opposition is now conferring to find a candidate to run against saakashvili . according to the georgian constitution , the president is elected for a five-year term and the early election will still require parliamentary approval .
a pro-saakashvili majority in parliament is expected to quickly endorse his decision . after six days of opposition protests , prime minister zurab nogaideli said on wednesday that saakashvili had declared a state of emergency in the capital tbilisi because of " an attempt at a state coup . " meanwhile , economic development minister georgi arvaladze said in a televised statement that saakashvili had imposed restrictions on public gatherings and the media , closing all television networks except state-controlled stations . post-revolution disillusionment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators have been calling for new elections for days the move came after a further day of running battles between riot police and demonstrators demanding the resignation of saakashvili , who came to power in the peaceful 2003 " rose revolution . "
the violence erupted when unarmed police attempted to disperse a rally on rustaveli avenue near parliament , in the center of the ancient city . accusing the president of corruption , political killings and failing to address widespread poverty in the country , the protestors had called for early elections . " we are demanding saakashvili 's resignation after such terrible and savage use of force , " said levan berdenishvili , a leader of the opposition .
" such uncivilized methods can not be allowed by any state . " saakashvili has repeatedly stressed that he will not resign and said he intends to run for re-election . " i , as the leader of this nation , need your mandate to cope with any external threat , to manage any pressure and to do away with an attempt to annex georgia 's territory , " he said . the afp news agency reported that according to health officials , some 500 people had been hospitalized wednesday after clashes with police , who fired rubber bullets , tear gas , and water cannons .
most were released after being treated for minor injuries and exposure to tear gas . later , the pro-opposition imedi television station went off air after an anchor said that government special forces had entered the broadcaster 's building . " anti-russian hysteria " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests started a week ago " high-ranking officials in russian special services are behind this , " said saakashvili in a televised national address , adding that they were " trying to gain a foothold among some of the radical opposition parties . " saakashvili announced that several russian diplomats would be expelled for engaging in " subversive , espionage activity in georgia . "
three diplomats were due for expulsion , according to interfax news agency . dismissing the claims as " anti-russian hysteria , " the russian foreign ministry described the accusations as irresponsible and said that any expulsion of russian diplomats would elicit an " appropriate response . " georgia , which frequently accuses russia of causing trouble in the former soviet republic which has cultivated close ties with washington in recent years , also recalled its ambassador from moscow , the foreign ministry revealed . staunchly pro-western , saakashvili has angered moscow with his push to join nato and his attempts to regain sovereignty over two breakaway pro-russian provinces . international concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili gave in to protesters ' demands the white house said it was " concerned " by the unrest in georgia , urging the government and opposition to resolve their differences peacefully and to shun steps that could provoke violence .

8 . barroso was the first high-level international visitor to travel to warsaw to congratulate tusk , whose center-right civic platform party and its allies are expected to form a coalition government later this week after winning legislative elections on oct .
21 . eu leaders have been barely able to contain their relief at the demise of outgoing prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's conservative government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk is expected to be named prime minister on friday " today , i was able to congratulate personally donald tusk , my good friend , for his victory , for the victory of his party in the parliamentary elections , " barroso told reporters at a press conference after the meeting . tusk campaigned on a promise to help the eu 's largest post-communist member catch up with richer western european countries , and said poland could become like ireland , where eu entry triggered an economic boom . pro-eu course further promises include improving strained relations with poland 's neighbors ; taking advantage of the country 's strong economic growth ; adopting the euro in the next six years , and re-examining a us plan to place parts of an anti-missile shield in poland . tusk has also said special attention would be paid to german-polish ties , which have taken a battering in recent years . " one can be certain that the government will take a very strong pro-european direction , and european relations will be intensified , " tusk said after the meeting . " we , the eu , will benefit from an engaged , constructive , dynamic , european poland , " barroso responded . end of a conserative era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins had few admirers in the european union relations between poland and the eu steadily deteriorated under kaczynski and his identical twin president lech kaczynski , whose term in office is set to run until 2010 . until then , he will continue to exert a strong influence - particularly in poland 's foreign policy .
some experts fear there are already signs of imminent clashes with the new government . as leader of the law and justice party , jaroslaw kaczynski was frequently at odds with other members of the 27-nation eu bloc . tusk has accused the kaczynski twins of damaging relations with major international partners and of isolating poland from the rest of europe . the outgoing government was widely seen in europe as a troublemaker , blocking talks on a new partnership agreement with moscow in 2005 and alluding to world war ii during negotiations on the new eu reform treaty . good for brussels , bad for washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-polish ties have been strained of late tusk and barroso did not reveal whether they had discussed the european treaty or the charter of fundamental rights , reuters reported . the kaczynskis rejected adoption of the charter , saying it could violate poland 's christian-oriented value system . outgoing foreign minister anna fotyga said adopting the charter would pave the way for gay marriage and euthanasia , both strongly opposed by predominantly catholic poles . meanwhile , some observers predicted that poland 's pro-european course may cost the country its friendship with washington .
they pointed out that disagreement was likely over the us plan to place an anti-missile shield in poland . " if we decide in talks with our partners in the eu and nato that this is not an unambiguous project , then we are definitely going to think it over , " tusk was cited as saying in ap . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many times , the reason is long forgotten in the horror which follows .
luckily , no one will have to face the shame of one breaking out over apple wine . it was set to be the biggest battle over eu designations since the infamous champagne war of 2005 and the equally distressing feta incident of 2002 .
but , somewhat ironically considering the nature of the dispute in the first place , common sense has prevailed to end the apfelwein rebellion of 2007 before any sap was spilt . the german campaign , led by hesse premier roland koch with support from federal agriculture minister horst seehofer , was ready to storm the gates of the eurocrat fortresses in brussels to fight for the right to have the traditional cider-like brew recognized as a wine . the eu claimed that the regional drink fell foul of a proposal from the european commission to use the term " wine " purely for grape products . koch and seehofer target euro madness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch : " madness " an outraged koch vehemently defended his state 's brew and the drums of conflict began to sound . " we will not allow our traditional name to be sacrificed to regulatory madness in brussels , " koch ranted earlier this week .
" we will fight with all the means at our disposal for our apple wine . " seehofer , obviously seeing the worth in throwing his federal weight behind such an affront to german tradition , joined what he called a " justified " cause . " the minister definitely wants to save the terms apfelwein and obstwein -lsb- fruit wine -rsb- , while it should be made clear to consumers that these are not grape products , " seehofer bravely stated - through a spokesperson - to a gaggle of unpatriotic reporters . anyone who has found the sour tasting regional icon to be unpalatable may appreciate the german efforts out of principle alone .
apfelwein , which is also known under various other terms like " ebbelwoi " and " apfelmost , " is seen as an oddity in the rest of the country and those who have no love of its taste would struggle to defend it . devastation averted eu peacemakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt was awash with apfelwein as peace broke out but this fight was about the name and not the taste .
thankfully , for once at least , the european commission saw sense .
apfelwein , it was announced on tuesday , will remain a wine after all . " in the context of the negotiations on the wine reform we will find a solution to allow apfelwein and other fruit and berry wines to continue to be marketed as they are now - namely as fruit wines , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said in a statement that will surely be quoted when she picks up her future nobel peace prize for averting the conflict . " contrary to what i have read in the newspapers over recent days , it was never our intention to stop the production of these products , " she said , adding that germany and brussels would work for a compromise at a meeting of farm ministers in december . reports suggest that the state of emergency in hesse has since been scaled back . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 .
germany took seventh place . according to the gender gap report , released by the world economic forum , germany successfully narrowed its gender gap from a year ago .
but because other countries made even greater progress , germany 's overall ranking dropped , from fifth place to seventh . the wef study measures international gender equality by looking at four key areas : women 's economic participation in society ; their levels of health and education ; and their political empowerment .
economist saadia zahidi , one of the authors of the report , noted that while germany 's lowest rating was in the area of economic participation , " its scores make it a high-ranking country compared to others , particularly in europe . " as in 2006 , the top-most ranks were swept by a brace of scandinavian nations .
but germany " is actually doing much better in comparison to other countries , especially countries like italy , france or malta , " which fell much lower down in the rankings overall , zahidi said . dw-world.de spoke with zahidi about the purpose , and potential pitfalls , of carrying out a sweeping gender study . dw-world.de : the concept of a gender gap report is a fairly new one .
can you explain its purpose ? saadia zahidi : the global gender gap index tries to examine the gap between women and men in various areas .
it is looking at gaps , rather than levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zahidi : " countries should capitalize on half their resources " for example having an index that tells a country like bangladesh that it has lower levels of education than sweden is not very useful , they already know that .
they 're a poor country .
what this index tries to answer is , for example , whether bangladesh has a bigger gap on education than a comparable country such as pakistan . everything we do is rewarding parity .
it is not rewarding women 's supremacy over men , or men 's supremacy over women .
it is rewarding countries that aim to distribute their resources equally between women and men . so how does one measure parity ? a key feature of the index is that it has a fixed scale , with " zero " being inequality , and " one " being equality .
a score of 0.75 can be approximately interpreted as meaning , 75 percent of the gap in that country has been closed .
it is all relative to a benchmark , which is the number " one . "
it allows us to track the changes over time . statistical data is notoriously slippery .
do you think your report gives an accurate picture of the state of gender equality in the world ? the report is actually based on 14 different variables , 13 of which come from hard data sources , like the united nations development program , the international labor organization and the world health organization .
this is all hard statistics , which simply look at things such as labor force participation rates , or the number of women ministers , or literacy rates . all we have done is provide a framework that allows us to look at these hard facts in such a way that gives you an idea of where this country stands in terms of gap , compared to other countries in the world .
so yes , i think it does provide an accurate picture . why gather this information ?
who uses it ? we 've tried to make it something that is going to be useful for general awareness , and we believe the rankings will help do that .
but because we 've provided a lot of details , it is also a reference tool for international organizations and national governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education levels are compared in the study it has also become a catalyst for academic research .
quite a lot of academics contact us for details from the index , wondering about the connections between certain policies and their outcomes . germany ranked seventh overall this year , and scored relatively well in terms of economic participation .
but newspapers here are full of articles about glass ceilings , a stubborn wage gap , and social education practices that make it hard for mothers to re-enter the work force .
how does that add up ? in our study we look at the overall workplace participation rate .
in the global statistics , it appears germany is doing well in terms of labor force participation of women , whereas italy and france are not doing as well . how many women actually go back into the workplace after having children is n't something we include in the index .
but we do provide information on the length of paid maternity leave , which is 14 weeks in germany , and the maternity benefits , which is that the wages are 100 percent paid , partly by social security up to a certain level , and the rest by the employer . how meaningful is this kind of measurement ?
the philippines , where women 's situation is not usually thought of as being very good , was ranked sixth - right above germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , unlike saudi arabia , women are commonly active in politics that goes back to what i said earlier : the index looks at gaps , not levels .
so we 're not worried about what is the overall level of resources in the philippines compared to that in the united kingdom .
what we do show is that relatively speaking , those resources are being divided more equitably in the philippines as compared to in the uk . … as to whether this is meaningful , it may not be - except to be a striking example of how this could be a priority for all countries , whether rich or poor . are the relative wealth or poverty of the 128 countries you include reflected in the study ? what we have done is divide rankings by income groups ; low income compared to low income countries , high income to high income . … we find that within each of these income groups there are countries that perform very well , and others that perform poorly . in the high income group , for example , sweden does extremely well , but saudi arabia does very poorly .
or in the lower and lower-middle group , there are countries like philippines and tanzania that do very well , but also countries like pakistan and yemen that do badly . it all goes a long way toward showing that gender equality is not a luxury good , and that it is something all countries can aspire towards . do most countries see gender equality as an ideal to be strived for ? that is one of the key messages we are trying to spread with this report .
clearly this is a human rights challenge , but it is also an economic challenge .
countries that are not capitalizing on half of their resource pool will be undermining their competitive potential in the long run .
this is definitely one of the key messages we highlight in this report . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 08.11.2007 expert calls gender gap a human rights challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study examined women 's empowerment the world economic forum published the results of its gender gap report , measuring the level of gender parity in 128 countries , on thursday , nov .
8 .
germany took seventh place . according to the gender gap report , released by the world economic forum , germany successfully narrowed its gender gap from a year ago .
but because other countries made even greater progress , germany 's overall ranking dropped , from fifth place to seventh . the wef study measures international gender equality by looking at four key areas : women 's economic participation in society ; their levels of health and education ; and their political empowerment .
economist saadia zahidi , one of the authors of the report , noted that while germany 's lowest rating was in the area of economic participation , " its scores make it a high-ranking country compared to others , particularly in europe . " as in 2006 , the top-most ranks were swept by a brace of scandinavian nations .
but germany " is actually doing much better in comparison to other countries , especially countries like italy , france or malta , " which fell much lower down in the rankings overall , zahidi said . dw-world.de spoke with zahidi about the purpose , and potential pitfalls , of carrying out a sweeping gender study . dw-world.de : the concept of a gender gap report is a fairly new one .
can you explain its purpose ? saadia zahidi : the global gender gap index tries to examine the gap between women and men in various areas .
it is looking at gaps , rather than levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zahidi : " countries should capitalize on half their resources " for example having an index that tells a country like bangladesh that it has lower levels of education than sweden is not very useful , they already know that .
they 're a poor country .
what this index tries to answer is , for example , whether bangladesh has a bigger gap on education than a comparable country such as pakistan . everything we do is rewarding parity .
it is not rewarding women 's supremacy over men , or men 's supremacy over women .
it is rewarding countries that aim to distribute their resources equally between women and men . so how does one measure parity ? a key feature of the index is that it has a fixed scale , with " zero " being inequality , and " one " being equality .
a score of 0.75 can be approximately interpreted as meaning , 75 percent of the gap in that country has been closed .
it is all relative to a benchmark , which is the number " one . "
it allows us to track the changes over time . statistical data is notoriously slippery .
do you think your report gives an accurate picture of the state of gender equality in the world ? the report is actually based on 14 different variables , 13 of which come from hard data sources , like the united nations development program , the international labor organization and the world health organization .
this is all hard statistics , which simply look at things such as labor force participation rates , or the number of women ministers , or literacy rates . all we have done is provide a framework that allows us to look at these hard facts in such a way that gives you an idea of where this country stands in terms of gap , compared to other countries in the world .
so yes , i think it does provide an accurate picture . why gather this information ?
who uses it ? we 've tried to make it something that is going to be useful for general awareness , and we believe the rankings will help do that .
but because we 've provided a lot of details , it is also a reference tool for international organizations and national governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education levels are compared in the study it has also become a catalyst for academic research .
quite a lot of academics contact us for details from the index , wondering about the connections between certain policies and their outcomes . germany ranked seventh overall this year , and scored relatively well in terms of economic participation .
but newspapers here are full of articles about glass ceilings , a stubborn wage gap , and social education practices that make it hard for mothers to re-enter the work force .
how does that add up ? in our study we look at the overall workplace participation rate .
in the global statistics , it appears germany is doing well in terms of labor force participation of women , whereas italy and france are not doing as well . how many women actually go back into the workplace after having children is n't something we include in the index .
but we do provide information on the length of paid maternity leave , which is 14 weeks in germany , and the maternity benefits , which is that the wages are 100 percent paid , partly by social security up to a certain level , and the rest by the employer . how meaningful is this kind of measurement ?
the philippines , where women 's situation is not usually thought of as being very good , was ranked sixth - right above germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , unlike saudi arabia , women are commonly active in politics that goes back to what i said earlier : the index looks at gaps , not levels .
so we 're not worried about what is the overall level of resources in the philippines compared to that in the united kingdom .
what we do show is that relatively speaking , those resources are being divided more equitably in the philippines as compared to in the uk . … as to whether this is meaningful , it may not be - except to be a striking example of how this could be a priority for all countries , whether rich or poor . are the relative wealth or poverty of the 128 countries you include reflected in the study ? what we have done is divide rankings by income groups ; low income compared to low income countries , high income to high income . … we find that within each of these income groups there are countries that perform very well , and others that perform poorly . in the high income group , for example , sweden does extremely well , but saudi arabia does very poorly .
or in the lower and lower-middle group , there are countries like philippines and tanzania that do very well , but also countries like pakistan and yemen that do badly . it all goes a long way toward showing that gender equality is not a luxury good , and that it is something all countries can aspire towards . do most countries see gender equality as an ideal to be strived for ? that is one of the key messages we are trying to spread with this report .
clearly this is a human rights challenge , but it is also an economic challenge .
countries that are not capitalizing on half of their resource pool will be undermining their competitive potential in the long run .
this is definitely one of the key messages we highlight in this report . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many times , the reason is long forgotten in the horror which follows .
luckily , no one will have to face the shame of one breaking out over apple wine . it was set to be the biggest battle over eu designations since the infamous champagne war of 2005 and the equally distressing feta incident of 2002 .
but , somewhat ironically considering the nature of the dispute in the first place , common sense has prevailed to end the apfelwein rebellion of 2007 before any sap was spilt . the german campaign , led by hesse premier roland koch with support from federal agriculture minister horst seehofer , was ready to storm the gates of the eurocrat fortresses in brussels to fight for the right to have the traditional cider-like brew recognized as a wine . the eu claimed that the regional drink fell foul of a proposal from the european commission to use the term " wine " purely for grape products . koch and seehofer target euro madness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch : " madness " an outraged koch vehemently defended his state 's brew and the drums of conflict began to sound . " we will not allow our traditional name to be sacrificed to regulatory madness in brussels , " koch ranted earlier this week .
" we will fight with all the means at our disposal for our apple wine . " seehofer , obviously seeing the worth in throwing his federal weight behind such an affront to german tradition , joined what he called a " justified " cause . " the minister definitely wants to save the terms apfelwein and obstwein -lsb- fruit wine -rsb- , while it should be made clear to consumers that these are not grape products , " seehofer bravely stated - through a spokesperson - to a gaggle of unpatriotic reporters . anyone who has found the sour tasting regional icon to be unpalatable may appreciate the german efforts out of principle alone .
apfelwein , which is also known under various other terms like " ebbelwoi " and " apfelmost , " is seen as an oddity in the rest of the country and those who have no love of its taste would struggle to defend it . devastation averted eu peacemakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt was awash with apfelwein as peace broke out but this fight was about the name and not the taste .
thankfully , for once at least , the european commission saw sense .
apfelwein , it was announced on tuesday , will remain a wine after all . " in the context of the negotiations on the wine reform we will find a solution to allow apfelwein and other fruit and berry wines to continue to be marketed as they are now - namely as fruit wines , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said in a statement that will surely be quoted when she picks up her future nobel peace prize for averting the conflict . " contrary to what i have read in the newspapers over recent days , it was never our intention to stop the production of these products , " she said , adding that germany and brussels would work for a compromise at a meeting of farm ministers in december . reports suggest that the state of emergency in hesse has since been scaled back . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

's original sceptical friend just after french president nicolas sarkozy flies out of the us , german chancellor angela merkel flies in .
both european leaders have sought to improve their ties with the us , but the trio does n't agree on everything . dw-radio spoke with john hulsman , an alfred von oppenheim scholar in residence at the german council on foreign relations in berlin . dw-radio : a lot has been said about how nicolas sarkozy in france and angela merkel in germany have turned around their relationships with the us since the iraq invasion .
how aligned is europe now with washington on international issues ? john hulsman : the fascinating thing about the big three , and i 'd throw the united kingdom in there as well , is that they are all coming to a similar position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could merkel , sarkozy and brown usher in a new era of eu-us relations ?
mr. sarkozy looked at the chirac presidency and saw that france had absolutely no stake in the middle east after opposing the americans over iraq .
that he was , in effect , too far away from america to be a major decision player - and that 's one thing french presidents , regardless of their politics , all want to be .
so he needs to move closer to america to matter . gordon brown has the opposite problem .
tony blair moved too close to president bush and it ruined his premiership , so gordon brown moved slightly away from the united states , while retaining close ties . and they both row to an island where they find angela merkel who staked out this position of " skeptical friendship " ahead of time .
which is that of course we support america .
of course america 's an ally , and we share values but that does n't mean we 're your lapdog and we 're going to agree with you issue after issue . german chancellor angela merkel arrives in the us on friday .
do you think she ’ ll receive a warm a welcome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush share a mutual respect for each other yes , president bush thinks extremely highly of chancellor merkel .
she 's proven to be not flamboyant , not showy but to get the job done diplomatically behind closed doors .
again -lsb- she has -rsb- this kind of european view of skeptical friendship .
that we need the united states , we must work with them but that we 're not going to be their lapdog .
this is really her invention . the atmospherics after chancellor schröder were awful , and chancellor merkel entered very clear and in a straight way by saying that america remains a great ally of germany but that does n't mean she 's in favor of guantanamo bay , renditions , torture , etc . what will chancellor merkel be talking about in her discussions with president bush ? it 's a number of issues that i do n't think grab attention but really matter .
for instance , her plans to free up currency flows between europe and the united states by talking about common regulations .
this is an issue that will take years - if not decades - to negotiate but will actually help both european and american economies immensely .
in the absence of a free trade deal this may be the closest we can get to actually improving cooperation between our two huge and important economies . certainly the other issue will be chancellor merkel 's signature issue , which is climate change .
can we reach some sort of post-kyoto protocol ?
this again is going to take a very long time and probably wo n't be decided until president bush has a successor .
but she has moved the president to say things like " actually climate change is a problem , " and that was a huge change from when president bush came into office .
that 's entirely due to chancellor angela merkel chipping away at him from outside and -lsb- california -rsb- governor arnold schwarzenegger chipping away at president bush from within the country . interview : nathan wiktop -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

's original sceptical friend just after french president nicolas sarkozy flies out of the us , german chancellor angela merkel flies in .
both european leaders have sought to improve their ties with the us , but the trio does n't agree on everything . dw-radio spoke with john hulsman , an alfred von oppenheim scholar in residence at the german council on foreign relations in berlin . dw-radio : a lot has been said about how nicolas sarkozy in france and angela merkel in germany have turned around their relationships with the us since the iraq invasion .
how aligned is europe now with washington on international issues ? john hulsman : the fascinating thing about the big three , and i 'd throw the united kingdom in there as well , is that they are all coming to a similar position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could merkel , sarkozy and brown usher in a new era of eu-us relations ?
mr. sarkozy looked at the chirac presidency and saw that france had absolutely no stake in the middle east after opposing the americans over iraq .
that he was , in effect , too far away from america to be a major decision player - and that 's one thing french presidents , regardless of their politics , all want to be .
so he needs to move closer to america to matter . gordon brown has the opposite problem .
tony blair moved too close to president bush and it ruined his premiership , so gordon brown moved slightly away from the united states , while retaining close ties . and they both row to an island where they find angela merkel who staked out this position of " skeptical friendship " ahead of time .
which is that of course we support america .
of course america 's an ally , and we share values but that does n't mean we 're your lapdog and we 're going to agree with you issue after issue . german chancellor angela merkel arrives in the us on friday .
do you think she ’ ll receive a warm a welcome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush share a mutual respect for each other yes , president bush thinks extremely highly of chancellor merkel .
she 's proven to be not flamboyant , not showy but to get the job done diplomatically behind closed doors .
again -lsb- she has -rsb- this kind of european view of skeptical friendship .
that we need the united states , we must work with them but that we 're not going to be their lapdog .
this is really her invention . the atmospherics after chancellor schröder were awful , and chancellor merkel entered very clear and in a straight way by saying that america remains a great ally of germany but that does n't mean she 's in favor of guantanamo bay , renditions , torture , etc . what will chancellor merkel be talking about in her discussions with president bush ? it 's a number of issues that i do n't think grab attention but really matter .
for instance , her plans to free up currency flows between europe and the united states by talking about common regulations .
this is an issue that will take years - if not decades - to negotiate but will actually help both european and american economies immensely .
in the absence of a free trade deal this may be the closest we can get to actually improving cooperation between our two huge and important economies . certainly the other issue will be chancellor merkel 's signature issue , which is climate change .
can we reach some sort of post-kyoto protocol ?
this again is going to take a very long time and probably wo n't be decided until president bush has a successor .
but she has moved the president to say things like " actually climate change is a problem , " and that was a huge change from when president bush came into office .

many times , the reason is long forgotten in the horror which follows .
luckily , no one will have to face the shame of one breaking out over apple wine . it was set to be the biggest battle over eu designations since the infamous champagne war of 2005 and the equally distressing feta incident of 2002 .
but , somewhat ironically considering the nature of the dispute in the first place , common sense has prevailed to end the apfelwein rebellion of 2007 before any sap was spilt . the german campaign , led by hesse premier roland koch with support from federal agriculture minister horst seehofer , was ready to storm the gates of the eurocrat fortresses in brussels to fight for the right to have the traditional cider-like brew recognized as a wine . the eu claimed that the regional drink fell foul of a proposal from the european commission to use the term " wine " purely for grape products . koch and seehofer target euro madness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch : " madness " an outraged koch vehemently defended his state 's brew and the drums of conflict began to sound . " we will not allow our traditional name to be sacrificed to regulatory madness in brussels , " koch ranted earlier this week .
" we will fight with all the means at our disposal for our apple wine . " seehofer , obviously seeing the worth in throwing his federal weight behind such an affront to german tradition , joined what he called a " justified " cause . " the minister definitely wants to save the terms apfelwein and obstwein -lsb- fruit wine -rsb- , while it should be made clear to consumers that these are not grape products , " seehofer bravely stated - through a spokesperson - to a gaggle of unpatriotic reporters . anyone who has found the sour tasting regional icon to be unpalatable may appreciate the german efforts out of principle alone .
apfelwein , which is also known under various other terms like " ebbelwoi " and " apfelmost , " is seen as an oddity in the rest of the country and those who have no love of its taste would struggle to defend it . devastation averted eu peacemakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt was awash with apfelwein as peace broke out but this fight was about the name and not the taste .
thankfully , for once at least , the european commission saw sense .
apfelwein , it was announced on tuesday , will remain a wine after all . " in the context of the negotiations on the wine reform we will find a solution to allow apfelwein and other fruit and berry wines to continue to be marketed as they are now - namely as fruit wines , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said in a statement that will surely be quoted when she picks up her future nobel peace prize for averting the conflict . " contrary to what i have read in the newspapers over recent days , it was never our intention to stop the production of these products , " she said , adding that germany and brussels would work for a compromise at a meeting of farm ministers in december . reports suggest that the state of emergency in hesse has since been scaled back . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the council -lsb- of ministers -rsb- agreed that the conditions for the lifting of internal borders with nine new member states have been met , " a council source told dpa on thursday , nov .
8 . the nine new schengen members are : estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovenia , slovakia and the czech republic . the move , seen in brussels as an early christmas present , will bring an end to long queues of people and road freight at borders , a problem that has grown into a priority for the countries since they joined the eu in 2004 . the first of the two conditions needed for joining was met by the nine in early september when the countries plugged into an electronic database that allows authorities to swap details on wanted people , objects or vehicles . for the second condition , concerning the security of their borders with non-eu countries , experts have over the last year inspected the controls and described them , according to a draft eu text , as " satisfying . " the european parliament must also approve nine countries ' entry into the schengen agreement , but this is largely considered a formality . air controls to be relaxed in march bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restrictions at airports will be lifted next year thursday 's decision applies only to land and sea borders .
passport controls at airports are to remain in place in the nine new members until the end of march 2008 . " this is a historical event and a moment of great joy - not a threat - for germany , " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said . schengen is the term denoting a body of eu law granting greater freedom of movement for persons .
it abolishes passport checks within its internal borders and establishes common external borders among members . the expanded schengen area will comprise 22 member states .
non-eu countries norway and iceland are in the schengen travel zone , but eu member britain has only agreed to participate in its provisions that concern police and judicial cooperation . bulgaria , cyprus , romania and switzerland , the latter which signed an agreement on its association with the bloc in 2004 , are expected to fully join the border-free zone in coming years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 08.11.2007 opinion : germany has no role to play in enduring freedom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by extending its participation in operation enduring freedom , germany is not making the world a safer place , said dw 's nina werkhäuser .
is n't it time berlin jumped ship ? germany 's role in operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- has long been controversial .
in the wake of the sept .
11 attacks , then chancellor gerhard schröder pledged the us unconditional solidarity and military support in its war on terror .
when his coalition partner , the green party , dug its heels in , schröder resorted to a vote of confidence in the german parliament to force the bundestag 's pacifist members to swallow a bundeswehr dispatch to afghanistan - and won by a narrow margin . back then , germany offered almost 4,000 troops to help out the americans in their fight against al qaeda and its allies , primarily in afghanistan .
unlike the isaf mission , which is mandated by united nations security council resolutions , operation enduring freedom is based on the us right to self-defense against terrorism - which is , granted , recognized by the security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nina werkhäuser nonetheless , six years since the launch of this mission , it is time to ask how long the right to self-defense remains a legitimate argument .
if the us is prepared to maintain its war on terror indefinitely , then the german role in the conflict needs to be defined once and for all .
this has yet to happen . according to the bundestag mandate , elite german special forces -lrb- ksk -rrb- have been deployed to afghanistan .
to this day , the precise nature of their mission is still a secret - for reasons of security , says berlin . all this mystery makes it almost impossible to assess germany 's participation in oef .
one member of parliament recently complained that the bundestag is denied information , while the government insists it has no information to share on operation enduring freedom .
for the last six years , berlin has maintained unreserved loyalty to the undertaking , despite the fact that washington apparently provides military updates only sporadically .
the number of civilian lives claimed in afghanistan is also information that tends to be swept under the carpet . but facts are all there is to go on .
ksk forces have not been in afghanistan since germany 's change of government two years ago . the country 's current contribution to oef is 250 marines stationed on the horn of africa , which still cost berlin some 65 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- this year alone .
past experience suggests that the german frigates do little to deter potential terrorists .
so why is berlin still faithful to operation enduring freedom ? berlin 's argument that it is unwilling to leave its allies in the lurch is a specious one .
more to the point , it is unwilling to anger washington .
germany 's involvement in operation enduring freedom does not make the world a safer place .
it is high time berlin abandoned it . nina werkhäuser covers foreign , defense and security policy affairs for dw-radio . -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german parliament extends afghanistan mission despite public opposition , over 75 percent of germany 's lower house voted on friday , oct .

" we are glad that we have taken another important step in clearing up the past , " he said .
" we have to do business as well and as cleanly as we can . " external auditors had found questionable sums totaling more than 1 billion euros in august , but siemens refused to comment at that time , saying their internal probe was still underway . most of the money is reported to have disappeared into secret bank accounts for use as bribes in securing contracts outside germany , the munich-based conglomerate said . revenues rise despite scandal stress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo peter löscher presented his company 's progress report in munich the company 's confession coincided with the release of a relatively bright quarterly report on thursday . revenue grew by 9 percent to 20.2 billion euros while operating profits rose 166 percent in the last quarter of the 2006-2007 fiscal year , which ended on sept .
30 , siemens said in a statement .
growth was particularly strong in the asia-pacific regions . at the same time , however , the group posted a net loss of 74 million euros , compared to the same period last year .
the loss can be attributed to 1 billion euros in taxes on the sale of its vds subsidiary to the continental automotive group as well 201 million euros in fines in connection with the bribery scandal . löscher is also scheduled to meets with officials from the us securities and exchange commission .
the wall street watchdog may also impose hefty finds on the company , which is listed on the new york stock exchange as well as in frankfurt . investors , however , seemed pleased with the company 's transparency .

8 , georgian president mikhail saakashvili he set a date of jan .
5 , media reports from the capital tbilisi said .
saakashvili said he decided to hold the vote , originally scheduled for late 2008 , " to receive the trust of the people . " " i , as president of this nation , take this decision and make this proposal to hold a vote of confidence on my mandate , to receive unambiguous support from you to continue building our country , " he said . " the president 's statement is a victory for the georgian people , " said david zurabishvili , one of the leaders of the democratic front .
" the role of the opposition was only to bring the idea of the people to the president . " the opposition is now conferring to find a candidate to run against saakashvili . according to the georgian constitution , the president is elected for a five-year term and the early election will still require parliamentary approval .
a pro-saakashvili majority in parliament is expected to quickly endorse his decision . after six days of opposition protests , prime minister zurab nogaideli said on wednesday that saakashvili had declared a state of emergency in the capital tbilisi because of " an attempt at a state coup . " meanwhile , economic development minister georgi arvaladze said in a televised statement that saakashvili had imposed restrictions on public gatherings and the media , closing all television networks except state-controlled stations . post-revolution disillusionment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators have been calling for new elections for days the move came after a further day of running battles between riot police and demonstrators demanding the resignation of saakashvili , who came to power in the peaceful 2003 " rose revolution . "
the violence erupted when unarmed police attempted to disperse a rally on rustaveli avenue near parliament , in the center of the ancient city . accusing the president of corruption , political killings and failing to address widespread poverty in the country , the protestors had called for early elections . " we are demanding saakashvili 's resignation after such terrible and savage use of force , " said levan berdenishvili , a leader of the opposition .
" such uncivilized methods can not be allowed by any state . " saakashvili has repeatedly stressed that he will not resign and said he intends to run for re-election . " i , as the leader of this nation , need your mandate to cope with any external threat , to manage any pressure and to do away with an attempt to annex georgia 's territory , " he said . the afp news agency reported that according to health officials , some 500 people had been hospitalized wednesday after clashes with police , who fired rubber bullets , tear gas , and water cannons .
most were released after being treated for minor injuries and exposure to tear gas . later , the pro-opposition imedi television station went off air after an anchor said that government special forces had entered the broadcaster 's building . " anti-russian hysteria " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests started a week ago " high-ranking officials in russian special services are behind this , " said saakashvili in a televised national address , adding that they were " trying to gain a foothold among some of the radical opposition parties . " saakashvili announced that several russian diplomats would be expelled for engaging in " subversive , espionage activity in georgia . "
three diplomats were due for expulsion , according to interfax news agency . dismissing the claims as " anti-russian hysteria , " the russian foreign ministry described the accusations as irresponsible and said that any expulsion of russian diplomats would elicit an " appropriate response . " georgia , which frequently accuses russia of causing trouble in the former soviet republic which has cultivated close ties with washington in recent years , also recalled its ambassador from moscow , the foreign ministry revealed . staunchly pro-western , saakashvili has angered moscow with his push to join nato and his attempts to regain sovereignty over two breakaway pro-russian provinces . international concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili gave in to protesters ' demands the white house said it was " concerned " by the unrest in georgia , urging the government and opposition to resolve their differences peacefully and to shun steps that could provoke violence . " neither side ... should take any steps that would be deliberately provocative to the other and could lead to violence , " state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters . the european union 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , called for restraint , saying " political differences should be resolved within the democratic institutions .

5 , media reports from the capital tbilisi said .
saakashvili said he decided to hold the vote , originally scheduled for late 2008 , " to receive the trust of the people . " " i , as president of this nation , take this decision and make this proposal to hold a vote of confidence on my mandate , to receive unambiguous support from you to continue building our country , " he said . " the president 's statement is a victory for the georgian people , " said david zurabishvili , one of the leaders of the democratic front .
" the role of the opposition was only to bring the idea of the people to the president . " the opposition is now conferring to find a candidate to run against saakashvili . according to the georgian constitution , the president is elected for a five-year term and the early election will still require parliamentary approval .
a pro-saakashvili majority in parliament is expected to quickly endorse his decision . after six days of opposition protests , prime minister zurab nogaideli said on wednesday that saakashvili had declared a state of emergency in the capital tbilisi because of " an attempt at a state coup . " meanwhile , economic development minister georgi arvaladze said in a televised statement that saakashvili had imposed restrictions on public gatherings and the media , closing all television networks except state-controlled stations . post-revolution disillusionment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators have been calling for new elections for days the move came after a further day of running battles between riot police and demonstrators demanding the resignation of saakashvili , who came to power in the peaceful 2003 " rose revolution . "
the violence erupted when unarmed police attempted to disperse a rally on rustaveli avenue near parliament , in the center of the ancient city . accusing the president of corruption , political killings and failing to address widespread poverty in the country , the protestors had called for early elections . " we are demanding saakashvili 's resignation after such terrible and savage use of force , " said levan berdenishvili , a leader of the opposition .
" such uncivilized methods can not be allowed by any state . " saakashvili has repeatedly stressed that he will not resign and said he intends to run for re-election . " i , as the leader of this nation , need your mandate to cope with any external threat , to manage any pressure and to do away with an attempt to annex georgia 's territory , " he said . the afp news agency reported that according to health officials , some 500 people had been hospitalized wednesday after clashes with police , who fired rubber bullets , tear gas , and water cannons .
most were released after being treated for minor injuries and exposure to tear gas . later , the pro-opposition imedi television station went off air after an anchor said that government special forces had entered the broadcaster 's building . " anti-russian hysteria " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests started a week ago " high-ranking officials in russian special services are behind this , " said saakashvili in a televised national address , adding that they were " trying to gain a foothold among some of the radical opposition parties . " saakashvili announced that several russian diplomats would be expelled for engaging in " subversive , espionage activity in georgia . "
three diplomats were due for expulsion , according to interfax news agency . dismissing the claims as " anti-russian hysteria , " the russian foreign ministry described the accusations as irresponsible and said that any expulsion of russian diplomats would elicit an " appropriate response . " georgia , which frequently accuses russia of causing trouble in the former soviet republic which has cultivated close ties with washington in recent years , also recalled its ambassador from moscow , the foreign ministry revealed . staunchly pro-western , saakashvili has angered moscow with his push to join nato and his attempts to regain sovereignty over two breakaway pro-russian provinces . international concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili gave in to protesters ' demands the white house said it was " concerned " by the unrest in georgia , urging the government and opposition to resolve their differences peacefully and to shun steps that could provoke violence . " neither side ... should take any steps that would be deliberately provocative to the other and could lead to violence , " state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters . the european union 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , called for restraint , saying " political differences should be resolved within the democratic institutions .

's original sceptical friend just after french president nicolas sarkozy flies out of the us , german chancellor angela merkel flies in .
both european leaders have sought to improve their ties with the us , but the trio does n't agree on everything . dw-radio spoke with john hulsman , an alfred von oppenheim scholar in residence at the german council on foreign relations in berlin . dw-radio : a lot has been said about how nicolas sarkozy in france and angela merkel in germany have turned around their relationships with the us since the iraq invasion .
how aligned is europe now with washington on international issues ? john hulsman : the fascinating thing about the big three , and i 'd throw the united kingdom in there as well , is that they are all coming to a similar position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could merkel , sarkozy and brown usher in a new era of eu-us relations ?
mr. sarkozy looked at the chirac presidency and saw that france had absolutely no stake in the middle east after opposing the americans over iraq .
that he was , in effect , too far away from america to be a major decision player - and that 's one thing french presidents , regardless of their politics , all want to be .
so he needs to move closer to america to matter . gordon brown has the opposite problem .
tony blair moved too close to president bush and it ruined his premiership , so gordon brown moved slightly away from the united states , while retaining close ties . and they both row to an island where they find angela merkel who staked out this position of " skeptical friendship " ahead of time .
which is that of course we support america .
of course america 's an ally , and we share values but that does n't mean we 're your lapdog and we 're going to agree with you issue after issue . german chancellor angela merkel arrives in the us on friday .
do you think she ’ ll receive a warm a welcome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush share a mutual respect for each other yes , president bush thinks extremely highly of chancellor merkel .
she 's proven to be not flamboyant , not showy but to get the job done diplomatically behind closed doors .
again -lsb- she has -rsb- this kind of european view of skeptical friendship .
that we need the united states , we must work with them but that we 're not going to be their lapdog .
this is really her invention . the atmospherics after chancellor schröder were awful , and chancellor merkel entered very clear and in a straight way by saying that america remains a great ally of germany but that does n't mean she 's in favor of guantanamo bay , renditions , torture , etc . what will chancellor merkel be talking about in her discussions with president bush ? it 's a number of issues that i do n't think grab attention but really matter .
for instance , her plans to free up currency flows between europe and the united states by talking about common regulations .
this is an issue that will take years - if not decades - to negotiate but will actually help both european and american economies immensely .
in the absence of a free trade deal this may be the closest we can get to actually improving cooperation between our two huge and important economies . certainly the other issue will be chancellor merkel 's signature issue , which is climate change .
can we reach some sort of post-kyoto protocol ?
this again is going to take a very long time and probably wo n't be decided until president bush has a successor .
but she has moved the president to say things like " actually climate change is a problem , " and that was a huge change from when president bush came into office .

luckily , no one will have to face the shame of one breaking out over apple wine . it was set to be the biggest battle over eu designations since the infamous champagne war of 2005 and the equally distressing feta incident of 2002 .
but , somewhat ironically considering the nature of the dispute in the first place , common sense has prevailed to end the apfelwein rebellion of 2007 before any sap was spilt . the german campaign , led by hesse premier roland koch with support from federal agriculture minister horst seehofer , was ready to storm the gates of the eurocrat fortresses in brussels to fight for the right to have the traditional cider-like brew recognized as a wine . the eu claimed that the regional drink fell foul of a proposal from the european commission to use the term " wine " purely for grape products . koch and seehofer target euro madness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch : " madness " an outraged koch vehemently defended his state 's brew and the drums of conflict began to sound .

many times , the reason is long forgotten in the horror which follows .
luckily , no one will have to face the shame of one breaking out over apple wine . it was set to be the biggest battle over eu designations since the infamous champagne war of 2005 and the equally distressing feta incident of 2002 .
but , somewhat ironically considering the nature of the dispute in the first place , common sense has prevailed to end the apfelwein rebellion of 2007 before any sap was spilt . the german campaign , led by hesse premier roland koch with support from federal agriculture minister horst seehofer , was ready to storm the gates of the eurocrat fortresses in brussels to fight for the right to have the traditional cider-like brew recognized as a wine . the eu claimed that the regional drink fell foul of a proposal from the european commission to use the term " wine " purely for grape products . koch and seehofer target euro madness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch : " madness " an outraged koch vehemently defended his state 's brew and the drums of conflict began to sound . " we will not allow our traditional name to be sacrificed to regulatory madness in brussels , " koch ranted earlier this week .
" we will fight with all the means at our disposal for our apple wine . " seehofer , obviously seeing the worth in throwing his federal weight behind such an affront to german tradition , joined what he called a " justified " cause . " the minister definitely wants to save the terms apfelwein and obstwein -lsb- fruit wine -rsb- , while it should be made clear to consumers that these are not grape products , " seehofer bravely stated - through a spokesperson - to a gaggle of unpatriotic reporters . anyone who has found the sour tasting regional icon to be unpalatable may appreciate the german efforts out of principle alone .
apfelwein , which is also known under various other terms like " ebbelwoi " and " apfelmost , " is seen as an oddity in the rest of the country and those who have no love of its taste would struggle to defend it . devastation averted eu peacemakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt was awash with apfelwein as peace broke out but this fight was about the name and not the taste .
thankfully , for once at least , the european commission saw sense .
apfelwein , it was announced on tuesday , will remain a wine after all . " in the context of the negotiations on the wine reform we will find a solution to allow apfelwein and other fruit and berry wines to continue to be marketed as they are now - namely as fruit wines , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said in a statement that will surely be quoted when she picks up her future nobel peace prize for averting the conflict .

" we are glad that we have taken another important step in clearing up the past , " he said .
" we have to do business as well and as cleanly as we can . " external auditors had found questionable sums totaling more than 1 billion euros in august , but siemens refused to comment at that time , saying their internal probe was still underway . most of the money is reported to have disappeared into secret bank accounts for use as bribes in securing contracts outside germany , the munich-based conglomerate said . revenues rise despite scandal stress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo peter löscher presented his company 's progress report in munich the company 's confession coincided with the release of a relatively bright quarterly report on thursday . revenue grew by 9 percent to 20.2 billion euros while operating profits rose 166 percent in the last quarter of the 2006-2007 fiscal year , which ended on sept .

growth was particularly strong in the asia-pacific regions . at the same time , however , the group posted a net loss of 74 million euros , compared to the same period last year .
the loss can be attributed to 1 billion euros in taxes on the sale of its vds subsidiary to the continental automotive group as well 201 million euros in fines in connection with the bribery scandal . löscher is also scheduled to meets with officials from the us securities and exchange commission .

is n't it time berlin jumped ship ? germany 's role in operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- has long been controversial .
in the wake of the sept .
11 attacks , then chancellor gerhard schröder pledged the us unconditional solidarity and military support in its war on terror .
when his coalition partner , the green party , dug its heels in , schröder resorted to a vote of confidence in the german parliament to force the bundestag 's pacifist members to swallow a bundeswehr dispatch to afghanistan - and won by a narrow margin . back then , germany offered almost 4,000 troops to help out the americans in their fight against al qaeda and its allies , primarily in afghanistan .
unlike the isaf mission , which is mandated by united nations security council resolutions , operation enduring freedom is based on the us right to self-defense against terrorism - which is , granted , recognized by the security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nina werkhäuser nonetheless , six years since the launch of this mission , it is time to ask how long the right to self-defense remains a legitimate argument .
if the us is prepared to maintain its war on terror indefinitely , then the german role in the conflict needs to be defined once and for all .
this has yet to happen . according to the bundestag mandate , elite german special forces -lrb- ksk -rrb- have been deployed to afghanistan .
to this day , the precise nature of their mission is still a secret - for reasons of security , says berlin . all this mystery makes it almost impossible to assess germany 's participation in oef .
one member of parliament recently complained that the bundestag is denied information , while the government insists it has no information to share on operation enduring freedom .
for the last six years , berlin has maintained unreserved loyalty to the undertaking , despite the fact that washington apparently provides military updates only sporadically .
the number of civilian lives claimed in afghanistan is also information that tends to be swept under the carpet . but facts are all there is to go on .
ksk forces have not been in afghanistan since germany 's change of government two years ago . the country 's current contribution to oef is 250 marines stationed on the horn of africa , which still cost berlin some 65 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- this year alone .
past experience suggests that the german frigates do little to deter potential terrorists .
so why is berlin still faithful to operation enduring freedom ? berlin 's argument that it is unwilling to leave its allies in the lurch is a specious one .
more to the point , it is unwilling to anger washington .
germany 's involvement in operation enduring freedom does not make the world a safer place .
it is high time berlin abandoned it . nina werkhäuser covers foreign , defense and security policy affairs for dw-radio . -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 .
germany took seventh place . according to the gender gap report , released by the world economic forum , germany successfully narrowed its gender gap from a year ago .
but because other countries made even greater progress , germany 's overall ranking dropped , from fifth place to seventh . the wef study measures international gender equality by looking at four key areas : women 's economic participation in society ; their levels of health and education ; and their political empowerment .
economist saadia zahidi , one of the authors of the report , noted that while germany 's lowest rating was in the area of economic participation , " its scores make it a high-ranking country compared to others , particularly in europe . " as in 2006 , the top-most ranks were swept by a brace of scandinavian nations .
but germany " is actually doing much better in comparison to other countries , especially countries like italy , france or malta , " which fell much lower down in the rankings overall , zahidi said . dw-world.de spoke with zahidi about the purpose , and potential pitfalls , of carrying out a sweeping gender study . dw-world.de : the concept of a gender gap report is a fairly new one .
can you explain its purpose ? saadia zahidi : the global gender gap index tries to examine the gap between women and men in various areas .
it is looking at gaps , rather than levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zahidi : " countries should capitalize on half their resources " for example having an index that tells a country like bangladesh that it has lower levels of education than sweden is not very useful , they already know that .
they 're a poor country .
what this index tries to answer is , for example , whether bangladesh has a bigger gap on education than a comparable country such as pakistan . everything we do is rewarding parity .
it is not rewarding women 's supremacy over men , or men 's supremacy over women .
it is rewarding countries that aim to distribute their resources equally between women and men . so how does one measure parity ? a key feature of the index is that it has a fixed scale , with " zero " being inequality , and " one " being equality .
a score of 0.75 can be approximately interpreted as meaning , 75 percent of the gap in that country has been closed .
it is all relative to a benchmark , which is the number " one . "
it allows us to track the changes over time . statistical data is notoriously slippery .
do you think your report gives an accurate picture of the state of gender equality in the world ? the report is actually based on 14 different variables , 13 of which come from hard data sources , like the united nations development program , the international labor organization and the world health organization .
this is all hard statistics , which simply look at things such as labor force participation rates , or the number of women ministers , or literacy rates . all we have done is provide a framework that allows us to look at these hard facts in such a way that gives you an idea of where this country stands in terms of gap , compared to other countries in the world .
so yes , i think it does provide an accurate picture . why gather this information ?
who uses it ? we 've tried to make it something that is going to be useful for general awareness , and we believe the rankings will help do that .
but because we 've provided a lot of details , it is also a reference tool for international organizations and national governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education levels are compared in the study it has also become a catalyst for academic research .
quite a lot of academics contact us for details from the index , wondering about the connections between certain policies and their outcomes . germany ranked seventh overall this year , and scored relatively well in terms of economic participation .
but newspapers here are full of articles about glass ceilings , a stubborn wage gap , and social education practices that make it hard for mothers to re-enter the work force .
how does that add up ? in our study we look at the overall workplace participation rate .
in the global statistics , it appears germany is doing well in terms of labor force participation of women , whereas italy and france are not doing as well . how many women actually go back into the workplace after having children is n't something we include in the index .
but we do provide information on the length of paid maternity leave , which is 14 weeks in germany , and the maternity benefits , which is that the wages are 100 percent paid , partly by social security up to a certain level , and the rest by the employer . how meaningful is this kind of measurement ?
the philippines , where women 's situation is not usually thought of as being very good , was ranked sixth - right above germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , unlike saudi arabia , women are commonly active in politics that goes back to what i said earlier : the index looks at gaps , not levels .
so we 're not worried about what is the overall level of resources in the philippines compared to that in the united kingdom .
what we do show is that relatively speaking , those resources are being divided more equitably in the philippines as compared to in the uk . … as to whether this is meaningful , it may not be - except to be a striking example of how this could be a priority for all countries , whether rich or poor . are the relative wealth or poverty of the 128 countries you include reflected in the study ? what we have done is divide rankings by income groups ; low income compared to low income countries , high income to high income . … we find that within each of these income groups there are countries that perform very well , and others that perform poorly . in the high income group , for example , sweden does extremely well , but saudi arabia does very poorly .
or in the lower and lower-middle group , there are countries like philippines and tanzania that do very well , but also countries like pakistan and yemen that do badly . it all goes a long way toward showing that gender equality is not a luxury good , and that it is something all countries can aspire towards . do most countries see gender equality as an ideal to be strived for ? that is one of the key messages we are trying to spread with this report .
clearly this is a human rights challenge , but it is also an economic challenge .
countries that are not capitalizing on half of their resource pool will be undermining their competitive potential in the long run .
this is definitely one of the key messages we highlight in this report . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but germany " is actually doing much better in comparison to other countries , especially countries like italy , france or malta , " which fell much lower down in the rankings overall , zahidi said . dw-world.de spoke with zahidi about the purpose , and potential pitfalls , of carrying out a sweeping gender study . dw-world.de : the concept of a gender gap report is a fairly new one .
can you explain its purpose ? saadia zahidi : the global gender gap index tries to examine the gap between women and men in various areas .
it is looking at gaps , rather than levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zahidi : " countries should capitalize on half their resources " for example having an index that tells a country like bangladesh that it has lower levels of education than sweden is not very useful , they already know that .
they 're a poor country .
what this index tries to answer is , for example , whether bangladesh has a bigger gap on education than a comparable country such as pakistan . everything we do is rewarding parity .
it is not rewarding women 's supremacy over men , or men 's supremacy over women .
it is rewarding countries that aim to distribute their resources equally between women and men . so how does one measure parity ? a key feature of the index is that it has a fixed scale , with " zero " being inequality , and " one " being equality .
a score of 0.75 can be approximately interpreted as meaning , 75 percent of the gap in that country has been closed .
it is all relative to a benchmark , which is the number " one . "
it allows us to track the changes over time . statistical data is notoriously slippery .
do you think your report gives an accurate picture of the state of gender equality in the world ? the report is actually based on 14 different variables , 13 of which come from hard data sources , like the united nations development program , the international labor organization and the world health organization .
this is all hard statistics , which simply look at things such as labor force participation rates , or the number of women ministers , or literacy rates . all we have done is provide a framework that allows us to look at these hard facts in such a way that gives you an idea of where this country stands in terms of gap , compared to other countries in the world .
so yes , i think it does provide an accurate picture . why gather this information ?
who uses it ? we 've tried to make it something that is going to be useful for general awareness , and we believe the rankings will help do that .
but because we 've provided a lot of details , it is also a reference tool for international organizations and national governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education levels are compared in the study it has also become a catalyst for academic research .
quite a lot of academics contact us for details from the index , wondering about the connections between certain policies and their outcomes . germany ranked seventh overall this year , and scored relatively well in terms of economic participation .
but newspapers here are full of articles about glass ceilings , a stubborn wage gap , and social education practices that make it hard for mothers to re-enter the work force .
how does that add up ? in our study we look at the overall workplace participation rate .
in the global statistics , it appears germany is doing well in terms of labor force participation of women , whereas italy and france are not doing as well . how many women actually go back into the workplace after having children is n't something we include in the index .
but we do provide information on the length of paid maternity leave , which is 14 weeks in germany , and the maternity benefits , which is that the wages are 100 percent paid , partly by social security up to a certain level , and the rest by the employer . how meaningful is this kind of measurement ?
the philippines , where women 's situation is not usually thought of as being very good , was ranked sixth - right above germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , unlike saudi arabia , women are commonly active in politics that goes back to what i said earlier : the index looks at gaps , not levels .
so we 're not worried about what is the overall level of resources in the philippines compared to that in the united kingdom .
what we do show is that relatively speaking , those resources are being divided more equitably in the philippines as compared to in the uk . … as to whether this is meaningful , it may not be - except to be a striking example of how this could be a priority for all countries , whether rich or poor . are the relative wealth or poverty of the 128 countries you include reflected in the study ? what we have done is divide rankings by income groups ; low income compared to low income countries , high income to high income . … we find that within each of these income groups there are countries that perform very well , and others that perform poorly . in the high income group , for example , sweden does extremely well , but saudi arabia does very poorly .
or in the lower and lower-middle group , there are countries like philippines and tanzania that do very well , but also countries like pakistan and yemen that do badly . it all goes a long way toward showing that gender equality is not a luxury good , and that it is something all countries can aspire towards . do most countries see gender equality as an ideal to be strived for ? that is one of the key messages we are trying to spread with this report .
clearly this is a human rights challenge , but it is also an economic challenge .
countries that are not capitalizing on half of their resource pool will be undermining their competitive potential in the long run .
this is definitely one of the key messages we highlight in this report . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 .
germany took seventh place . according to the gender gap report , released by the world economic forum , germany successfully narrowed its gender gap from a year ago .
but because other countries made even greater progress , germany 's overall ranking dropped , from fifth place to seventh . the wef study measures international gender equality by looking at four key areas : women 's economic participation in society ; their levels of health and education ; and their political empowerment .
economist saadia zahidi , one of the authors of the report , noted that while germany 's lowest rating was in the area of economic participation , " its scores make it a high-ranking country compared to others , particularly in europe . " as in 2006 , the top-most ranks were swept by a brace of scandinavian nations .
but germany " is actually doing much better in comparison to other countries , especially countries like italy , france or malta , " which fell much lower down in the rankings overall , zahidi said . dw-world.de spoke with zahidi about the purpose , and potential pitfalls , of carrying out a sweeping gender study . dw-world.de : the concept of a gender gap report is a fairly new one .
can you explain its purpose ? saadia zahidi : the global gender gap index tries to examine the gap between women and men in various areas .
it is looking at gaps , rather than levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zahidi : " countries should capitalize on half their resources " for example having an index that tells a country like bangladesh that it has lower levels of education than sweden is not very useful , they already know that .
they 're a poor country .
what this index tries to answer is , for example , whether bangladesh has a bigger gap on education than a comparable country such as pakistan . everything we do is rewarding parity .
it is not rewarding women 's supremacy over men , or men 's supremacy over women .
it is rewarding countries that aim to distribute their resources equally between women and men . so how does one measure parity ? a key feature of the index is that it has a fixed scale , with " zero " being inequality , and " one " being equality .
a score of 0.75 can be approximately interpreted as meaning , 75 percent of the gap in that country has been closed .
it is all relative to a benchmark , which is the number " one . "
it allows us to track the changes over time . statistical data is notoriously slippery .
do you think your report gives an accurate picture of the state of gender equality in the world ? the report is actually based on 14 different variables , 13 of which come from hard data sources , like the united nations development program , the international labor organization and the world health organization .
this is all hard statistics , which simply look at things such as labor force participation rates , or the number of women ministers , or literacy rates . all we have done is provide a framework that allows us to look at these hard facts in such a way that gives you an idea of where this country stands in terms of gap , compared to other countries in the world .
so yes , i think it does provide an accurate picture . why gather this information ?
who uses it ? we 've tried to make it something that is going to be useful for general awareness , and we believe the rankings will help do that .
but because we 've provided a lot of details , it is also a reference tool for international organizations and national governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education levels are compared in the study it has also become a catalyst for academic research .
quite a lot of academics contact us for details from the index , wondering about the connections between certain policies and their outcomes . germany ranked seventh overall this year , and scored relatively well in terms of economic participation .
but newspapers here are full of articles about glass ceilings , a stubborn wage gap , and social education practices that make it hard for mothers to re-enter the work force .
how does that add up ? in our study we look at the overall workplace participation rate .
in the global statistics , it appears germany is doing well in terms of labor force participation of women , whereas italy and france are not doing as well . how many women actually go back into the workplace after having children is n't something we include in the index .
but we do provide information on the length of paid maternity leave , which is 14 weeks in germany , and the maternity benefits , which is that the wages are 100 percent paid , partly by social security up to a certain level , and the rest by the employer . how meaningful is this kind of measurement ?
the philippines , where women 's situation is not usually thought of as being very good , was ranked sixth - right above germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , unlike saudi arabia , women are commonly active in politics that goes back to what i said earlier : the index looks at gaps , not levels .

in the wake of the sept .
11 attacks , then chancellor gerhard schröder pledged the us unconditional solidarity and military support in its war on terror .
when his coalition partner , the green party , dug its heels in , schröder resorted to a vote of confidence in the german parliament to force the bundestag 's pacifist members to swallow a bundeswehr dispatch to afghanistan - and won by a narrow margin . back then , germany offered almost 4,000 troops to help out the americans in their fight against al qaeda and its allies , primarily in afghanistan .
unlike the isaf mission , which is mandated by united nations security council resolutions , operation enduring freedom is based on the us right to self-defense against terrorism - which is , granted , recognized by the security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nina werkhäuser nonetheless , six years since the launch of this mission , it is time to ask how long the right to self-defense remains a legitimate argument .
if the us is prepared to maintain its war on terror indefinitely , then the german role in the conflict needs to be defined once and for all .
this has yet to happen . according to the bundestag mandate , elite german special forces -lrb- ksk -rrb- have been deployed to afghanistan .
to this day , the precise nature of their mission is still a secret - for reasons of security , says berlin . all this mystery makes it almost impossible to assess germany 's participation in oef .
one member of parliament recently complained that the bundestag is denied information , while the government insists it has no information to share on operation enduring freedom .
for the last six years , berlin has maintained unreserved loyalty to the undertaking , despite the fact that washington apparently provides military updates only sporadically .
the number of civilian lives claimed in afghanistan is also information that tends to be swept under the carpet . but facts are all there is to go on .
ksk forces have not been in afghanistan since germany 's change of government two years ago . the country 's current contribution to oef is 250 marines stationed on the horn of africa , which still cost berlin some 65 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- this year alone .
past experience suggests that the german frigates do little to deter potential terrorists .
so why is berlin still faithful to operation enduring freedom ? berlin 's argument that it is unwilling to leave its allies in the lurch is a specious one .
more to the point , it is unwilling to anger washington .

's original sceptical friend just after french president nicolas sarkozy flies out of the us , german chancellor angela merkel flies in .
both european leaders have sought to improve their ties with the us , but the trio does n't agree on everything . dw-radio spoke with john hulsman , an alfred von oppenheim scholar in residence at the german council on foreign relations in berlin . dw-radio : a lot has been said about how nicolas sarkozy in france and angela merkel in germany have turned around their relationships with the us since the iraq invasion .
how aligned is europe now with washington on international issues ? john hulsman : the fascinating thing about the big three , and i 'd throw the united kingdom in there as well , is that they are all coming to a similar position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could merkel , sarkozy and brown usher in a new era of eu-us relations ?
mr. sarkozy looked at the chirac presidency and saw that france had absolutely no stake in the middle east after opposing the americans over iraq .
that he was , in effect , too far away from america to be a major decision player - and that 's one thing french presidents , regardless of their politics , all want to be .
so he needs to move closer to america to matter . gordon brown has the opposite problem .
tony blair moved too close to president bush and it ruined his premiership , so gordon brown moved slightly away from the united states , while retaining close ties . and they both row to an island where they find angela merkel who staked out this position of " skeptical friendship " ahead of time .
which is that of course we support america .
of course america 's an ally , and we share values but that does n't mean we 're your lapdog and we 're going to agree with you issue after issue . german chancellor angela merkel arrives in the us on friday .
do you think she ’ ll receive a warm a welcome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and bush share a mutual respect for each other yes , president bush thinks extremely highly of chancellor merkel .
she 's proven to be not flamboyant , not showy but to get the job done diplomatically behind closed doors .
again -lsb- she has -rsb- this kind of european view of skeptical friendship .
that we need the united states , we must work with them but that we 're not going to be their lapdog .
this is really her invention . the atmospherics after chancellor schröder were awful , and chancellor merkel entered very clear and in a straight way by saying that america remains a great ally of germany but that does n't mean she 's in favor of guantanamo bay , renditions , torture , etc . what will chancellor merkel be talking about in her discussions with president bush ? it 's a number of issues that i do n't think grab attention but really matter .
for instance , her plans to free up currency flows between europe and the united states by talking about common regulations .
this is an issue that will take years - if not decades - to negotiate but will actually help both european and american economies immensely .
in the absence of a free trade deal this may be the closest we can get to actually improving cooperation between our two huge and important economies . certainly the other issue will be chancellor merkel 's signature issue , which is climate change .
can we reach some sort of post-kyoto protocol ?
this again is going to take a very long time and probably wo n't be decided until president bush has a successor .
but she has moved the president to say things like " actually climate change is a problem , " and that was a huge change from when president bush came into office .
that 's entirely due to chancellor angela merkel chipping away at him from outside and -lsb- california -rsb- governor arnold schwarzenegger chipping away at president bush from within the country . interview : nathan wiktop -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 08.11.2007 no sap spilt as peace breaks out in apfelwein war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tanks were called back from the belgian border after apfelwein was saved people go to war over many things ; religion , land , resources .
many times , the reason is long forgotten in the horror which follows .
luckily , no one will have to face the shame of one breaking out over apple wine . it was set to be the biggest battle over eu designations since the infamous champagne war of 2005 and the equally distressing feta incident of 2002 .
but , somewhat ironically considering the nature of the dispute in the first place , common sense has prevailed to end the apfelwein rebellion of 2007 before any sap was spilt . the german campaign , led by hesse premier roland koch with support from federal agriculture minister horst seehofer , was ready to storm the gates of the eurocrat fortresses in brussels to fight for the right to have the traditional cider-like brew recognized as a wine . the eu claimed that the regional drink fell foul of a proposal from the european commission to use the term " wine " purely for grape products . koch and seehofer target euro madness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch : " madness " an outraged koch vehemently defended his state 's brew and the drums of conflict began to sound . " we will not allow our traditional name to be sacrificed to regulatory madness in brussels , " koch ranted earlier this week .
" we will fight with all the means at our disposal for our apple wine . " seehofer , obviously seeing the worth in throwing his federal weight behind such an affront to german tradition , joined what he called a " justified " cause . " the minister definitely wants to save the terms apfelwein and obstwein -lsb- fruit wine -rsb- , while it should be made clear to consumers that these are not grape products , " seehofer bravely stated - through a spokesperson - to a gaggle of unpatriotic reporters . anyone who has found the sour tasting regional icon to be unpalatable may appreciate the german efforts out of principle alone .
apfelwein , which is also known under various other terms like " ebbelwoi " and " apfelmost , " is seen as an oddity in the rest of the country and those who have no love of its taste would struggle to defend it . devastation averted eu peacemakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt was awash with apfelwein as peace broke out but this fight was about the name and not the taste .
thankfully , for once at least , the european commission saw sense .
apfelwein , it was announced on tuesday , will remain a wine after all . " in the context of the negotiations on the wine reform we will find a solution to allow apfelwein and other fruit and berry wines to continue to be marketed as they are now - namely as fruit wines , " eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel said in a statement that will surely be quoted when she picks up her future nobel peace prize for averting the conflict . " contrary to what i have read in the newspapers over recent days , it was never our intention to stop the production of these products , " she said , adding that germany and brussels would work for a compromise at a meeting of farm ministers in december . reports suggest that the state of emergency in hesse has since been scaled back . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a king 's college london study of more than 2,000 women found those with higher vitamin d levels showed fewer ageing-related changes in their dna .
however , the american journal of clinical nutrition study stops short of proving cause and effect .
a lack of vitamin d , also found in some foods , has also been linked to multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis .
it 's possible that the same sunshine which may increase our risk of skin cancer may also have a healthy effect on the ageing process in general professor tim spector king 's college london the genetic material inside every cell has an inbuilt " clock " , which counts down every time the cell reproduces itself .
the shortening of these strands of dna called telomeres is one way of examining the ageing process at a cellular level .
snapshot measurement the king 's team looked at white blood cells , which tend to experience faster rates of turnover - and faster shortening of telomeres - when the body 's tissues are suffering more inflammation .
they looked at a total of 2,160 women aged between 18 and 79 , and took a snapshot measurement of the levels of vitamin d in their bloodstream , comparing this to the length of the telomeres in their white blood cells .
they found that , after adjusting the results for the age of the volunteer , women with higher levels of vitamin d were more likely to have longer telomeres in these cells , and vice versa .
what we do know is that while telomere length can be used as a biological marker , for an individual , it is not a very precise one professor thomas von zglinicki newcastle university professor brent richards , who led the study , said : " these results are exciting because they demonstrate for the first time that people who have higher levels of vitamin d may age more slowly than people with lower levels of vitamin d.
" this could help to explain how vitamin d has a protective effect on many ageing-related diseases , such as heart disease and cancer . "
another of the study 's authors , professor tim spector , said : " although it might sound absurd , it 's possible that the same sunshine which may increase our risk of skin cancer may also have a healthy effect on the ageing process in general . "
no proof the study authors , however , conceded that while this suggested a link between vitamin d levels and telomere length , it did not provide unequivocal evidence that vitamin d was responsible for this effect , rather than some other factor unaccounted for in the research , .
professor thomas von zglinicki , a leading telomere researcher from the university of newcastle , said that this was more evidence that telomere length could be related to ageing and age-related diseases .
however , he said : " what we do know is that while telomere length can be used as a biological marker , for an individual , it is not a very precise one .
" other studies have found that people who die at the same age can have significant differences in their telomere length - up to 30 times the differences described in this study .
" we just still do n't know how all the different factors that correlate to telomere length work together . "
he said that it was possible that vitamin d might not be delaying the shortening of telomeres , but that another factor which did this might alter the way the vitamin was created and metabolised by the body .

no proof the study authors , however , conceded that while this suggested a link between vitamin d levels and telomere length , it did not provide unequivocal evidence that vitamin d was responsible for this effect , rather than some other factor unaccounted for in the research , .
professor thomas von zglinicki , a leading telomere researcher from the university of newcastle , said that this was more evidence that telomere length could be related to ageing and age-related diseases .
however , he said : " what we do know is that while telomere length can be used as a biological marker , for an individual , it is not a very precise one .
" other studies have found that people who die at the same age can have significant differences in their telomere length - up to 30 times the differences described in this study .
" we just still do n't know how all the different factors that correlate to telomere length work together . "
he said that it was possible that vitamin d might not be delaying the shortening of telomeres , but that another factor which did this might alter the way the vitamin was created and metabolised by the body .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- vitamin d ' may help slow ageing ' bbc news / health graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- health contents : medical notes thursday , 8 november 2007 , 05:10 gmt vitamin d ' may help slow ageing ' a vitamin made when sunlight hits the skin could help slow down the ageing of cells and tissues , say researchers .
a king 's college london study of more than 2,000 women found those with higher vitamin d levels showed fewer ageing-related changes in their dna .
however , the american journal of clinical nutrition study stops short of proving cause and effect .
a lack of vitamin d , also found in some foods , has also been linked to multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis . "
it 's possible that the same sunshine which may increase our risk of skin cancer may also have a healthy effect on the ageing process in general " professor tim spector king 's college london the genetic material inside every cell has an inbuilt " clock " , which counts down every time the cell reproduces itself .
the shortening of these strands of dna called telomeres is one way of examining the ageing process at a cellular level .
snapshot measurement the king 's team looked at white blood cells , which tend to experience faster rates of turnover - and faster shortening of telomeres - when the body 's tissues are suffering more inflammation .
they looked at a total of 2,160 women aged between 18 and 79 , and took a snapshot measurement of the levels of vitamin d in their bloodstream , comparing this to the length of the telomeres in their white blood cells .
they found that , after adjusting the results for the age of the volunteer , women with higher levels of vitamin d were more likely to have longer telomeres in these cells , and vice versa . "
what we do know is that while telomere length can be used as a biological marker , for an individual , it is not a very precise one " professor thomas von zglinicki newcastle university professor brent richards , who led the study , said : " these results are exciting because they demonstrate for the first time that people who have higher levels of vitamin d may age more slowly than people with lower levels of vitamin d.
" this could help to explain how vitamin d has a protective effect on many ageing-related diseases , such as heart disease and cancer . "
another of the study 's authors , professor tim spector , said : " although it might sound absurd , it 's possible that the same sunshine which may increase our risk of skin cancer may also have a healthy effect on the ageing process in general . "

a total of five children were taken to hospital after swallowing tiny beads known as bindeez in australia and aqua dots in the us .
the beads were coated in chemicals which transformed into the banned drug when swallowed .
it is the latest in a series of safety scares over products made in china .
us toy maker mattel has recalled more than 20 million chinese-made toys this year .
coloured beads the toy has proved extremely popular in both countries .
in 2007 , bindeez was named australia 's toy of the year .
the toy consists of hundreds of brightly-coloured beads that can be arranged into a piece of art and sprayed with water to set .
the beads are meant to be coated in a non-toxic glue , but a batch in australia was found to be covered with a substance that did not match the approved formula .
in australia , two children in new south wales and one child in queensland have been hospitalised in the past two weeks after swallowing the beads .
all three have now recovered , but all of the country 's states and territories have now banned the toy .
in the us , two children were affected , the consumer product safety commission warned .
they slipped into comas , but later recovered .
about 4.2 million units of the toy will be recalled in the us , officials said , and about one million in australia .
australian-based manufacturer moose enterprises said the toys were made at a factory in southern china 's guangdong province .
the firm said bindeez beads would in future be covered with a " foul-tasting ingredient " to try to ensure children would not eat them .
the fair trading minister in australia 's new south wales , linda burney , said an investigation was under way to determine how batches of the chinese-made beads failed to match the approved formula .

the policy exchange report compared key economic indicators from towns that had received substantial funding , with the national average .
it found there were " no signs of improvement " in unemployment or income in the towns that had received funding .
the government said the majority of big cities had seen improvement since 1997 .
economic performance local government minister john healey said : " we totally reject these claims .
" our towns and cities have overcome years of decline and decay with economic performance rising in six out of eight of the largest cities in england since 1997 . "
the lse-affiliated think tank said that over the past 10 years there have been 14 core urban regeneration schemes , which have received a total £ 30bn in public funds .
for its report , entitled cities limited , the think-tank selected 18 towns and cities targeted for investment by between four and eight of the 14 schemes .
they then compared the economic performance of these " urban policy towns " with the national average , and with six towns that have not received funding but have economically out-performed the national average .
the urban policy towns include : sheffield , liverpool , hull , southampton , coventry , leicester and glasgow .

for unemployment , by the end of the decade there were still 50 % more people out of work in urban policy towns than the national average .
and for the gva , the gap has substantially widened , the report found .
in 1997 , urban policy towns were 9 % behind the national average , but this had reached 13 % behind in 2004 -lrb- the most recent year for which figures are available -rrb- .

" the scale of positive change is clear , however deep-rooted pockets of deprivation still exist which no one single approach can tackle . "
he said there would be continued investment in deprived areas , with £ 2bn announced in october through the comprehensive spending review .
he said : " it 's alarming that this think tank is arguing that we should do otherwise by targeting less effort and resources at turning round deprived areas when those that have received government funding have shown the greatest improvements . "
mr healey 's comments were echoed by glasgow city council , one of the cities deemed by the policy exchange report to be lagging behind .
a council spokesman said : " this report seems to be at odds with the vast majority of examinations of glasgow 's economic performance over the past decade . "
the spokesman said there were about 80,000 more jobs in the city in 2005 than there had been ten years earlier .

the policy exchange report compared key economic indicators from towns that had received substantial funding , with the national average .
it found there were " no signs of improvement " in unemployment or income in the towns that had received funding .
the government said the majority of big cities had seen improvement since 1997 .
economic performance local government minister john healey said : " we totally reject these claims .
" our towns and cities have overcome years of decline and decay with economic performance rising in six out of eight of the largest cities in england since 1997 . "
the lse-affiliated think tank said that over the past 10 years there have been 14 core urban regeneration schemes , which have received a total £ 30bn in public funds .
for its report , entitled cities limited , the think-tank selected 18 towns and cities targeted for investment by between four and eight of the 14 schemes .
they then compared the economic performance of these " urban policy towns " with the national average , and with six towns that have not received funding but have economically out-performed the national average .
the urban policy towns include : sheffield , liverpool , hull , southampton , coventry , leicester and glasgow .
the high-performing towns were : edinburgh , windsor-maidenhead , peterborough , bristol , milton keynes and swindon .

the big picture is the same : towns which receive large amounts of urban policy funding are not converging to the uk average dr oliver marc hartwich policy exchange the report found that for personal income , urban policy towns began 17 % behind the uk average in 1997 , and ended 18 % behind in 2005 .
for unemployment , by the end of the decade there were still 50 % more people out of work in urban policy towns than the national average .
and for the gva , the gap has substantially widened , the report found .
in 1997 , urban policy towns were 9 % behind the national average , but this had reached 13 % behind in 2004 -lrb- the most recent year for which figures are available -rrb- .
policy exchange 's chief economist , dr oliver marc hartwich , said : " the big picture is the same : towns which receive large amounts of urban policy funding are not converging to the uk average .
" if anything , they are slipping farther behind while successful towns are stretching their lead . "
but the department of communities and local government , which heads urban regeneration funding , vigorously rejected the claims made by the report .
mr healey said : " life chances in areas receiving neighbourhood renewal funding continue to improve with mortality rates from heart disease falling by 27.5 % since 1997 , crime rates by 15 % between 2003 and 2007 and the coalfields programme creating 16,000 jobs since 1996 .
" the scale of positive change is clear , however deep-rooted pockets of deprivation still exist which no one single approach can tackle . "
he said there would be continued investment in deprived areas , with £ 2bn announced in october through the comprehensive spending review .
he said : " it 's alarming that this think tank is arguing that we should do otherwise by targeting less effort and resources at turning round deprived areas when those that have received government funding have shown the greatest improvements . "
mr healey 's comments were echoed by glasgow city council , one of the cities deemed by the policy exchange report to be lagging behind .
a council spokesman said : " this report seems to be at odds with the vast majority of examinations of glasgow 's economic performance over the past decade . "
the spokesman said there were about 80,000 more jobs in the city in 2005 than there had been ten years earlier .

the policy exchange report compared key economic indicators from towns that had received substantial funding , with the national average .
it found there were " no signs of improvement " in unemployment or income in the towns that had received funding .
the government said the majority of big cities had seen improvement since 1997 .
economic performance local government minister john healey said : " we totally reject these claims .
" our towns and cities have overcome years of decline and decay with economic performance rising in six out of eight of the largest cities in england since 1997 . "
the lse-affiliated think tank said that over the past 10 years there have been 14 core urban regeneration schemes , which have received a total £ 30bn in public funds .
for its report , entitled cities limited , the think-tank selected 18 towns and cities targeted for investment by between four and eight of the 14 schemes .
they then compared the economic performance of these " urban policy towns " with the national average , and with six towns that have not received funding but have economically out-performed the national average .
the urban policy towns include : sheffield , liverpool , hull , southampton , coventry , leicester and glasgow .
the high-performing towns were : edinburgh , windsor-maidenhead , peterborough , bristol , milton keynes and swindon .
gap ' widening ' the study used key economic indicators such as personal income , unemployment levels , and a factor known as " gross value added " -lrb- gva -rrb- - a cash figure showing the per-capita contribution people make to the economy , personal income and employment .
the big picture is the same : towns which receive large amounts of urban policy funding are not converging to the uk average dr oliver marc hartwich policy exchange the report found that for personal income , urban policy towns began 17 % behind the uk average in 1997 , and ended 18 % behind in 2005 .
for unemployment , by the end of the decade there were still 50 % more people out of work in urban policy towns than the national average .
and for the gva , the gap has substantially widened , the report found .
in 1997 , urban policy towns were 9 % behind the national average , but this had reached 13 % behind in 2004 -lrb- the most recent year for which figures are available -rrb- .
policy exchange 's chief economist , dr oliver marc hartwich , said : " the big picture is the same : towns which receive large amounts of urban policy funding are not converging to the uk average .
" if anything , they are slipping farther behind while successful towns are stretching their lead . "
but the department of communities and local government , which heads urban regeneration funding , vigorously rejected the claims made by the report .
mr healey said : " life chances in areas receiving neighbourhood renewal funding continue to improve with mortality rates from heart disease falling by 27.5 % since 1997 , crime rates by 15 % between 2003 and 2007 and the coalfields programme creating 16,000 jobs since 1996 .
" the scale of positive change is clear , however deep-rooted pockets of deprivation still exist which no one single approach can tackle . "

the north east ambulance service -lrb- neas -rrb- wants to end the current system , where 999 calls are shared between centres in middlesbrough and newcastle .
it says a two-centre model focused on tyneside would better stand up to a terrorist attack or other major alert .
but the cleveland police authority described the proposals as " nonsense " and demanded urgent talks .
ambulance bosses say a study highlighted concerns that the present system in which newcastle and middlesbrough have technical links and operate as a single virtual centre , could fail in a major incident .
close links it now plans to keep its existing centre in newcastle and create a second base in hebburn , south tyneside .
but cleveland police authority chairman dave mcluckie said : " it is hard to understand the logic in a proposal which would break the close links between two key emergency services and inevitably would lead to a loss of local knowledge .
" apparently one of the arguments for having two centres on tyneside is that it would improve resilience in the event of a natural disaster or terrorist attack .
" frankly that 's a nonsense .
if the ambulance trust has valid arguments then they should be prepared to come and meet us and make the case because this looks like yet another attempt to regionalise at our expense . "
the neas said the plans would have no impact on the location of ambulance stations or result in any job losses .

bt reported pre-tax profits to £ 1.035bn for the six months to 30 september , down 17 % on the same period last year .
the £ 450m price tag of creating a new organisational structure to regain its competitive advantage was partly to blame , the group said .
bt has been making big strides into all-inclusive payment plans in an effort to offer cheaper calls and win back its customers .
shares in bt fell in early morning trade , dropping 10.75p , or 3.4 % , to 304.25p.
future bright ?
despite the fall in profits , the company said its long-term future remained bright .
" we are achieving significant transformation of our business which will deliver further efficiencies alongside faster , better , smarter services for our customers , " said ben verwaayen , bt chief executive .
increased demand for its broadband and corporate networked it services boosted revenue for the six months to the end of september .
but this was largely offset by the decline in bt 's traditional fixed-line business , which meant overall revenue rose a modest 3 % to £ 10.12bn , from £ 9.8bn.

bt reported pre-tax profits to £ 1.035bn for the six months to 30 september , down 17 % on the same period last year .
the £ 450m price tag of creating a new organisational structure to regain its competitive advantage was partly to blame , the group said .
bt has been making big strides into all-inclusive payment plans in an effort to offer cheaper calls and win back its customers .
shares in bt fell in early morning trade , dropping 10.75p , or 3.4 % , to 304.25p.
future bright ?
despite the fall in profits , the company said its long-term future remained bright .
" we are achieving significant transformation of our business which will deliver further efficiencies alongside faster , better , smarter services for our customers , " said ben verwaayen , bt chief executive .
increased demand for its broadband and corporate networked it services boosted revenue for the six months to the end of september .
but this was largely offset by the decline in bt 's traditional fixed-line business , which meant overall revenue rose a modest 3 % to £ 10.12bn , from £ 9.8bn.
the group said it remained the uk 's number one broadband provider more than four million broadband customers .

try telling that to the legions of sex pistols fans clamouring to see the ageing punks perform a series of sell-out concerts over the next few days .
the pistols play the first of five nights at london 's brixton academy on thursday , while last weekend the stranglers performed at the legendary roundhouse - 30 years to the day since they last graced the venue .
the gig saw the band replicate the set-list from 1977 and , despite the absence of founder-member hugh cornwell , the material sounded as fresh as ever .
the bbc caught up with four original punks still snarling their way through songs first aired in the days when chopper bikes and space hoppers were all the rage .
jj burnel , the stranglers it was great to play the roundhouse again .
there was a few songs we had n't played for 20-odd years but it was fun rediscovering them .
burnel is also a martial arts instructor i wo n't be going to see the pistols , though .
they 're old men who get together every few years to top up their pension fund .
and now they can actually play their instruments , it 's boring .
mind you , they 've had 30 years to learn how to play one album .
music has not moved on much .
mainstream pop and rock does n't seem to have shaken off that punk thing .
if we 'd been playing music from 30 years before in 1977 , we 'd have been doing glenn miller or something .
you hear all the bands now and they 're all thrashing chords .
they 're not smart and they 're not trying to be intelligent , so basically they make us look better .
it means that we do n't sound dated and it should n't be that way .
we 've still got that competitive edge and we all get on well - i think the only thing that 's going to stop the stranglers is an act of god .
steve diggle , buzzcocks i 'll probably go to see the pistols .
we put them on in manchester in 1976 and opened up for them .
that was where the punk rock atom was really split - that was when the explosion started .
there 's still nobody to touch what we all did .
there 's been nothing as powerful as that since - it changed people 's lives .
steve diggle is working on his second solo album our motivation to keep going is the music .
the pistols , the buzzcocks and the clash are just as relevant as they have ever been .
most of the music today is rubbish .
it 's just a generation of blue peter presenters with guitars .
i 'm looking forward to the day when i can hear something new .
i can just about be spoonfed a bit of razorlight and i think you need pete doherty 's unpredictability .
but lots of young people come to our gigs .
about two thirds of the audience are kids - amazing as that seems - but then they have n't seen anything like we do .
we 're the definite article .
jake burns , stiff little fingers there 's been nothing like punk since .
i remember when i first heard it , it felt like how it must have done when rock ' n ' roll first started .
we swept away the dinosaur bands and gave rock ' n ' roll back to the kids .
people realised you did n't need a grade eight music education to play in a band .
slf are touring the uk in march some of the bands today are obviously influenced by the whole punk thing , which is fine - if they 're creating their own sound .
but if it 's just rehashes of what the damned and the ramones did , then i 'm sorry , but i saw the damned back then and you 're not going to top that .
i 've always written songs about things that offend my sense of justice - protest songs .
i never bought into the whole anarchistic , nihilistic stuff and up until recently the songs we wrote about northern ireland were still very pertinent .
we always said if it stopped becoming fun or people stopped coming to see us , we 'd quit .
fortunately that 's not the case .
charlie harper , uk subs i never thought we 'd still be playing 30 years later .
up until quite recently i kept thinking i 'll just give it another couple of years before i pack it in .
but people still want us to play , so i 'm going to carry on until i ca n't anymore .
the uk subs had six top 40 hits punk was basically music stripped down to the bare bones and built up again .
all the stuff these days sounds the same , but back then siouxsie sounded different to the jam , the jam sounded different to the buzzcocks , and the buzzcocks sounded different to the pistols .
everyone is still so into it .
i believe punk is more relevant than it was in the 70s because all of our predictions are coming true .
songs we do , like warhead , are more poignant than ever .
punk rock was the early warning system - the wake-up call to society , but back then most of the people did n't want to listen .

the pistols , the buzzcocks and the clash are just as relevant as they have ever been .
most of the music today is rubbish .
it 's just a generation of blue peter presenters with guitars .
i 'm looking forward to the day when i can hear something new .
i can just about be spoonfed a bit of razorlight and i think you need pete doherty 's unpredictability .
but lots of young people come to our gigs .
about two thirds of the audience are kids - amazing as that seems - but then they have n't seen anything like we do .
we 're the definite article .
jake burns , stiff little fingers there 's been nothing like punk since .
i remember when i first heard it , it felt like how it must have done when rock ' n ' roll first started .
we swept away the dinosaur bands and gave rock ' n ' roll back to the kids .
people realised you did n't need a grade eight music education to play in a band .
slf are touring the uk in march some of the bands today are obviously influenced by the whole punk thing , which is fine - if they 're creating their own sound .

i 've always written songs about things that offend my sense of justice - protest songs .
i never bought into the whole anarchistic , nihilistic stuff and up until recently the songs we wrote about northern ireland were still very pertinent .
we always said if it stopped becoming fun or people stopped coming to see us , we 'd quit .
fortunately that 's not the case .
charlie harper , uk subs i never thought we 'd still be playing 30 years later .
up until quite recently i kept thinking i 'll just give it another couple of years before i pack it in .
but people still want us to play , so i 'm going to carry on until i ca n't anymore .
the uk subs had six top 40 hits punk was basically music stripped down to the bare bones and built up again .
all the stuff these days sounds the same , but back then siouxsie sounded different to the jam , the jam sounded different to the buzzcocks , and the buzzcocks sounded different to the pistols .
everyone is still so into it .
i believe punk is more relevant than it was in the 70s because all of our predictions are coming true .
songs we do , like warhead , are more poignant than ever .
punk rock was the early warning system - the wake-up call to society , but back then most of the people did n't want to listen .

try telling that to the legions of sex pistols fans clamouring to see the ageing punks perform a series of sell-out concerts over the next few days .
the pistols play the first of five nights at london 's brixton academy on thursday , while last weekend the stranglers performed at the legendary roundhouse - 30 years to the day since they last graced the venue .
the gig saw the band replicate the set-list from 1977 and , despite the absence of founder-member hugh cornwell , the material sounded as fresh as ever .
the bbc caught up with four original punks still snarling their way through songs first aired in the days when chopper bikes and space hoppers were all the rage .
jj burnel , the stranglers it was great to play the roundhouse again .
there was a few songs we had n't played for 20-odd years but it was fun rediscovering them .
burnel is also a martial arts instructor i wo n't be going to see the pistols , though .
they 're old men who get together every few years to top up their pension fund .
and now they can actually play their instruments , it 's boring .
mind you , they 've had 30 years to learn how to play one album .
music has not moved on much .
mainstream pop and rock does n't seem to have shaken off that punk thing .
if we 'd been playing music from 30 years before in 1977 , we 'd have been doing glenn miller or something .
you hear all the bands now and they 're all thrashing chords .
they 're not smart and they 're not trying to be intelligent , so basically they make us look better .
it means that we do n't sound dated and it should n't be that way .
we 've still got that competitive edge and we all get on well - i think the only thing that 's going to stop the stranglers is an act of god .
steve diggle , buzzcocks i 'll probably go to see the pistols .
we put them on in manchester in 1976 and opened up for them .
that was where the punk rock atom was really split - that was when the explosion started .
there 's still nobody to touch what we all did .

october became the month of the general election that never was , as the polls went on a serious roller-coaster .
to take just one example : yougov polls -lrb- not random samples of the british public , but drawn from a panel of internet users -rrb- went from an 11 % labour lead at the end of the party 's conference to a 3 % conservative lead one week later at the close of that party 's conference .
are we to conclude that the polls are rubbish , simply ricocheting around ?
i do n't believe so .
the public mood does appear to be a volatile and the conservatives certainly struck a chord with their proposals on inheritance tax and stamp duty .
complex populus / times -lrb- sampled 2 to 4 october -rrb- found 61 % thought their tax bills too high ; and 72 % supported the conservative proposal to make " wealthy people pay more in tax in order to take most people in britain out of the inheritance tax net " .
and populus / daily politics -lrb- sampled 3 to 4 october -rrb- found 58 % agreeing that it was " a good idea for the conservatives to place tax cuts at the centre of their election campaign " .
however , the polls also suggest that the electorate 's view of the past few weeks is a more complex picture than that portrayed in the headline voting figures .
gordon brown 's standing among voters has certainly taken a knock .
leadership but while an icm / sunday telegraph poll -lrb- sampled 10 to 11 october -rrb- gave a seven-point conservative vote lead over labour , it also found gordon brown 20 points ahead of david cameron on being the strongest leader ; and 11 points ahead on managing the economy properly .
and while the past month has seen a distinct rise in conservative fortunes , icm / guardian -lrb- sampled 3 to 4 october -rrb- found 54 % taking the view that the conservatives are the same party they always were and have n't really changed at all , compared with 39 % who thought the party had changed under david cameron .
in the aftermath of sir menzies campbell 's resignation as lib dem leader , populus / bbc daily politics -lrb- sampled 17 to 18 october -rrb- registered 87 % disagreement with the statement that he was " too old to lead a national political party " .
his parliamentary colleagues would have been relieved that 57 % of respondents also disagreed that the lib dems " are now irrelevant in british politics " .
pay mori / fawcett society-unison -lrb- sampled 26 to 28 october -rrb- addressed the issue of pay inequality .
some 58 % thought men were paid more than women for comparable jobs -lrb- a view held by 53 % of men and 64 % of women -rrb- as opposed to 31 % who thought there was no differential .
when asked about government attempts to ensure equal pay for women in britain , 61 % said they had not gone far enough , compared with 30 % who said they were " about right " .
on the question of which political party was most committed to closing pay differences between men and women , 23 % nominated labour and 8 % each the conservatives and lib dems -lrb- 10 % said " none " and 49 % answered " do n't know " -rrb- .
immigration populus / bbc daily politics -lrb- sampled 24 to 25 october -rrb- ventured into the recent debate about projected increases in britain 's population .
some 64 % agreed there were too many people in britain ; and 77 % supported a strict limit on immigration .
however , 60 % disagreed that our increasing population had a negative impact on their lives -lrb- 37 % said it did -rrb- .
and 71 % agreed that immigrants " make a vital contribution to the economy " .
finally , on a more heart-warming note , an icm poll for the bbc -lrb- sampled 18 to 21 october -rrb- asked married respondents if they had their time over again would they marry the same person .
some 92 % said they would .

october became the month of the general election that never was , as the polls went on a serious roller-coaster .
to take just one example : yougov polls -lrb- not random samples of the british public , but drawn from a panel of internet users -rrb- went from an 11 % labour lead at the end of the party 's conference to a 3 % conservative lead one week later at the close of that party 's conference .
are we to conclude that the polls are rubbish , simply ricocheting around ?
i do n't believe so .
the public mood does appear to be a volatile and the conservatives certainly struck a chord with their proposals on inheritance tax and stamp duty .
complex populus / times -lrb- sampled 2 to 4 october -rrb- found 61 % thought their tax bills too high ; and 72 % supported the conservative proposal to make " wealthy people pay more in tax in order to take most people in britain out of the inheritance tax net " .
and populus / daily politics -lrb- sampled 3 to 4 october -rrb- found 58 % agreeing that it was " a good idea for the conservatives to place tax cuts at the centre of their election campaign " .
however , the polls also suggest that the electorate 's view of the past few weeks is a more complex picture than that portrayed in the headline voting figures .
gordon brown 's standing among voters has certainly taken a knock .
leadership but while an icm / sunday telegraph poll -lrb- sampled 10 to 11 october -rrb- gave a seven-point conservative vote lead over labour , it also found gordon brown 20 points ahead of david cameron on being the strongest leader ; and 11 points ahead on managing the economy properly .
and while the past month has seen a distinct rise in conservative fortunes , icm / guardian -lrb- sampled 3 to 4 october -rrb- found 54 % taking the view that the conservatives are the same party they always were and have n't really changed at all , compared with 39 % who thought the party had changed under david cameron .
in the aftermath of sir menzies campbell 's resignation as lib dem leader , populus / bbc daily politics -lrb- sampled 17 to 18 october -rrb- registered 87 % disagreement with the statement that he was " too old to lead a national political party " .
his parliamentary colleagues would have been relieved that 57 % of respondents also disagreed that the lib dems " are now irrelevant in british politics " .
pay mori / fawcett society-unison -lrb- sampled 26 to 28 october -rrb- addressed the issue of pay inequality .
some 58 % thought men were paid more than women for comparable jobs -lrb- a view held by 53 % of men and 64 % of women -rrb- as opposed to 31 % who thought there was no differential .
when asked about government attempts to ensure equal pay for women in britain , 61 % said they had not gone far enough , compared with 30 % who said they were " about right " .
on the question of which political party was most committed to closing pay differences between men and women , 23 % nominated labour and 8 % each the conservatives and lib dems -lrb- 10 % said " none " and 49 % answered " do n't know " -rrb- .
immigration populus / bbc daily politics -lrb- sampled 24 to 25 october -rrb- ventured into the recent debate about projected increases in britain 's population .
some 64 % agreed there were too many people in britain ; and 77 % supported a strict limit on immigration .
however , 60 % disagreed that our increasing population had a negative impact on their lives -lrb- 37 % said it did -rrb- .
and 71 % agreed that immigrants " make a vital contribution to the economy " .
finally , on a more heart-warming note , an icm poll for the bbc -lrb- sampled 18 to 21 october -rrb- asked married respondents if they had their time over again would they marry the same person .
some 92 % said they would .

by tim weber business editor , bbc news website mobile phones come with ever more features ; whether we use them is crucial to a billion-dollar industry .
can your phone take pictures ?
probably yes .
but can it sync with the diary and contacts on your computer ?
download and play music and videos ?
play video games ?
browse the web , do your e-mail ?
tell you where you are and where to go ?
your answers are important - not just when you decide on your next mobile phone .
a whole range of industries is waiting for you to make up your mind , because it bets that you will want a phone that is smart , and sends and receives plenty of data .
smart , kind of once upon a time the dividing line was clear : there were smartphones , expensive but chunky bricks with plenty of office applications ; and then there were smaller consumer phones that allowed you to text and talk .
today , boundaries are blurred .
so-called feature-rich phones are everywhere .
unlike true smartphones they may not be able to run more than one or two programs at a time .
apart from that you 'll be hard pressed to tell the difference .
to make such a phone a true money spinner , it has to have a fast 3g data connection , says paul goode , senior analyst at m : metrics , a consulting firm .
in the uk , that 's about 20 % of all mobile phones .
in italy , which is europe 's leader in all things mobile , nearly a third are 3g-enabled .
take htc 's tytn ii , sold on the uk market by t-mobile as mda vario iii .
with its slide-out keyboard and tilting screen it resembles a mini laptop , complete with browser , office software and gps navigation system .
but do people need mini-computers like that ?
" there are two categories of phone users , " says anders runevad , head of sales at phone maker sony ericsson .
" those who have time to kill : they want to fill it with entertainment , blogging , surfing and sharing with friends .
and those who have time to create : they use office applications , calendar , e-mail . "
the industry is working hard to find out which features are best for what kind of user .
" most phones sold into the market now tend to specialise in different things - the internet , music or e-mail , " says richard warmsley , t-mobile uk 's head of internet on the move .
" it 's about matching different types of services with the needs of different customers . "
" yes , we in the industry push features on consumers , " says mats lindoff , the chief technology officer of phone maker sony ericsson .
but it works .
take camera phones .
they were derided at first .
today half of all mobile phone users in the uk take pictures with their mobiles , and a quarter send them on .
camera phones have been a " phenomenal success " says paul goode .
now the industry hopes that mobile data - web , e-mail , music downloads - will be the next goldmine .
the economics of fast phones for manufacturers the economics are clear : " we make quite a lot of money on both smart and feature-rich phones , " says mr lindoff .
and the smarter the phone , the bigger the usage of data .
smartphone users are five times more likely to watch television and three times more likely to listen to music on their phone than normal users , which boosts the revenue of network operators .
but do smart phones also translate into higher revenue for operators ?
" yes , absolutely , " asserts nigel clifford , the chief executive of symbian , which makes operating systems for mobile phones .
" we see more downloads of applications , picture sharing , more activity - and higher average revenue per user . "
this view is echoed by sony ericsson 's anders runevad .
" feature-rich phones are important for the whole ecosystem -lsb- of the mobile phone industry -rsb- , for us , the network operators , the application and content providers . "
data usage " has already moved out of the early adopters stage , " says paul goode at m : metrics .
t-mobile is reporting double-digit growth for mobile internet usage in the uk during the past 18 months .
the level of mobile browsing , however , depends on which phone you use .
owners of symbian phones , for example , use more data services than those of other phones , according to m : metrics , although mr goode cautions that this is also due to the fact that owners of smartphones tend to be richer than most and can afford to do so .
sony ericsson , for its part , promises network operators that owners of its line of walkman phones are bringing in more money by downloading more music than others .
bye bye ipod indeed , music -lrb- including ringtones -rrb- has so far proven to be the only killer content for mobiles .
mobile phones are getting ever better at playing music .
a third of people having a media player on their phone have dumped their single-purpose mp3 player , according to m : metrics .
that 's the reason why apple developed the iphone , says mr goode .
" apple had no other chance , because mp3 players are on the way out . "
however , he also stresses that music still has some way to go .
right now only 10 % of all phones can play music .
and it 's questionable whether other fancy applications can succeed .
a year ago , 40 % of 3g users browsed the web ; now only 30 % do .
it 's not that people have stopped going online on-the-go .
rather , many new phone owners are less tech-savvy and ca n't be bothered using their fancy phones to the max .
" we are packing more and more functionality into these phones , but there just are n't enough 10-year-olds around to explain how to use all that , " quipped a speaker at the recent symbian smartphone show in london .
no wonder that john mccullen , chief technology officer of bluestreak technologies , exhorted the industry to follow the kisse principle : " keep it -lsb- the mobile user experience -rsb- simple , stupid and enjoyable . "
old battles , new players the battle over usability and content is fought in an increasingly crowded space - and features the replay of operating system battles of old .
in the red corner the reigning champion , symbian , backed by the world 's largest mobile phone manufacturers and with a 70 % share of the top-end of the market .
in the blue corner microsoft , for once the underdog .
in the green corner newcomer apple , playing its usual role of selling nicely designed but perfectly closed systems .
on the sidelines research in motion , cornering the market for corporate e-mail on the go .
linux fans once again promise that their software 's big break is just around the corner .
and then there is google , which actually may make linux dreams come true .
with $ 13bn in cash to play with , the search giant from mountain view , california , is promising a linux-based mobile phone operating system , dubbed android and designed to bring us the truly mobile web .
while these rivalries are fun to watch , they have yet to deliver for customers .
the lack of standardisation is making life difficult for everybody involved .
feature-rich phones , for example , rely on java to run applications .
this has turned out to be a pandora 's box for developers .
" java : develop once and test forever for each version , " laughs sony ericsson 's mats lindoff .
smartphones , in contrast , are somewhat easier to run , because their sophisticated operating systems provide a more stable environment .
not everybody is convinced .
development costs make complex operating systems expensive , says dr t k srikanth , head of product management at sasken , a mobile communications firm .
" smartphones , " says dr srikanth , " are still not solid revenue generators for handset manufacturers , they simply do not sell in the volume necessary . "
going cheap , going global of course , hardware and software costs are coming down rapidly .
" it 's less and less the case that people say i want this but ca n't afford it , " says symbian 's nigel clifford .
it 's a global phenomenon , and asian markets are the main drivers .
japan is still 18 months or two years ahead of everybody else , says mr clifford , but china is catching up fast .
in the second quarter of this year , consumers in china bought 40 % more smartphones than those in the us .
in india , " more people access the internet from their phone than from a pc , a scenario that will certainly play out right across the globe , " says dr srikanth .
in bangladesh , meanwhile , more people are using the popular opera mini browser for mobile phones than there are computers in the country , says jon von tetzchner , chief executive of opera .
content with nowhere to go while manufacturers and operators fine-tune their phones to fit a plethora of market segments , the media industry is in the starting blocks to offer consumers an avalanche of mobile content .
there is just one hitch : can they sell it ?
phones may get cheaper , but call plans are the cost factor that is holding back the digital mobile revolution .
they are simply too confusing .
in the uk for example , t-mobile offers an " unlimited download " plan -lrb- in reality with a one gigabyte limit -rrb- for about £ 7.50 a month .
customers of virgin media -lrb- which uses t-mobile 's network -rrb- have to fork out two or three quid after downloading just a few web pages .
this unpredictability means that media firms ca n't tell their customers how much it will cost to download and use their content .
marc lepetit at phoenix film in berlin has developed a series of short films for distribution on mobile phones : " right now it does n't make sense to offer this content , because the varying call plans may confuse users . "
" hidden download costs make mobile content so expensive that we have decided to wait until there are more transparent flat-rate tariffs , " says mr lepetit .
" the price plan is a phenomenal issue , " confirms paul goode .
it 's probably no accident that most people use a lot of data just after they 've got a new phone - downloading ringtones , programmes , playing around - only for this activity to tail off quickly , says the m : metrics analyst .
in sweden , says sony ericsson 's mats lindoff , the all-you-can-eat price plan of mobile operator three has completely changed the game .
" it is used like crazy , three had to buy new base stations just to cope with demand , " he says .
mobile dreams flat rates equal large customer numbers , and " once you 've got a large group of customers , and you have that revenue , you can invest in services that may bring in additional revenue streams , " says t-mobile 's richard warmsley .
so what will we do in five years , clutching the mobile phone equivalent of a swiss army knife ?
" watch japan , " says symbian boss nigel clifford .
" the business world is oriented to mobile working .
commuters catch up on tv programmes .
people compare shop prices on the internet , and pay for goods with their phones . "
mr lindoff tips social networking , music , e-mail and location based services to be big winners .
his colleague anders runevad believes the user-centric web 2.0 model will be translated to the mobile world .
and mr warmsley reports that his customers are " very big " on social networking .
soon we may all lead much smarter -lrb- phone -rrb- lives .
and soon a rapidly growing industry could get very rich .

by tim weber business editor , bbc news website the phone industry promises to put the internet in your pocket mobile phones come with ever more features ; whether we use them is crucial to a billion-dollar industry .
can your phone take pictures ?
probably yes .
but can it sync with the diary and contacts on your computer ?
download and play music and videos ?
play video games ?
browse the web , do your e-mail ?
tell you where you are and where to go ?
your answers are important - not just when you decide on your next mobile phone .
a whole range of industries is waiting for you to make up your mind , because it bets that you will want a phone that is smart , and sends and receives plenty of data .
smart , kind of once upon a time the dividing line was clear : there were smartphones , expensive but chunky bricks with plenty of office applications ; and then there were smaller consumer phones that allowed you to text and talk .
today , boundaries are blurred .
so-called feature-rich phones are everywhere .
unlike true smartphones they may not be able to run more than one or two programs at a time .
apart from that you 'll be hard pressed to tell the difference .
to make such a phone a true money spinner , it has to have a fast 3g data connection , says paul goode , senior analyst at m : metrics , a consulting firm .
office , e-mail , music , web , gps - anything else you need ?
in the uk , that 's about 20 % of all mobile phones .
in italy , which is europe 's leader in all things mobile , nearly a third are 3g-enabled .
take htc 's tytn ii , sold on the uk market by t-mobile as mda vario iii .
with its slide-out keyboard and tilting screen it resembles a mini laptop , complete with browser , office software and gps navigation system .
but do people need mini-computers like that ?
" there are two categories of phone users , " says anders runevad , head of sales at phone maker sony ericsson .
" those who have time to kill : they want to fill it with entertainment , blogging , surfing and sharing with friends .
and those who have time to create : they use office applications , calendar , e-mail . "
the industry is working hard to find out which features are best for what kind of user .
" most phones sold into the market now tend to specialise in different things - the internet , music or e-mail , " says richard warmsley , t-mobile uk 's head of internet on the move .
" it 's about matching different types of services with the needs of different customers . "
" yes , we in the industry push features on consumers , " says mats lindoff , the chief technology officer of phone maker sony ericsson .
but it works .
take camera phones .
they were derided at first .
today half of all mobile phone users in the uk take pictures with their mobiles , and a quarter send them on .
camera phones have been a " phenomenal success " says paul goode .
now the industry hopes that mobile data - web , e-mail , music downloads - will be the next goldmine .
the economics of fast phones for manufacturers the economics are clear : " we make quite a lot of money on both smart and feature-rich phones , " says mr lindoff .
and the smarter the phone , the bigger the usage of data .
smartphone users are five times more likely to watch television and three times more likely to listen to music on their phone than normal users , which boosts the revenue of network operators .
but do smart phones also translate into higher revenue for operators ?
" yes , absolutely , " asserts nigel clifford , the chief executive of symbian , which makes operating systems for mobile phones .
" we see more downloads of applications , picture sharing , more activity - and higher average revenue per user . "
this view is echoed by sony ericsson 's anders runevad .
" feature-rich phones are important for the whole ecosystem -lsb- of the mobile phone industry -rsb- , for us , the network operators , the application and content providers . "
data usage " has already moved out of the early adopters stage , " says paul goode at m : metrics .
t-mobile is reporting double-digit growth for mobile internet usage in the uk during the past 18 months .
the level of mobile browsing , however , depends on which phone you use .
owners of symbian phones , for example , use more data services than those of other phones , according to m : metrics , although mr goode cautions that this is also due to the fact that owners of smartphones tend to be richer than most and can afford to do so .
sony ericsson , for its part , promises network operators that owners of its line of walkman phones are bringing in more money by downloading more music than others .
bye bye ipod indeed , music -lrb- including ringtones -rrb- has so far proven to be the only killer content for mobiles .
music players on mobile phones threaten mp3 players mobile phones are getting ever better at playing music .
a third of people having a media player on their phone have dumped their single-purpose mp3 player , according to m : metrics .
that 's the reason why apple developed the iphone , says mr goode .
" apple had no other chance , because mp3 players are on the way out . "
however , he also stresses that music still has some way to go .
right now only 10 % of all phones can play music .
and it 's questionable whether other fancy applications can succeed .
a year ago , 40 % of 3g users browsed the web ; now only 30 % do .
it 's not that people have stopped going online on-the-go .
rather , many new phone owners are less tech-savvy and ca n't be bothered using their fancy phones to the max .
" we are packing more and more functionality into these phones , but there just are n't enough 10-year-olds around to explain how to use all that , " quipped a speaker at the recent symbian smartphone show in london .
no wonder that john mccullen , chief technology officer of bluestreak technologies , exhorted the industry to follow the kisse principle : " keep it -lsb- the mobile user experience -rsb- simple , stupid and enjoyable . "
old battles , new players the battle over usability and content is fought in an increasingly crowded space - and features the replay of operating system battles of old .
it 's apple v microsoft - and symbian , linux , rim , google ...
in the red corner the reigning champion , symbian , backed by the world 's largest mobile phone manufacturers and with a 70 % share of the top-end of the market .
in the blue corner microsoft , for once the underdog .
in the green corner newcomer apple , playing its usual role of selling nicely designed but perfectly closed systems .
on the sidelines research in motion , cornering the market for corporate e-mail on the go .
linux fans once again promise that their software 's big break is just around the corner .
and then there is google , which actually may make linux dreams come true .
with $ 13bn in cash to play with , the search giant from mountain view , california , is promising a linux-based mobile phone operating system , dubbed android and designed to bring us the truly mobile web .
while these rivalries are fun to watch , they have yet to deliver for customers .
the lack of standardisation is making life difficult for everybody involved .
feature-rich phones , for example , rely on java to run applications .
this has turned out to be a pandora 's box for developers .
" java : develop once and test forever for each version , " laughs sony ericsson 's mats lindoff .
smartphones , in contrast , are somewhat easier to run , because their sophisticated operating systems provide a more stable environment .
not everybody is convinced .
development costs make complex operating systems expensive , says dr t k srikanth , head of product management at sasken , a mobile communications firm .
" smartphones , " says dr srikanth , " are still not solid revenue generators for handset manufacturers , they simply do not sell in the volume necessary . "
going cheap , going global of course , hardware and software costs are coming down rapidly .
" it 's less and less the case that people say i want this but ca n't afford it , " says symbian 's nigel clifford .
mobile phones drive digital access in south asia it 's a global phenomenon , and asian markets are the main drivers .
japan is still 18 months or two years ahead of everybody else , says mr clifford , but china is catching up fast .
in the second quarter of this year , consumers in china bought 40 % more smartphones than those in the us .
in india , " more people access the internet from their phone than from a pc , a scenario that will certainly play out right across the globe , " says dr srikanth .
in bangladesh , meanwhile , more people are using the popular opera mini browser for mobile phones than there are computers in the country , says jon von tetzchner , chief executive of opera .
content with nowhere to go while manufacturers and operators fine-tune their phones to fit a plethora of market segments , the media industry is in the starting blocks to offer consumers an avalanche of mobile content .
there is just one hitch : can they sell it ?
phones may get cheaper , but call plans are the cost factor that is holding back the digital mobile revolution .
they are simply too confusing .
designed for young music fans - every niche gets its own phone in the uk for example , t-mobile offers an " unlimited download " plan -lrb- in reality with a one gigabyte limit -rrb- for about £ 7.50 a month .
customers of virgin media -lrb- which uses t-mobile 's network -rrb- have to fork out two or three quid after downloading just a few web pages .
this unpredictability means that media firms ca n't tell their customers how much it will cost to download and use their content .
marc lepetit at phoenix film in berlin has developed a series of short films for distribution on mobile phones : " right now it does n't make sense to offer this content , because the varying call plans may confuse users . "
" hidden download costs make mobile content so expensive that we have decided to wait until there are more transparent flat-rate tariffs , " says mr lepetit .
" the price plan is a phenomenal issue , " confirms paul goode .
it 's probably no accident that most people use a lot of data just after they 've got a new phone - downloading ringtones , programmes , playing around - only for this activity to tail off quickly , says the m : metrics analyst .
in sweden , says sony ericsson 's mats lindoff , the all-you-can-eat price plan of mobile operator three has completely changed the game .
" it is used like crazy , three had to buy new base stations just to cope with demand , " he says .
mobile dreams flat rates equal large customer numbers , and " once you 've got a large group of customers , and you have that revenue , you can invest in services that may bring in additional revenue streams , " says t-mobile 's richard warmsley .
so what will we do in five years , clutching the mobile phone equivalent of a swiss army knife ?
" watch japan , " says symbian boss nigel clifford .
" the business world is oriented to mobile working .
commuters catch up on tv programmes .
people compare shop prices on the internet , and pay for goods with their phones . "
mr lindoff tips social networking , music , e-mail and location based services to be big winners .
his colleague anders runevad believes the user-centric web 2.0 model will be translated to the mobile world .
and mr warmsley reports that his customers are " very big " on social networking .
soon we may all lead much smarter -lrb- phone -rrb- lives .
and soon a rapidly growing industry could get very rich .

" feature-rich phones are important for the whole ecosystem -lsb- of the mobile phone industry -rsb- , for us , the network operators , the application and content providers . "
data usage " has already moved out of the early adopters stage , " says paul goode at m : metrics .
t-mobile is reporting double-digit growth for mobile internet usage in the uk during the past 18 months .
the level of mobile browsing , however , depends on which phone you use .
owners of symbian phones , for example , use more data services than those of other phones , according to m : metrics , although mr goode cautions that this is also due to the fact that owners of smartphones tend to be richer than most and can afford to do so .
sony ericsson , for its part , promises network operators that owners of its line of walkman phones are bringing in more money by downloading more music than others .
bye bye ipod indeed , music -lrb- including ringtones -rrb- has so far proven to be the only killer content for mobiles .
music players on mobile phones threaten mp3 players mobile phones are getting ever better at playing music .
a third of people having a media player on their phone have dumped their single-purpose mp3 player , according to m : metrics .
that 's the reason why apple developed the iphone , says mr goode .
" apple had no other chance , because mp3 players are on the way out . "
however , he also stresses that music still has some way to go .
right now only 10 % of all phones can play music .
and it 's questionable whether other fancy applications can succeed .
a year ago , 40 % of 3g users browsed the web ; now only 30 % do .
it 's not that people have stopped going online on-the-go .
rather , many new phone owners are less tech-savvy and ca n't be bothered using their fancy phones to the max .
" we are packing more and more functionality into these phones , but there just are n't enough 10-year-olds around to explain how to use all that , " quipped a speaker at the recent symbian smartphone show in london .
no wonder that john mccullen , chief technology officer of bluestreak technologies , exhorted the industry to follow the kisse principle : " keep it -lsb- the mobile user experience -rsb- simple , stupid and enjoyable . "
old battles , new players the battle over usability and content is fought in an increasingly crowded space - and features the replay of operating system battles of old .
it 's apple v microsoft - and symbian , linux , rim , google ...
in the red corner the reigning champion , symbian , backed by the world 's largest mobile phone manufacturers and with a 70 % share of the top-end of the market .
in the blue corner microsoft , for once the underdog .
in the green corner newcomer apple , playing its usual role of selling nicely designed but perfectly closed systems .
on the sidelines research in motion , cornering the market for corporate e-mail on the go .
linux fans once again promise that their software 's big break is just around the corner .
and then there is google , which actually may make linux dreams come true .
with $ 13bn in cash to play with , the search giant from mountain view , california , is promising a linux-based mobile phone operating system , dubbed android and designed to bring us the truly mobile web .
while these rivalries are fun to watch , they have yet to deliver for customers .
the lack of standardisation is making life difficult for everybody involved .
feature-rich phones , for example , rely on java to run applications .
this has turned out to be a pandora 's box for developers .
" java : develop once and test forever for each version , " laughs sony ericsson 's mats lindoff .
smartphones , in contrast , are somewhat easier to run , because their sophisticated operating systems provide a more stable environment .
not everybody is convinced .
development costs make complex operating systems expensive , says dr t k srikanth , head of product management at sasken , a mobile communications firm .
" smartphones , " says dr srikanth , " are still not solid revenue generators for handset manufacturers , they simply do not sell in the volume necessary . "
going cheap , going global of course , hardware and software costs are coming down rapidly .
" it 's less and less the case that people say i want this but ca n't afford it , " says symbian 's nigel clifford .
mobile phones drive digital access in south asia it 's a global phenomenon , and asian markets are the main drivers .
japan is still 18 months or two years ahead of everybody else , says mr clifford , but china is catching up fast .
in the second quarter of this year , consumers in china bought 40 % more smartphones than those in the us .
in india , " more people access the internet from their phone than from a pc , a scenario that will certainly play out right across the globe , " says dr srikanth .
in bangladesh , meanwhile , more people are using the popular opera mini browser for mobile phones than there are computers in the country , says jon von tetzchner , chief executive of opera .
content with nowhere to go while manufacturers and operators fine-tune their phones to fit a plethora of market segments , the media industry is in the starting blocks to offer consumers an avalanche of mobile content .
there is just one hitch : can they sell it ?
phones may get cheaper , but call plans are the cost factor that is holding back the digital mobile revolution .
they are simply too confusing .
designed for young music fans - every niche gets its own phone in the uk for example , t-mobile offers an " unlimited download " plan -lrb- in reality with a one gigabyte limit -rrb- for about £ 7.50 a month .
customers of virgin media -lrb- which uses t-mobile 's network -rrb- have to fork out two or three quid after downloading just a few web pages .
this unpredictability means that media firms ca n't tell their customers how much it will cost to download and use their content .
marc lepetit at phoenix film in berlin has developed a series of short films for distribution on mobile phones : " right now it does n't make sense to offer this content , because the varying call plans may confuse users . "
" hidden download costs make mobile content so expensive that we have decided to wait until there are more transparent flat-rate tariffs , " says mr lepetit .
" the price plan is a phenomenal issue , " confirms paul goode .
it 's probably no accident that most people use a lot of data just after they 've got a new phone - downloading ringtones , programmes , playing around - only for this activity to tail off quickly , says the m : metrics analyst .
in sweden , says sony ericsson 's mats lindoff , the all-you-can-eat price plan of mobile operator three has completely changed the game .
" it is used like crazy , three had to buy new base stations just to cope with demand , " he says .
mobile dreams flat rates equal large customer numbers , and " once you 've got a large group of customers , and you have that revenue , you can invest in services that may bring in additional revenue streams , " says t-mobile 's richard warmsley .
so what will we do in five years , clutching the mobile phone equivalent of a swiss army knife ?
" watch japan , " says symbian boss nigel clifford .
" the business world is oriented to mobile working .
commuters catch up on tv programmes .
people compare shop prices on the internet , and pay for goods with their phones . "
mr lindoff tips social networking , music , e-mail and location based services to be big winners .
his colleague anders runevad believes the user-centric web 2.0 model will be translated to the mobile world .
and mr warmsley reports that his customers are " very big " on social networking .
soon we may all lead much smarter -lrb- phone -rrb- lives .
and soon a rapidly growing industry could get very rich .

by tim weber business editor , bbc news website the phone industry promises to put the internet in your pocket mobile phones come with ever more features ; whether we use them is crucial to a billion-dollar industry .
can your phone take pictures ?
probably yes .
but can it sync with the diary and contacts on your computer ?
download and play music and videos ?
play video games ?
browse the web , do your e-mail ?
tell you where you are and where to go ?
your answers are important - not just when you decide on your next mobile phone .
a whole range of industries is waiting for you to make up your mind , because it bets that you will want a phone that is smart , and sends and receives plenty of data .
smart , kind of once upon a time the dividing line was clear : there were smartphones , expensive but chunky bricks with plenty of office applications ; and then there were smaller consumer phones that allowed you to text and talk .
today , boundaries are blurred .
so-called feature-rich phones are everywhere .
unlike true smartphones they may not be able to run more than one or two programs at a time .
apart from that you 'll be hard pressed to tell the difference .
to make such a phone a true money spinner , it has to have a fast 3g data connection , says paul goode , senior analyst at m : metrics , a consulting firm .
office , e-mail , music , web , gps - anything else you need ?
in the uk , that 's about 20 % of all mobile phones .
in italy , which is europe 's leader in all things mobile , nearly a third are 3g-enabled .
take htc 's tytn ii , sold on the uk market by t-mobile as mda vario iii .
with its slide-out keyboard and tilting screen it resembles a mini laptop , complete with browser , office software and gps navigation system .
but do people need mini-computers like that ?
" there are two categories of phone users , " says anders runevad , head of sales at phone maker sony ericsson .
" those who have time to kill : they want to fill it with entertainment , blogging , surfing and sharing with friends .
and those who have time to create : they use office applications , calendar , e-mail . "
the industry is working hard to find out which features are best for what kind of user .
" most phones sold into the market now tend to specialise in different things - the internet , music or e-mail , " says richard warmsley , t-mobile uk 's head of internet on the move .
" it 's about matching different types of services with the needs of different customers . "
" yes , we in the industry push features on consumers , " says mats lindoff , the chief technology officer of phone maker sony ericsson .
but it works .
take camera phones .
they were derided at first .
today half of all mobile phone users in the uk take pictures with their mobiles , and a quarter send them on .
camera phones have been a " phenomenal success " says paul goode .
now the industry hopes that mobile data - web , e-mail , music downloads - will be the next goldmine .
the economics of fast phones for manufacturers the economics are clear : " we make quite a lot of money on both smart and feature-rich phones , " says mr lindoff .
and the smarter the phone , the bigger the usage of data .
smartphone users are five times more likely to watch television and three times more likely to listen to music on their phone than normal users , which boosts the revenue of network operators .
but do smart phones also translate into higher revenue for operators ?
" yes , absolutely , " asserts nigel clifford , the chief executive of symbian , which makes operating systems for mobile phones .
" we see more downloads of applications , picture sharing , more activity - and higher average revenue per user . "
this view is echoed by sony ericsson 's anders runevad .
" feature-rich phones are important for the whole ecosystem -lsb- of the mobile phone industry -rsb- , for us , the network operators , the application and content providers . "

single parents , same-sex partnerships and other variations on the family unit , it was insisted , should not be discriminated against in government policy .
there seemed to be a consensus that , while the traditional family unit of married mum and dad bringing up children in a stable home was probably the ideal , there had been such dramatic social changes over the decades that it was unrealistic , even unacceptable , to base policy on it .
after all , it was argued , the old victorian extended family had , thanks to equally dramatic social change , given way to the nuclear family .
it was claimed by some , however , that this was largely a matter of political correctness and that policy had actually become anti-family and marriage .
these were often the same groups who insisted many social problems were a result of a breakdown in traditional family life .
meanwhile , tory prime minister john major started cutting the married couple 's tax allowance in the mid-1990s before it was finally abolished by labour in 2000 .
' good thing ' the past couple of years , however , has seen a distinct shift of emphasis with many politicians of all colours once again holding up marriage and the traditional family as the ideal - and not getting shouted down .
conservative leader david cameron recently told the bbc 's newsnight : " marriage is , on the whole , a good thing that should be rewarded not punished . "
and chief secretary to the treasury , andy burnham , told the daily telegraph newspaper : " it 's not wrong that the tax system should recognise commitment and marriage . "
he added : " i do n't think the tories should have a monopoly on this kind of thinking .
this is totally where gordon -lsb- brown -rsb- is coming from , your roots and your family are everything . "
that , however , led to claims he was attacking current government policy .
and , in his party conference speech , the prime minister appeared to re-assert the existing labour view , even quoting the bible in his defence .
" i say to the children of two-parent families , one-parent families , foster parent families ; to the widow bringing up children : i stand for a britain that supports as first-class citizens not just some children and some families but supports all children and all families .
" we all remember that biblical saying : ' suffer the little children to come unto me ' .
no bible i have ever read says : ' bring just some of the children ' . "
tax break none the less , there have now been signs that government policy on the family may be open to change after the apparent popularity of some of david cameron 's announcements .
specifically , mr cameron 's pledge to raise the inheritance tax threshold to £ 1million caused a minor sensation during his party conference .
chancellor alistair darling was then accused of stealing tory clothes when he announced an effective doubling of the limit for married couples - by making their allowances transferable - in his pre-budget report just days later .
labour stresses that , thanks to government policy , six million families receiving child benefit and child tax credit will see their minimum payments rise from £ 11 in 1997 to £ 31 , a rise from £ 575 a year to £ 1,600 a year .
the government is also placing an emphasis on children and poverty , with minister for the family , ed balls , drawing up a national children 's plan .
meanwhile , the tories ' social justice policy group , headed by former leader iain duncan smith , suggested the introduction of a £ 20-a-week tax break for married couples .
the tories have not yet adopted this as policy , but mr cameron has announced his election manifesto will recognise marriage in the tax system .
the liberal democrats , on the other hand , insist tax breaks for married couples are the wrong way to go , and have placed emphasis on helping couples stay together .
all three parties seem to agree one of the greatest challenges , however , is to tackle poverty and unemployment .
once again , this is an area where the tories are planning to come up with fresh thinking and which the government is focusing much of its energy .
what seems clear is that the family is set to become one of the big battle grounds in the next general election and we can expect to see some considerable policy developments from all three main parties between then and now .

he added : " i do n't think the tories should have a monopoly on this kind of thinking .
this is totally where gordon -lsb- brown -rsb- is coming from , your roots and your family are everything . "
that , however , led to claims he was attacking current government policy .
and , in his party conference speech , the prime minister appeared to re-assert the existing labour view , even quoting the bible in his defence .
" i say to the children of two-parent families , one-parent families , foster parent families ; to the widow bringing up children : i stand for a britain that supports as first-class citizens not just some children and some families but supports all children and all families .
" we all remember that biblical saying : ' suffer the little children to come unto me ' .
no bible i have ever read says : ' bring just some of the children ' . "
tax break none the less , there have now been signs that government policy on the family may be open to change after the apparent popularity of some of david cameron 's announcements .
children are at the core of parties ' policies specifically , mr cameron 's pledge to raise the inheritance tax threshold to £ 1million caused a minor sensation during his party conference .
chancellor alistair darling was then accused of stealing tory clothes when he announced an effective doubling of the limit for married couples - by making their allowances transferable - in his pre-budget report just days later .
labour stresses that , thanks to government policy , six million families receiving child benefit and child tax credit will see their minimum payments rise from £ 11 in 1997 to £ 31 , a rise from £ 575 a year to £ 1,600 a year .
the government is also placing an emphasis on children and poverty , with minister for the family , ed balls , drawing up a national children 's plan .
meanwhile , the tories ' social justice policy group , headed by former leader iain duncan smith , suggested the introduction of a £ 20-a-week tax break for married couples .
the tories have not yet adopted this as policy , but mr cameron has announced his election manifesto will recognise marriage in the tax system .
the liberal democrats , on the other hand , insist tax breaks for married couples are the wrong way to go , and have placed emphasis on helping couples stay together .
all three parties seem to agree one of the greatest challenges , however , is to tackle poverty and unemployment .
once again , this is an area where the tories are planning to come up with fresh thinking and which the government is focusing much of its energy .
what seems clear is that the family is set to become one of the big battle grounds in the next general election and we can expect to see some considerable policy developments from all three main parties between then and now .

it is rare for former top brass to start such a public campaign , let alone in such a sensitive political area - but they believe it is time to speak out .
the establishment of the uknda can be seen as a sign of the growing gulf between ministers and some in the military over the course of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan .
there are claims that the government is no longer honouring the military covenant , britain 's duty of care to its servicemen and women .
winston churchill , former mp and grandson of the uk 's prime minister during world war ii , is president of the group and insists that the government must prioritise spending on the armed forces .
" successive governments have let people down , " he says .
" whereas health and education have seen surges in spending , defence has seen a decline , and that needs to be reversed if we are to ensure our men and women on the front line have what they need .
" that decline in spending also means that when they come home injured there are few defence medical facilities for rehabilitation and some have to rely partially on charity for funding .
" while in terms of compensation , they get a fraction of what a civilian would receive for injuries . "
' let down ' the recent case of rifleman jamie cooper , who at the age of 18 became the youngest soldier to be badly injured in iraq , is one example .
these are the forgotten soldiers , the ones coming back injured caroline cooper mother of rifleman jamie cooper wounded in iraq he lost the use of his right hand and one leg , and suffered severe stomach injuries when he was struck by shrapnel from two mortars in basra last year .
he is still in hospital recovering from a super-bug infection he caught after his latest operation .
he is to receive £ 57,000 in a one-off compensation payment from the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- , on top of a small annual income when he leaves the army .
his parents are planning to appeal against the compensation amount .
" jamie feels very let down , " says his father phil .
" yes , he chose to join the forces , but the mod should look after their own - he 's a young man who needs to be able to rebuild his life . "
jamie 's mother , caroline , says their appeal is not just on behalf of their son .
" i feel disgusted , angry and upset , " she said .
" these are the forgotten soldiers , the ones coming back injured , and we want more for the next soldiers to be injured too . "
another former chief of defence staff and uknda member , adm lord boyce , agrees that servicemen and women fell let down by those in charge .
and he says that feeling could hit troop recruitment and retention hard .
' public debate ' the uknda 's launch comes after the establishment last year of the british armed forces federation , a staff association set up amid growing discontent among the rank and file .
it also follows a report by the think tank demos on monday , which warned that the future for britain 's armed forces looked bleak unless steps were taken to improve pay , housing , training and recruitment .
the report 's authors , dr timothy edmunds , senior lecturer in the politics department at the university of bristol , and professor anthony forster of durham university , said britain needed a " pragmatic and public debate " on defence .
gordon brown has announced an extra £ 7.7bn for defence that debate should focus , they said , on what role the armed forces should be playing in the 21st century and whether their work in iraq and afghanistan was making britain a safer place .
in july , the mod was awarded an annual 1.5 % real-terms increase in its budget .
that compares with 4 % for health and 11 % for international development .
the mod also announced extra spending on accommodation for servicemen and women , bringing the total defence budget for 2008 to £ 34bn .
in a statement , the department said overall spending would increase by £ 7.7bn by 2011 .
this , it said , was " evidence of the government 's commitment to defence and to the men and women who serve with the utmost bravery in our armed forces " .
the mod also said it welcomed the contribution of the uknda to the spending debate .
" the uknda 's supporters include prominent former senior military personnel , including chiefs of staff , and their experience will undoubtedly be invaluable in any such debate , " it said .

it is rare for former top brass to start such a public campaign , let alone in such a sensitive political area - but they believe it is time to speak out .
the establishment of the uknda can be seen as a sign of the growing gulf between ministers and some in the military over the course of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan .
there are claims that the government is no longer honouring the military covenant , britain 's duty of care to its servicemen and women .
winston churchill , former mp and grandson of the uk 's prime minister during world war ii , is president of the group and insists that the government must prioritise spending on the armed forces .
" successive governments have let people down , " he says .
" whereas health and education have seen surges in spending , defence has seen a decline , and that needs to be reversed if we are to ensure our men and women on the front line have what they need .
" that decline in spending also means that when they come home injured there are few defence medical facilities for rehabilitation and some have to rely partially on charity for funding .

" whereas health and education have seen surges in spending , defence has seen a decline , and that needs to be reversed if we are to ensure our men and women on the front line have what they need .
" that decline in spending also means that when they come home injured there are few defence medical facilities for rehabilitation and some have to rely partially on charity for funding .
" while in terms of compensation , they get a fraction of what a civilian would receive for injuries . "
' let down ' the recent case of rifleman jamie cooper , who at the age of 18 became the youngest soldier to be badly injured in iraq , is one example .
these are the forgotten soldiers , the ones coming back injured caroline cooper mother of rifleman jamie cooper wounded in iraq he lost the use of his right hand and one leg , and suffered severe stomach injuries when he was struck by shrapnel from two mortars in basra last year .
he is still in hospital recovering from a super-bug infection he caught after his latest operation .
he is to receive £ 57,000 in a one-off compensation payment from the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- , on top of a small annual income when he leaves the army .
his parents are planning to appeal against the compensation amount .
" jamie feels very let down , " says his father phil .
" yes , he chose to join the forces , but the mod should look after their own - he 's a young man who needs to be able to rebuild his life . "
jamie 's mother , caroline , says their appeal is not just on behalf of their son .
" i feel disgusted , angry and upset , " she said .
" these are the forgotten soldiers , the ones coming back injured , and we want more for the next soldiers to be injured too . "
another former chief of defence staff and uknda member , adm lord boyce , agrees that servicemen and women fell let down by those in charge .
and he says that feeling could hit troop recruitment and retention hard .
' public debate ' the uknda 's launch comes after the establishment last year of the british armed forces federation , a staff association set up amid growing discontent among the rank and file .
it also follows a report by the think tank demos on monday , which warned that the future for britain 's armed forces looked bleak unless steps were taken to improve pay , housing , training and recruitment .
the report 's authors , dr timothy edmunds , senior lecturer in the politics department at the university of bristol , and professor anthony forster of durham university , said britain needed a " pragmatic and public debate " on defence .
gordon brown has announced an extra £ 7.7bn for defence that debate should focus , they said , on what role the armed forces should be playing in the 21st century and whether their work in iraq and afghanistan was making britain a safer place .
in july , the mod was awarded an annual 1.5 % real-terms increase in its budget .
that compares with 4 % for health and 11 % for international development .
the mod also announced extra spending on accommodation for servicemen and women , bringing the total defence budget for 2008 to £ 34bn .
in a statement , the department said overall spending would increase by £ 7.7bn by 2011 .
this , it said , was " evidence of the government 's commitment to defence and to the men and women who serve with the utmost bravery in our armed forces " .
the mod also said it welcomed the contribution of the uknda to the spending debate .
" the uknda 's supporters include prominent former senior military personnel , including chiefs of staff , and their experience will undoubtedly be invaluable in any such debate , " it said .

it is rare for former top brass to start such a public campaign , let alone in such a sensitive political area - but they believe it is time to speak out .
the establishment of the uknda can be seen as a sign of the growing gulf between ministers and some in the military over the course of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan .
there are claims that the government is no longer honouring the military covenant , britain 's duty of care to its servicemen and women .
winston churchill , former mp and grandson of the uk 's prime minister during world war ii , is president of the group and insists that the government must prioritise spending on the armed forces .
" successive governments have let people down , " he says .
" whereas health and education have seen surges in spending , defence has seen a decline , and that needs to be reversed if we are to ensure our men and women on the front line have what they need .
" that decline in spending also means that when they come home injured there are few defence medical facilities for rehabilitation and some have to rely partially on charity for funding .
" while in terms of compensation , they get a fraction of what a civilian would receive for injuries . "
' let down ' the recent case of rifleman jamie cooper , who at the age of 18 became the youngest soldier to be badly injured in iraq , is one example .
these are the forgotten soldiers , the ones coming back injured caroline cooper mother of rifleman jamie cooper wounded in iraq he lost the use of his right hand and one leg , and suffered severe stomach injuries when he was struck by shrapnel from two mortars in basra last year .
he is still in hospital recovering from a super-bug infection he caught after his latest operation .
he is to receive £ 57,000 in a one-off compensation payment from the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- , on top of a small annual income when he leaves the army .
his parents are planning to appeal against the compensation amount .
" jamie feels very let down , " says his father phil .
" yes , he chose to join the forces , but the mod should look after their own - he 's a young man who needs to be able to rebuild his life . "
jamie 's mother , caroline , says their appeal is not just on behalf of their son .
" i feel disgusted , angry and upset , " she said .
" these are the forgotten soldiers , the ones coming back injured , and we want more for the next soldiers to be injured too . "
another former chief of defence staff and uknda member , adm lord boyce , agrees that servicemen and women fell let down by those in charge .
and he says that feeling could hit troop recruitment and retention hard .
' public debate ' the uknda 's launch comes after the establishment last year of the british armed forces federation , a staff association set up amid growing discontent among the rank and file .
it also follows a report by the think tank demos on monday , which warned that the future for britain 's armed forces looked bleak unless steps were taken to improve pay , housing , training and recruitment .
the report 's authors , dr timothy edmunds , senior lecturer in the politics department at the university of bristol , and professor anthony forster of durham university , said britain needed a " pragmatic and public debate " on defence .
gordon brown has announced an extra £ 7.7bn for defence that debate should focus , they said , on what role the armed forces should be playing in the 21st century and whether their work in iraq and afghanistan was making britain a safer place .
in july , the mod was awarded an annual 1.5 % real-terms increase in its budget .
that compares with 4 % for health and 11 % for international development .
the mod also announced extra spending on accommodation for servicemen and women , bringing the total defence budget for 2008 to £ 34bn .
in a statement , the department said overall spending would increase by £ 7.7bn by 2011 .
this , it said , was " evidence of the government 's commitment to defence and to the men and women who serve with the utmost bravery in our armed forces " .
the mod also said it welcomed the contribution of the uknda to the spending debate .
" the uknda 's supporters include prominent former senior military personnel , including chiefs of staff , and their experience will undoubtedly be invaluable in any such debate , " it said .

it is rare for former top brass to start such a public campaign , let alone in such a sensitive political area - but they believe it is time to speak out .
the establishment of the uknda can be seen as a sign of the growing gulf between ministers and some in the military over the course of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan .
there are claims that the government is no longer honouring the military covenant , britain 's duty of care to its servicemen and women .
winston churchill , former mp and grandson of the uk 's prime minister during world war ii , is president of the group and insists that the government must prioritise spending on the armed forces .
" successive governments have let people down , " he says .
" whereas health and education have seen surges in spending , defence has seen a decline , and that needs to be reversed if we are to ensure our men and women on the front line have what they need .
" that decline in spending also means that when they come home injured there are few defence medical facilities for rehabilitation and some have to rely partially on charity for funding .
" while in terms of compensation , they get a fraction of what a civilian would receive for injuries . "
' let down ' the recent case of rifleman jamie cooper , who at the age of 18 became the youngest soldier to be badly injured in iraq , is one example . "
these are the forgotten soldiers , the ones coming back injured " caroline cooper mother of rifleman jamie cooper wounded in iraq he lost the use of his right hand and one leg , and suffered severe stomach injuries when he was struck by shrapnel from two mortars in basra last year .
he is still in hospital recovering from a super-bug infection he caught after his latest operation .
he is to receive £ 57,000 in a one-off compensation payment from the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- , on top of a small annual income when he leaves the army .
his parents are planning to appeal against the compensation amount .
" jamie feels very let down , " says his father phil .
" yes , he chose to join the forces , but the mod should look after their own - he 's a young man who needs to be able to rebuild his life . "
jamie 's mother , caroline , says their appeal is not just on behalf of their son .
" i feel disgusted , angry and upset , " she said .
" these are the forgotten soldiers , the ones coming back injured , and we want more for the next soldiers to be injured too . "
another former chief of defence staff and uknda member , adm lord boyce , agrees that servicemen and women fell let down by those in charge .
and he says that feeling could hit troop recruitment and retention hard .
' public debate ' the uknda 's launch comes after the establishment last year of the british armed forces federation , a staff association set up amid growing discontent among the rank and file .
it also follows a report by the think tank demos on monday , which warned that the future for britain 's armed forces looked bleak unless steps were taken to improve pay , housing , training and recruitment .
the report 's authors , dr timothy edmunds , senior lecturer in the politics department at the university of bristol , and professor anthony forster of durham university , said britain needed a " pragmatic and public debate " on defence .
that debate should focus , they said , on what role the armed forces should be playing in the 21st century and whether their work in iraq and afghanistan was making britain a safer place .
in july , the mod was awarded an annual 1.5 % real-terms increase in its budget .
that compares with 4 % for health and 11 % for international development .
the mod also announced extra spending on accommodation for servicemen and women , bringing the total defence budget for 2008 to £ 34bn .
in a statement , the department said overall spending would increase by £ 7.7bn by 2011 .
this , it said , was " evidence of the government 's commitment to defence and to the men and women who serve with the utmost bravery in our armed forces " .
the mod also said it welcomed the contribution of the uknda to the spending debate .
" the uknda 's supporters include prominent former senior military personnel , including chiefs of staff , and their experience will undoubtedly be invaluable in any such debate , " it said .

in his first annual report , tony jewell , who provides independent advice to the assembly government , says the population is living longer .
but he said more action was needed to tackle smoking , binge drinking and obesity , particularly in the young .
but one gp from merthyr tydfil warned it would be hard getting the health message home to many young people .
dr jewell said the overall health of people living in wales was " favourable " .
he said infant mortality rates were improving , people were living longer and deaths from heart and circulatory disease were reducing , although it remained the biggest killer .
however , concern remained for the health of children in wales , who drank more alcohol at an earlier age , exercised less and had higher body mass index results than the majority of countries in the western world . "
figures published earlier this week show that more mothers in wales -lrb- 37 % -rrb- smoked during their pregnancy than in any other uk country " tony jewell , chief medical officer for wales " while overall population indicators may show health is improving , these conceal wide variations within the population , " he said .
" i am particularly concerned about the health of children in wales , notably the rising epidemic of obesity , high smoking rates , and the growing culture of binge drinking . "
figures showed that while the number of adult smokers was falling , there were still 6,000 premature deaths each year , and children as young as 12 were taking up the habit .
dr jewell said the aim was to reduce the number of adults smoking from the current 25 % to 17 % .
" the smoking ban is a major step forward , but now we have to try and prevent young people starting to smoke and build the campaign for smoke-free homes - especially where there are children exposed to second-hand smoke , " he said .
reducing binge drinking was also a priority for health officials , according to the report which also recommended having smoke-free homes for children and tackling health inequalities in poorer communities .
' no aspirations ' dr jewell said he had joined other uk chief medical officers to write to the treasury to express concern about the relatively cheap price of alcohol and the need to consider tax policies as part of a programme of action .
the report also emphasised the need to tackle wider health inequalities of those in disadvantaged communities , such as the south wales valleys , which had higher than average rates of smoking , drinking and obesity .
but dr jonathan richards , of morlais surgery in dowlais , merthyr tydfil , believed it could be hard getting the health message home to many young people .
" research has shown that young people in the south wales valleys do not really think about the future , " he said .
" they live in the present and so if i 'm sitting there saying to them ' if you smoke now you will get lung disease in 20 years time or cancer in 25 years ' time ' , that is completely meaningless to them because they do n't have aspirations in terms of education .
" they do n't have aspirations in terms of jobs and therefore why bother changing a lifestyle they are enjoying ? "

sotheby 's was hoping the wheat fields would fetch up to $ 35m -lrb- £ 16.7m -rrb- , but it failed to reach its undisclosed reserve or attract a bid over $ 25m -lrb- £ 11.9m -rrb- .
the landscape was painted in 1890 , just two weeks before the artist 's suicide , and is considered to be possibly his last finished work .
" our estimates were obviously not accepted by the market , " a sotheby 's spokesman said .
the wheat fields was not the only painting that failed to sell at the auction .
' disappointing ' twenty out of the 76 lots on offer failed to attract buyers , including four works by picasso and others by pierre-auguste renoir , henri matisse , and claude monet .
david norman , co-chairman of impressionist and modern art at sotheby 's , insisted that while the results were disappointing , the market remained sound and blamed the poor sales on overly-optimistic estimates .
" i really think the art market , despite the results of the sales tonight , is strong with a tremendous capacity to absorb the works , " he said .
among the few successes of the night was picasso 's tete de femme , which fetched $ 29.1m -lrb- £ 13.8m -rrb- , setting a new record at auction for a sculpture by the artist .

sotheby 's was hoping the wheat fields would fetch up to $ 35m -lrb- £ 16.7m -rrb- , but it failed to reach its undisclosed reserve or attract a bid over $ 25m -lrb- £ 11.9m -rrb- .
the landscape was painted in 1890 , just two weeks before the artist 's suicide , and is considered to be possibly his last finished work .
" our estimates were obviously not accepted by the market , " a sotheby 's spokesman said .
the wheat fields was not the only painting that failed to sell at the auction .
' disappointing ' twenty out of the 76 lots on offer failed to attract buyers , including four works by picasso and others by pierre-auguste renoir , henri matisse , and claude monet .
david norman , co-chairman of impressionist and modern art at sotheby 's , insisted that while the results were disappointing , the market remained sound and blamed the poor sales on overly-optimistic estimates .
" i really think the art market , despite the results of the sales tonight , is strong with a tremendous capacity to absorb the works , " he said .
among the few successes of the night was picasso 's tete de femme , which fetched $ 29.1m -lrb- £ 13.8m -rrb- , setting a new record at auction for a sculpture by the artist .
