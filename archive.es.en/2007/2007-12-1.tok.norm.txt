why can there be virtually no surprises in the upcoming russian elections ?
dw-world.de spoke to russian sociologist lev gudkov about voters , their relationship to the state and their views of the political system . dw-world.de : how would you characterize the russian voters ' mood ahead of the presidential and parliamentary elections ? lev gudkov : i 'd point out that people have become increasingly content with their lives over the past year and a half .
we 're noticing for the first time that the general mood is positive : people are more satisfied than dissatisfied with their lives .
for 15 years - after 1991 - the mood was decidedly negative : people believed that the country was not developing in the right direction , that their opinions and interests were not considered , that their income was falling . all that , of course , is not equally distributed among different groups .
only 15 to 20 percent of people have actually benefited from all the changes , but the bulk of the people feel that they 're living like before .
for the first time after the crisis of 1998 , however , people have calmed down and they are not expecting any commotion in the near future .
this leads not so much to confidence and optimism as to the weakening of their feeling that something negative could happen .
we 're dealing here not so much with the formula : " look how well off we are , " but rather with the principle : " thank god , nothing bad is going on . " is that the reason why the russian president and his party are so popular ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lev gudkov thinks that most russians are satisfied with the system partly .
a large portion of people continue living with a soviet mindset .
they expect to get help , employment , social services and other things from the state .
in that sense , they are dependent on the government .
and their level of satisfaction with the government is based on whether or not the government fulfills these expectations . people , especially in the villages , although in cities , too , feel that they ca n't get through without state help - without free medical and social services etc .
putting aside the fact that voters are pressured , the opposition is getting squeezed out and the mass media are not free i.e. all those " gems " of managed democracy , people put their hopes in the party in power because it at lest can accomplish something .
and that 's also why they put their hopes in the president . so what are voters thinking nowadays ? strictly speaking , the situation is stable and will not essentially change until after the elections .
although slight surprises and mood swings are always possible .
fifty-three percent of the population is planning to take part in the elections , which means that 47 percent will not participate for political reasons . specifically , what reasons ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of russians will not be heading to the polls they do n't think that their voices can change anything .
most of them believe that the election results can be rigged , many are tired of politics and do n't trust the politicians .
only 5 percent of voters are abstaining from voting because they " do n't understand much about politics . "
basically , abstentions are fully motivated : those who are not finding a party that would represent their interests would rather abstain from voting than vote for anybody . how would you estimate party ratings ? approximately 59 percent of votes will go to -lsb- president putin 's -rsb- " one russia , " 18 percent will go to the communists , 9 percent to -lsb- moderate pro-kremlin -rsb- " just russia " and some 7 percent , i.e. around the minimum required to enter the parliament , will go to -lsb- right-winger -rsb- zhirinovsky 's party . none of the opposition democratic parties stand a chance ? unfortunately , none of them .
the -lsb- liberal -rsb- yabloko party is getting less than 3 percent and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- is in the 1 to 2 percent range . so if all the opposition democratic parties got together , they would still not pass the 7-percent barrier ? yes , the so-called democrats would not pass the minimum barrier . are you expecting any surprises from the parliamentary elections ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yabloko supporters wo n't make it to parliament i do n't expect any special surprises .
what kind of surprises could we expect when the media are so tightly controlled when it comes to political advertising and propaganda ?
it is possible that zhirinovksy 's ratings will go up in the last days before the elections - it has happened before , but only if no pressure is exerted on him .
in principle , in the current situation - in a managed democracy - he is not necessary .
to a certain extend , he 's even discrediting the kremlin . will the state parliament -lrb- duma -rrb- be controlled by the kremlin again ? the duma will have an absolute majority of pro-kremlin parties , which will make it completely steerable and in that sense dependent on the executive branch , obedient and ineffective . what do the majority of russians think about the developments of the russian political system ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " czar putin " -lrb- center -rrb- in a parody of a famous painting by ilya repin people do n't have a good idea of what a democracy is : they never lived in one .
at the same time , the populist conservative demagogy propelled by the communists in the 1990s and later by the ruling party lead to the discrediting of the very principles of democracy and democratic models . depending on their level of education and how well-informed they are , people understand the meaning of democracy as the right to criticize the authorities , the freedom to leave the country etc . , or things like chaos , dissolution , empty promises , demagogy .
people do n't understand and do n't know that democracy is a system based on the separation of powers and free competition of political parties .
only 10-12 percent of russians are truly familiar with democratic principles . are russians becoming more aware of the need to develop civil society ? no .
russian society remains very conservative with elements of feudal-state consciousness .
it is oriented towards the authorities , it is used to their caprices , it expects their patronage and entrusts its own will to those in power . interview : sergei morozov -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

why can there be virtually no surprises in the upcoming russian elections ?
dw-world.de spoke to russian sociologist lev gudkov about voters , their relationship to the state and their views of the political system . dw-world.de : how would you characterize the russian voters ' mood ahead of the presidential and parliamentary elections ? lev gudkov : i 'd point out that people have become increasingly content with their lives over the past year and a half .
we 're noticing for the first time that the general mood is positive : people are more satisfied than dissatisfied with their lives .
for 15 years - after 1991 - the mood was decidedly negative : people believed that the country was not developing in the right direction , that their opinions and interests were not considered , that their income was falling . all that , of course , is not equally distributed among different groups .
only 15 to 20 percent of people have actually benefited from all the changes , but the bulk of the people feel that they 're living like before .
for the first time after the crisis of 1998 , however , people have calmed down and they are not expecting any commotion in the near future .
this leads not so much to confidence and optimism as to the weakening of their feeling that something negative could happen .
we 're dealing here not so much with the formula : " look how well off we are , " but rather with the principle : " thank god , nothing bad is going on . " is that the reason why the russian president and his party are so popular ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lev gudkov thinks that most russians are satisfied with the system partly .
a large portion of people continue living with a soviet mindset .
they expect to get help , employment , social services and other things from the state .
in that sense , they are dependent on the government .
and their level of satisfaction with the government is based on whether or not the government fulfills these expectations . people , especially in the villages , although in cities , too , feel that they ca n't get through without state help - without free medical and social services etc .
putting aside the fact that voters are pressured , the opposition is getting squeezed out and the mass media are not free i.e. all those " gems " of managed democracy , people put their hopes in the party in power because it at lest can accomplish something .
and that 's also why they put their hopes in the president . so what are voters thinking nowadays ? strictly speaking , the situation is stable and will not essentially change until after the elections .
although slight surprises and mood swings are always possible .
fifty-three percent of the population is planning to take part in the elections , which means that 47 percent will not participate for political reasons . specifically , what reasons ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of russians will not be heading to the polls they do n't think that their voices can change anything .

why can there be virtually no surprises in the upcoming russian elections ?
dw-world.de spoke to russian sociologist lev gudkov about voters , their relationship to the state and their views of the political system . dw-world.de : how would you characterize the russian voters ' mood ahead of the presidential and parliamentary elections ? lev gudkov : i 'd point out that people have become increasingly content with their lives over the past year and a half .
we 're noticing for the first time that the general mood is positive : people are more satisfied than dissatisfied with their lives .
for 15 years - after 1991 - the mood was decidedly negative : people believed that the country was not developing in the right direction , that their opinions and interests were not considered , that their income was falling . all that , of course , is not equally distributed among different groups .
only 15 to 20 percent of people have actually benefited from all the changes , but the bulk of the people feel that they 're living like before .
for the first time after the crisis of 1998 , however , people have calmed down and they are not expecting any commotion in the near future .
this leads not so much to confidence and optimism as to the weakening of their feeling that something negative could happen .
we 're dealing here not so much with the formula : " look how well off we are , " but rather with the principle : " thank god , nothing bad is going on . " is that the reason why the russian president and his party are so popular ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lev gudkov thinks that most russians are satisfied with the system partly .
a large portion of people continue living with a soviet mindset .
they expect to get help , employment , social services and other things from the state .
in that sense , they are dependent on the government .
and their level of satisfaction with the government is based on whether or not the government fulfills these expectations . people , especially in the villages , although in cities , too , feel that they ca n't get through without state help - without free medical and social services etc .
putting aside the fact that voters are pressured , the opposition is getting squeezed out and the mass media are not free i.e. all those " gems " of managed democracy , people put their hopes in the party in power because it at lest can accomplish something .
and that 's also why they put their hopes in the president . so what are voters thinking nowadays ? strictly speaking , the situation is stable and will not essentially change until after the elections .
although slight surprises and mood swings are always possible .
fifty-three percent of the population is planning to take part in the elections , which means that 47 percent will not participate for political reasons . specifically , what reasons ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of russians will not be heading to the polls they do n't think that their voices can change anything .
most of them believe that the election results can be rigged , many are tired of politics and do n't trust the politicians .
only 5 percent of voters are abstaining from voting because they " do n't understand much about politics . "
basically , abstentions are fully motivated : those who are not finding a party that would represent their interests would rather abstain from voting than vote for anybody . how would you estimate party ratings ? approximately 59 percent of votes will go to -lsb- president putin 's -rsb- " one russia , " 18 percent will go to the communists , 9 percent to -lsb- moderate pro-kremlin -rsb- " just russia " and some 7 percent , i.e. around the minimum required to enter the parliament , will go to -lsb- right-winger -rsb- zhirinovsky 's party . none of the opposition democratic parties stand a chance ? unfortunately , none of them .
the -lsb- liberal -rsb- yabloko party is getting less than 3 percent and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- is in the 1 to 2 percent range . so if all the opposition democratic parties got together , they would still not pass the 7-percent barrier ? yes , the so-called democrats would not pass the minimum barrier . are you expecting any surprises from the parliamentary elections ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yabloko supporters wo n't make it to parliament i do n't expect any special surprises .
what kind of surprises could we expect when the media are so tightly controlled when it comes to political advertising and propaganda ?
it is possible that zhirinovksy 's ratings will go up in the last days before the elections - it has happened before , but only if no pressure is exerted on him .
in principle , in the current situation - in a managed democracy - he is not necessary .
to a certain extend , he 's even discrediting the kremlin . will the state parliament -lrb- duma -rrb- be controlled by the kremlin again ? the duma will have an absolute majority of pro-kremlin parties , which will make it completely steerable and in that sense dependent on the executive branch , obedient and ineffective . what do the majority of russians think about the developments of the russian political system ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " czar putin " -lrb- center -rrb- in a parody of a famous painting by ilya repin people do n't have a good idea of what a democracy is : they never lived in one .

the first hurdle on the road to a major national census in 2011 has been crossed , but berlin is resistant to brussels 's plans for a unified eu census . the census will be the first in germany since reunification .
expense and sensitive data protection issues mean that it will less comprehensive than those carried out in west germany in 1987 and in east germany in 1981 .
but it will nonetheless comprise data gathered from up to 8 million citizens and 17.5 million property-owners . the project has been mired in controversy over a range of issues .
most problematically , the various states objected to the financial contribution they were expected to make .
the preparations alone are set to cost 176 million euros -lrb- $ 261.4 million -rrb- , in addition to the 137 million-euro expense of the actual census . harmonizing data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels needs the information to develop policies but there are even more ambitious plans afoot . keen to end the practice of 27 states asking different questions at different times , brussels this month discussed the possibility of a unified eu census , which would need approval from eu governments . last week , plans to harmonize census data across the eu were approved by members of the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs at the european parliament . they include a list of questions the eu would like all member states to ask on how people live - including education , occupation , hours worked , and marital status - which would result in better quality data on areas such as housing and population .
the european commission says it needs this information to formulate policies . while this form of information is usually gathered nationally , the commission is arguing that it needs more central control to help its work . " the data has to be fully comparable at the european level , and is often requested at a level of regional detail and in a quality that can only be guaranteed by european legislation on population and housing censuses , " its said in a statement . prurient questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do people live in germany today the data requested would include ethnicity , literacy , size and type of family , religion , while the survey also wants to find out about issues such as computer literacy , number of cars owned , cooking facilities and " durable consumer goods possessed by the household .

" many felt these questions were too intrusive , while others feared that confidentiality could not be guaranteed . doubtful that privacy could be ensured on a european level , thomas mann , a christian democrat and member of the european parliament , believed that it was inadvisable to pass national data on to the eu 's eurostat office in luxembourg .

the alternative nobel prize winner suggested a few other ways of protecting the earth . hermann scheer is a social democratic member of the german parliament .
he is president of the eurosolar organization for renewable energy and general chairman of the world council for renewable energy . dw-world.de : what do you expect to come out of the negotiations on bali ? hermann scheer : that a decision will be made to hold another conference .
there are lots of good intentions and appeals , but nothing concrete .
too many expectations have been projected on this conference , which makes the disappointment afterward even bigger . for many governments , these meetings take the place of doing something , according to the unwritten motto : " speak globally , delay nationally . "
everything is put off until the conference , even though they know that no real break-through decisions will happen there .
the question has to be asked : is this the right level to be solving these problems at ? why are you so skeptical ?
there 's a lot of pressure for the participating countries to reach an agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer is general chairman of the world council for renewable energy all of these conferences depend on reaching a consensus .
but the principle of consensus contradicts the necessity of speeding things us .
and we desperately need to speed up the fight against climate change .
it 's time to think about not making these conferences a standard for everything that further decisions are based on . do un climate conferences have any value at all ? these conferences do have significance , which is why they should be held - that is , raising awareness of the problem and creating public pressure on the countries to act .
their value is in keeping the topic up high on the political agenda .
but you ca n't expect the necessary , practical solutions here .
action has to happen later , in the individual countries themselves . what topics should be discussed on bali ? an initiative for increased dismantling of nuclear power plants will be on the table on bali .
but you ca n't fall into the trap of thinking that nuclear power is the solution to the climate problem .
let 's just think about the problematic effects of nuclear energy , the costs associated with it , and the risks that result .
it needs to be critically discussed that the allegedly co2-free power plants lead to a dead end .
this approach is n't so much in the foreground because there 's supposed to be a guarantee of survival for the large power plants . why does co2 refinement lead to a dead end ? the concept of refining and storing co2 ca n't be successful .
it ca n't be released from the earth ever again .
it 's comparable to the atomic waste problem .
and it will be incredibly expensive .
everything will be swept to the side . it would be much better to get away from the big power plant structure and replace them with decentralized energy supplies .
and , internationally , we finally have to come to the realization that fighting climate change wo n't bring economic damage .
in fact , the opposite is true : increasing energy efficiency and switching to renewable energy sources means a huge economic benefit and is an investment in the future . what should the central points be in the successor treaty to kyoto ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer sees little future for nuclear power the cheapest method of relieving the climate situation should be put in the foreground - that is , a worldwide reforestation program that would considerably reduce the excess co2 in the atmosphere .
it would also be groundbreaking to organize a transfer of technology to developing and emerging nations . one proposal is to set up an international agency for renewable energy , but there 's too much resistant to it on bali .
i 've been following this idea for 17 years and since then it 's even been approved by the german government .
with the un consensus process , it probably would n't be possible .
the agency would have to be founded by the countries that want to participate as a government organization . are there other ways to include the developing and emerging nations ? we 'd have to talk about how we can give existing institutions more capacity and financial power to assist the countries .
that would be a topic that should be focused on at these kinds of conferences .
that 's true for unesco , when it 's a matter of training specialists .
it 's also true for unido , the un organization for industrial development that is there to support renewable energies in emerging nations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 01.12.2007 dutch consider new ways of holding back the waters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media suggested the island could be windmill-shaped island or take the form of a cannabis leaf with over half of its population living below sea level , the netherlands is particularly at risk from the effects of climate change .
one new idea is to build an island in the north sea - in the shape of a tulip . the off-shore island is meant to provide extra land for housing and offer coastal protection to the low-lying nation .
the dutch government has asked a governmental advisory body , the innovative platform -lrb- ip -rrb- , to carry out research into the feasibility of the proposal .
ip officials regard it as a good opportunity to showcase the country 's expertise in hydro-engineering and water management .
the dutch have been battling against the sea and the threat of floods for centuries and their skills are of world renown . but up to now , dutch contractors have only been commissioned to build grandiose projects overseas , in countries like dubai with its famous palm islands .
now , it could become a reality closer to home .
and what could be more dutch than the image of a tulip ? proposal for tulip-shaped island sparks debate bildunterschrift : one of the draft designs envisages building wind turbines on the island prime minister jan-peter balkenende , the chairman of ip , praised the body 's work in the water sector .
" we are good at hydraulic engineering and we should hold on to this leadership position , " he said .
" the tulip island has got the discussion going and has mobilized creative forces .
that is just how it should be if we want to innovate . "
the project was floated by joop atsma , a member of balkenende 's center-right christian democratic appeal party -lrb- cda -rrb- .
atsma envisages an island around 50,000 to 100,000 hectares in area situated off the coast of the randstad .
this is the country 's most populous area and includes the netherlands ' four largest cities : amsterdam , rotterdam , the hague and utrecht .
a cda spokeswoman said the research should show if the proposal is affordable .
she added that the price of land in the area had risen to such heights that creating an island could bring some relief to the real estate market .
" it could be a solution to the lack of space we have in the netherlands , " she said .
" in addition , it could act as a buffer , improving coastal protection . "
worries about the impact of an island bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rivers are set to become an increasing threat in the future but the idea has triggered mixed reactions .
environmental groups and some hydro-engineering firms believe other solutions might be cheaper , more effective and have less impact on the landscape .
one thing that 's clear is that more action is needed to protect the dutch from the effects of global warming .
experts from the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change project that the sea will rise by anything between 9 and 88 centimeters -lrb- 3.5 to 35 inches -rrb- by the end of the 21st century .
coastal surges are set to become an increasing threat to life and property in years to come .
holland already has one of the world 's most ambitious flood defense systems , which has been described by some as the eighth wonder of the world .
its construction was prompted by the flooding tragedy of 1953 , in which more than 1,800 people lost their lives and tens of thousands of people had to be evacuated . consisting of dams , sluices , locks , dikes and storm surge barriers , the delta works block the estuary mouths of a number of major rivers in the southwest of holland and controls the entry of water into those rivers that have to remain navigable .
recent studies have , however , shown that defenses on eight stretches of the coast are too weak .
the government is planning to rectify this matter by 2015 and has allocated 741 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- to this end .
ellen verkoelen , director of the environmental federation of southern holland , said she believes that an artificial island does not really address this problem .
she said she thinks it is more about creating additional space for real estate .
extending dunes and beaches is another option bildunterschrift : holland 's system of sea and river dikes date from medieval times verkoelen said she favors extending the coastline with sand . her organization has been working with the government on the problem for two years and is about to carry out a pilot scheme to test the idea .
" five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- more beach and dunes would give more safety and recreation , " she said .
" it 's also the least expensive way of dealing with the problem .
twenty to 50 years from now we would have a lot of new coast . "
" the sea level change can be stopped in this way , but not with the island , " she added .
" it would have to be an island as big as holland .
this is a marketing strategy .
it 's the same as in dubai . "
the extension of dunes and beaches is also an idea that could be copied in less wealthy countries with similar problems unlike the costly island project .
a similar solution is supported by the north sea foundation , an environmental group .
their spokesman , jaroan dagevos , said he is worried about the visual , environmental and even psychological impact of the proposed island , which he said would stretch along about a fifth of the coastline .
" holland is one of the most crowded countries in the world and if you want to enjoy some open space , you go to the sea , " he said .
" we do n't have many spaces like that .
this is one of the last big nature areas in this region .
" we have to do more to keep the coast as it is , " he added .
" an island is not a solution .
the whole view of the north sea will disappear and this will upset streaming patterns of larvae and fish . "
trend towards cheap solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : god made the world and the dutch made the netherlands is a common saying in holland even the marine contractors responsible for building dubai 's palm islands , van oord , expressed their backing for a cheaper solution .

one new idea is to build an island in the north sea - in the shape of a tulip . the off-shore island is meant to provide extra land for housing and offer coastal protection to the low-lying nation .
the dutch government has asked a governmental advisory body , the innovative platform -lrb- ip -rrb- , to carry out research into the feasibility of the proposal .
ip officials regard it as a good opportunity to showcase the country 's expertise in hydro-engineering and water management .
the dutch have been battling against the sea and the threat of floods for centuries and their skills are of world renown . but up to now , dutch contractors have only been commissioned to build grandiose projects overseas , in countries like dubai with its famous palm islands .
now , it could become a reality closer to home .
and what could be more dutch than the image of a tulip ? proposal for tulip-shaped island sparks debate bildunterschrift : one of the draft designs envisages building wind turbines on the island prime minister jan-peter balkenende , the chairman of ip , praised the body 's work in the water sector .
" we are good at hydraulic engineering and we should hold on to this leadership position , " he said .
" the tulip island has got the discussion going and has mobilized creative forces .
that is just how it should be if we want to innovate . "
the project was floated by joop atsma , a member of balkenende 's center-right christian democratic appeal party -lrb- cda -rrb- .
atsma envisages an island around 50,000 to 100,000 hectares in area situated off the coast of the randstad .
this is the country 's most populous area and includes the netherlands ' four largest cities : amsterdam , rotterdam , the hague and utrecht .
a cda spokeswoman said the research should show if the proposal is affordable .
she added that the price of land in the area had risen to such heights that creating an island could bring some relief to the real estate market .
" it could be a solution to the lack of space we have in the netherlands , " she said .
" in addition , it could act as a buffer , improving coastal protection . "
worries about the impact of an island bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rivers are set to become an increasing threat in the future but the idea has triggered mixed reactions .
environmental groups and some hydro-engineering firms believe other solutions might be cheaper , more effective and have less impact on the landscape .
one thing that 's clear is that more action is needed to protect the dutch from the effects of global warming .
experts from the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change project that the sea will rise by anything between 9 and 88 centimeters -lrb- 3.5 to 35 inches -rrb- by the end of the 21st century .
coastal surges are set to become an increasing threat to life and property in years to come .
holland already has one of the world 's most ambitious flood defense systems , which has been described by some as the eighth wonder of the world .
its construction was prompted by the flooding tragedy of 1953 , in which more than 1,800 people lost their lives and tens of thousands of people had to be evacuated . consisting of dams , sluices , locks , dikes and storm surge barriers , the delta works block the estuary mouths of a number of major rivers in the southwest of holland and controls the entry of water into those rivers that have to remain navigable .
recent studies have , however , shown that defenses on eight stretches of the coast are too weak .
the government is planning to rectify this matter by 2015 and has allocated 741 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- to this end .
ellen verkoelen , director of the environmental federation of southern holland , said she believes that an artificial island does not really address this problem .
she said she thinks it is more about creating additional space for real estate .
extending dunes and beaches is another option bildunterschrift : holland 's system of sea and river dikes date from medieval times verkoelen said she favors extending the coastline with sand . her organization has been working with the government on the problem for two years and is about to carry out a pilot scheme to test the idea .
" five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- more beach and dunes would give more safety and recreation , " she said .
" it 's also the least expensive way of dealing with the problem .
twenty to 50 years from now we would have a lot of new coast . "
" the sea level change can be stopped in this way , but not with the island , " she added .
" it would have to be an island as big as holland .
this is a marketing strategy .
it 's the same as in dubai . "
the extension of dunes and beaches is also an idea that could be copied in less wealthy countries with similar problems unlike the costly island project .
a similar solution is supported by the north sea foundation , an environmental group .
their spokesman , jaroan dagevos , said he is worried about the visual , environmental and even psychological impact of the proposed island , which he said would stretch along about a fifth of the coastline .
" holland is one of the most crowded countries in the world and if you want to enjoy some open space , you go to the sea , " he said .
" we do n't have many spaces like that .
this is one of the last big nature areas in this region .
" we have to do more to keep the coast as it is , " he added .
" an island is not a solution .
the whole view of the north sea will disappear and this will upset streaming patterns of larvae and fish . "
trend towards cheap solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : god made the world and the dutch made the netherlands is a common saying in holland even the marine contractors responsible for building dubai 's palm islands , van oord , expressed their backing for a cheaper solution .

1 , urged the eu and g8 industrial nations to live up to promises on climate change .
her own country is ready to set an example , she said . the eu and the g8 summit in germany earlier this year " took international decisions to do more for climate protection , " the chancellor said in her weekly podcast . " in particular we need a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol that expires in 2012 , " she said .
she said the un climate conference starting in bali on monday needed to agree on a timetable so that negotiations on a follow-up agreement to kyoto could be completed by the end of 2009 . the kyoto protocol , which went into effect in 2005 , requires industrial countries to reduce their carbon emissions by 2012 .
but the world 's two top co2 polluters , the united states and china , are not bound to fixed reductions under the pact . although the us signed the kyoto protocol , it never ratified it .
china 's case is different : as a developing country , it was not bound by the protocol 's emissions cap . the aim of the bali meeting , which runs until dec .
14 , is to gain consensus on a formal framework for reaching a new emissions-reduction pact over the next two years . setting an example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming is already taking its toll in the arctic " every country has to decide for itself , " merkel said .
" germany is ready to set an example . " on wednesday , the german cabinet is due to agree on a package of measures designed to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
" time is running out , " she said .
" the international climate control panel has warned that we have only until the middle of the century to reduce co2 emissions by half . " a hot issue at bali will be whether the us will join a new global treaty on climate change even if emerging economies like china and india continue to resist making cuts . although developed industrialized countries are blamed for 70 percent of the co2 currently in the atmosphere , developing countries are expected to bear the brunt of suffering from the extreme weather conditions linked to global warming . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , at a conference in germany . " the responses to international terrorism have not always been adequate " despite a broad consensus among the nations of europe and the united states about the danger , he told an anti-terrorism conference in werder , 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- southwest of berlin .
schäuble was joined by us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and the interior ministers of france , britain , italy , spain and poland for the two-day meeting , which ended saturday .
the talks were designed to explore ways of strengthening preventive measures against terrorist actions and improve methods of cross-border coordination in combating terrorism .
extraditing terror suspects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble wants more coordination between states the german minister said different solutions were needed because the penalties enshrined in criminal laws in force today no longer acted as a deterrent to terrorists .
one of the issues under discussion was how to deal with terrorist suspects holding foreign passports - more specifically whether they should be extradited if the countries receiving them pledge to treat them according to international law and human rights standards .
another issue covers the exchange of information related to terrorist threats and the legal aspects covering how such information is obtained .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 01.12.2007 dutch consider new ways of holding back the waters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media suggested the island could be windmill-shaped island or take the form of a cannabis leaf with over half of its population living below sea level , the netherlands is particularly at risk from the effects of climate change .
one new idea is to build an island in the north sea - in the shape of a tulip . the off-shore island is meant to provide extra land for housing and offer coastal protection to the low-lying nation .
the dutch government has asked a governmental advisory body , the innovative platform -lrb- ip -rrb- , to carry out research into the feasibility of the proposal .
ip officials regard it as a good opportunity to showcase the country 's expertise in hydro-engineering and water management .
the dutch have been battling against the sea and the threat of floods for centuries and their skills are of world renown . but up to now , dutch contractors have only been commissioned to build grandiose projects overseas , in countries like dubai with its famous palm islands .
now , it could become a reality closer to home .
and what could be more dutch than the image of a tulip ? proposal for tulip-shaped island sparks debate bildunterschrift : one of the draft designs envisages building wind turbines on the island prime minister jan-peter balkenende , the chairman of ip , praised the body 's work in the water sector .
" we are good at hydraulic engineering and we should hold on to this leadership position , " he said .
" the tulip island has got the discussion going and has mobilized creative forces .
that is just how it should be if we want to innovate . "
the project was floated by joop atsma , a member of balkenende 's center-right christian democratic appeal party -lrb- cda -rrb- .
atsma envisages an island around 50,000 to 100,000 hectares in area situated off the coast of the randstad .
this is the country 's most populous area and includes the netherlands ' four largest cities : amsterdam , rotterdam , the hague and utrecht .
a cda spokeswoman said the research should show if the proposal is affordable .
she added that the price of land in the area had risen to such heights that creating an island could bring some relief to the real estate market .
" it could be a solution to the lack of space we have in the netherlands , " she said .
" in addition , it could act as a buffer , improving coastal protection . "
worries about the impact of an island bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rivers are set to become an increasing threat in the future but the idea has triggered mixed reactions .
environmental groups and some hydro-engineering firms believe other solutions might be cheaper , more effective and have less impact on the landscape .
one thing that 's clear is that more action is needed to protect the dutch from the effects of global warming .
experts from the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change project that the sea will rise by anything between 9 and 88 centimeters -lrb- 3.5 to 35 inches -rrb- by the end of the 21st century .
coastal surges are set to become an increasing threat to life and property in years to come .
holland already has one of the world 's most ambitious flood defense systems , which has been described by some as the eighth wonder of the world .
its construction was prompted by the flooding tragedy of 1953 , in which more than 1,800 people lost their lives and tens of thousands of people had to be evacuated . consisting of dams , sluices , locks , dikes and storm surge barriers , the delta works block the estuary mouths of a number of major rivers in the southwest of holland and controls the entry of water into those rivers that have to remain navigable .
recent studies have , however , shown that defenses on eight stretches of the coast are too weak .
the government is planning to rectify this matter by 2015 and has allocated 741 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- to this end .
ellen verkoelen , director of the environmental federation of southern holland , said she believes that an artificial island does not really address this problem .
she said she thinks it is more about creating additional space for real estate .
extending dunes and beaches is another option bildunterschrift : holland 's system of sea and river dikes date from medieval times verkoelen said she favors extending the coastline with sand . her organization has been working with the government on the problem for two years and is about to carry out a pilot scheme to test the idea .
" five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- more beach and dunes would give more safety and recreation , " she said .
" it 's also the least expensive way of dealing with the problem .
twenty to 50 years from now we would have a lot of new coast . "
" the sea level change can be stopped in this way , but not with the island , " she added .
" it would have to be an island as big as holland .
this is a marketing strategy .
it 's the same as in dubai . "
the extension of dunes and beaches is also an idea that could be copied in less wealthy countries with similar problems unlike the costly island project .
a similar solution is supported by the north sea foundation , an environmental group .
their spokesman , jaroan dagevos , said he is worried about the visual , environmental and even psychological impact of the proposed island , which he said would stretch along about a fifth of the coastline .
" holland is one of the most crowded countries in the world and if you want to enjoy some open space , you go to the sea , " he said .
" we do n't have many spaces like that .
this is one of the last big nature areas in this region .
" we have to do more to keep the coast as it is , " he added .
" an island is not a solution .
the whole view of the north sea will disappear and this will upset streaming patterns of larvae and fish . "
trend towards cheap solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : god made the world and the dutch made the netherlands is a common saying in holland even the marine contractors responsible for building dubai 's palm islands , van oord , expressed their backing for a cheaper solution .
" i think it 's more realistic to widen the beaches and dunes into the north sea , " said van oord 's spokesman , bert groothuizen .
" it 's not very revolutionary .
the idea has been about for the last 30 years .
but it 's a very economical option . "
the trend generally appears to be towards less interventionist schemes .
" we are moving away from engineering solutions and towards building with nature , " he said .
mark van zanten , of the maritime consultancy firm royal haskoning , took a more positive approach towards the proposed island .
he said it would have the advantage of being both a protective measure and an area for potential development .
" we can design it so it will serve both purposes , " he said .
" if we built it high enough , it will probably be one of the safest places in the netherlands . "
but he did not rule out other coastal protection options .
" we are looking into the possibility of building an artificial reef made of sand and stones that would protect the coast from heavy storms , " he said .
of course , the netherlands - once described by the dutch government as the " drain of europe " - does not just face a threat from the sea .
thanks to climate change , the risk of flooding inland is also growing .
the dutch are now leading the way in the design of floating homes .
the technical university in delft is working on a project that even investigates the possibility of building an entire floating city . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her own country is ready to set an example , she said . the eu and the g8 summit in germany earlier this year " took international decisions to do more for climate protection , " the chancellor said in her weekly podcast . " in particular we need a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol that expires in 2012 , " she said .
she said the un climate conference starting in bali on monday needed to agree on a timetable so that negotiations on a follow-up agreement to kyoto could be completed by the end of 2009 . the kyoto protocol , which went into effect in 2005 , requires industrial countries to reduce their carbon emissions by 2012 .
but the world 's two top co2 polluters , the united states and china , are not bound to fixed reductions under the pact . although the us signed the kyoto protocol , it never ratified it .

schäuble was joined by us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and the interior ministers of france , britain , italy , spain and poland for the two-day meeting , which ended saturday .

the alternative nobel prize winner suggested a few other ways of protecting the earth . hermann scheer is a social democratic member of the german parliament .
he is president of the eurosolar organization for renewable energy and general chairman of the world council for renewable energy . dw-world.de : what do you expect to come out of the negotiations on bali ? hermann scheer : that a decision will be made to hold another conference .
there are lots of good intentions and appeals , but nothing concrete .
too many expectations have been projected on this conference , which makes the disappointment afterward even bigger . for many governments , these meetings take the place of doing something , according to the unwritten motto : " speak globally , delay nationally . "
everything is put off until the conference , even though they know that no real break-through decisions will happen there .
the question has to be asked : is this the right level to be solving these problems at ? why are you so skeptical ?
there 's a lot of pressure for the participating countries to reach an agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer is general chairman of the world council for renewable energy all of these conferences depend on reaching a consensus .
but the principle of consensus contradicts the necessity of speeding things us .
and we desperately need to speed up the fight against climate change .
it 's time to think about not making these conferences a standard for everything that further decisions are based on . do un climate conferences have any value at all ? these conferences do have significance , which is why they should be held - that is , raising awareness of the problem and creating public pressure on the countries to act .
their value is in keeping the topic up high on the political agenda .
but you ca n't expect the necessary , practical solutions here .
action has to happen later , in the individual countries themselves . what topics should be discussed on bali ? an initiative for increased dismantling of nuclear power plants will be on the table on bali .
but you ca n't fall into the trap of thinking that nuclear power is the solution to the climate problem .
let 's just think about the problematic effects of nuclear energy , the costs associated with it , and the risks that result .
it needs to be critically discussed that the allegedly co2-free power plants lead to a dead end .
this approach is n't so much in the foreground because there 's supposed to be a guarantee of survival for the large power plants . why does co2 refinement lead to a dead end ? the concept of refining and storing co2 ca n't be successful .
it ca n't be released from the earth ever again .
it 's comparable to the atomic waste problem .
and it will be incredibly expensive .
everything will be swept to the side . it would be much better to get away from the big power plant structure and replace them with decentralized energy supplies .
and , internationally , we finally have to come to the realization that fighting climate change wo n't bring economic damage .
in fact , the opposite is true : increasing energy efficiency and switching to renewable energy sources means a huge economic benefit and is an investment in the future . what should the central points be in the successor treaty to kyoto ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer sees little future for nuclear power the cheapest method of relieving the climate situation should be put in the foreground - that is , a worldwide reforestation program that would considerably reduce the excess co2 in the atmosphere .
it would also be groundbreaking to organize a transfer of technology to developing and emerging nations . one proposal is to set up an international agency for renewable energy , but there 's too much resistant to it on bali .
i 've been following this idea for 17 years and since then it 's even been approved by the german government .
with the un consensus process , it probably would n't be possible .
the agency would have to be founded by the countries that want to participate as a government organization . are there other ways to include the developing and emerging nations ? we 'd have to talk about how we can give existing institutions more capacity and financial power to assist the countries .
that would be a topic that should be focused on at these kinds of conferences .
that 's true for unesco , when it 's a matter of training specialists .
it 's also true for unido , the un organization for industrial development that is there to support renewable energies in emerging nations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 01.12.2007 dutch consider new ways of holding back the waters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media suggested the island could be windmill-shaped island or take the form of a cannabis leaf with over half of its population living below sea level , the netherlands is particularly at risk from the effects of climate change .
one new idea is to build an island in the north sea - in the shape of a tulip . the off-shore island is meant to provide extra land for housing and offer coastal protection to the low-lying nation .
the dutch government has asked a governmental advisory body , the innovative platform -lrb- ip -rrb- , to carry out research into the feasibility of the proposal .
ip officials regard it as a good opportunity to showcase the country 's expertise in hydro-engineering and water management .
the dutch have been battling against the sea and the threat of floods for centuries and their skills are of world renown . but up to now , dutch contractors have only been commissioned to build grandiose projects overseas , in countries like dubai with its famous palm islands .
now , it could become a reality closer to home .
and what could be more dutch than the image of a tulip ? proposal for tulip-shaped island sparks debate bildunterschrift : one of the draft designs envisages building wind turbines on the island prime minister jan-peter balkenende , the chairman of ip , praised the body 's work in the water sector .
" we are good at hydraulic engineering and we should hold on to this leadership position , " he said .
" the tulip island has got the discussion going and has mobilized creative forces .
that is just how it should be if we want to innovate . "
the project was floated by joop atsma , a member of balkenende 's center-right christian democratic appeal party -lrb- cda -rrb- .
atsma envisages an island around 50,000 to 100,000 hectares in area situated off the coast of the randstad .
this is the country 's most populous area and includes the netherlands ' four largest cities : amsterdam , rotterdam , the hague and utrecht .
a cda spokeswoman said the research should show if the proposal is affordable .
she added that the price of land in the area had risen to such heights that creating an island could bring some relief to the real estate market .
" it could be a solution to the lack of space we have in the netherlands , " she said .
" in addition , it could act as a buffer , improving coastal protection . "
worries about the impact of an island bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rivers are set to become an increasing threat in the future but the idea has triggered mixed reactions .
environmental groups and some hydro-engineering firms believe other solutions might be cheaper , more effective and have less impact on the landscape .
one thing that 's clear is that more action is needed to protect the dutch from the effects of global warming .
experts from the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change project that the sea will rise by anything between 9 and 88 centimeters -lrb- 3.5 to 35 inches -rrb- by the end of the 21st century .
coastal surges are set to become an increasing threat to life and property in years to come .
holland already has one of the world 's most ambitious flood defense systems , which has been described by some as the eighth wonder of the world .
its construction was prompted by the flooding tragedy of 1953 , in which more than 1,800 people lost their lives and tens of thousands of people had to be evacuated . consisting of dams , sluices , locks , dikes and storm surge barriers , the delta works block the estuary mouths of a number of major rivers in the southwest of holland and controls the entry of water into those rivers that have to remain navigable .
recent studies have , however , shown that defenses on eight stretches of the coast are too weak .
the government is planning to rectify this matter by 2015 and has allocated 741 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- to this end .
ellen verkoelen , director of the environmental federation of southern holland , said she believes that an artificial island does not really address this problem .
she said she thinks it is more about creating additional space for real estate .
extending dunes and beaches is another option bildunterschrift : holland 's system of sea and river dikes date from medieval times verkoelen said she favors extending the coastline with sand . her organization has been working with the government on the problem for two years and is about to carry out a pilot scheme to test the idea .
" five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- more beach and dunes would give more safety and recreation , " she said .
" it 's also the least expensive way of dealing with the problem .
twenty to 50 years from now we would have a lot of new coast . "
" the sea level change can be stopped in this way , but not with the island , " she added .
" it would have to be an island as big as holland .
this is a marketing strategy .
it 's the same as in dubai . "
the extension of dunes and beaches is also an idea that could be copied in less wealthy countries with similar problems unlike the costly island project .
a similar solution is supported by the north sea foundation , an environmental group .
their spokesman , jaroan dagevos , said he is worried about the visual , environmental and even psychological impact of the proposed island , which he said would stretch along about a fifth of the coastline .
" holland is one of the most crowded countries in the world and if you want to enjoy some open space , you go to the sea , " he said .
" we do n't have many spaces like that .
this is one of the last big nature areas in this region .
" we have to do more to keep the coast as it is , " he added .
" an island is not a solution .
the whole view of the north sea will disappear and this will upset streaming patterns of larvae and fish . "
trend towards cheap solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : god made the world and the dutch made the netherlands is a common saying in holland even the marine contractors responsible for building dubai 's palm islands , van oord , expressed their backing for a cheaper solution .
" i think it 's more realistic to widen the beaches and dunes into the north sea , " said van oord 's spokesman , bert groothuizen .
" it 's not very revolutionary .
the idea has been about for the last 30 years .
but it 's a very economical option . "
the trend generally appears to be towards less interventionist schemes .
" we are moving away from engineering solutions and towards building with nature , " he said .
mark van zanten , of the maritime consultancy firm royal haskoning , took a more positive approach towards the proposed island .
he said it would have the advantage of being both a protective measure and an area for potential development .
" we can design it so it will serve both purposes , " he said .
" if we built it high enough , it will probably be one of the safest places in the netherlands . "
but he did not rule out other coastal protection options .
" we are looking into the possibility of building an artificial reef made of sand and stones that would protect the coast from heavy storms , " he said .
of course , the netherlands - once described by the dutch government as the " drain of europe " - does not just face a threat from the sea .
thanks to climate change , the risk of flooding inland is also growing .

one new idea is to build an island in the north sea - in the shape of a tulip . the off-shore island is meant to provide extra land for housing and offer coastal protection to the low-lying nation .
the dutch government has asked a governmental advisory body , the innovative platform -lrb- ip -rrb- , to carry out research into the feasibility of the proposal .
ip officials regard it as a good opportunity to showcase the country 's expertise in hydro-engineering and water management .
the dutch have been battling against the sea and the threat of floods for centuries and their skills are of world renown . but up to now , dutch contractors have only been commissioned to build grandiose projects overseas , in countries like dubai with its famous palm islands .
now , it could become a reality closer to home .
and what could be more dutch than the image of a tulip ? proposal for tulip-shaped island sparks debate bildunterschrift : one of the draft designs envisages building wind turbines on the island prime minister jan-peter balkenende , the chairman of ip , praised the body 's work in the water sector .
" we are good at hydraulic engineering and we should hold on to this leadership position , " he said .
" the tulip island has got the discussion going and has mobilized creative forces .
that is just how it should be if we want to innovate . "
the project was floated by joop atsma , a member of balkenende 's center-right christian democratic appeal party -lrb- cda -rrb- .
atsma envisages an island around 50,000 to 100,000 hectares in area situated off the coast of the randstad .
this is the country 's most populous area and includes the netherlands ' four largest cities : amsterdam , rotterdam , the hague and utrecht .
a cda spokeswoman said the research should show if the proposal is affordable .
she added that the price of land in the area had risen to such heights that creating an island could bring some relief to the real estate market .
" it could be a solution to the lack of space we have in the netherlands , " she said .

one thing that 's clear is that more action is needed to protect the dutch from the effects of global warming .
experts from the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change project that the sea will rise by anything between 9 and 88 centimeters -lrb- 3.5 to 35 inches -rrb- by the end of the 21st century .
coastal surges are set to become an increasing threat to life and property in years to come .
holland already has one of the world 's most ambitious flood defense systems , which has been described by some as the eighth wonder of the world .
its construction was prompted by the flooding tragedy of 1953 , in which more than 1,800 people lost their lives and tens of thousands of people had to be evacuated . consisting of dams , sluices , locks , dikes and storm surge barriers , the delta works block the estuary mouths of a number of major rivers in the southwest of holland and controls the entry of water into those rivers that have to remain navigable .
recent studies have , however , shown that defenses on eight stretches of the coast are too weak .
the government is planning to rectify this matter by 2015 and has allocated 741 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- to this end .
ellen verkoelen , director of the environmental federation of southern holland , said she believes that an artificial island does not really address this problem .
she said she thinks it is more about creating additional space for real estate .
extending dunes and beaches is another option bildunterschrift : holland 's system of sea and river dikes date from medieval times verkoelen said she favors extending the coastline with sand . her organization has been working with the government on the problem for two years and is about to carry out a pilot scheme to test the idea .
" five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- more beach and dunes would give more safety and recreation , " she said .
" it 's also the least expensive way of dealing with the problem .
twenty to 50 years from now we would have a lot of new coast . "
" the sea level change can be stopped in this way , but not with the island , " she added .
" it would have to be an island as big as holland .
this is a marketing strategy .
it 's the same as in dubai . "
the extension of dunes and beaches is also an idea that could be copied in less wealthy countries with similar problems unlike the costly island project .
a similar solution is supported by the north sea foundation , an environmental group .
their spokesman , jaroan dagevos , said he is worried about the visual , environmental and even psychological impact of the proposed island , which he said would stretch along about a fifth of the coastline .
" holland is one of the most crowded countries in the world and if you want to enjoy some open space , you go to the sea , " he said .
" we do n't have many spaces like that .
this is one of the last big nature areas in this region .
" we have to do more to keep the coast as it is , " he added .
" an island is not a solution .
the whole view of the north sea will disappear and this will upset streaming patterns of larvae and fish . "
trend towards cheap solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : god made the world and the dutch made the netherlands is a common saying in holland even the marine contractors responsible for building dubai 's palm islands , van oord , expressed their backing for a cheaper solution .
" i think it 's more realistic to widen the beaches and dunes into the north sea , " said van oord 's spokesman , bert groothuizen .
" it 's not very revolutionary .
the idea has been about for the last 30 years .
but it 's a very economical option . "
the trend generally appears to be towards less interventionist schemes .
" we are moving away from engineering solutions and towards building with nature , " he said .
mark van zanten , of the maritime consultancy firm royal haskoning , took a more positive approach towards the proposed island .
he said it would have the advantage of being both a protective measure and an area for potential development .
" we can design it so it will serve both purposes , " he said .
" if we built it high enough , it will probably be one of the safest places in the netherlands . "
but he did not rule out other coastal protection options .
" we are looking into the possibility of building an artificial reef made of sand and stones that would protect the coast from heavy storms , " he said .

one new idea is to build an island in the north sea - in the shape of a tulip . the off-shore island is meant to provide extra land for housing and offer coastal protection to the low-lying nation .
the dutch government has asked a governmental advisory body , the innovative platform -lrb- ip -rrb- , to carry out research into the feasibility of the proposal .
ip officials regard it as a good opportunity to showcase the country 's expertise in hydro-engineering and water management .
the dutch have been battling against the sea and the threat of floods for centuries and their skills are of world renown . but up to now , dutch contractors have only been commissioned to build grandiose projects overseas , in countries like dubai with its famous palm islands .
now , it could become a reality closer to home .
and what could be more dutch than the image of a tulip ? proposal for tulip-shaped island sparks debate bildunterschrift : one of the draft designs envisages building wind turbines on the island prime minister jan-peter balkenende , the chairman of ip , praised the body 's work in the water sector .
" we are good at hydraulic engineering and we should hold on to this leadership position , " he said .
" the tulip island has got the discussion going and has mobilized creative forces .
that is just how it should be if we want to innovate . "
the project was floated by joop atsma , a member of balkenende 's center-right christian democratic appeal party -lrb- cda -rrb- .
atsma envisages an island around 50,000 to 100,000 hectares in area situated off the coast of the randstad .
this is the country 's most populous area and includes the netherlands ' four largest cities : amsterdam , rotterdam , the hague and utrecht .
a cda spokeswoman said the research should show if the proposal is affordable .
she added that the price of land in the area had risen to such heights that creating an island could bring some relief to the real estate market .
" it could be a solution to the lack of space we have in the netherlands , " she said .
" in addition , it could act as a buffer , improving coastal protection . "

her own country is ready to set an example , she said . the eu and the g8 summit in germany earlier this year " took international decisions to do more for climate protection , " the chancellor said in her weekly podcast . " in particular we need a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol that expires in 2012 , " she said .
she said the un climate conference starting in bali on monday needed to agree on a timetable so that negotiations on a follow-up agreement to kyoto could be completed by the end of 2009 . the kyoto protocol , which went into effect in 2005 , requires industrial countries to reduce their carbon emissions by 2012 .
but the world 's two top co2 polluters , the united states and china , are not bound to fixed reductions under the pact . although the us signed the kyoto protocol , it never ratified it .
china 's case is different : as a developing country , it was not bound by the protocol 's emissions cap . the aim of the bali meeting , which runs until dec .
14 , is to gain consensus on a formal framework for reaching a new emissions-reduction pact over the next two years . setting an example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming is already taking its toll in the arctic " every country has to decide for itself , " merkel said .
" germany is ready to set an example . " on wednesday , the german cabinet is due to agree on a package of measures designed to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
" time is running out , " she said .
" the international climate control panel has warned that we have only until the middle of the century to reduce co2 emissions by half . " a hot issue at bali will be whether the us will join a new global treaty on climate change even if emerging economies like china and india continue to resist making cuts . although developed industrialized countries are blamed for 70 percent of the co2 currently in the atmosphere , developing countries are expected to bear the brunt of suffering from the extreme weather conditions linked to global warming . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first hurdle on the road to a major national census in 2011 has been crossed , but berlin is resistant to brussels 's plans for a unified eu census . the census will be the first in germany since reunification .
expense and sensitive data protection issues mean that it will less comprehensive than those carried out in west germany in 1987 and in east germany in 1981 .
but it will nonetheless comprise data gathered from up to 8 million citizens and 17.5 million property-owners . the project has been mired in controversy over a range of issues .
most problematically , the various states objected to the financial contribution they were expected to make .
the preparations alone are set to cost 176 million euros -lrb- $ 261.4 million -rrb- , in addition to the 137 million-euro expense of the actual census . harmonizing data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels needs the information to develop policies but there are even more ambitious plans afoot . keen to end the practice of 27 states asking different questions at different times , brussels this month discussed the possibility of a unified eu census , which would need approval from eu governments . last week , plans to harmonize census data across the eu were approved by members of the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs at the european parliament . they include a list of questions the eu would like all member states to ask on how people live - including education , occupation , hours worked , and marital status - which would result in better quality data on areas such as housing and population .
the european commission says it needs this information to formulate policies . while this form of information is usually gathered nationally , the commission is arguing that it needs more central control to help its work . " the data has to be fully comparable at the european level , and is often requested at a level of regional detail and in a quality that can only be guaranteed by european legislation on population and housing censuses , " its said in a statement . prurient questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do people live in germany today the data requested would include ethnicity , literacy , size and type of family , religion , while the survey also wants to find out about issues such as computer literacy , number of cars owned , cooking facilities and " durable consumer goods possessed by the household . " other questions were considered too prurient and have since been dropped .
supposedly , one would have asked the " date -lrb- s -rrb- of the beginning of consensual union -lrb- s -rrb- of women having ever been in a consensual union : -lrb- ii -rrb- first consensual union and -lrb- ii -rrb- current consensual union . " many felt these questions were too intrusive , while others feared that confidentiality could not be guaranteed . doubtful that privacy could be ensured on a european level , thomas mann , a christian democrat and member of the european parliament , believed that it was inadvisable to pass national data on to the eu 's eurostat office in luxembourg .

" the data has to be fully comparable at the european level , and is often requested at a level of regional detail and in a quality that can only be guaranteed by european legislation on population and housing censuses , " its said in a statement . prurient questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do people live in germany today the data requested would include ethnicity , literacy , size and type of family , religion , while the survey also wants to find out about issues such as computer literacy , number of cars owned , cooking facilities and " durable consumer goods possessed by the household . " other questions were considered too prurient and have since been dropped .
supposedly , one would have asked the " date -lrb- s -rrb- of the beginning of consensual union -lrb- s -rrb- of women having ever been in a consensual union : -lrb- ii -rrb- first consensual union and -lrb- ii -rrb- current consensual union . " many felt these questions were too intrusive , while others feared that confidentiality could not be guaranteed . doubtful that privacy could be ensured on a european level , thomas mann , a christian democrat and member of the european parliament , believed that it was inadvisable to pass national data on to the eu 's eurostat office in luxembourg . " does anyone seriously think that data protection is as thorough everywhere as it is in germany ?

the alternative nobel prize winner suggested a few other ways of protecting the earth . hermann scheer is a social democratic member of the german parliament .
he is president of the eurosolar organization for renewable energy and general chairman of the world council for renewable energy . dw-world.de : what do you expect to come out of the negotiations on bali ? hermann scheer : that a decision will be made to hold another conference .
there are lots of good intentions and appeals , but nothing concrete .
too many expectations have been projected on this conference , which makes the disappointment afterward even bigger . for many governments , these meetings take the place of doing something , according to the unwritten motto : " speak globally , delay nationally . "
everything is put off until the conference , even though they know that no real break-through decisions will happen there .
the question has to be asked : is this the right level to be solving these problems at ? why are you so skeptical ?
there 's a lot of pressure for the participating countries to reach an agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer is general chairman of the world council for renewable energy all of these conferences depend on reaching a consensus .
but the principle of consensus contradicts the necessity of speeding things us .
and we desperately need to speed up the fight against climate change .
it 's time to think about not making these conferences a standard for everything that further decisions are based on . do un climate conferences have any value at all ? these conferences do have significance , which is why they should be held - that is , raising awareness of the problem and creating public pressure on the countries to act .
their value is in keeping the topic up high on the political agenda .
but you ca n't expect the necessary , practical solutions here .
action has to happen later , in the individual countries themselves . what topics should be discussed on bali ? an initiative for increased dismantling of nuclear power plants will be on the table on bali .
but you ca n't fall into the trap of thinking that nuclear power is the solution to the climate problem .
let 's just think about the problematic effects of nuclear energy , the costs associated with it , and the risks that result .
it needs to be critically discussed that the allegedly co2-free power plants lead to a dead end .
this approach is n't so much in the foreground because there 's supposed to be a guarantee of survival for the large power plants . why does co2 refinement lead to a dead end ? the concept of refining and storing co2 ca n't be successful .
it ca n't be released from the earth ever again .
it 's comparable to the atomic waste problem .
and it will be incredibly expensive .
everything will be swept to the side . it would be much better to get away from the big power plant structure and replace them with decentralized energy supplies .
and , internationally , we finally have to come to the realization that fighting climate change wo n't bring economic damage .
in fact , the opposite is true : increasing energy efficiency and switching to renewable energy sources means a huge economic benefit and is an investment in the future . what should the central points be in the successor treaty to kyoto ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer sees little future for nuclear power the cheapest method of relieving the climate situation should be put in the foreground - that is , a worldwide reforestation program that would considerably reduce the excess co2 in the atmosphere .
it would also be groundbreaking to organize a transfer of technology to developing and emerging nations . one proposal is to set up an international agency for renewable energy , but there 's too much resistant to it on bali .
i 've been following this idea for 17 years and since then it 's even been approved by the german government .
with the un consensus process , it probably would n't be possible .
the agency would have to be founded by the countries that want to participate as a government organization . are there other ways to include the developing and emerging nations ? we 'd have to talk about how we can give existing institutions more capacity and financial power to assist the countries .
that would be a topic that should be focused on at these kinds of conferences .
that 's true for unesco , when it 's a matter of training specialists .
it 's also true for unido , the un organization for industrial development that is there to support renewable energies in emerging nations .

the alternative nobel prize winner suggested a few other ways of protecting the earth . hermann scheer is a social democratic member of the german parliament .
he is president of the eurosolar organization for renewable energy and general chairman of the world council for renewable energy . dw-world.de : what do you expect to come out of the negotiations on bali ? hermann scheer : that a decision will be made to hold another conference .
there are lots of good intentions and appeals , but nothing concrete .
too many expectations have been projected on this conference , which makes the disappointment afterward even bigger . for many governments , these meetings take the place of doing something , according to the unwritten motto : " speak globally , delay nationally . "
everything is put off until the conference , even though they know that no real break-through decisions will happen there .
the question has to be asked : is this the right level to be solving these problems at ? why are you so skeptical ?
there 's a lot of pressure for the participating countries to reach an agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer is general chairman of the world council for renewable energy all of these conferences depend on reaching a consensus .
but the principle of consensus contradicts the necessity of speeding things us .
and we desperately need to speed up the fight against climate change .
it 's time to think about not making these conferences a standard for everything that further decisions are based on . do un climate conferences have any value at all ? these conferences do have significance , which is why they should be held - that is , raising awareness of the problem and creating public pressure on the countries to act .

action has to happen later , in the individual countries themselves . what topics should be discussed on bali ? an initiative for increased dismantling of nuclear power plants will be on the table on bali .
but you ca n't fall into the trap of thinking that nuclear power is the solution to the climate problem .
let 's just think about the problematic effects of nuclear energy , the costs associated with it , and the risks that result .
it needs to be critically discussed that the allegedly co2-free power plants lead to a dead end .
this approach is n't so much in the foreground because there 's supposed to be a guarantee of survival for the large power plants . why does co2 refinement lead to a dead end ? the concept of refining and storing co2 ca n't be successful .
it ca n't be released from the earth ever again .
it 's comparable to the atomic waste problem .
and it will be incredibly expensive .
everything will be swept to the side . it would be much better to get away from the big power plant structure and replace them with decentralized energy supplies .
and , internationally , we finally have to come to the realization that fighting climate change wo n't bring economic damage .
in fact , the opposite is true : increasing energy efficiency and switching to renewable energy sources means a huge economic benefit and is an investment in the future . what should the central points be in the successor treaty to kyoto ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer sees little future for nuclear power the cheapest method of relieving the climate situation should be put in the foreground - that is , a worldwide reforestation program that would considerably reduce the excess co2 in the atmosphere .
it would also be groundbreaking to organize a transfer of technology to developing and emerging nations . one proposal is to set up an international agency for renewable energy , but there 's too much resistant to it on bali .
i 've been following this idea for 17 years and since then it 's even been approved by the german government .
with the un consensus process , it probably would n't be possible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 01.12.2007 dutch consider new ways of holding back the waters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media suggested the island could be windmill-shaped island or take the form of a cannabis leaf with over half of its population living below sea level , the netherlands is particularly at risk from the effects of climate change .
one new idea is to build an island in the north sea - in the shape of a tulip . the off-shore island is meant to provide extra land for housing and offer coastal protection to the low-lying nation .
the dutch government has asked a governmental advisory body , the innovative platform -lrb- ip -rrb- , to carry out research into the feasibility of the proposal .
ip officials regard it as a good opportunity to showcase the country 's expertise in hydro-engineering and water management .
the dutch have been battling against the sea and the threat of floods for centuries and their skills are of world renown . but up to now , dutch contractors have only been commissioned to build grandiose projects overseas , in countries like dubai with its famous palm islands .
now , it could become a reality closer to home .
and what could be more dutch than the image of a tulip ? proposal for tulip-shaped island sparks debate bildunterschrift : one of the draft designs envisages building wind turbines on the island prime minister jan-peter balkenende , the chairman of ip , praised the body 's work in the water sector .
" we are good at hydraulic engineering and we should hold on to this leadership position , " he said .
" the tulip island has got the discussion going and has mobilized creative forces .
that is just how it should be if we want to innovate . "
the project was floated by joop atsma , a member of balkenende 's center-right christian democratic appeal party -lrb- cda -rrb- .
atsma envisages an island around 50,000 to 100,000 hectares in area situated off the coast of the randstad .
this is the country 's most populous area and includes the netherlands ' four largest cities : amsterdam , rotterdam , the hague and utrecht .
a cda spokeswoman said the research should show if the proposal is affordable .
she added that the price of land in the area had risen to such heights that creating an island could bring some relief to the real estate market .
" it could be a solution to the lack of space we have in the netherlands , " she said .
" in addition , it could act as a buffer , improving coastal protection . "
worries about the impact of an island bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rivers are set to become an increasing threat in the future but the idea has triggered mixed reactions .
environmental groups and some hydro-engineering firms believe other solutions might be cheaper , more effective and have less impact on the landscape .
one thing that 's clear is that more action is needed to protect the dutch from the effects of global warming .
experts from the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change project that the sea will rise by anything between 9 and 88 centimeters -lrb- 3.5 to 35 inches -rrb- by the end of the 21st century .
coastal surges are set to become an increasing threat to life and property in years to come .
holland already has one of the world 's most ambitious flood defense systems , which has been described by some as the eighth wonder of the world .
its construction was prompted by the flooding tragedy of 1953 , in which more than 1,800 people lost their lives and tens of thousands of people had to be evacuated . consisting of dams , sluices , locks , dikes and storm surge barriers , the delta works block the estuary mouths of a number of major rivers in the southwest of holland and controls the entry of water into those rivers that have to remain navigable .
recent studies have , however , shown that defenses on eight stretches of the coast are too weak .
the government is planning to rectify this matter by 2015 and has allocated 741 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- to this end .
ellen verkoelen , director of the environmental federation of southern holland , said she believes that an artificial island does not really address this problem .
she said she thinks it is more about creating additional space for real estate .
extending dunes and beaches is another option bildunterschrift : holland 's system of sea and river dikes date from medieval times verkoelen said she favors extending the coastline with sand . her organization has been working with the government on the problem for two years and is about to carry out a pilot scheme to test the idea .
" five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- more beach and dunes would give more safety and recreation , " she said .
" it 's also the least expensive way of dealing with the problem .
twenty to 50 years from now we would have a lot of new coast . "
" the sea level change can be stopped in this way , but not with the island , " she added .
" it would have to be an island as big as holland .
this is a marketing strategy .
it 's the same as in dubai . "
the extension of dunes and beaches is also an idea that could be copied in less wealthy countries with similar problems unlike the costly island project .
a similar solution is supported by the north sea foundation , an environmental group .
their spokesman , jaroan dagevos , said he is worried about the visual , environmental and even psychological impact of the proposed island , which he said would stretch along about a fifth of the coastline .
" holland is one of the most crowded countries in the world and if you want to enjoy some open space , you go to the sea , " he said .
" we do n't have many spaces like that .
this is one of the last big nature areas in this region .
" we have to do more to keep the coast as it is , " he added .
" an island is not a solution .

one new idea is to build an island in the north sea - in the shape of a tulip . the off-shore island is meant to provide extra land for housing and offer coastal protection to the low-lying nation .
the dutch government has asked a governmental advisory body , the innovative platform -lrb- ip -rrb- , to carry out research into the feasibility of the proposal .
ip officials regard it as a good opportunity to showcase the country 's expertise in hydro-engineering and water management .
the dutch have been battling against the sea and the threat of floods for centuries and their skills are of world renown . but up to now , dutch contractors have only been commissioned to build grandiose projects overseas , in countries like dubai with its famous palm islands .
now , it could become a reality closer to home .
and what could be more dutch than the image of a tulip ? proposal for tulip-shaped island sparks debate bildunterschrift : one of the draft designs envisages building wind turbines on the island prime minister jan-peter balkenende , the chairman of ip , praised the body 's work in the water sector .
" we are good at hydraulic engineering and we should hold on to this leadership position , " he said .
" the tulip island has got the discussion going and has mobilized creative forces .
that is just how it should be if we want to innovate . "
the project was floated by joop atsma , a member of balkenende 's center-right christian democratic appeal party -lrb- cda -rrb- .
atsma envisages an island around 50,000 to 100,000 hectares in area situated off the coast of the randstad .
this is the country 's most populous area and includes the netherlands ' four largest cities : amsterdam , rotterdam , the hague and utrecht .
a cda spokeswoman said the research should show if the proposal is affordable .
she added that the price of land in the area had risen to such heights that creating an island could bring some relief to the real estate market .
" it could be a solution to the lack of space we have in the netherlands , " she said .
" in addition , it could act as a buffer , improving coastal protection . "
worries about the impact of an island bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rivers are set to become an increasing threat in the future but the idea has triggered mixed reactions .
environmental groups and some hydro-engineering firms believe other solutions might be cheaper , more effective and have less impact on the landscape .
one thing that 's clear is that more action is needed to protect the dutch from the effects of global warming .
experts from the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change project that the sea will rise by anything between 9 and 88 centimeters -lrb- 3.5 to 35 inches -rrb- by the end of the 21st century .
coastal surges are set to become an increasing threat to life and property in years to come .
holland already has one of the world 's most ambitious flood defense systems , which has been described by some as the eighth wonder of the world .
its construction was prompted by the flooding tragedy of 1953 , in which more than 1,800 people lost their lives and tens of thousands of people had to be evacuated . consisting of dams , sluices , locks , dikes and storm surge barriers , the delta works block the estuary mouths of a number of major rivers in the southwest of holland and controls the entry of water into those rivers that have to remain navigable .
recent studies have , however , shown that defenses on eight stretches of the coast are too weak .
the government is planning to rectify this matter by 2015 and has allocated 741 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- to this end .
ellen verkoelen , director of the environmental federation of southern holland , said she believes that an artificial island does not really address this problem .
she said she thinks it is more about creating additional space for real estate .
extending dunes and beaches is another option bildunterschrift : holland 's system of sea and river dikes date from medieval times verkoelen said she favors extending the coastline with sand . her organization has been working with the government on the problem for two years and is about to carry out a pilot scheme to test the idea .
" five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- more beach and dunes would give more safety and recreation , " she said .
" it 's also the least expensive way of dealing with the problem .
twenty to 50 years from now we would have a lot of new coast . "
" the sea level change can be stopped in this way , but not with the island , " she added .
" it would have to be an island as big as holland .
this is a marketing strategy .
it 's the same as in dubai . "
the extension of dunes and beaches is also an idea that could be copied in less wealthy countries with similar problems unlike the costly island project .
a similar solution is supported by the north sea foundation , an environmental group .
their spokesman , jaroan dagevos , said he is worried about the visual , environmental and even psychological impact of the proposed island , which he said would stretch along about a fifth of the coastline .
" holland is one of the most crowded countries in the world and if you want to enjoy some open space , you go to the sea , " he said .
" we do n't have many spaces like that .
this is one of the last big nature areas in this region .
" we have to do more to keep the coast as it is , " he added .

" i think it 's more realistic to widen the beaches and dunes into the north sea , " said van oord 's spokesman , bert groothuizen .
" it 's not very revolutionary .
the idea has been about for the last 30 years .
but it 's a very economical option . "
the trend generally appears to be towards less interventionist schemes .
" we are moving away from engineering solutions and towards building with nature , " he said .
mark van zanten , of the maritime consultancy firm royal haskoning , took a more positive approach towards the proposed island .
he said it would have the advantage of being both a protective measure and an area for potential development .
" we can design it so it will serve both purposes , " he said .
" if we built it high enough , it will probably be one of the safest places in the netherlands . "
but he did not rule out other coastal protection options .
" we are looking into the possibility of building an artificial reef made of sand and stones that would protect the coast from heavy storms , " he said .

she said the un climate conference starting in bali on monday needed to agree on a timetable so that negotiations on a follow-up agreement to kyoto could be completed by the end of 2009 . the kyoto protocol , which went into effect in 2005 , requires industrial countries to reduce their carbon emissions by 2012 .

the alternative nobel prize winner suggested a few other ways of protecting the earth . hermann scheer is a social democratic member of the german parliament .
he is president of the eurosolar organization for renewable energy and general chairman of the world council for renewable energy . dw-world.de : what do you expect to come out of the negotiations on bali ? hermann scheer : that a decision will be made to hold another conference .
there are lots of good intentions and appeals , but nothing concrete .
too many expectations have been projected on this conference , which makes the disappointment afterward even bigger . for many governments , these meetings take the place of doing something , according to the unwritten motto : " speak globally , delay nationally . "
everything is put off until the conference , even though they know that no real break-through decisions will happen there .
the question has to be asked : is this the right level to be solving these problems at ? why are you so skeptical ?
there 's a lot of pressure for the participating countries to reach an agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer is general chairman of the world council for renewable energy all of these conferences depend on reaching a consensus .
but the principle of consensus contradicts the necessity of speeding things us .
and we desperately need to speed up the fight against climate change .
it 's time to think about not making these conferences a standard for everything that further decisions are based on . do un climate conferences have any value at all ? these conferences do have significance , which is why they should be held - that is , raising awareness of the problem and creating public pressure on the countries to act .
their value is in keeping the topic up high on the political agenda .
but you ca n't expect the necessary , practical solutions here .
action has to happen later , in the individual countries themselves . what topics should be discussed on bali ? an initiative for increased dismantling of nuclear power plants will be on the table on bali .
but you ca n't fall into the trap of thinking that nuclear power is the solution to the climate problem .
let 's just think about the problematic effects of nuclear energy , the costs associated with it , and the risks that result .
it needs to be critically discussed that the allegedly co2-free power plants lead to a dead end .
this approach is n't so much in the foreground because there 's supposed to be a guarantee of survival for the large power plants . why does co2 refinement lead to a dead end ? the concept of refining and storing co2 ca n't be successful .
it ca n't be released from the earth ever again .
it 's comparable to the atomic waste problem .
and it will be incredibly expensive .
everything will be swept to the side . it would be much better to get away from the big power plant structure and replace them with decentralized energy supplies .
and , internationally , we finally have to come to the realization that fighting climate change wo n't bring economic damage .
in fact , the opposite is true : increasing energy efficiency and switching to renewable energy sources means a huge economic benefit and is an investment in the future . what should the central points be in the successor treaty to kyoto ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer sees little future for nuclear power the cheapest method of relieving the climate situation should be put in the foreground - that is , a worldwide reforestation program that would considerably reduce the excess co2 in the atmosphere .
it would also be groundbreaking to organize a transfer of technology to developing and emerging nations . one proposal is to set up an international agency for renewable energy , but there 's too much resistant to it on bali .
i 've been following this idea for 17 years and since then it 's even been approved by the german government .
with the un consensus process , it probably would n't be possible .
the agency would have to be founded by the countries that want to participate as a government organization . are there other ways to include the developing and emerging nations ? we 'd have to talk about how we can give existing institutions more capacity and financial power to assist the countries .
that would be a topic that should be focused on at these kinds of conferences .
that 's true for unesco , when it 's a matter of training specialists .
it 's also true for unido , the un organization for industrial development that is there to support renewable energies in emerging nations .
and it applies to food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , which helps countries establish bio-energy structures in order to get away from energy imports . interview : torsten schäfer -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first hurdle on the road to a major national census in 2011 has been crossed , but berlin is resistant to brussels 's plans for a unified eu census . the census will be the first in germany since reunification .
expense and sensitive data protection issues mean that it will less comprehensive than those carried out in west germany in 1987 and in east germany in 1981 .
but it will nonetheless comprise data gathered from up to 8 million citizens and 17.5 million property-owners . the project has been mired in controversy over a range of issues .
most problematically , the various states objected to the financial contribution they were expected to make .
the preparations alone are set to cost 176 million euros -lrb- $ 261.4 million -rrb- , in addition to the 137 million-euro expense of the actual census . harmonizing data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels needs the information to develop policies but there are even more ambitious plans afoot . keen to end the practice of 27 states asking different questions at different times , brussels this month discussed the possibility of a unified eu census , which would need approval from eu governments . last week , plans to harmonize census data across the eu were approved by members of the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs at the european parliament . they include a list of questions the eu would like all member states to ask on how people live - including education , occupation , hours worked , and marital status - which would result in better quality data on areas such as housing and population .
the european commission says it needs this information to formulate policies . while this form of information is usually gathered nationally , the commission is arguing that it needs more central control to help its work . " the data has to be fully comparable at the european level , and is often requested at a level of regional detail and in a quality that can only be guaranteed by european legislation on population and housing censuses , " its said in a statement . prurient questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do people live in germany today the data requested would include ethnicity , literacy , size and type of family , religion , while the survey also wants to find out about issues such as computer literacy , number of cars owned , cooking facilities and " durable consumer goods possessed by the household . " other questions were considered too prurient and have since been dropped .
supposedly , one would have asked the " date -lrb- s -rrb- of the beginning of consensual union -lrb- s -rrb- of women having ever been in a consensual union : -lrb- ii -rrb- first consensual union and -lrb- ii -rrb- current consensual union . " many felt these questions were too intrusive , while others feared that confidentiality could not be guaranteed . doubtful that privacy could be ensured on a european level , thomas mann , a christian democrat and member of the european parliament , believed that it was inadvisable to pass national data on to the eu 's eurostat office in luxembourg .

" in particular we need a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol that expires in 2012 , " she said .
she said the un climate conference starting in bali on monday needed to agree on a timetable so that negotiations on a follow-up agreement to kyoto could be completed by the end of 2009 . the kyoto protocol , which went into effect in 2005 , requires industrial countries to reduce their carbon emissions by 2012 .
but the world 's two top co2 polluters , the united states and china , are not bound to fixed reductions under the pact . although the us signed the kyoto protocol , it never ratified it .

" time is running out , " she said .
" the international climate control panel has warned that we have only until the middle of the century to reduce co2 emissions by half . " a hot issue at bali will be whether the us will join a new global treaty on climate change even if emerging economies like china and india continue to resist making cuts . although developed industrialized countries are blamed for 70 percent of the co2 currently in the atmosphere , developing countries are expected to bear the brunt of suffering from the extreme weather conditions linked to global warming . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the alternative nobel prize winner suggested a few other ways of protecting the earth . hermann scheer is a social democratic member of the german parliament .
he is president of the eurosolar organization for renewable energy and general chairman of the world council for renewable energy . dw-world.de : what do you expect to come out of the negotiations on bali ? hermann scheer : that a decision will be made to hold another conference .
there are lots of good intentions and appeals , but nothing concrete .
too many expectations have been projected on this conference , which makes the disappointment afterward even bigger . for many governments , these meetings take the place of doing something , according to the unwritten motto : " speak globally , delay nationally . "
everything is put off until the conference , even though they know that no real break-through decisions will happen there .
the question has to be asked : is this the right level to be solving these problems at ? why are you so skeptical ?
there 's a lot of pressure for the participating countries to reach an agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer is general chairman of the world council for renewable energy all of these conferences depend on reaching a consensus .
but the principle of consensus contradicts the necessity of speeding things us .
and we desperately need to speed up the fight against climate change .
it 's time to think about not making these conferences a standard for everything that further decisions are based on . do un climate conferences have any value at all ? these conferences do have significance , which is why they should be held - that is , raising awareness of the problem and creating public pressure on the countries to act .
their value is in keeping the topic up high on the political agenda .
but you ca n't expect the necessary , practical solutions here .
action has to happen later , in the individual countries themselves . what topics should be discussed on bali ? an initiative for increased dismantling of nuclear power plants will be on the table on bali .
but you ca n't fall into the trap of thinking that nuclear power is the solution to the climate problem .
let 's just think about the problematic effects of nuclear energy , the costs associated with it , and the risks that result .
it needs to be critically discussed that the allegedly co2-free power plants lead to a dead end .
this approach is n't so much in the foreground because there 's supposed to be a guarantee of survival for the large power plants . why does co2 refinement lead to a dead end ? the concept of refining and storing co2 ca n't be successful .
it ca n't be released from the earth ever again .
it 's comparable to the atomic waste problem .
and it will be incredibly expensive .
everything will be swept to the side . it would be much better to get away from the big power plant structure and replace them with decentralized energy supplies .
and , internationally , we finally have to come to the realization that fighting climate change wo n't bring economic damage .
in fact , the opposite is true : increasing energy efficiency and switching to renewable energy sources means a huge economic benefit and is an investment in the future . what should the central points be in the successor treaty to kyoto ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer sees little future for nuclear power the cheapest method of relieving the climate situation should be put in the foreground - that is , a worldwide reforestation program that would considerably reduce the excess co2 in the atmosphere .
it would also be groundbreaking to organize a transfer of technology to developing and emerging nations . one proposal is to set up an international agency for renewable energy , but there 's too much resistant to it on bali .
i 've been following this idea for 17 years and since then it 's even been approved by the german government .
with the un consensus process , it probably would n't be possible .
the agency would have to be founded by the countries that want to participate as a government organization . are there other ways to include the developing and emerging nations ? we 'd have to talk about how we can give existing institutions more capacity and financial power to assist the countries .
that would be a topic that should be focused on at these kinds of conferences .
that 's true for unesco , when it 's a matter of training specialists .
it 's also true for unido , the un organization for industrial development that is there to support renewable energies in emerging nations .
and it applies to food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , which helps countries establish bio-energy structures in order to get away from energy imports . interview : torsten schäfer -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 01.12.2007 dutch consider new ways of holding back the waters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media suggested the island could be windmill-shaped island or take the form of a cannabis leaf with over half of its population living below sea level , the netherlands is particularly at risk from the effects of climate change .
one new idea is to build an island in the north sea - in the shape of a tulip . the off-shore island is meant to provide extra land for housing and offer coastal protection to the low-lying nation .
the dutch government has asked a governmental advisory body , the innovative platform -lrb- ip -rrb- , to carry out research into the feasibility of the proposal .
ip officials regard it as a good opportunity to showcase the country 's expertise in hydro-engineering and water management .
the dutch have been battling against the sea and the threat of floods for centuries and their skills are of world renown . but up to now , dutch contractors have only been commissioned to build grandiose projects overseas , in countries like dubai with its famous palm islands .
now , it could become a reality closer to home .
and what could be more dutch than the image of a tulip ? proposal for tulip-shaped island sparks debate bildunterschrift : one of the draft designs envisages building wind turbines on the island prime minister jan-peter balkenende , the chairman of ip , praised the body 's work in the water sector .
" we are good at hydraulic engineering and we should hold on to this leadership position , " he said .
" the tulip island has got the discussion going and has mobilized creative forces .
that is just how it should be if we want to innovate . "
the project was floated by joop atsma , a member of balkenende 's center-right christian democratic appeal party -lrb- cda -rrb- .
atsma envisages an island around 50,000 to 100,000 hectares in area situated off the coast of the randstad .
this is the country 's most populous area and includes the netherlands ' four largest cities : amsterdam , rotterdam , the hague and utrecht .
a cda spokeswoman said the research should show if the proposal is affordable .
she added that the price of land in the area had risen to such heights that creating an island could bring some relief to the real estate market .
" it could be a solution to the lack of space we have in the netherlands , " she said .
" in addition , it could act as a buffer , improving coastal protection . "
worries about the impact of an island bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rivers are set to become an increasing threat in the future but the idea has triggered mixed reactions .
environmental groups and some hydro-engineering firms believe other solutions might be cheaper , more effective and have less impact on the landscape .
one thing that 's clear is that more action is needed to protect the dutch from the effects of global warming .
experts from the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change project that the sea will rise by anything between 9 and 88 centimeters -lrb- 3.5 to 35 inches -rrb- by the end of the 21st century .
coastal surges are set to become an increasing threat to life and property in years to come .
holland already has one of the world 's most ambitious flood defense systems , which has been described by some as the eighth wonder of the world .
its construction was prompted by the flooding tragedy of 1953 , in which more than 1,800 people lost their lives and tens of thousands of people had to be evacuated . consisting of dams , sluices , locks , dikes and storm surge barriers , the delta works block the estuary mouths of a number of major rivers in the southwest of holland and controls the entry of water into those rivers that have to remain navigable .
recent studies have , however , shown that defenses on eight stretches of the coast are too weak .
the government is planning to rectify this matter by 2015 and has allocated 741 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- to this end .
ellen verkoelen , director of the environmental federation of southern holland , said she believes that an artificial island does not really address this problem .
she said she thinks it is more about creating additional space for real estate .
extending dunes and beaches is another option bildunterschrift : holland 's system of sea and river dikes date from medieval times verkoelen said she favors extending the coastline with sand . her organization has been working with the government on the problem for two years and is about to carry out a pilot scheme to test the idea .
" five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- more beach and dunes would give more safety and recreation , " she said .
" it 's also the least expensive way of dealing with the problem .
twenty to 50 years from now we would have a lot of new coast . "
" the sea level change can be stopped in this way , but not with the island , " she added .
" it would have to be an island as big as holland .
this is a marketing strategy .
it 's the same as in dubai . "
the extension of dunes and beaches is also an idea that could be copied in less wealthy countries with similar problems unlike the costly island project .
a similar solution is supported by the north sea foundation , an environmental group .
their spokesman , jaroan dagevos , said he is worried about the visual , environmental and even psychological impact of the proposed island , which he said would stretch along about a fifth of the coastline .
" holland is one of the most crowded countries in the world and if you want to enjoy some open space , you go to the sea , " he said .
" we do n't have many spaces like that .
this is one of the last big nature areas in this region .
" we have to do more to keep the coast as it is , " he added .
" an island is not a solution .
the whole view of the north sea will disappear and this will upset streaming patterns of larvae and fish . "
trend towards cheap solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : god made the world and the dutch made the netherlands is a common saying in holland even the marine contractors responsible for building dubai 's palm islands , van oord , expressed their backing for a cheaper solution .
" i think it 's more realistic to widen the beaches and dunes into the north sea , " said van oord 's spokesman , bert groothuizen .
" it 's not very revolutionary .
the idea has been about for the last 30 years .
but it 's a very economical option . "
the trend generally appears to be towards less interventionist schemes .
" we are moving away from engineering solutions and towards building with nature , " he said .
mark van zanten , of the maritime consultancy firm royal haskoning , took a more positive approach towards the proposed island .
he said it would have the advantage of being both a protective measure and an area for potential development .
" we can design it so it will serve both purposes , " he said .
" if we built it high enough , it will probably be one of the safest places in the netherlands . "
but he did not rule out other coastal protection options .
" we are looking into the possibility of building an artificial reef made of sand and stones that would protect the coast from heavy storms , " he said .
of course , the netherlands - once described by the dutch government as the " drain of europe " - does not just face a threat from the sea .
thanks to climate change , the risk of flooding inland is also growing .
the dutch are now leading the way in the design of floating homes .

the first hurdle on the road to a major national census in 2011 has been crossed , but berlin is resistant to brussels 's plans for a unified eu census . the census will be the first in germany since reunification .
expense and sensitive data protection issues mean that it will less comprehensive than those carried out in west germany in 1987 and in east germany in 1981 .
but it will nonetheless comprise data gathered from up to 8 million citizens and 17.5 million property-owners . the project has been mired in controversy over a range of issues .
most problematically , the various states objected to the financial contribution they were expected to make .
the preparations alone are set to cost 176 million euros -lrb- $ 261.4 million -rrb- , in addition to the 137 million-euro expense of the actual census . harmonizing data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels needs the information to develop policies but there are even more ambitious plans afoot . keen to end the practice of 27 states asking different questions at different times , brussels this month discussed the possibility of a unified eu census , which would need approval from eu governments . last week , plans to harmonize census data across the eu were approved by members of the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs at the european parliament . they include a list of questions the eu would like all member states to ask on how people live - including education , occupation , hours worked , and marital status - which would result in better quality data on areas such as housing and population .
the european commission says it needs this information to formulate policies . while this form of information is usually gathered nationally , the commission is arguing that it needs more central control to help its work . " the data has to be fully comparable at the european level , and is often requested at a level of regional detail and in a quality that can only be guaranteed by european legislation on population and housing censuses , " its said in a statement . prurient questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do people live in germany today the data requested would include ethnicity , literacy , size and type of family , religion , while the survey also wants to find out about issues such as computer literacy , number of cars owned , cooking facilities and " durable consumer goods possessed by the household . " other questions were considered too prurient and have since been dropped .
supposedly , one would have asked the " date -lrb- s -rrb- of the beginning of consensual union -lrb- s -rrb- of women having ever been in a consensual union : -lrb- ii -rrb- first consensual union and -lrb- ii -rrb- current consensual union . " many felt these questions were too intrusive , while others feared that confidentiality could not be guaranteed . doubtful that privacy could be ensured on a european level , thomas mann , a christian democrat and member of the european parliament , believed that it was inadvisable to pass national data on to the eu 's eurostat office in luxembourg .

one new idea is to build an island in the north sea - in the shape of a tulip . the off-shore island is meant to provide extra land for housing and offer coastal protection to the low-lying nation .
the dutch government has asked a governmental advisory body , the innovative platform -lrb- ip -rrb- , to carry out research into the feasibility of the proposal .
ip officials regard it as a good opportunity to showcase the country 's expertise in hydro-engineering and water management .
the dutch have been battling against the sea and the threat of floods for centuries and their skills are of world renown . but up to now , dutch contractors have only been commissioned to build grandiose projects overseas , in countries like dubai with its famous palm islands .
now , it could become a reality closer to home .
and what could be more dutch than the image of a tulip ? proposal for tulip-shaped island sparks debate bildunterschrift : one of the draft designs envisages building wind turbines on the island prime minister jan-peter balkenende , the chairman of ip , praised the body 's work in the water sector .
" we are good at hydraulic engineering and we should hold on to this leadership position , " he said .
" the tulip island has got the discussion going and has mobilized creative forces .
that is just how it should be if we want to innovate . "
the project was floated by joop atsma , a member of balkenende 's center-right christian democratic appeal party -lrb- cda -rrb- .
atsma envisages an island around 50,000 to 100,000 hectares in area situated off the coast of the randstad .
this is the country 's most populous area and includes the netherlands ' four largest cities : amsterdam , rotterdam , the hague and utrecht .
a cda spokeswoman said the research should show if the proposal is affordable .
she added that the price of land in the area had risen to such heights that creating an island could bring some relief to the real estate market .
" it could be a solution to the lack of space we have in the netherlands , " she said .
" in addition , it could act as a buffer , improving coastal protection . "
worries about the impact of an island bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rivers are set to become an increasing threat in the future but the idea has triggered mixed reactions .
environmental groups and some hydro-engineering firms believe other solutions might be cheaper , more effective and have less impact on the landscape .
one thing that 's clear is that more action is needed to protect the dutch from the effects of global warming .
experts from the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change project that the sea will rise by anything between 9 and 88 centimeters -lrb- 3.5 to 35 inches -rrb- by the end of the 21st century .
coastal surges are set to become an increasing threat to life and property in years to come .
holland already has one of the world 's most ambitious flood defense systems , which has been described by some as the eighth wonder of the world .
its construction was prompted by the flooding tragedy of 1953 , in which more than 1,800 people lost their lives and tens of thousands of people had to be evacuated . consisting of dams , sluices , locks , dikes and storm surge barriers , the delta works block the estuary mouths of a number of major rivers in the southwest of holland and controls the entry of water into those rivers that have to remain navigable .
recent studies have , however , shown that defenses on eight stretches of the coast are too weak .
the government is planning to rectify this matter by 2015 and has allocated 741 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- to this end .
ellen verkoelen , director of the environmental federation of southern holland , said she believes that an artificial island does not really address this problem .
she said she thinks it is more about creating additional space for real estate .
extending dunes and beaches is another option bildunterschrift : holland 's system of sea and river dikes date from medieval times verkoelen said she favors extending the coastline with sand . her organization has been working with the government on the problem for two years and is about to carry out a pilot scheme to test the idea .
" five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- more beach and dunes would give more safety and recreation , " she said .
" it 's also the least expensive way of dealing with the problem .
twenty to 50 years from now we would have a lot of new coast . "
" the sea level change can be stopped in this way , but not with the island , " she added .
" it would have to be an island as big as holland .
this is a marketing strategy .
it 's the same as in dubai . "
the extension of dunes and beaches is also an idea that could be copied in less wealthy countries with similar problems unlike the costly island project .
a similar solution is supported by the north sea foundation , an environmental group .
their spokesman , jaroan dagevos , said he is worried about the visual , environmental and even psychological impact of the proposed island , which he said would stretch along about a fifth of the coastline .
" holland is one of the most crowded countries in the world and if you want to enjoy some open space , you go to the sea , " he said .
" we do n't have many spaces like that .
this is one of the last big nature areas in this region .
" we have to do more to keep the coast as it is , " he added .
" an island is not a solution .
the whole view of the north sea will disappear and this will upset streaming patterns of larvae and fish . "
trend towards cheap solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : god made the world and the dutch made the netherlands is a common saying in holland even the marine contractors responsible for building dubai 's palm islands , van oord , expressed their backing for a cheaper solution .
" i think it 's more realistic to widen the beaches and dunes into the north sea , " said van oord 's spokesman , bert groothuizen .
" it 's not very revolutionary .
the idea has been about for the last 30 years .
but it 's a very economical option . "
the trend generally appears to be towards less interventionist schemes .
" we are moving away from engineering solutions and towards building with nature , " he said .
mark van zanten , of the maritime consultancy firm royal haskoning , took a more positive approach towards the proposed island .
he said it would have the advantage of being both a protective measure and an area for potential development .
" we can design it so it will serve both purposes , " he said .
" if we built it high enough , it will probably be one of the safest places in the netherlands . "
but he did not rule out other coastal protection options .
" we are looking into the possibility of building an artificial reef made of sand and stones that would protect the coast from heavy storms , " he said .
of course , the netherlands - once described by the dutch government as the " drain of europe " - does not just face a threat from the sea .
thanks to climate change , the risk of flooding inland is also growing .
the dutch are now leading the way in the design of floating homes .

there are lots of good intentions and appeals , but nothing concrete .
too many expectations have been projected on this conference , which makes the disappointment afterward even bigger . for many governments , these meetings take the place of doing something , according to the unwritten motto : " speak globally , delay nationally . "
everything is put off until the conference , even though they know that no real break-through decisions will happen there .
the question has to be asked : is this the right level to be solving these problems at ? why are you so skeptical ?
there 's a lot of pressure for the participating countries to reach an agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer is general chairman of the world council for renewable energy all of these conferences depend on reaching a consensus .
but the principle of consensus contradicts the necessity of speeding things us .
and we desperately need to speed up the fight against climate change .
it 's time to think about not making these conferences a standard for everything that further decisions are based on . do un climate conferences have any value at all ? these conferences do have significance , which is why they should be held - that is , raising awareness of the problem and creating public pressure on the countries to act .

but you ca n't fall into the trap of thinking that nuclear power is the solution to the climate problem .
let 's just think about the problematic effects of nuclear energy , the costs associated with it , and the risks that result .
it needs to be critically discussed that the allegedly co2-free power plants lead to a dead end .
this approach is n't so much in the foreground because there 's supposed to be a guarantee of survival for the large power plants . why does co2 refinement lead to a dead end ? the concept of refining and storing co2 ca n't be successful .
it ca n't be released from the earth ever again .
it 's comparable to the atomic waste problem .
and it will be incredibly expensive .
everything will be swept to the side . it would be much better to get away from the big power plant structure and replace them with decentralized energy supplies .
and , internationally , we finally have to come to the realization that fighting climate change wo n't bring economic damage .
in fact , the opposite is true : increasing energy efficiency and switching to renewable energy sources means a huge economic benefit and is an investment in the future . what should the central points be in the successor treaty to kyoto ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer sees little future for nuclear power the cheapest method of relieving the climate situation should be put in the foreground - that is , a worldwide reforestation program that would considerably reduce the excess co2 in the atmosphere .

i 've been following this idea for 17 years and since then it 's even been approved by the german government .
with the un consensus process , it probably would n't be possible .
the agency would have to be founded by the countries that want to participate as a government organization . are there other ways to include the developing and emerging nations ? we 'd have to talk about how we can give existing institutions more capacity and financial power to assist the countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 01.12.2007 dutch consider new ways of holding back the waters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media suggested the island could be windmill-shaped island or take the form of a cannabis leaf with over half of its population living below sea level , the netherlands is particularly at risk from the effects of climate change .
one new idea is to build an island in the north sea - in the shape of a tulip . the off-shore island is meant to provide extra land for housing and offer coastal protection to the low-lying nation .
the dutch government has asked a governmental advisory body , the innovative platform -lrb- ip -rrb- , to carry out research into the feasibility of the proposal .
ip officials regard it as a good opportunity to showcase the country 's expertise in hydro-engineering and water management .
the dutch have been battling against the sea and the threat of floods for centuries and their skills are of world renown . but up to now , dutch contractors have only been commissioned to build grandiose projects overseas , in countries like dubai with its famous palm islands .
now , it could become a reality closer to home .
and what could be more dutch than the image of a tulip ? proposal for tulip-shaped island sparks debate bildunterschrift : one of the draft designs envisages building wind turbines on the island prime minister jan-peter balkenende , the chairman of ip , praised the body 's work in the water sector .
" we are good at hydraulic engineering and we should hold on to this leadership position , " he said .
" the tulip island has got the discussion going and has mobilized creative forces .
that is just how it should be if we want to innovate . "
the project was floated by joop atsma , a member of balkenende 's center-right christian democratic appeal party -lrb- cda -rrb- .
atsma envisages an island around 50,000 to 100,000 hectares in area situated off the coast of the randstad .
this is the country 's most populous area and includes the netherlands ' four largest cities : amsterdam , rotterdam , the hague and utrecht .
a cda spokeswoman said the research should show if the proposal is affordable .
she added that the price of land in the area had risen to such heights that creating an island could bring some relief to the real estate market .
" it could be a solution to the lack of space we have in the netherlands , " she said .
" in addition , it could act as a buffer , improving coastal protection . "
worries about the impact of an island bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rivers are set to become an increasing threat in the future but the idea has triggered mixed reactions .
environmental groups and some hydro-engineering firms believe other solutions might be cheaper , more effective and have less impact on the landscape .
one thing that 's clear is that more action is needed to protect the dutch from the effects of global warming .
experts from the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change project that the sea will rise by anything between 9 and 88 centimeters -lrb- 3.5 to 35 inches -rrb- by the end of the 21st century .
coastal surges are set to become an increasing threat to life and property in years to come .
holland already has one of the world 's most ambitious flood defense systems , which has been described by some as the eighth wonder of the world .
its construction was prompted by the flooding tragedy of 1953 , in which more than 1,800 people lost their lives and tens of thousands of people had to be evacuated . consisting of dams , sluices , locks , dikes and storm surge barriers , the delta works block the estuary mouths of a number of major rivers in the southwest of holland and controls the entry of water into those rivers that have to remain navigable .
recent studies have , however , shown that defenses on eight stretches of the coast are too weak .
the government is planning to rectify this matter by 2015 and has allocated 741 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- to this end .
ellen verkoelen , director of the environmental federation of southern holland , said she believes that an artificial island does not really address this problem .
she said she thinks it is more about creating additional space for real estate .
extending dunes and beaches is another option bildunterschrift : holland 's system of sea and river dikes date from medieval times verkoelen said she favors extending the coastline with sand . her organization has been working with the government on the problem for two years and is about to carry out a pilot scheme to test the idea .
" five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- more beach and dunes would give more safety and recreation , " she said .
" it 's also the least expensive way of dealing with the problem .
twenty to 50 years from now we would have a lot of new coast . "
" the sea level change can be stopped in this way , but not with the island , " she added .
" it would have to be an island as big as holland .
this is a marketing strategy .
it 's the same as in dubai . "
the extension of dunes and beaches is also an idea that could be copied in less wealthy countries with similar problems unlike the costly island project .
a similar solution is supported by the north sea foundation , an environmental group .
their spokesman , jaroan dagevos , said he is worried about the visual , environmental and even psychological impact of the proposed island , which he said would stretch along about a fifth of the coastline .
" holland is one of the most crowded countries in the world and if you want to enjoy some open space , you go to the sea , " he said .
" we do n't have many spaces like that .
this is one of the last big nature areas in this region .
" we have to do more to keep the coast as it is , " he added .
" an island is not a solution .
the whole view of the north sea will disappear and this will upset streaming patterns of larvae and fish . "
trend towards cheap solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : god made the world and the dutch made the netherlands is a common saying in holland even the marine contractors responsible for building dubai 's palm islands , van oord , expressed their backing for a cheaper solution .
" i think it 's more realistic to widen the beaches and dunes into the north sea , " said van oord 's spokesman , bert groothuizen .
" it 's not very revolutionary .
the idea has been about for the last 30 years .
but it 's a very economical option . "
the trend generally appears to be towards less interventionist schemes .
" we are moving away from engineering solutions and towards building with nature , " he said .
mark van zanten , of the maritime consultancy firm royal haskoning , took a more positive approach towards the proposed island .
he said it would have the advantage of being both a protective measure and an area for potential development .
" we can design it so it will serve both purposes , " he said .
" if we built it high enough , it will probably be one of the safest places in the netherlands . "
but he did not rule out other coastal protection options .
" we are looking into the possibility of building an artificial reef made of sand and stones that would protect the coast from heavy storms , " he said .
of course , the netherlands - once described by the dutch government as the " drain of europe " - does not just face a threat from the sea .
thanks to climate change , the risk of flooding inland is also growing .
the dutch are now leading the way in the design of floating homes .

the government is planning to rectify this matter by 2015 and has allocated 741 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- to this end .
ellen verkoelen , director of the environmental federation of southern holland , said she believes that an artificial island does not really address this problem .
she said she thinks it is more about creating additional space for real estate .
extending dunes and beaches is another option bildunterschrift : holland 's system of sea and river dikes date from medieval times verkoelen said she favors extending the coastline with sand . her organization has been working with the government on the problem for two years and is about to carry out a pilot scheme to test the idea .
" five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- more beach and dunes would give more safety and recreation , " she said .
" it 's also the least expensive way of dealing with the problem .
twenty to 50 years from now we would have a lot of new coast . "
" the sea level change can be stopped in this way , but not with the island , " she added .
" it would have to be an island as big as holland .
this is a marketing strategy .
it 's the same as in dubai . "
the extension of dunes and beaches is also an idea that could be copied in less wealthy countries with similar problems unlike the costly island project .
a similar solution is supported by the north sea foundation , an environmental group .
their spokesman , jaroan dagevos , said he is worried about the visual , environmental and even psychological impact of the proposed island , which he said would stretch along about a fifth of the coastline .
" holland is one of the most crowded countries in the world and if you want to enjoy some open space , you go to the sea , " he said .
" we do n't have many spaces like that .
this is one of the last big nature areas in this region .
" we have to do more to keep the coast as it is , " he added .
" an island is not a solution .
the whole view of the north sea will disappear and this will upset streaming patterns of larvae and fish . "
trend towards cheap solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : god made the world and the dutch made the netherlands is a common saying in holland even the marine contractors responsible for building dubai 's palm islands , van oord , expressed their backing for a cheaper solution .
" i think it 's more realistic to widen the beaches and dunes into the north sea , " said van oord 's spokesman , bert groothuizen .
" it 's not very revolutionary .
the idea has been about for the last 30 years .
but it 's a very economical option . "
the trend generally appears to be towards less interventionist schemes .
" we are moving away from engineering solutions and towards building with nature , " he said .
mark van zanten , of the maritime consultancy firm royal haskoning , took a more positive approach towards the proposed island .
he said it would have the advantage of being both a protective measure and an area for potential development .
" we can design it so it will serve both purposes , " he said .
" if we built it high enough , it will probably be one of the safest places in the netherlands . "
but he did not rule out other coastal protection options .
" we are looking into the possibility of building an artificial reef made of sand and stones that would protect the coast from heavy storms , " he said .
of course , the netherlands - once described by the dutch government as the " drain of europe " - does not just face a threat from the sea .
thanks to climate change , the risk of flooding inland is also growing .
the dutch are now leading the way in the design of floating homes .
the technical university in delft is working on a project that even investigates the possibility of building an entire floating city . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

extraditing terror suspects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble wants more coordination between states the german minister said different solutions were needed because the penalties enshrined in criminal laws in force today no longer acted as a deterrent to terrorists .
one of the issues under discussion was how to deal with terrorist suspects holding foreign passports - more specifically whether they should be extradited if the countries receiving them pledge to treat them according to international law and human rights standards .
another issue covers the exchange of information related to terrorist threats and the legal aspects covering how such information is obtained .
search for common principles experts from the seven participating countries were also present at the conference , which did not pass any resolutions .
the aim of the gathering was to lay the foundation for a long-term process by which the different states can agree on common principles on how to deal with terrorism , schäuble said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the alternative nobel prize winner suggested a few other ways of protecting the earth . hermann scheer is a social democratic member of the german parliament .
he is president of the eurosolar organization for renewable energy and general chairman of the world council for renewable energy . dw-world.de : what do you expect to come out of the negotiations on bali ? hermann scheer : that a decision will be made to hold another conference .
there are lots of good intentions and appeals , but nothing concrete .
too many expectations have been projected on this conference , which makes the disappointment afterward even bigger . for many governments , these meetings take the place of doing something , according to the unwritten motto : " speak globally , delay nationally . "
everything is put off until the conference , even though they know that no real break-through decisions will happen there .
the question has to be asked : is this the right level to be solving these problems at ? why are you so skeptical ?
there 's a lot of pressure for the participating countries to reach an agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer is general chairman of the world council for renewable energy all of these conferences depend on reaching a consensus .
but the principle of consensus contradicts the necessity of speeding things us .
and we desperately need to speed up the fight against climate change .
it 's time to think about not making these conferences a standard for everything that further decisions are based on . do un climate conferences have any value at all ? these conferences do have significance , which is why they should be held - that is , raising awareness of the problem and creating public pressure on the countries to act .
their value is in keeping the topic up high on the political agenda .
but you ca n't expect the necessary , practical solutions here .
action has to happen later , in the individual countries themselves . what topics should be discussed on bali ? an initiative for increased dismantling of nuclear power plants will be on the table on bali .
but you ca n't fall into the trap of thinking that nuclear power is the solution to the climate problem .
let 's just think about the problematic effects of nuclear energy , the costs associated with it , and the risks that result .
it needs to be critically discussed that the allegedly co2-free power plants lead to a dead end .
this approach is n't so much in the foreground because there 's supposed to be a guarantee of survival for the large power plants . why does co2 refinement lead to a dead end ? the concept of refining and storing co2 ca n't be successful .
it ca n't be released from the earth ever again .
it 's comparable to the atomic waste problem .
and it will be incredibly expensive .
everything will be swept to the side . it would be much better to get away from the big power plant structure and replace them with decentralized energy supplies .
and , internationally , we finally have to come to the realization that fighting climate change wo n't bring economic damage .
in fact , the opposite is true : increasing energy efficiency and switching to renewable energy sources means a huge economic benefit and is an investment in the future . what should the central points be in the successor treaty to kyoto ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer sees little future for nuclear power the cheapest method of relieving the climate situation should be put in the foreground - that is , a worldwide reforestation program that would considerably reduce the excess co2 in the atmosphere .
it would also be groundbreaking to organize a transfer of technology to developing and emerging nations . one proposal is to set up an international agency for renewable energy , but there 's too much resistant to it on bali .
i 've been following this idea for 17 years and since then it 's even been approved by the german government .
with the un consensus process , it probably would n't be possible .
the agency would have to be founded by the countries that want to participate as a government organization . are there other ways to include the developing and emerging nations ? we 'd have to talk about how we can give existing institutions more capacity and financial power to assist the countries .
that would be a topic that should be focused on at these kinds of conferences .
that 's true for unesco , when it 's a matter of training specialists .
it 's also true for unido , the un organization for industrial development that is there to support renewable energies in emerging nations .
and it applies to food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , which helps countries establish bio-energy structures in order to get away from energy imports . interview : torsten schäfer -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 01.12.2007 german rents rise as more retailers set up shop downtown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : düsseldorf 's most glamorous street is fondly called the " kö " retailers in germany are looking more and more for downtown locations , which means the rent prices on the country 's trendiest boulevards are skyrocketing . when names like gucci or hermes , leysieffer or godiva grace the shop signs , rent prices are bound to go through the roof . in germany , that 's particularly true on kaufingerstrasse , munich 's most glamorous shopping boulevard .
the bavarian metropolis is traditionally the most expensive location for retailers in germany , said gerhard kemper of kemper 's , one of the country 's most successful property management companies . " in munich , one square meter of retail property costs about 260 euros per month -lrb- about $ 36 per square foot -rrb- , not including tax or utilities , " kemper said .
" in comparison , one square meter in paris costs about 750 euros and in london it 's about 500 euros per square meter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris is europe 's most expensive place to rent a shop though they 're still well below the major european capitals , frankfurt , düsseldorf and berlin trail closely behind munich as the most expensive german cities for retailers . fifth avenue in new york city , however , still takes the cake for being home to the world 's priciest real estate , with an average monthly shop rent of 999 euros per square meter . shops go urban to find customers germany has recently been making a concerted effort to draw businesses back to downtown , following the previous trend of setting up shop outside the city , kemper said . " we 're starting to see that shopping centers , which several years ago were being built at the edge of town or even in rural areas , are returning to the cities , " he said .
" shopping center development is definitely focusing on downtown locations . " and for good reason : the new malls are proving to be customer magnates . " it was important for us to find a nice location in düsseldorf that was central and seen in a positive light by the city 's population and is also accessible to international customers , " said martin kurz from a well-known jewellery designer on düsseldorf 's trendy königsallee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher rents mean more customers - or higher prices the shop 's customers represent a cross-section of the city 's population , kurz added . after all , the shops on germany 's priciest streets ca n't afford a shortage of customers .
kemper estimated that , in general , monthly revenues of 8,000 to 20,000 euros are necessary for a retailer to keep its head above water . " in the short-term , a shop can take an initial loss , but in the middle and long-term it has to pay off - and it does , " he said , adding that the economic upswing has finally arrived in germany . monika lohmüller -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 01.12.2007 dutch consider new ways of holding back the waters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media suggested the island could be windmill-shaped island or take the form of a cannabis leaf with over half of its population living below sea level , the netherlands is particularly at risk from the effects of climate change .
one new idea is to build an island in the north sea - in the shape of a tulip . the off-shore island is meant to provide extra land for housing and offer coastal protection to the low-lying nation .
the dutch government has asked a governmental advisory body , the innovative platform -lrb- ip -rrb- , to carry out research into the feasibility of the proposal .
ip officials regard it as a good opportunity to showcase the country 's expertise in hydro-engineering and water management .
the dutch have been battling against the sea and the threat of floods for centuries and their skills are of world renown . but up to now , dutch contractors have only been commissioned to build grandiose projects overseas , in countries like dubai with its famous palm islands .
now , it could become a reality closer to home .
and what could be more dutch than the image of a tulip ? proposal for tulip-shaped island sparks debate bildunterschrift : one of the draft designs envisages building wind turbines on the island prime minister jan-peter balkenende , the chairman of ip , praised the body 's work in the water sector .
" we are good at hydraulic engineering and we should hold on to this leadership position , " he said .
" the tulip island has got the discussion going and has mobilized creative forces .
that is just how it should be if we want to innovate . "
the project was floated by joop atsma , a member of balkenende 's center-right christian democratic appeal party -lrb- cda -rrb- .
atsma envisages an island around 50,000 to 100,000 hectares in area situated off the coast of the randstad .
this is the country 's most populous area and includes the netherlands ' four largest cities : amsterdam , rotterdam , the hague and utrecht .
a cda spokeswoman said the research should show if the proposal is affordable .
she added that the price of land in the area had risen to such heights that creating an island could bring some relief to the real estate market .
" it could be a solution to the lack of space we have in the netherlands , " she said .
" in addition , it could act as a buffer , improving coastal protection . "
worries about the impact of an island bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rivers are set to become an increasing threat in the future but the idea has triggered mixed reactions .
environmental groups and some hydro-engineering firms believe other solutions might be cheaper , more effective and have less impact on the landscape .
one thing that 's clear is that more action is needed to protect the dutch from the effects of global warming .
experts from the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change project that the sea will rise by anything between 9 and 88 centimeters -lrb- 3.5 to 35 inches -rrb- by the end of the 21st century .
coastal surges are set to become an increasing threat to life and property in years to come .
holland already has one of the world 's most ambitious flood defense systems , which has been described by some as the eighth wonder of the world .
its construction was prompted by the flooding tragedy of 1953 , in which more than 1,800 people lost their lives and tens of thousands of people had to be evacuated . consisting of dams , sluices , locks , dikes and storm surge barriers , the delta works block the estuary mouths of a number of major rivers in the southwest of holland and controls the entry of water into those rivers that have to remain navigable .
recent studies have , however , shown that defenses on eight stretches of the coast are too weak .
the government is planning to rectify this matter by 2015 and has allocated 741 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- to this end .
ellen verkoelen , director of the environmental federation of southern holland , said she believes that an artificial island does not really address this problem .
she said she thinks it is more about creating additional space for real estate .
extending dunes and beaches is another option bildunterschrift : holland 's system of sea and river dikes date from medieval times verkoelen said she favors extending the coastline with sand . her organization has been working with the government on the problem for two years and is about to carry out a pilot scheme to test the idea .
" five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- more beach and dunes would give more safety and recreation , " she said .
" it 's also the least expensive way of dealing with the problem .
twenty to 50 years from now we would have a lot of new coast . "
" the sea level change can be stopped in this way , but not with the island , " she added .
" it would have to be an island as big as holland .
this is a marketing strategy .
it 's the same as in dubai . "
the extension of dunes and beaches is also an idea that could be copied in less wealthy countries with similar problems unlike the costly island project .
a similar solution is supported by the north sea foundation , an environmental group .
their spokesman , jaroan dagevos , said he is worried about the visual , environmental and even psychological impact of the proposed island , which he said would stretch along about a fifth of the coastline .
" holland is one of the most crowded countries in the world and if you want to enjoy some open space , you go to the sea , " he said .
" we do n't have many spaces like that .
this is one of the last big nature areas in this region .
" we have to do more to keep the coast as it is , " he added .
" an island is not a solution .
the whole view of the north sea will disappear and this will upset streaming patterns of larvae and fish . "
trend towards cheap solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : god made the world and the dutch made the netherlands is a common saying in holland even the marine contractors responsible for building dubai 's palm islands , van oord , expressed their backing for a cheaper solution .
" i think it 's more realistic to widen the beaches and dunes into the north sea , " said van oord 's spokesman , bert groothuizen .
" it 's not very revolutionary .
the idea has been about for the last 30 years .
but it 's a very economical option . "
the trend generally appears to be towards less interventionist schemes .
" we are moving away from engineering solutions and towards building with nature , " he said .
mark van zanten , of the maritime consultancy firm royal haskoning , took a more positive approach towards the proposed island .
he said it would have the advantage of being both a protective measure and an area for potential development .
" we can design it so it will serve both purposes , " he said .
" if we built it high enough , it will probably be one of the safest places in the netherlands . "
but he did not rule out other coastal protection options .
" we are looking into the possibility of building an artificial reef made of sand and stones that would protect the coast from heavy storms , " he said .
of course , the netherlands - once described by the dutch government as the " drain of europe " - does not just face a threat from the sea .
thanks to climate change , the risk of flooding inland is also growing .
the dutch are now leading the way in the design of floating homes .

" five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- more beach and dunes would give more safety and recreation , " she said .
" it 's also the least expensive way of dealing with the problem .
twenty to 50 years from now we would have a lot of new coast . "
" the sea level change can be stopped in this way , but not with the island , " she added .
" it would have to be an island as big as holland .
this is a marketing strategy .
it 's the same as in dubai . "
the extension of dunes and beaches is also an idea that could be copied in less wealthy countries with similar problems unlike the costly island project .
a similar solution is supported by the north sea foundation , an environmental group .
their spokesman , jaroan dagevos , said he is worried about the visual , environmental and even psychological impact of the proposed island , which he said would stretch along about a fifth of the coastline .
" holland is one of the most crowded countries in the world and if you want to enjoy some open space , you go to the sea , " he said .

this is one of the last big nature areas in this region .

" it 's not very revolutionary .
the idea has been about for the last 30 years .
but it 's a very economical option . "
the trend generally appears to be towards less interventionist schemes .
" we are moving away from engineering solutions and towards building with nature , " he said .
mark van zanten , of the maritime consultancy firm royal haskoning , took a more positive approach towards the proposed island .
he said it would have the advantage of being both a protective measure and an area for potential development .

one new idea is to build an island in the north sea - in the shape of a tulip . the off-shore island is meant to provide extra land for housing and offer coastal protection to the low-lying nation .
the dutch government has asked a governmental advisory body , the innovative platform -lrb- ip -rrb- , to carry out research into the feasibility of the proposal .
ip officials regard it as a good opportunity to showcase the country 's expertise in hydro-engineering and water management .
the dutch have been battling against the sea and the threat of floods for centuries and their skills are of world renown . but up to now , dutch contractors have only been commissioned to build grandiose projects overseas , in countries like dubai with its famous palm islands .
now , it could become a reality closer to home .
and what could be more dutch than the image of a tulip ? proposal for tulip-shaped island sparks debate bildunterschrift : one of the draft designs envisages building wind turbines on the island prime minister jan-peter balkenende , the chairman of ip , praised the body 's work in the water sector .
" we are good at hydraulic engineering and we should hold on to this leadership position , " he said .
" the tulip island has got the discussion going and has mobilized creative forces .
that is just how it should be if we want to innovate . "
the project was floated by joop atsma , a member of balkenende 's center-right christian democratic appeal party -lrb- cda -rrb- .
atsma envisages an island around 50,000 to 100,000 hectares in area situated off the coast of the randstad .
this is the country 's most populous area and includes the netherlands ' four largest cities : amsterdam , rotterdam , the hague and utrecht .
a cda spokeswoman said the research should show if the proposal is affordable .
she added that the price of land in the area had risen to such heights that creating an island could bring some relief to the real estate market .
" it could be a solution to the lack of space we have in the netherlands , " she said .
" in addition , it could act as a buffer , improving coastal protection . "
worries about the impact of an island bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rivers are set to become an increasing threat in the future but the idea has triggered mixed reactions .
environmental groups and some hydro-engineering firms believe other solutions might be cheaper , more effective and have less impact on the landscape .
one thing that 's clear is that more action is needed to protect the dutch from the effects of global warming .
experts from the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change project that the sea will rise by anything between 9 and 88 centimeters -lrb- 3.5 to 35 inches -rrb- by the end of the 21st century .
coastal surges are set to become an increasing threat to life and property in years to come .
holland already has one of the world 's most ambitious flood defense systems , which has been described by some as the eighth wonder of the world .
its construction was prompted by the flooding tragedy of 1953 , in which more than 1,800 people lost their lives and tens of thousands of people had to be evacuated . consisting of dams , sluices , locks , dikes and storm surge barriers , the delta works block the estuary mouths of a number of major rivers in the southwest of holland and controls the entry of water into those rivers that have to remain navigable .
recent studies have , however , shown that defenses on eight stretches of the coast are too weak .
the government is planning to rectify this matter by 2015 and has allocated 741 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- to this end .
ellen verkoelen , director of the environmental federation of southern holland , said she believes that an artificial island does not really address this problem .
she said she thinks it is more about creating additional space for real estate .
extending dunes and beaches is another option bildunterschrift : holland 's system of sea and river dikes date from medieval times verkoelen said she favors extending the coastline with sand . her organization has been working with the government on the problem for two years and is about to carry out a pilot scheme to test the idea .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 01.12.2007 german rents rise as more retailers set up shop downtown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : düsseldorf 's most glamorous street is fondly called the " kö " retailers in germany are looking more and more for downtown locations , which means the rent prices on the country 's trendiest boulevards are skyrocketing . when names like gucci or hermes , leysieffer or godiva grace the shop signs , rent prices are bound to go through the roof . in germany , that 's particularly true on kaufingerstrasse , munich 's most glamorous shopping boulevard .
the bavarian metropolis is traditionally the most expensive location for retailers in germany , said gerhard kemper of kemper 's , one of the country 's most successful property management companies . " in munich , one square meter of retail property costs about 260 euros per month -lrb- about $ 36 per square foot -rrb- , not including tax or utilities , " kemper said .
" in comparison , one square meter in paris costs about 750 euros and in london it 's about 500 euros per square meter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris is europe 's most expensive place to rent a shop though they 're still well below the major european capitals , frankfurt , düsseldorf and berlin trail closely behind munich as the most expensive german cities for retailers . fifth avenue in new york city , however , still takes the cake for being home to the world 's priciest real estate , with an average monthly shop rent of 999 euros per square meter . shops go urban to find customers germany has recently been making a concerted effort to draw businesses back to downtown , following the previous trend of setting up shop outside the city , kemper said . " we 're starting to see that shopping centers , which several years ago were being built at the edge of town or even in rural areas , are returning to the cities , " he said .
" shopping center development is definitely focusing on downtown locations . " and for good reason : the new malls are proving to be customer magnates . " it was important for us to find a nice location in düsseldorf that was central and seen in a positive light by the city 's population and is also accessible to international customers , " said martin kurz from a well-known jewellery designer on düsseldorf 's trendy königsallee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher rents mean more customers - or higher prices the shop 's customers represent a cross-section of the city 's population , kurz added . after all , the shops on germany 's priciest streets ca n't afford a shortage of customers .
kemper estimated that , in general , monthly revenues of 8,000 to 20,000 euros are necessary for a retailer to keep its head above water . " in the short-term , a shop can take an initial loss , but in the middle and long-term it has to pay off - and it does , " he said , adding that the economic upswing has finally arrived in germany . monika lohmüller -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her own country is ready to set an example , she said . the eu and the g8 summit in germany earlier this year " took international decisions to do more for climate protection , " the chancellor said in her weekly podcast . " in particular we need a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol that expires in 2012 , " she said .
she said the un climate conference starting in bali on monday needed to agree on a timetable so that negotiations on a follow-up agreement to kyoto could be completed by the end of 2009 . the kyoto protocol , which went into effect in 2005 , requires industrial countries to reduce their carbon emissions by 2012 .
but the world 's two top co2 polluters , the united states and china , are not bound to fixed reductions under the pact . although the us signed the kyoto protocol , it never ratified it .
china 's case is different : as a developing country , it was not bound by the protocol 's emissions cap . the aim of the bali meeting , which runs until dec .

the alternative nobel prize winner suggested a few other ways of protecting the earth . hermann scheer is a social democratic member of the german parliament .
he is president of the eurosolar organization for renewable energy and general chairman of the world council for renewable energy . dw-world.de : what do you expect to come out of the negotiations on bali ? hermann scheer : that a decision will be made to hold another conference .
there are lots of good intentions and appeals , but nothing concrete .
too many expectations have been projected on this conference , which makes the disappointment afterward even bigger . for many governments , these meetings take the place of doing something , according to the unwritten motto : " speak globally , delay nationally . "
everything is put off until the conference , even though they know that no real break-through decisions will happen there .
the question has to be asked : is this the right level to be solving these problems at ? why are you so skeptical ?
there 's a lot of pressure for the participating countries to reach an agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer is general chairman of the world council for renewable energy all of these conferences depend on reaching a consensus .
but the principle of consensus contradicts the necessity of speeding things us .
and we desperately need to speed up the fight against climate change .
it 's time to think about not making these conferences a standard for everything that further decisions are based on . do un climate conferences have any value at all ? these conferences do have significance , which is why they should be held - that is , raising awareness of the problem and creating public pressure on the countries to act .
their value is in keeping the topic up high on the political agenda .
but you ca n't expect the necessary , practical solutions here .
action has to happen later , in the individual countries themselves . what topics should be discussed on bali ? an initiative for increased dismantling of nuclear power plants will be on the table on bali .
but you ca n't fall into the trap of thinking that nuclear power is the solution to the climate problem .
let 's just think about the problematic effects of nuclear energy , the costs associated with it , and the risks that result .
it needs to be critically discussed that the allegedly co2-free power plants lead to a dead end .
this approach is n't so much in the foreground because there 's supposed to be a guarantee of survival for the large power plants . why does co2 refinement lead to a dead end ? the concept of refining and storing co2 ca n't be successful .
it ca n't be released from the earth ever again .
it 's comparable to the atomic waste problem .
and it will be incredibly expensive .
everything will be swept to the side . it would be much better to get away from the big power plant structure and replace them with decentralized energy supplies .
and , internationally , we finally have to come to the realization that fighting climate change wo n't bring economic damage .
in fact , the opposite is true : increasing energy efficiency and switching to renewable energy sources means a huge economic benefit and is an investment in the future . what should the central points be in the successor treaty to kyoto ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer sees little future for nuclear power the cheapest method of relieving the climate situation should be put in the foreground - that is , a worldwide reforestation program that would considerably reduce the excess co2 in the atmosphere .
it would also be groundbreaking to organize a transfer of technology to developing and emerging nations . one proposal is to set up an international agency for renewable energy , but there 's too much resistant to it on bali .
i 've been following this idea for 17 years and since then it 's even been approved by the german government .
with the un consensus process , it probably would n't be possible .
the agency would have to be founded by the countries that want to participate as a government organization . are there other ways to include the developing and emerging nations ? we 'd have to talk about how we can give existing institutions more capacity and financial power to assist the countries .
that would be a topic that should be focused on at these kinds of conferences .
that 's true for unesco , when it 's a matter of training specialists .
it 's also true for unido , the un organization for industrial development that is there to support renewable energies in emerging nations .
and it applies to food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , which helps countries establish bio-energy structures in order to get away from energy imports . interview : torsten schäfer -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , at a conference in germany . " the responses to international terrorism have not always been adequate " despite a broad consensus among the nations of europe and the united states about the danger , he told an anti-terrorism conference in werder , 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- southwest of berlin .
schäuble was joined by us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and the interior ministers of france , britain , italy , spain and poland for the two-day meeting , which ended saturday .
the talks were designed to explore ways of strengthening preventive measures against terrorist actions and improve methods of cross-border coordination in combating terrorism .
extraditing terror suspects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble wants more coordination between states the german minister said different solutions were needed because the penalties enshrined in criminal laws in force today no longer acted as a deterrent to terrorists .
one of the issues under discussion was how to deal with terrorist suspects holding foreign passports - more specifically whether they should be extradited if the countries receiving them pledge to treat them according to international law and human rights standards .
another issue covers the exchange of information related to terrorist threats and the legal aspects covering how such information is obtained .
search for common principles experts from the seven participating countries were also present at the conference , which did not pass any resolutions .
the aim of the gathering was to lay the foundation for a long-term process by which the different states can agree on common principles on how to deal with terrorism , schäuble said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 01.12.2007 energy expert : do n't expect much from bali conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reforestation is a cheap way to help save the earth , said scheer as the un climate conference gets underway on bali , energy expert hermann scheer told dw-world.de not to get hopes up .
the alternative nobel prize winner suggested a few other ways of protecting the earth . hermann scheer is a social democratic member of the german parliament .
he is president of the eurosolar organization for renewable energy and general chairman of the world council for renewable energy . dw-world.de : what do you expect to come out of the negotiations on bali ? hermann scheer : that a decision will be made to hold another conference .
there are lots of good intentions and appeals , but nothing concrete .
too many expectations have been projected on this conference , which makes the disappointment afterward even bigger . for many governments , these meetings take the place of doing something , according to the unwritten motto : " speak globally , delay nationally . "
everything is put off until the conference , even though they know that no real break-through decisions will happen there .
the question has to be asked : is this the right level to be solving these problems at ? why are you so skeptical ?
there 's a lot of pressure for the participating countries to reach an agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer is general chairman of the world council for renewable energy all of these conferences depend on reaching a consensus .
but the principle of consensus contradicts the necessity of speeding things us .
and we desperately need to speed up the fight against climate change .
it 's time to think about not making these conferences a standard for everything that further decisions are based on . do un climate conferences have any value at all ? these conferences do have significance , which is why they should be held - that is , raising awareness of the problem and creating public pressure on the countries to act .
their value is in keeping the topic up high on the political agenda .
but you ca n't expect the necessary , practical solutions here .
action has to happen later , in the individual countries themselves . what topics should be discussed on bali ? an initiative for increased dismantling of nuclear power plants will be on the table on bali .
but you ca n't fall into the trap of thinking that nuclear power is the solution to the climate problem .
let 's just think about the problematic effects of nuclear energy , the costs associated with it , and the risks that result .
it needs to be critically discussed that the allegedly co2-free power plants lead to a dead end .
this approach is n't so much in the foreground because there 's supposed to be a guarantee of survival for the large power plants . why does co2 refinement lead to a dead end ? the concept of refining and storing co2 ca n't be successful .
it ca n't be released from the earth ever again .
it 's comparable to the atomic waste problem .
and it will be incredibly expensive .
everything will be swept to the side . it would be much better to get away from the big power plant structure and replace them with decentralized energy supplies .
and , internationally , we finally have to come to the realization that fighting climate change wo n't bring economic damage .
in fact , the opposite is true : increasing energy efficiency and switching to renewable energy sources means a huge economic benefit and is an investment in the future . what should the central points be in the successor treaty to kyoto ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer sees little future for nuclear power the cheapest method of relieving the climate situation should be put in the foreground - that is , a worldwide reforestation program that would considerably reduce the excess co2 in the atmosphere .
it would also be groundbreaking to organize a transfer of technology to developing and emerging nations . one proposal is to set up an international agency for renewable energy , but there 's too much resistant to it on bali .
i 've been following this idea for 17 years and since then it 's even been approved by the german government .
with the un consensus process , it probably would n't be possible .
the agency would have to be founded by the countries that want to participate as a government organization . are there other ways to include the developing and emerging nations ? we 'd have to talk about how we can give existing institutions more capacity and financial power to assist the countries .
that would be a topic that should be focused on at these kinds of conferences .
that 's true for unesco , when it 's a matter of training specialists .
it 's also true for unido , the un organization for industrial development that is there to support renewable energies in emerging nations .
and it applies to food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , which helps countries establish bio-energy structures in order to get away from energy imports . interview : torsten schäfer -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first hurdle on the road to a major national census in 2011 has been crossed , but berlin is resistant to brussels 's plans for a unified eu census . the census will be the first in germany since reunification .
expense and sensitive data protection issues mean that it will less comprehensive than those carried out in west germany in 1987 and in east germany in 1981 .
but it will nonetheless comprise data gathered from up to 8 million citizens and 17.5 million property-owners . the project has been mired in controversy over a range of issues .
most problematically , the various states objected to the financial contribution they were expected to make .
the preparations alone are set to cost 176 million euros -lrb- $ 261.4 million -rrb- , in addition to the 137 million-euro expense of the actual census . harmonizing data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels needs the information to develop policies but there are even more ambitious plans afoot . keen to end the practice of 27 states asking different questions at different times , brussels this month discussed the possibility of a unified eu census , which would need approval from eu governments . last week , plans to harmonize census data across the eu were approved by members of the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs at the european parliament . they include a list of questions the eu would like all member states to ask on how people live - including education , occupation , hours worked , and marital status - which would result in better quality data on areas such as housing and population .
the european commission says it needs this information to formulate policies . while this form of information is usually gathered nationally , the commission is arguing that it needs more central control to help its work . " the data has to be fully comparable at the european level , and is often requested at a level of regional detail and in a quality that can only be guaranteed by european legislation on population and housing censuses , " its said in a statement . prurient questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do people live in germany today the data requested would include ethnicity , literacy , size and type of family , religion , while the survey also wants to find out about issues such as computer literacy , number of cars owned , cooking facilities and " durable consumer goods possessed by the household . " other questions were considered too prurient and have since been dropped .
supposedly , one would have asked the " date -lrb- s -rrb- of the beginning of consensual union -lrb- s -rrb- of women having ever been in a consensual union : -lrb- ii -rrb- first consensual union and -lrb- ii -rrb- current consensual union . " many felt these questions were too intrusive , while others feared that confidentiality could not be guaranteed . doubtful that privacy could be ensured on a european level , thomas mann , a christian democrat and member of the european parliament , believed that it was inadvisable to pass national data on to the eu 's eurostat office in luxembourg . " does anyone seriously think that data protection is as thorough everywhere as it is in germany ?

why can there be virtually no surprises in the upcoming russian elections ?
dw-world.de spoke to russian sociologist lev gudkov about voters , their relationship to the state and their views of the political system . dw-world.de : how would you characterize the russian voters ' mood ahead of the presidential and parliamentary elections ? lev gudkov : i 'd point out that people have become increasingly content with their lives over the past year and a half .
we 're noticing for the first time that the general mood is positive : people are more satisfied than dissatisfied with their lives .
for 15 years - after 1991 - the mood was decidedly negative : people believed that the country was not developing in the right direction , that their opinions and interests were not considered , that their income was falling . all that , of course , is not equally distributed among different groups .
only 15 to 20 percent of people have actually benefited from all the changes , but the bulk of the people feel that they 're living like before .
for the first time after the crisis of 1998 , however , people have calmed down and they are not expecting any commotion in the near future .
this leads not so much to confidence and optimism as to the weakening of their feeling that something negative could happen .
we 're dealing here not so much with the formula : " look how well off we are , " but rather with the principle : " thank god , nothing bad is going on . " is that the reason why the russian president and his party are so popular ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lev gudkov thinks that most russians are satisfied with the system partly .
a large portion of people continue living with a soviet mindset .
they expect to get help , employment , social services and other things from the state .
in that sense , they are dependent on the government .
and their level of satisfaction with the government is based on whether or not the government fulfills these expectations . people , especially in the villages , although in cities , too , feel that they ca n't get through without state help - without free medical and social services etc .
putting aside the fact that voters are pressured , the opposition is getting squeezed out and the mass media are not free i.e. all those " gems " of managed democracy , people put their hopes in the party in power because it at lest can accomplish something .
and that 's also why they put their hopes in the president . so what are voters thinking nowadays ? strictly speaking , the situation is stable and will not essentially change until after the elections .
although slight surprises and mood swings are always possible .
fifty-three percent of the population is planning to take part in the elections , which means that 47 percent will not participate for political reasons . specifically , what reasons ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of russians will not be heading to the polls they do n't think that their voices can change anything .
most of them believe that the election results can be rigged , many are tired of politics and do n't trust the politicians .
only 5 percent of voters are abstaining from voting because they " do n't understand much about politics . "
basically , abstentions are fully motivated : those who are not finding a party that would represent their interests would rather abstain from voting than vote for anybody . how would you estimate party ratings ? approximately 59 percent of votes will go to -lsb- president putin 's -rsb- " one russia , " 18 percent will go to the communists , 9 percent to -lsb- moderate pro-kremlin -rsb- " just russia " and some 7 percent , i.e. around the minimum required to enter the parliament , will go to -lsb- right-winger -rsb- zhirinovsky 's party . none of the opposition democratic parties stand a chance ? unfortunately , none of them .
the -lsb- liberal -rsb- yabloko party is getting less than 3 percent and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- is in the 1 to 2 percent range . so if all the opposition democratic parties got together , they would still not pass the 7-percent barrier ? yes , the so-called democrats would not pass the minimum barrier . are you expecting any surprises from the parliamentary elections ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yabloko supporters wo n't make it to parliament i do n't expect any special surprises .
what kind of surprises could we expect when the media are so tightly controlled when it comes to political advertising and propaganda ?
it is possible that zhirinovksy 's ratings will go up in the last days before the elections - it has happened before , but only if no pressure is exerted on him .
in principle , in the current situation - in a managed democracy - he is not necessary .
to a certain extend , he 's even discrediting the kremlin . will the state parliament -lrb- duma -rrb- be controlled by the kremlin again ? the duma will have an absolute majority of pro-kremlin parties , which will make it completely steerable and in that sense dependent on the executive branch , obedient and ineffective . what do the majority of russians think about the developments of the russian political system ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " czar putin " -lrb- center -rrb- in a parody of a famous painting by ilya repin people do n't have a good idea of what a democracy is : they never lived in one .
at the same time , the populist conservative demagogy propelled by the communists in the 1990s and later by the ruling party lead to the discrediting of the very principles of democracy and democratic models . depending on their level of education and how well-informed they are , people understand the meaning of democracy as the right to criticize the authorities , the freedom to leave the country etc . , or things like chaos , dissolution , empty promises , demagogy .
people do n't understand and do n't know that democracy is a system based on the separation of powers and free competition of political parties .
only 10-12 percent of russians are truly familiar with democratic principles . are russians becoming more aware of the need to develop civil society ? no .
russian society remains very conservative with elements of feudal-state consciousness .
it is oriented towards the authorities , it is used to their caprices , it expects their patronage and entrusts its own will to those in power . interview : sergei morozov -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

why can there be virtually no surprises in the upcoming russian elections ?
dw-world.de spoke to russian sociologist lev gudkov about voters , their relationship to the state and their views of the political system . dw-world.de : how would you characterize the russian voters ' mood ahead of the presidential and parliamentary elections ? lev gudkov : i 'd point out that people have become increasingly content with their lives over the past year and a half .
we 're noticing for the first time that the general mood is positive : people are more satisfied than dissatisfied with their lives .
for 15 years - after 1991 - the mood was decidedly negative : people believed that the country was not developing in the right direction , that their opinions and interests were not considered , that their income was falling . all that , of course , is not equally distributed among different groups .
only 15 to 20 percent of people have actually benefited from all the changes , but the bulk of the people feel that they 're living like before .
for the first time after the crisis of 1998 , however , people have calmed down and they are not expecting any commotion in the near future .
this leads not so much to confidence and optimism as to the weakening of their feeling that something negative could happen .
we 're dealing here not so much with the formula : " look how well off we are , " but rather with the principle : " thank god , nothing bad is going on . " is that the reason why the russian president and his party are so popular ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lev gudkov thinks that most russians are satisfied with the system partly .
a large portion of people continue living with a soviet mindset .
they expect to get help , employment , social services and other things from the state .
in that sense , they are dependent on the government .
and their level of satisfaction with the government is based on whether or not the government fulfills these expectations . people , especially in the villages , although in cities , too , feel that they ca n't get through without state help - without free medical and social services etc .
putting aside the fact that voters are pressured , the opposition is getting squeezed out and the mass media are not free i.e. all those " gems " of managed democracy , people put their hopes in the party in power because it at lest can accomplish something .
and that 's also why they put their hopes in the president . so what are voters thinking nowadays ? strictly speaking , the situation is stable and will not essentially change until after the elections .
although slight surprises and mood swings are always possible .
fifty-three percent of the population is planning to take part in the elections , which means that 47 percent will not participate for political reasons . specifically , what reasons ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of russians will not be heading to the polls they do n't think that their voices can change anything .
most of them believe that the election results can be rigged , many are tired of politics and do n't trust the politicians .
only 5 percent of voters are abstaining from voting because they " do n't understand much about politics . "
basically , abstentions are fully motivated : those who are not finding a party that would represent their interests would rather abstain from voting than vote for anybody . how would you estimate party ratings ? approximately 59 percent of votes will go to -lsb- president putin 's -rsb- " one russia , " 18 percent will go to the communists , 9 percent to -lsb- moderate pro-kremlin -rsb- " just russia " and some 7 percent , i.e. around the minimum required to enter the parliament , will go to -lsb- right-winger -rsb- zhirinovsky 's party . none of the opposition democratic parties stand a chance ? unfortunately , none of them .
the -lsb- liberal -rsb- yabloko party is getting less than 3 percent and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- is in the 1 to 2 percent range . so if all the opposition democratic parties got together , they would still not pass the 7-percent barrier ? yes , the so-called democrats would not pass the minimum barrier . are you expecting any surprises from the parliamentary elections ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yabloko supporters wo n't make it to parliament i do n't expect any special surprises .
what kind of surprises could we expect when the media are so tightly controlled when it comes to political advertising and propaganda ?
it is possible that zhirinovksy 's ratings will go up in the last days before the elections - it has happened before , but only if no pressure is exerted on him .
in principle , in the current situation - in a managed democracy - he is not necessary .
to a certain extend , he 's even discrediting the kremlin . will the state parliament -lrb- duma -rrb- be controlled by the kremlin again ? the duma will have an absolute majority of pro-kremlin parties , which will make it completely steerable and in that sense dependent on the executive branch , obedient and ineffective . what do the majority of russians think about the developments of the russian political system ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " czar putin " -lrb- center -rrb- in a parody of a famous painting by ilya repin people do n't have a good idea of what a democracy is : they never lived in one .

the alternative nobel prize winner suggested a few other ways of protecting the earth . hermann scheer is a social democratic member of the german parliament .
he is president of the eurosolar organization for renewable energy and general chairman of the world council for renewable energy . dw-world.de : what do you expect to come out of the negotiations on bali ? hermann scheer : that a decision will be made to hold another conference .
there are lots of good intentions and appeals , but nothing concrete .
too many expectations have been projected on this conference , which makes the disappointment afterward even bigger . for many governments , these meetings take the place of doing something , according to the unwritten motto : " speak globally , delay nationally . "
everything is put off until the conference , even though they know that no real break-through decisions will happen there .
the question has to be asked : is this the right level to be solving these problems at ? why are you so skeptical ?
there 's a lot of pressure for the participating countries to reach an agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer is general chairman of the world council for renewable energy all of these conferences depend on reaching a consensus .
but the principle of consensus contradicts the necessity of speeding things us .
and we desperately need to speed up the fight against climate change .
it 's time to think about not making these conferences a standard for everything that further decisions are based on . do un climate conferences have any value at all ? these conferences do have significance , which is why they should be held - that is , raising awareness of the problem and creating public pressure on the countries to act .
their value is in keeping the topic up high on the political agenda .
but you ca n't expect the necessary , practical solutions here .
action has to happen later , in the individual countries themselves . what topics should be discussed on bali ? an initiative for increased dismantling of nuclear power plants will be on the table on bali .
but you ca n't fall into the trap of thinking that nuclear power is the solution to the climate problem .
let 's just think about the problematic effects of nuclear energy , the costs associated with it , and the risks that result .
it needs to be critically discussed that the allegedly co2-free power plants lead to a dead end .
this approach is n't so much in the foreground because there 's supposed to be a guarantee of survival for the large power plants . why does co2 refinement lead to a dead end ? the concept of refining and storing co2 ca n't be successful .
it ca n't be released from the earth ever again .
it 's comparable to the atomic waste problem .
and it will be incredibly expensive .
everything will be swept to the side . it would be much better to get away from the big power plant structure and replace them with decentralized energy supplies .
and , internationally , we finally have to come to the realization that fighting climate change wo n't bring economic damage .
in fact , the opposite is true : increasing energy efficiency and switching to renewable energy sources means a huge economic benefit and is an investment in the future . what should the central points be in the successor treaty to kyoto ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer sees little future for nuclear power the cheapest method of relieving the climate situation should be put in the foreground - that is , a worldwide reforestation program that would considerably reduce the excess co2 in the atmosphere .
it would also be groundbreaking to organize a transfer of technology to developing and emerging nations . one proposal is to set up an international agency for renewable energy , but there 's too much resistant to it on bali .
i 've been following this idea for 17 years and since then it 's even been approved by the german government .
with the un consensus process , it probably would n't be possible .
the agency would have to be founded by the countries that want to participate as a government organization . are there other ways to include the developing and emerging nations ? we 'd have to talk about how we can give existing institutions more capacity and financial power to assist the countries .
that would be a topic that should be focused on at these kinds of conferences .
that 's true for unesco , when it 's a matter of training specialists .
it 's also true for unido , the un organization for industrial development that is there to support renewable energies in emerging nations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : russian parliamentary elections putin 's party wins russia elections amid vote-rigging claims kremlin takes heat from the west following dubious election opinion : democracy biggest loser in russian elections germany 's merkel criticizes lack of observers in russian poll russia -pipe- 01.12.2007 sociologist : most russians do n't know what democracy is großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have russians simply not had a chance so far to warm up to democracy ?
why can there be virtually no surprises in the upcoming russian elections ?
dw-world.de spoke to russian sociologist lev gudkov about voters , their relationship to the state and their views of the political system . dw-world.de : how would you characterize the russian voters ' mood ahead of the presidential and parliamentary elections ? lev gudkov : i 'd point out that people have become increasingly content with their lives over the past year and a half .
we 're noticing for the first time that the general mood is positive : people are more satisfied than dissatisfied with their lives .
for 15 years - after 1991 - the mood was decidedly negative : people believed that the country was not developing in the right direction , that their opinions and interests were not considered , that their income was falling . all that , of course , is not equally distributed among different groups .
only 15 to 20 percent of people have actually benefited from all the changes , but the bulk of the people feel that they 're living like before .
for the first time after the crisis of 1998 , however , people have calmed down and they are not expecting any commotion in the near future .
this leads not so much to confidence and optimism as to the weakening of their feeling that something negative could happen .
we 're dealing here not so much with the formula : " look how well off we are , " but rather with the principle : " thank god , nothing bad is going on . " is that the reason why the russian president and his party are so popular ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lev gudkov thinks that most russians are satisfied with the system partly .
a large portion of people continue living with a soviet mindset .
they expect to get help , employment , social services and other things from the state .
in that sense , they are dependent on the government .
and their level of satisfaction with the government is based on whether or not the government fulfills these expectations . people , especially in the villages , although in cities , too , feel that they ca n't get through without state help - without free medical and social services etc .
putting aside the fact that voters are pressured , the opposition is getting squeezed out and the mass media are not free i.e. all those " gems " of managed democracy , people put their hopes in the party in power because it at lest can accomplish something .
and that 's also why they put their hopes in the president . so what are voters thinking nowadays ? strictly speaking , the situation is stable and will not essentially change until after the elections .
although slight surprises and mood swings are always possible .
fifty-three percent of the population is planning to take part in the elections , which means that 47 percent will not participate for political reasons . specifically , what reasons ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of russians will not be heading to the polls they do n't think that their voices can change anything .
most of them believe that the election results can be rigged , many are tired of politics and do n't trust the politicians .
only 5 percent of voters are abstaining from voting because they " do n't understand much about politics . "
basically , abstentions are fully motivated : those who are not finding a party that would represent their interests would rather abstain from voting than vote for anybody . how would you estimate party ratings ? approximately 59 percent of votes will go to -lsb- president putin 's -rsb- " one russia , " 18 percent will go to the communists , 9 percent to -lsb- moderate pro-kremlin -rsb- " just russia " and some 7 percent , i.e. around the minimum required to enter the parliament , will go to -lsb- right-winger -rsb- zhirinovsky 's party . none of the opposition democratic parties stand a chance ? unfortunately , none of them .
the -lsb- liberal -rsb- yabloko party is getting less than 3 percent and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- is in the 1 to 2 percent range . so if all the opposition democratic parties got together , they would still not pass the 7-percent barrier ? yes , the so-called democrats would not pass the minimum barrier . are you expecting any surprises from the parliamentary elections ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yabloko supporters wo n't make it to parliament i do n't expect any special surprises .
what kind of surprises could we expect when the media are so tightly controlled when it comes to political advertising and propaganda ?
it is possible that zhirinovksy 's ratings will go up in the last days before the elections - it has happened before , but only if no pressure is exerted on him .
in principle , in the current situation - in a managed democracy - he is not necessary .
to a certain extend , he 's even discrediting the kremlin . will the state parliament -lrb- duma -rrb- be controlled by the kremlin again ? the duma will have an absolute majority of pro-kremlin parties , which will make it completely steerable and in that sense dependent on the executive branch , obedient and ineffective . what do the majority of russians think about the developments of the russian political system ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " czar putin " -lrb- center -rrb- in a parody of a famous painting by ilya repin people do n't have a good idea of what a democracy is : they never lived in one .
at the same time , the populist conservative demagogy propelled by the communists in the 1990s and later by the ruling party lead to the discrediting of the very principles of democracy and democratic models . depending on their level of education and how well-informed they are , people understand the meaning of democracy as the right to criticize the authorities , the freedom to leave the country etc . , or things like chaos , dissolution , empty promises , demagogy .
people do n't understand and do n't know that democracy is a system based on the separation of powers and free competition of political parties .
only 10-12 percent of russians are truly familiar with democratic principles . are russians becoming more aware of the need to develop civil society ? no .
russian society remains very conservative with elements of feudal-state consciousness .
it is oriented towards the authorities , it is used to their caprices , it expects their patronage and entrusts its own will to those in power . interview : sergei morozov -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

why can there be virtually no surprises in the upcoming russian elections ?
dw-world.de spoke to russian sociologist lev gudkov about voters , their relationship to the state and their views of the political system . dw-world.de : how would you characterize the russian voters ' mood ahead of the presidential and parliamentary elections ? lev gudkov : i 'd point out that people have become increasingly content with their lives over the past year and a half .
we 're noticing for the first time that the general mood is positive : people are more satisfied than dissatisfied with their lives .
for 15 years - after 1991 - the mood was decidedly negative : people believed that the country was not developing in the right direction , that their opinions and interests were not considered , that their income was falling . all that , of course , is not equally distributed among different groups .
only 15 to 20 percent of people have actually benefited from all the changes , but the bulk of the people feel that they 're living like before .
for the first time after the crisis of 1998 , however , people have calmed down and they are not expecting any commotion in the near future .
this leads not so much to confidence and optimism as to the weakening of their feeling that something negative could happen .
we 're dealing here not so much with the formula : " look how well off we are , " but rather with the principle : " thank god , nothing bad is going on . " is that the reason why the russian president and his party are so popular ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lev gudkov thinks that most russians are satisfied with the system partly .
a large portion of people continue living with a soviet mindset .
they expect to get help , employment , social services and other things from the state .
in that sense , they are dependent on the government .
and their level of satisfaction with the government is based on whether or not the government fulfills these expectations . people , especially in the villages , although in cities , too , feel that they ca n't get through without state help - without free medical and social services etc .
putting aside the fact that voters are pressured , the opposition is getting squeezed out and the mass media are not free i.e. all those " gems " of managed democracy , people put their hopes in the party in power because it at lest can accomplish something .
and that 's also why they put their hopes in the president . so what are voters thinking nowadays ? strictly speaking , the situation is stable and will not essentially change until after the elections .
although slight surprises and mood swings are always possible .
fifty-three percent of the population is planning to take part in the elections , which means that 47 percent will not participate for political reasons . specifically , what reasons ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of russians will not be heading to the polls they do n't think that their voices can change anything .
most of them believe that the election results can be rigged , many are tired of politics and do n't trust the politicians .
only 5 percent of voters are abstaining from voting because they " do n't understand much about politics . "
basically , abstentions are fully motivated : those who are not finding a party that would represent their interests would rather abstain from voting than vote for anybody . how would you estimate party ratings ? approximately 59 percent of votes will go to -lsb- president putin 's -rsb- " one russia , " 18 percent will go to the communists , 9 percent to -lsb- moderate pro-kremlin -rsb- " just russia " and some 7 percent , i.e. around the minimum required to enter the parliament , will go to -lsb- right-winger -rsb- zhirinovsky 's party . none of the opposition democratic parties stand a chance ? unfortunately , none of them .
the -lsb- liberal -rsb- yabloko party is getting less than 3 percent and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- is in the 1 to 2 percent range . so if all the opposition democratic parties got together , they would still not pass the 7-percent barrier ? yes , the so-called democrats would not pass the minimum barrier . are you expecting any surprises from the parliamentary elections ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yabloko supporters wo n't make it to parliament i do n't expect any special surprises .
what kind of surprises could we expect when the media are so tightly controlled when it comes to political advertising and propaganda ?
it is possible that zhirinovksy 's ratings will go up in the last days before the elections - it has happened before , but only if no pressure is exerted on him .
in principle , in the current situation - in a managed democracy - he is not necessary .
to a certain extend , he 's even discrediting the kremlin . will the state parliament -lrb- duma -rrb- be controlled by the kremlin again ? the duma will have an absolute majority of pro-kremlin parties , which will make it completely steerable and in that sense dependent on the executive branch , obedient and ineffective . what do the majority of russians think about the developments of the russian political system ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " czar putin " -lrb- center -rrb- in a parody of a famous painting by ilya repin people do n't have a good idea of what a democracy is : they never lived in one .
at the same time , the populist conservative demagogy propelled by the communists in the 1990s and later by the ruling party lead to the discrediting of the very principles of democracy and democratic models . depending on their level of education and how well-informed they are , people understand the meaning of democracy as the right to criticize the authorities , the freedom to leave the country etc . , or things like chaos , dissolution , empty promises , demagogy .

the bavarian metropolis is traditionally the most expensive location for retailers in germany , said gerhard kemper of kemper 's , one of the country 's most successful property management companies . " in munich , one square meter of retail property costs about 260 euros per month -lrb- about $ 36 per square foot -rrb- , not including tax or utilities , " kemper said .
" in comparison , one square meter in paris costs about 750 euros and in london it 's about 500 euros per square meter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris is europe 's most expensive place to rent a shop though they 're still well below the major european capitals , frankfurt , düsseldorf and berlin trail closely behind munich as the most expensive german cities for retailers . fifth avenue in new york city , however , still takes the cake for being home to the world 's priciest real estate , with an average monthly shop rent of 999 euros per square meter . shops go urban to find customers germany has recently been making a concerted effort to draw businesses back to downtown , following the previous trend of setting up shop outside the city , kemper said . " we 're starting to see that shopping centers , which several years ago were being built at the edge of town or even in rural areas , are returning to the cities , " he said .
" shopping center development is definitely focusing on downtown locations . " and for good reason : the new malls are proving to be customer magnates . " it was important for us to find a nice location in düsseldorf that was central and seen in a positive light by the city 's population and is also accessible to international customers , " said martin kurz from a well-known jewellery designer on düsseldorf 's trendy königsallee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher rents mean more customers - or higher prices the shop 's customers represent a cross-section of the city 's population , kurz added . after all , the shops on germany 's priciest streets ca n't afford a shortage of customers .
kemper estimated that , in general , monthly revenues of 8,000 to 20,000 euros are necessary for a retailer to keep its head above water . " in the short-term , a shop can take an initial loss , but in the middle and long-term it has to pay off - and it does , " he said , adding that the economic upswing has finally arrived in germany . monika lohmüller -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first hurdle on the road to a major national census in 2011 has been crossed , but berlin is resistant to brussels 's plans for a unified eu census . the census will be the first in germany since reunification .
expense and sensitive data protection issues mean that it will less comprehensive than those carried out in west germany in 1987 and in east germany in 1981 .
but it will nonetheless comprise data gathered from up to 8 million citizens and 17.5 million property-owners . the project has been mired in controversy over a range of issues .
most problematically , the various states objected to the financial contribution they were expected to make .
the preparations alone are set to cost 176 million euros -lrb- $ 261.4 million -rrb- , in addition to the 137 million-euro expense of the actual census . harmonizing data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels needs the information to develop policies but there are even more ambitious plans afoot . keen to end the practice of 27 states asking different questions at different times , brussels this month discussed the possibility of a unified eu census , which would need approval from eu governments . last week , plans to harmonize census data across the eu were approved by members of the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs at the european parliament . they include a list of questions the eu would like all member states to ask on how people live - including education , occupation , hours worked , and marital status - which would result in better quality data on areas such as housing and population .
the european commission says it needs this information to formulate policies . while this form of information is usually gathered nationally , the commission is arguing that it needs more central control to help its work . " the data has to be fully comparable at the european level , and is often requested at a level of regional detail and in a quality that can only be guaranteed by european legislation on population and housing censuses , " its said in a statement . prurient questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do people live in germany today the data requested would include ethnicity , literacy , size and type of family , religion , while the survey also wants to find out about issues such as computer literacy , number of cars owned , cooking facilities and " durable consumer goods possessed by the household . " other questions were considered too prurient and have since been dropped .
supposedly , one would have asked the " date -lrb- s -rrb- of the beginning of consensual union -lrb- s -rrb- of women having ever been in a consensual union : -lrb- ii -rrb- first consensual union and -lrb- ii -rrb- current consensual union . " many felt these questions were too intrusive , while others feared that confidentiality could not be guaranteed . doubtful that privacy could be ensured on a european level , thomas mann , a christian democrat and member of the european parliament , believed that it was inadvisable to pass national data on to the eu 's eurostat office in luxembourg .

the first hurdle on the road to a major national census in 2011 has been crossed , but berlin is resistant to brussels 's plans for a unified eu census . the census will be the first in germany since reunification .
expense and sensitive data protection issues mean that it will less comprehensive than those carried out in west germany in 1987 and in east germany in 1981 .
but it will nonetheless comprise data gathered from up to 8 million citizens and 17.5 million property-owners . the project has been mired in controversy over a range of issues .
most problematically , the various states objected to the financial contribution they were expected to make .
the preparations alone are set to cost 176 million euros -lrb- $ 261.4 million -rrb- , in addition to the 137 million-euro expense of the actual census . harmonizing data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels needs the information to develop policies but there are even more ambitious plans afoot . keen to end the practice of 27 states asking different questions at different times , brussels this month discussed the possibility of a unified eu census , which would need approval from eu governments . last week , plans to harmonize census data across the eu were approved by members of the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs at the european parliament . they include a list of questions the eu would like all member states to ask on how people live - including education , occupation , hours worked , and marital status - which would result in better quality data on areas such as housing and population .
the european commission says it needs this information to formulate policies . while this form of information is usually gathered nationally , the commission is arguing that it needs more central control to help its work . " the data has to be fully comparable at the european level , and is often requested at a level of regional detail and in a quality that can only be guaranteed by european legislation on population and housing censuses , " its said in a statement . prurient questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do people live in germany today the data requested would include ethnicity , literacy , size and type of family , religion , while the survey also wants to find out about issues such as computer literacy , number of cars owned , cooking facilities and " durable consumer goods possessed by the household . " other questions were considered too prurient and have since been dropped .
supposedly , one would have asked the " date -lrb- s -rrb- of the beginning of consensual union -lrb- s -rrb- of women having ever been in a consensual union : -lrb- ii -rrb- first consensual union and -lrb- ii -rrb- current consensual union . " many felt these questions were too intrusive , while others feared that confidentiality could not be guaranteed . doubtful that privacy could be ensured on a european level , thomas mann , a christian democrat and member of the european parliament , believed that it was inadvisable to pass national data on to the eu 's eurostat office in luxembourg . " does anyone seriously think that data protection is as thorough everywhere as it is in germany ?

the bavarian metropolis is traditionally the most expensive location for retailers in germany , said gerhard kemper of kemper 's , one of the country 's most successful property management companies . " in munich , one square meter of retail property costs about 260 euros per month -lrb- about $ 36 per square foot -rrb- , not including tax or utilities , " kemper said .
" in comparison , one square meter in paris costs about 750 euros and in london it 's about 500 euros per square meter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris is europe 's most expensive place to rent a shop though they 're still well below the major european capitals , frankfurt , düsseldorf and berlin trail closely behind munich as the most expensive german cities for retailers . fifth avenue in new york city , however , still takes the cake for being home to the world 's priciest real estate , with an average monthly shop rent of 999 euros per square meter . shops go urban to find customers germany has recently been making a concerted effort to draw businesses back to downtown , following the previous trend of setting up shop outside the city , kemper said . " we 're starting to see that shopping centers , which several years ago were being built at the edge of town or even in rural areas , are returning to the cities , " he said .
" shopping center development is definitely focusing on downtown locations . " and for good reason : the new malls are proving to be customer magnates . " it was important for us to find a nice location in düsseldorf that was central and seen in a positive light by the city 's population and is also accessible to international customers , " said martin kurz from a well-known jewellery designer on düsseldorf 's trendy königsallee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher rents mean more customers - or higher prices the shop 's customers represent a cross-section of the city 's population , kurz added . after all , the shops on germany 's priciest streets ca n't afford a shortage of customers .
kemper estimated that , in general , monthly revenues of 8,000 to 20,000 euros are necessary for a retailer to keep its head above water . " in the short-term , a shop can take an initial loss , but in the middle and long-term it has to pay off - and it does , " he said , adding that the economic upswing has finally arrived in germany . monika lohmüller -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

why can there be virtually no surprises in the upcoming russian elections ?
dw-world.de spoke to russian sociologist lev gudkov about voters , their relationship to the state and their views of the political system . dw-world.de : how would you characterize the russian voters ' mood ahead of the presidential and parliamentary elections ? lev gudkov : i 'd point out that people have become increasingly content with their lives over the past year and a half .
we 're noticing for the first time that the general mood is positive : people are more satisfied than dissatisfied with their lives .
for 15 years - after 1991 - the mood was decidedly negative : people believed that the country was not developing in the right direction , that their opinions and interests were not considered , that their income was falling . all that , of course , is not equally distributed among different groups .
only 15 to 20 percent of people have actually benefited from all the changes , but the bulk of the people feel that they 're living like before .
for the first time after the crisis of 1998 , however , people have calmed down and they are not expecting any commotion in the near future .
this leads not so much to confidence and optimism as to the weakening of their feeling that something negative could happen .
we 're dealing here not so much with the formula : " look how well off we are , " but rather with the principle : " thank god , nothing bad is going on . " is that the reason why the russian president and his party are so popular ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lev gudkov thinks that most russians are satisfied with the system partly .
a large portion of people continue living with a soviet mindset .
they expect to get help , employment , social services and other things from the state .
in that sense , they are dependent on the government .
and their level of satisfaction with the government is based on whether or not the government fulfills these expectations . people , especially in the villages , although in cities , too , feel that they ca n't get through without state help - without free medical and social services etc .
putting aside the fact that voters are pressured , the opposition is getting squeezed out and the mass media are not free i.e. all those " gems " of managed democracy , people put their hopes in the party in power because it at lest can accomplish something .
and that 's also why they put their hopes in the president . so what are voters thinking nowadays ? strictly speaking , the situation is stable and will not essentially change until after the elections .
although slight surprises and mood swings are always possible .
fifty-three percent of the population is planning to take part in the elections , which means that 47 percent will not participate for political reasons . specifically , what reasons ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of russians will not be heading to the polls they do n't think that their voices can change anything .
most of them believe that the election results can be rigged , many are tired of politics and do n't trust the politicians .
only 5 percent of voters are abstaining from voting because they " do n't understand much about politics . "
basically , abstentions are fully motivated : those who are not finding a party that would represent their interests would rather abstain from voting than vote for anybody . how would you estimate party ratings ? approximately 59 percent of votes will go to -lsb- president putin 's -rsb- " one russia , " 18 percent will go to the communists , 9 percent to -lsb- moderate pro-kremlin -rsb- " just russia " and some 7 percent , i.e. around the minimum required to enter the parliament , will go to -lsb- right-winger -rsb- zhirinovsky 's party . none of the opposition democratic parties stand a chance ? unfortunately , none of them .
the -lsb- liberal -rsb- yabloko party is getting less than 3 percent and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- is in the 1 to 2 percent range . so if all the opposition democratic parties got together , they would still not pass the 7-percent barrier ? yes , the so-called democrats would not pass the minimum barrier . are you expecting any surprises from the parliamentary elections ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yabloko supporters wo n't make it to parliament i do n't expect any special surprises .
what kind of surprises could we expect when the media are so tightly controlled when it comes to political advertising and propaganda ?
it is possible that zhirinovksy 's ratings will go up in the last days before the elections - it has happened before , but only if no pressure is exerted on him .
in principle , in the current situation - in a managed democracy - he is not necessary .
to a certain extend , he 's even discrediting the kremlin . will the state parliament -lrb- duma -rrb- be controlled by the kremlin again ? the duma will have an absolute majority of pro-kremlin parties , which will make it completely steerable and in that sense dependent on the executive branch , obedient and ineffective . what do the majority of russians think about the developments of the russian political system ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " czar putin " -lrb- center -rrb- in a parody of a famous painting by ilya repin people do n't have a good idea of what a democracy is : they never lived in one .
at the same time , the populist conservative demagogy propelled by the communists in the 1990s and later by the ruling party lead to the discrediting of the very principles of democracy and democratic models . depending on their level of education and how well-informed they are , people understand the meaning of democracy as the right to criticize the authorities , the freedom to leave the country etc . , or things like chaos , dissolution , empty promises , demagogy .

the first hurdle on the road to a major national census in 2011 has been crossed , but berlin is resistant to brussels 's plans for a unified eu census . the census will be the first in germany since reunification .
expense and sensitive data protection issues mean that it will less comprehensive than those carried out in west germany in 1987 and in east germany in 1981 .
but it will nonetheless comprise data gathered from up to 8 million citizens and 17.5 million property-owners . the project has been mired in controversy over a range of issues .
most problematically , the various states objected to the financial contribution they were expected to make .
the preparations alone are set to cost 176 million euros -lrb- $ 261.4 million -rrb- , in addition to the 137 million-euro expense of the actual census . harmonizing data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels needs the information to develop policies but there are even more ambitious plans afoot . keen to end the practice of 27 states asking different questions at different times , brussels this month discussed the possibility of a unified eu census , which would need approval from eu governments . last week , plans to harmonize census data across the eu were approved by members of the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs at the european parliament . they include a list of questions the eu would like all member states to ask on how people live - including education , occupation , hours worked , and marital status - which would result in better quality data on areas such as housing and population .
the european commission says it needs this information to formulate policies . while this form of information is usually gathered nationally , the commission is arguing that it needs more central control to help its work . " the data has to be fully comparable at the european level , and is often requested at a level of regional detail and in a quality that can only be guaranteed by european legislation on population and housing censuses , " its said in a statement . prurient questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do people live in germany today the data requested would include ethnicity , literacy , size and type of family , religion , while the survey also wants to find out about issues such as computer literacy , number of cars owned , cooking facilities and " durable consumer goods possessed by the household . " other questions were considered too prurient and have since been dropped .
supposedly , one would have asked the " date -lrb- s -rrb- of the beginning of consensual union -lrb- s -rrb- of women having ever been in a consensual union : -lrb- ii -rrb- first consensual union and -lrb- ii -rrb- current consensual union . " many felt these questions were too intrusive , while others feared that confidentiality could not be guaranteed . doubtful that privacy could be ensured on a european level , thomas mann , a christian democrat and member of the european parliament , believed that it was inadvisable to pass national data on to the eu 's eurostat office in luxembourg . " does anyone seriously think that data protection is as thorough everywhere as it is in germany ?

why can there be virtually no surprises in the upcoming russian elections ?
dw-world.de spoke to russian sociologist lev gudkov about voters , their relationship to the state and their views of the political system . dw-world.de : how would you characterize the russian voters ' mood ahead of the presidential and parliamentary elections ? lev gudkov : i 'd point out that people have become increasingly content with their lives over the past year and a half .
we 're noticing for the first time that the general mood is positive : people are more satisfied than dissatisfied with their lives .
for 15 years - after 1991 - the mood was decidedly negative : people believed that the country was not developing in the right direction , that their opinions and interests were not considered , that their income was falling . all that , of course , is not equally distributed among different groups .
only 15 to 20 percent of people have actually benefited from all the changes , but the bulk of the people feel that they 're living like before .
for the first time after the crisis of 1998 , however , people have calmed down and they are not expecting any commotion in the near future .
this leads not so much to confidence and optimism as to the weakening of their feeling that something negative could happen .
we 're dealing here not so much with the formula : " look how well off we are , " but rather with the principle : " thank god , nothing bad is going on . " is that the reason why the russian president and his party are so popular ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lev gudkov thinks that most russians are satisfied with the system partly .
a large portion of people continue living with a soviet mindset .
they expect to get help , employment , social services and other things from the state .
in that sense , they are dependent on the government .
and their level of satisfaction with the government is based on whether or not the government fulfills these expectations . people , especially in the villages , although in cities , too , feel that they ca n't get through without state help - without free medical and social services etc .
putting aside the fact that voters are pressured , the opposition is getting squeezed out and the mass media are not free i.e. all those " gems " of managed democracy , people put their hopes in the party in power because it at lest can accomplish something .
and that 's also why they put their hopes in the president . so what are voters thinking nowadays ? strictly speaking , the situation is stable and will not essentially change until after the elections .
although slight surprises and mood swings are always possible .
fifty-three percent of the population is planning to take part in the elections , which means that 47 percent will not participate for political reasons . specifically , what reasons ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of russians will not be heading to the polls they do n't think that their voices can change anything .
most of them believe that the election results can be rigged , many are tired of politics and do n't trust the politicians .
only 5 percent of voters are abstaining from voting because they " do n't understand much about politics . "
basically , abstentions are fully motivated : those who are not finding a party that would represent their interests would rather abstain from voting than vote for anybody . how would you estimate party ratings ? approximately 59 percent of votes will go to -lsb- president putin 's -rsb- " one russia , " 18 percent will go to the communists , 9 percent to -lsb- moderate pro-kremlin -rsb- " just russia " and some 7 percent , i.e. around the minimum required to enter the parliament , will go to -lsb- right-winger -rsb- zhirinovsky 's party . none of the opposition democratic parties stand a chance ? unfortunately , none of them .
the -lsb- liberal -rsb- yabloko party is getting less than 3 percent and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- is in the 1 to 2 percent range . so if all the opposition democratic parties got together , they would still not pass the 7-percent barrier ? yes , the so-called democrats would not pass the minimum barrier . are you expecting any surprises from the parliamentary elections ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yabloko supporters wo n't make it to parliament i do n't expect any special surprises .
what kind of surprises could we expect when the media are so tightly controlled when it comes to political advertising and propaganda ?
it is possible that zhirinovksy 's ratings will go up in the last days before the elections - it has happened before , but only if no pressure is exerted on him .
in principle , in the current situation - in a managed democracy - he is not necessary .
to a certain extend , he 's even discrediting the kremlin . will the state parliament -lrb- duma -rrb- be controlled by the kremlin again ? the duma will have an absolute majority of pro-kremlin parties , which will make it completely steerable and in that sense dependent on the executive branch , obedient and ineffective . what do the majority of russians think about the developments of the russian political system ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " czar putin " -lrb- center -rrb- in a parody of a famous painting by ilya repin people do n't have a good idea of what a democracy is : they never lived in one .
at the same time , the populist conservative demagogy propelled by the communists in the 1990s and later by the ruling party lead to the discrediting of the very principles of democracy and democratic models . depending on their level of education and how well-informed they are , people understand the meaning of democracy as the right to criticize the authorities , the freedom to leave the country etc . , or things like chaos , dissolution , empty promises , demagogy .
people do n't understand and do n't know that democracy is a system based on the separation of powers and free competition of political parties .
only 10-12 percent of russians are truly familiar with democratic principles . are russians becoming more aware of the need to develop civil society ? no .

the bavarian metropolis is traditionally the most expensive location for retailers in germany , said gerhard kemper of kemper 's , one of the country 's most successful property management companies . " in munich , one square meter of retail property costs about 260 euros per month -lrb- about $ 36 per square foot -rrb- , not including tax or utilities , " kemper said .
" in comparison , one square meter in paris costs about 750 euros and in london it 's about 500 euros per square meter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris is europe 's most expensive place to rent a shop though they 're still well below the major european capitals , frankfurt , düsseldorf and berlin trail closely behind munich as the most expensive german cities for retailers . fifth avenue in new york city , however , still takes the cake for being home to the world 's priciest real estate , with an average monthly shop rent of 999 euros per square meter . shops go urban to find customers germany has recently been making a concerted effort to draw businesses back to downtown , following the previous trend of setting up shop outside the city , kemper said . " we 're starting to see that shopping centers , which several years ago were being built at the edge of town or even in rural areas , are returning to the cities , " he said .
" shopping center development is definitely focusing on downtown locations . " and for good reason : the new malls are proving to be customer magnates . " it was important for us to find a nice location in düsseldorf that was central and seen in a positive light by the city 's population and is also accessible to international customers , " said martin kurz from a well-known jewellery designer on düsseldorf 's trendy königsallee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher rents mean more customers - or higher prices the shop 's customers represent a cross-section of the city 's population , kurz added . after all , the shops on germany 's priciest streets ca n't afford a shortage of customers .
kemper estimated that , in general , monthly revenues of 8,000 to 20,000 euros are necessary for a retailer to keep its head above water . " in the short-term , a shop can take an initial loss , but in the middle and long-term it has to pay off - and it does , " he said , adding that the economic upswing has finally arrived in germany . monika lohmüller -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

why can there be virtually no surprises in the upcoming russian elections ?
dw-world.de spoke to russian sociologist lev gudkov about voters , their relationship to the state and their views of the political system . dw-world.de : how would you characterize the russian voters ' mood ahead of the presidential and parliamentary elections ? lev gudkov : i 'd point out that people have become increasingly content with their lives over the past year and a half .
we 're noticing for the first time that the general mood is positive : people are more satisfied than dissatisfied with their lives .
for 15 years - after 1991 - the mood was decidedly negative : people believed that the country was not developing in the right direction , that their opinions and interests were not considered , that their income was falling . all that , of course , is not equally distributed among different groups .
only 15 to 20 percent of people have actually benefited from all the changes , but the bulk of the people feel that they 're living like before .
for the first time after the crisis of 1998 , however , people have calmed down and they are not expecting any commotion in the near future .
this leads not so much to confidence and optimism as to the weakening of their feeling that something negative could happen .
we 're dealing here not so much with the formula : " look how well off we are , " but rather with the principle : " thank god , nothing bad is going on . " is that the reason why the russian president and his party are so popular ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lev gudkov thinks that most russians are satisfied with the system partly .
a large portion of people continue living with a soviet mindset .
they expect to get help , employment , social services and other things from the state .
in that sense , they are dependent on the government .
and their level of satisfaction with the government is based on whether or not the government fulfills these expectations . people , especially in the villages , although in cities , too , feel that they ca n't get through without state help - without free medical and social services etc .
putting aside the fact that voters are pressured , the opposition is getting squeezed out and the mass media are not free i.e. all those " gems " of managed democracy , people put their hopes in the party in power because it at lest can accomplish something .
and that 's also why they put their hopes in the president . so what are voters thinking nowadays ? strictly speaking , the situation is stable and will not essentially change until after the elections .
although slight surprises and mood swings are always possible .
fifty-three percent of the population is planning to take part in the elections , which means that 47 percent will not participate for political reasons . specifically , what reasons ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of russians will not be heading to the polls they do n't think that their voices can change anything .
most of them believe that the election results can be rigged , many are tired of politics and do n't trust the politicians .
only 5 percent of voters are abstaining from voting because they " do n't understand much about politics . "
basically , abstentions are fully motivated : those who are not finding a party that would represent their interests would rather abstain from voting than vote for anybody . how would you estimate party ratings ? approximately 59 percent of votes will go to -lsb- president putin 's -rsb- " one russia , " 18 percent will go to the communists , 9 percent to -lsb- moderate pro-kremlin -rsb- " just russia " and some 7 percent , i.e. around the minimum required to enter the parliament , will go to -lsb- right-winger -rsb- zhirinovsky 's party . none of the opposition democratic parties stand a chance ? unfortunately , none of them .
the -lsb- liberal -rsb- yabloko party is getting less than 3 percent and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- is in the 1 to 2 percent range . so if all the opposition democratic parties got together , they would still not pass the 7-percent barrier ? yes , the so-called democrats would not pass the minimum barrier . are you expecting any surprises from the parliamentary elections ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yabloko supporters wo n't make it to parliament i do n't expect any special surprises .
what kind of surprises could we expect when the media are so tightly controlled when it comes to political advertising and propaganda ?
it is possible that zhirinovksy 's ratings will go up in the last days before the elections - it has happened before , but only if no pressure is exerted on him .
in principle , in the current situation - in a managed democracy - he is not necessary .
to a certain extend , he 's even discrediting the kremlin . will the state parliament -lrb- duma -rrb- be controlled by the kremlin again ? the duma will have an absolute majority of pro-kremlin parties , which will make it completely steerable and in that sense dependent on the executive branch , obedient and ineffective . what do the majority of russians think about the developments of the russian political system ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " czar putin " -lrb- center -rrb- in a parody of a famous painting by ilya repin people do n't have a good idea of what a democracy is : they never lived in one .
at the same time , the populist conservative demagogy propelled by the communists in the 1990s and later by the ruling party lead to the discrediting of the very principles of democracy and democratic models . depending on their level of education and how well-informed they are , people understand the meaning of democracy as the right to criticize the authorities , the freedom to leave the country etc . , or things like chaos , dissolution , empty promises , demagogy .
people do n't understand and do n't know that democracy is a system based on the separation of powers and free competition of political parties .
only 10-12 percent of russians are truly familiar with democratic principles . are russians becoming more aware of the need to develop civil society ? no .
russian society remains very conservative with elements of feudal-state consciousness .
it is oriented towards the authorities , it is used to their caprices , it expects their patronage and entrusts its own will to those in power . interview : sergei morozov -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they expect to get help , employment , social services and other things from the state .
in that sense , they are dependent on the government .
and their level of satisfaction with the government is based on whether or not the government fulfills these expectations . people , especially in the villages , although in cities , too , feel that they ca n't get through without state help - without free medical and social services etc .
putting aside the fact that voters are pressured , the opposition is getting squeezed out and the mass media are not free i.e. all those " gems " of managed democracy , people put their hopes in the party in power because it at lest can accomplish something .

most of them believe that the election results can be rigged , many are tired of politics and do n't trust the politicians .
only 5 percent of voters are abstaining from voting because they " do n't understand much about politics . "

the -lsb- liberal -rsb- yabloko party is getting less than 3 percent and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- is in the 1 to 2 percent range . so if all the opposition democratic parties got together , they would still not pass the 7-percent barrier ? yes , the so-called democrats would not pass the minimum barrier . are you expecting any surprises from the parliamentary elections ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yabloko supporters wo n't make it to parliament i do n't expect any special surprises .
what kind of surprises could we expect when the media are so tightly controlled when it comes to political advertising and propaganda ?

why can there be virtually no surprises in the upcoming russian elections ?
dw-world.de spoke to russian sociologist lev gudkov about voters , their relationship to the state and their views of the political system . dw-world.de : how would you characterize the russian voters ' mood ahead of the presidential and parliamentary elections ? lev gudkov : i 'd point out that people have become increasingly content with their lives over the past year and a half .
we 're noticing for the first time that the general mood is positive : people are more satisfied than dissatisfied with their lives .
for 15 years - after 1991 - the mood was decidedly negative : people believed that the country was not developing in the right direction , that their opinions and interests were not considered , that their income was falling . all that , of course , is not equally distributed among different groups .
only 15 to 20 percent of people have actually benefited from all the changes , but the bulk of the people feel that they 're living like before .
for the first time after the crisis of 1998 , however , people have calmed down and they are not expecting any commotion in the near future .
this leads not so much to confidence and optimism as to the weakening of their feeling that something negative could happen .
we 're dealing here not so much with the formula : " look how well off we are , " but rather with the principle : " thank god , nothing bad is going on . " is that the reason why the russian president and his party are so popular ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lev gudkov thinks that most russians are satisfied with the system partly .

why can there be virtually no surprises in the upcoming russian elections ?
dw-world.de spoke to russian sociologist lev gudkov about voters , their relationship to the state and their views of the political system . dw-world.de : how would you characterize the russian voters ' mood ahead of the presidential and parliamentary elections ? lev gudkov : i 'd point out that people have become increasingly content with their lives over the past year and a half .
we 're noticing for the first time that the general mood is positive : people are more satisfied than dissatisfied with their lives .
for 15 years - after 1991 - the mood was decidedly negative : people believed that the country was not developing in the right direction , that their opinions and interests were not considered , that their income was falling . all that , of course , is not equally distributed among different groups .
only 15 to 20 percent of people have actually benefited from all the changes , but the bulk of the people feel that they 're living like before .
for the first time after the crisis of 1998 , however , people have calmed down and they are not expecting any commotion in the near future .
this leads not so much to confidence and optimism as to the weakening of their feeling that something negative could happen .
we 're dealing here not so much with the formula : " look how well off we are , " but rather with the principle : " thank god , nothing bad is going on . " is that the reason why the russian president and his party are so popular ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lev gudkov thinks that most russians are satisfied with the system partly .
a large portion of people continue living with a soviet mindset .
they expect to get help , employment , social services and other things from the state .
in that sense , they are dependent on the government .
and their level of satisfaction with the government is based on whether or not the government fulfills these expectations . people , especially in the villages , although in cities , too , feel that they ca n't get through without state help - without free medical and social services etc .
putting aside the fact that voters are pressured , the opposition is getting squeezed out and the mass media are not free i.e. all those " gems " of managed democracy , people put their hopes in the party in power because it at lest can accomplish something .
and that 's also why they put their hopes in the president . so what are voters thinking nowadays ? strictly speaking , the situation is stable and will not essentially change until after the elections .
although slight surprises and mood swings are always possible .
fifty-three percent of the population is planning to take part in the elections , which means that 47 percent will not participate for political reasons . specifically , what reasons ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of russians will not be heading to the polls they do n't think that their voices can change anything .
most of them believe that the election results can be rigged , many are tired of politics and do n't trust the politicians .
only 5 percent of voters are abstaining from voting because they " do n't understand much about politics . "
basically , abstentions are fully motivated : those who are not finding a party that would represent their interests would rather abstain from voting than vote for anybody . how would you estimate party ratings ? approximately 59 percent of votes will go to -lsb- president putin 's -rsb- " one russia , " 18 percent will go to the communists , 9 percent to -lsb- moderate pro-kremlin -rsb- " just russia " and some 7 percent , i.e. around the minimum required to enter the parliament , will go to -lsb- right-winger -rsb- zhirinovsky 's party . none of the opposition democratic parties stand a chance ? unfortunately , none of them .
the -lsb- liberal -rsb- yabloko party is getting less than 3 percent and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- is in the 1 to 2 percent range . so if all the opposition democratic parties got together , they would still not pass the 7-percent barrier ? yes , the so-called democrats would not pass the minimum barrier . are you expecting any surprises from the parliamentary elections ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yabloko supporters wo n't make it to parliament i do n't expect any special surprises .
what kind of surprises could we expect when the media are so tightly controlled when it comes to political advertising and propaganda ?
it is possible that zhirinovksy 's ratings will go up in the last days before the elections - it has happened before , but only if no pressure is exerted on him .
in principle , in the current situation - in a managed democracy - he is not necessary .
to a certain extend , he 's even discrediting the kremlin . will the state parliament -lrb- duma -rrb- be controlled by the kremlin again ? the duma will have an absolute majority of pro-kremlin parties , which will make it completely steerable and in that sense dependent on the executive branch , obedient and ineffective . what do the majority of russians think about the developments of the russian political system ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " czar putin " -lrb- center -rrb- in a parody of a famous painting by ilya repin people do n't have a good idea of what a democracy is : they never lived in one .
at the same time , the populist conservative demagogy propelled by the communists in the 1990s and later by the ruling party lead to the discrediting of the very principles of democracy and democratic models . depending on their level of education and how well-informed they are , people understand the meaning of democracy as the right to criticize the authorities , the freedom to leave the country etc . , or things like chaos , dissolution , empty promises , demagogy .
people do n't understand and do n't know that democracy is a system based on the separation of powers and free competition of political parties .
only 10-12 percent of russians are truly familiar with democratic principles . are russians becoming more aware of the need to develop civil society ? no .
russian society remains very conservative with elements of feudal-state consciousness .
it is oriented towards the authorities , it is used to their caprices , it expects their patronage and entrusts its own will to those in power . interview : sergei morozov -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to russian sociologist lev gudkov about voters , their relationship to the state and their views of the political system . dw-world.de : how would you characterize the russian voters ' mood ahead of the presidential and parliamentary elections ? lev gudkov : i 'd point out that people have become increasingly content with their lives over the past year and a half .
we 're noticing for the first time that the general mood is positive : people are more satisfied than dissatisfied with their lives .
for 15 years - after 1991 - the mood was decidedly negative : people believed that the country was not developing in the right direction , that their opinions and interests were not considered , that their income was falling . all that , of course , is not equally distributed among different groups .
only 15 to 20 percent of people have actually benefited from all the changes , but the bulk of the people feel that they 're living like before .
for the first time after the crisis of 1998 , however , people have calmed down and they are not expecting any commotion in the near future .
this leads not so much to confidence and optimism as to the weakening of their feeling that something negative could happen .
we 're dealing here not so much with the formula : " look how well off we are , " but rather with the principle : " thank god , nothing bad is going on . " is that the reason why the russian president and his party are so popular ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lev gudkov thinks that most russians are satisfied with the system partly .
a large portion of people continue living with a soviet mindset .
they expect to get help , employment , social services and other things from the state .
in that sense , they are dependent on the government .
and their level of satisfaction with the government is based on whether or not the government fulfills these expectations . people , especially in the villages , although in cities , too , feel that they ca n't get through without state help - without free medical and social services etc .
putting aside the fact that voters are pressured , the opposition is getting squeezed out and the mass media are not free i.e. all those " gems " of managed democracy , people put their hopes in the party in power because it at lest can accomplish something .
and that 's also why they put their hopes in the president . so what are voters thinking nowadays ? strictly speaking , the situation is stable and will not essentially change until after the elections .
although slight surprises and mood swings are always possible .
fifty-three percent of the population is planning to take part in the elections , which means that 47 percent will not participate for political reasons . specifically , what reasons ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of russians will not be heading to the polls they do n't think that their voices can change anything .
most of them believe that the election results can be rigged , many are tired of politics and do n't trust the politicians .
only 5 percent of voters are abstaining from voting because they " do n't understand much about politics . "
basically , abstentions are fully motivated : those who are not finding a party that would represent their interests would rather abstain from voting than vote for anybody . how would you estimate party ratings ? approximately 59 percent of votes will go to -lsb- president putin 's -rsb- " one russia , " 18 percent will go to the communists , 9 percent to -lsb- moderate pro-kremlin -rsb- " just russia " and some 7 percent , i.e. around the minimum required to enter the parliament , will go to -lsb- right-winger -rsb- zhirinovsky 's party . none of the opposition democratic parties stand a chance ? unfortunately , none of them .
the -lsb- liberal -rsb- yabloko party is getting less than 3 percent and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- is in the 1 to 2 percent range . so if all the opposition democratic parties got together , they would still not pass the 7-percent barrier ? yes , the so-called democrats would not pass the minimum barrier . are you expecting any surprises from the parliamentary elections ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yabloko supporters wo n't make it to parliament i do n't expect any special surprises .
what kind of surprises could we expect when the media are so tightly controlled when it comes to political advertising and propaganda ?
it is possible that zhirinovksy 's ratings will go up in the last days before the elections - it has happened before , but only if no pressure is exerted on him .
in principle , in the current situation - in a managed democracy - he is not necessary .
to a certain extend , he 's even discrediting the kremlin . will the state parliament -lrb- duma -rrb- be controlled by the kremlin again ? the duma will have an absolute majority of pro-kremlin parties , which will make it completely steerable and in that sense dependent on the executive branch , obedient and ineffective . what do the majority of russians think about the developments of the russian political system ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " czar putin " -lrb- center -rrb- in a parody of a famous painting by ilya repin people do n't have a good idea of what a democracy is : they never lived in one .
at the same time , the populist conservative demagogy propelled by the communists in the 1990s and later by the ruling party lead to the discrediting of the very principles of democracy and democratic models . depending on their level of education and how well-informed they are , people understand the meaning of democracy as the right to criticize the authorities , the freedom to leave the country etc . , or things like chaos , dissolution , empty promises , demagogy .
people do n't understand and do n't know that democracy is a system based on the separation of powers and free competition of political parties .
only 10-12 percent of russians are truly familiar with democratic principles . are russians becoming more aware of the need to develop civil society ? no .
russian society remains very conservative with elements of feudal-state consciousness .
it is oriented towards the authorities , it is used to their caprices , it expects their patronage and entrusts its own will to those in power . interview : sergei morozov -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 01.12.2007 german rents rise as more retailers set up shop downtown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : düsseldorf 's most glamorous street is fondly called the " kö " retailers in germany are looking more and more for downtown locations , which means the rent prices on the country 's trendiest boulevards are skyrocketing . when names like gucci or hermes , leysieffer or godiva grace the shop signs , rent prices are bound to go through the roof . in germany , that 's particularly true on kaufingerstrasse , munich 's most glamorous shopping boulevard .
the bavarian metropolis is traditionally the most expensive location for retailers in germany , said gerhard kemper of kemper 's , one of the country 's most successful property management companies . " in munich , one square meter of retail property costs about 260 euros per month -lrb- about $ 36 per square foot -rrb- , not including tax or utilities , " kemper said .
" in comparison , one square meter in paris costs about 750 euros and in london it 's about 500 euros per square meter . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris is europe 's most expensive place to rent a shop though they 're still well below the major european capitals , frankfurt , düsseldorf and berlin trail closely behind munich as the most expensive german cities for retailers . fifth avenue in new york city , however , still takes the cake for being home to the world 's priciest real estate , with an average monthly shop rent of 999 euros per square meter . shops go urban to find customers germany has recently been making a concerted effort to draw businesses back to downtown , following the previous trend of setting up shop outside the city , kemper said . " we 're starting to see that shopping centers , which several years ago were being built at the edge of town or even in rural areas , are returning to the cities , " he said .
" shopping center development is definitely focusing on downtown locations . " and for good reason : the new malls are proving to be customer magnates . " it was important for us to find a nice location in düsseldorf that was central and seen in a positive light by the city 's population and is also accessible to international customers , " said martin kurz from a well-known jewellery designer on düsseldorf 's trendy königsallee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher rents mean more customers - or higher prices the shop 's customers represent a cross-section of the city 's population , kurz added . after all , the shops on germany 's priciest streets ca n't afford a shortage of customers .

why can there be virtually no surprises in the upcoming russian elections ?
dw-world.de spoke to russian sociologist lev gudkov about voters , their relationship to the state and their views of the political system . dw-world.de : how would you characterize the russian voters ' mood ahead of the presidential and parliamentary elections ? lev gudkov : i 'd point out that people have become increasingly content with their lives over the past year and a half .
we 're noticing for the first time that the general mood is positive : people are more satisfied than dissatisfied with their lives .
for 15 years - after 1991 - the mood was decidedly negative : people believed that the country was not developing in the right direction , that their opinions and interests were not considered , that their income was falling . all that , of course , is not equally distributed among different groups .
only 15 to 20 percent of people have actually benefited from all the changes , but the bulk of the people feel that they 're living like before .
for the first time after the crisis of 1998 , however , people have calmed down and they are not expecting any commotion in the near future .
this leads not so much to confidence and optimism as to the weakening of their feeling that something negative could happen .
we 're dealing here not so much with the formula : " look how well off we are , " but rather with the principle : " thank god , nothing bad is going on . " is that the reason why the russian president and his party are so popular ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lev gudkov thinks that most russians are satisfied with the system partly .
a large portion of people continue living with a soviet mindset .
they expect to get help , employment , social services and other things from the state .
in that sense , they are dependent on the government .
and their level of satisfaction with the government is based on whether or not the government fulfills these expectations . people , especially in the villages , although in cities , too , feel that they ca n't get through without state help - without free medical and social services etc .
putting aside the fact that voters are pressured , the opposition is getting squeezed out and the mass media are not free i.e. all those " gems " of managed democracy , people put their hopes in the party in power because it at lest can accomplish something .
and that 's also why they put their hopes in the president . so what are voters thinking nowadays ? strictly speaking , the situation is stable and will not essentially change until after the elections .
although slight surprises and mood swings are always possible .
fifty-three percent of the population is planning to take part in the elections , which means that 47 percent will not participate for political reasons . specifically , what reasons ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of russians will not be heading to the polls they do n't think that their voices can change anything .
most of them believe that the election results can be rigged , many are tired of politics and do n't trust the politicians .
only 5 percent of voters are abstaining from voting because they " do n't understand much about politics . "
basically , abstentions are fully motivated : those who are not finding a party that would represent their interests would rather abstain from voting than vote for anybody . how would you estimate party ratings ? approximately 59 percent of votes will go to -lsb- president putin 's -rsb- " one russia , " 18 percent will go to the communists , 9 percent to -lsb- moderate pro-kremlin -rsb- " just russia " and some 7 percent , i.e. around the minimum required to enter the parliament , will go to -lsb- right-winger -rsb- zhirinovsky 's party . none of the opposition democratic parties stand a chance ? unfortunately , none of them .
the -lsb- liberal -rsb- yabloko party is getting less than 3 percent and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- is in the 1 to 2 percent range . so if all the opposition democratic parties got together , they would still not pass the 7-percent barrier ? yes , the so-called democrats would not pass the minimum barrier . are you expecting any surprises from the parliamentary elections ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yabloko supporters wo n't make it to parliament i do n't expect any special surprises .
what kind of surprises could we expect when the media are so tightly controlled when it comes to political advertising and propaganda ?

why can there be virtually no surprises in the upcoming russian elections ?
dw-world.de spoke to russian sociologist lev gudkov about voters , their relationship to the state and their views of the political system . dw-world.de : how would you characterize the russian voters ' mood ahead of the presidential and parliamentary elections ? lev gudkov : i 'd point out that people have become increasingly content with their lives over the past year and a half .
we 're noticing for the first time that the general mood is positive : people are more satisfied than dissatisfied with their lives .
for 15 years - after 1991 - the mood was decidedly negative : people believed that the country was not developing in the right direction , that their opinions and interests were not considered , that their income was falling . all that , of course , is not equally distributed among different groups .
only 15 to 20 percent of people have actually benefited from all the changes , but the bulk of the people feel that they 're living like before .
for the first time after the crisis of 1998 , however , people have calmed down and they are not expecting any commotion in the near future .
this leads not so much to confidence and optimism as to the weakening of their feeling that something negative could happen .
we 're dealing here not so much with the formula : " look how well off we are , " but rather with the principle : " thank god , nothing bad is going on . " is that the reason why the russian president and his party are so popular ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lev gudkov thinks that most russians are satisfied with the system partly .
a large portion of people continue living with a soviet mindset .
they expect to get help , employment , social services and other things from the state .
in that sense , they are dependent on the government .
and their level of satisfaction with the government is based on whether or not the government fulfills these expectations . people , especially in the villages , although in cities , too , feel that they ca n't get through without state help - without free medical and social services etc .
putting aside the fact that voters are pressured , the opposition is getting squeezed out and the mass media are not free i.e. all those " gems " of managed democracy , people put their hopes in the party in power because it at lest can accomplish something .
and that 's also why they put their hopes in the president . so what are voters thinking nowadays ? strictly speaking , the situation is stable and will not essentially change until after the elections .
although slight surprises and mood swings are always possible .
fifty-three percent of the population is planning to take part in the elections , which means that 47 percent will not participate for political reasons . specifically , what reasons ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of russians will not be heading to the polls they do n't think that their voices can change anything .
most of them believe that the election results can be rigged , many are tired of politics and do n't trust the politicians .
only 5 percent of voters are abstaining from voting because they " do n't understand much about politics . "
basically , abstentions are fully motivated : those who are not finding a party that would represent their interests would rather abstain from voting than vote for anybody . how would you estimate party ratings ? approximately 59 percent of votes will go to -lsb- president putin 's -rsb- " one russia , " 18 percent will go to the communists , 9 percent to -lsb- moderate pro-kremlin -rsb- " just russia " and some 7 percent , i.e. around the minimum required to enter the parliament , will go to -lsb- right-winger -rsb- zhirinovsky 's party . none of the opposition democratic parties stand a chance ? unfortunately , none of them .
the -lsb- liberal -rsb- yabloko party is getting less than 3 percent and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- is in the 1 to 2 percent range . so if all the opposition democratic parties got together , they would still not pass the 7-percent barrier ? yes , the so-called democrats would not pass the minimum barrier . are you expecting any surprises from the parliamentary elections ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yabloko supporters wo n't make it to parliament i do n't expect any special surprises .
what kind of surprises could we expect when the media are so tightly controlled when it comes to political advertising and propaganda ?
it is possible that zhirinovksy 's ratings will go up in the last days before the elections - it has happened before , but only if no pressure is exerted on him .

why can there be virtually no surprises in the upcoming russian elections ?
dw-world.de spoke to russian sociologist lev gudkov about voters , their relationship to the state and their views of the political system . dw-world.de : how would you characterize the russian voters ' mood ahead of the presidential and parliamentary elections ? lev gudkov : i 'd point out that people have become increasingly content with their lives over the past year and a half .
we 're noticing for the first time that the general mood is positive : people are more satisfied than dissatisfied with their lives .
for 15 years - after 1991 - the mood was decidedly negative : people believed that the country was not developing in the right direction , that their opinions and interests were not considered , that their income was falling . all that , of course , is not equally distributed among different groups .
only 15 to 20 percent of people have actually benefited from all the changes , but the bulk of the people feel that they 're living like before .
for the first time after the crisis of 1998 , however , people have calmed down and they are not expecting any commotion in the near future .
this leads not so much to confidence and optimism as to the weakening of their feeling that something negative could happen .
we 're dealing here not so much with the formula : " look how well off we are , " but rather with the principle : " thank god , nothing bad is going on . " is that the reason why the russian president and his party are so popular ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lev gudkov thinks that most russians are satisfied with the system partly .
a large portion of people continue living with a soviet mindset .
they expect to get help , employment , social services and other things from the state .
in that sense , they are dependent on the government .
and their level of satisfaction with the government is based on whether or not the government fulfills these expectations . people , especially in the villages , although in cities , too , feel that they ca n't get through without state help - without free medical and social services etc .
putting aside the fact that voters are pressured , the opposition is getting squeezed out and the mass media are not free i.e. all those " gems " of managed democracy , people put their hopes in the party in power because it at lest can accomplish something .
and that 's also why they put their hopes in the president . so what are voters thinking nowadays ? strictly speaking , the situation is stable and will not essentially change until after the elections .
although slight surprises and mood swings are always possible .
fifty-three percent of the population is planning to take part in the elections , which means that 47 percent will not participate for political reasons . specifically , what reasons ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of russians will not be heading to the polls they do n't think that their voices can change anything .
most of them believe that the election results can be rigged , many are tired of politics and do n't trust the politicians .
only 5 percent of voters are abstaining from voting because they " do n't understand much about politics . "
basically , abstentions are fully motivated : those who are not finding a party that would represent their interests would rather abstain from voting than vote for anybody . how would you estimate party ratings ? approximately 59 percent of votes will go to -lsb- president putin 's -rsb- " one russia , " 18 percent will go to the communists , 9 percent to -lsb- moderate pro-kremlin -rsb- " just russia " and some 7 percent , i.e. around the minimum required to enter the parliament , will go to -lsb- right-winger -rsb- zhirinovsky 's party . none of the opposition democratic parties stand a chance ? unfortunately , none of them .
the -lsb- liberal -rsb- yabloko party is getting less than 3 percent and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- is in the 1 to 2 percent range . so if all the opposition democratic parties got together , they would still not pass the 7-percent barrier ? yes , the so-called democrats would not pass the minimum barrier . are you expecting any surprises from the parliamentary elections ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yabloko supporters wo n't make it to parliament i do n't expect any special surprises .
what kind of surprises could we expect when the media are so tightly controlled when it comes to political advertising and propaganda ?
it is possible that zhirinovksy 's ratings will go up in the last days before the elections - it has happened before , but only if no pressure is exerted on him .
in principle , in the current situation - in a managed democracy - he is not necessary .
to a certain extend , he 's even discrediting the kremlin . will the state parliament -lrb- duma -rrb- be controlled by the kremlin again ? the duma will have an absolute majority of pro-kremlin parties , which will make it completely steerable and in that sense dependent on the executive branch , obedient and ineffective . what do the majority of russians think about the developments of the russian political system ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " czar putin " -lrb- center -rrb- in a parody of a famous painting by ilya repin people do n't have a good idea of what a democracy is : they never lived in one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 01.12.2007 dutch consider new ways of holding back the waters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media suggested the island could be windmill-shaped island or take the form of a cannabis leaf with over half of its population living below sea level , the netherlands is particularly at risk from the effects of climate change .
one new idea is to build an island in the north sea - in the shape of a tulip . the off-shore island is meant to provide extra land for housing and offer coastal protection to the low-lying nation .
the dutch government has asked a governmental advisory body , the innovative platform -lrb- ip -rrb- , to carry out research into the feasibility of the proposal .
ip officials regard it as a good opportunity to showcase the country 's expertise in hydro-engineering and water management .
the dutch have been battling against the sea and the threat of floods for centuries and their skills are of world renown . but up to now , dutch contractors have only been commissioned to build grandiose projects overseas , in countries like dubai with its famous palm islands .
now , it could become a reality closer to home .
and what could be more dutch than the image of a tulip ? proposal for tulip-shaped island sparks debate bildunterschrift : one of the draft designs envisages building wind turbines on the island prime minister jan-peter balkenende , the chairman of ip , praised the body 's work in the water sector .
" we are good at hydraulic engineering and we should hold on to this leadership position , " he said .
" the tulip island has got the discussion going and has mobilized creative forces .
that is just how it should be if we want to innovate . "
the project was floated by joop atsma , a member of balkenende 's center-right christian democratic appeal party -lrb- cda -rrb- .
atsma envisages an island around 50,000 to 100,000 hectares in area situated off the coast of the randstad .
this is the country 's most populous area and includes the netherlands ' four largest cities : amsterdam , rotterdam , the hague and utrecht .
a cda spokeswoman said the research should show if the proposal is affordable .
she added that the price of land in the area had risen to such heights that creating an island could bring some relief to the real estate market .
" it could be a solution to the lack of space we have in the netherlands , " she said .
" in addition , it could act as a buffer , improving coastal protection . "
worries about the impact of an island bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rivers are set to become an increasing threat in the future but the idea has triggered mixed reactions .
environmental groups and some hydro-engineering firms believe other solutions might be cheaper , more effective and have less impact on the landscape .
one thing that 's clear is that more action is needed to protect the dutch from the effects of global warming .
experts from the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change project that the sea will rise by anything between 9 and 88 centimeters -lrb- 3.5 to 35 inches -rrb- by the end of the 21st century .
coastal surges are set to become an increasing threat to life and property in years to come .
holland already has one of the world 's most ambitious flood defense systems , which has been described by some as the eighth wonder of the world .
its construction was prompted by the flooding tragedy of 1953 , in which more than 1,800 people lost their lives and tens of thousands of people had to be evacuated . consisting of dams , sluices , locks , dikes and storm surge barriers , the delta works block the estuary mouths of a number of major rivers in the southwest of holland and controls the entry of water into those rivers that have to remain navigable .
recent studies have , however , shown that defenses on eight stretches of the coast are too weak .
the government is planning to rectify this matter by 2015 and has allocated 741 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- to this end .
ellen verkoelen , director of the environmental federation of southern holland , said she believes that an artificial island does not really address this problem .
she said she thinks it is more about creating additional space for real estate .
extending dunes and beaches is another option bildunterschrift : holland 's system of sea and river dikes date from medieval times verkoelen said she favors extending the coastline with sand . her organization has been working with the government on the problem for two years and is about to carry out a pilot scheme to test the idea .
" five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- more beach and dunes would give more safety and recreation , " she said .
" it 's also the least expensive way of dealing with the problem .
twenty to 50 years from now we would have a lot of new coast . "
" the sea level change can be stopped in this way , but not with the island , " she added .
" it would have to be an island as big as holland .
this is a marketing strategy .
it 's the same as in dubai . "
the extension of dunes and beaches is also an idea that could be copied in less wealthy countries with similar problems unlike the costly island project .
a similar solution is supported by the north sea foundation , an environmental group .
their spokesman , jaroan dagevos , said he is worried about the visual , environmental and even psychological impact of the proposed island , which he said would stretch along about a fifth of the coastline .
" holland is one of the most crowded countries in the world and if you want to enjoy some open space , you go to the sea , " he said .
" we do n't have many spaces like that .
this is one of the last big nature areas in this region .
" we have to do more to keep the coast as it is , " he added .
" an island is not a solution .
the whole view of the north sea will disappear and this will upset streaming patterns of larvae and fish . "
trend towards cheap solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : god made the world and the dutch made the netherlands is a common saying in holland even the marine contractors responsible for building dubai 's palm islands , van oord , expressed their backing for a cheaper solution .
" i think it 's more realistic to widen the beaches and dunes into the north sea , " said van oord 's spokesman , bert groothuizen .
" it 's not very revolutionary .
the idea has been about for the last 30 years .
but it 's a very economical option . "
the trend generally appears to be towards less interventionist schemes .
" we are moving away from engineering solutions and towards building with nature , " he said .
mark van zanten , of the maritime consultancy firm royal haskoning , took a more positive approach towards the proposed island .
he said it would have the advantage of being both a protective measure and an area for potential development .
" we can design it so it will serve both purposes , " he said .
" if we built it high enough , it will probably be one of the safest places in the netherlands . "
but he did not rule out other coastal protection options .
" we are looking into the possibility of building an artificial reef made of sand and stones that would protect the coast from heavy storms , " he said .
of course , the netherlands - once described by the dutch government as the " drain of europe " - does not just face a threat from the sea .
thanks to climate change , the risk of flooding inland is also growing .
the dutch are now leading the way in the design of floating homes .

" the responses to international terrorism have not always been adequate " despite a broad consensus among the nations of europe and the united states about the danger , he told an anti-terrorism conference in werder , 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- southwest of berlin .
schäuble was joined by us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and the interior ministers of france , britain , italy , spain and poland for the two-day meeting , which ended saturday .
the talks were designed to explore ways of strengthening preventive measures against terrorist actions and improve methods of cross-border coordination in combating terrorism .

one of the issues under discussion was how to deal with terrorist suspects holding foreign passports - more specifically whether they should be extradited if the countries receiving them pledge to treat them according to international law and human rights standards .
another issue covers the exchange of information related to terrorist threats and the legal aspects covering how such information is obtained .
search for common principles experts from the seven participating countries were also present at the conference , which did not pass any resolutions .

the first hurdle on the road to a major national census in 2011 has been crossed , but berlin is resistant to brussels 's plans for a unified eu census . the census will be the first in germany since reunification .
expense and sensitive data protection issues mean that it will less comprehensive than those carried out in west germany in 1987 and in east germany in 1981 .
but it will nonetheless comprise data gathered from up to 8 million citizens and 17.5 million property-owners . the project has been mired in controversy over a range of issues .
most problematically , the various states objected to the financial contribution they were expected to make .

the first hurdle on the road to a major national census in 2011 has been crossed , but berlin is resistant to brussels 's plans for a unified eu census . the census will be the first in germany since reunification .
expense and sensitive data protection issues mean that it will less comprehensive than those carried out in west germany in 1987 and in east germany in 1981 .
but it will nonetheless comprise data gathered from up to 8 million citizens and 17.5 million property-owners . the project has been mired in controversy over a range of issues .
most problematically , the various states objected to the financial contribution they were expected to make .
the preparations alone are set to cost 176 million euros -lrb- $ 261.4 million -rrb- , in addition to the 137 million-euro expense of the actual census . harmonizing data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels needs the information to develop policies but there are even more ambitious plans afoot . keen to end the practice of 27 states asking different questions at different times , brussels this month discussed the possibility of a unified eu census , which would need approval from eu governments . last week , plans to harmonize census data across the eu were approved by members of the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs at the european parliament . they include a list of questions the eu would like all member states to ask on how people live - including education , occupation , hours worked , and marital status - which would result in better quality data on areas such as housing and population .

the alternative nobel prize winner suggested a few other ways of protecting the earth . hermann scheer is a social democratic member of the german parliament .
he is president of the eurosolar organization for renewable energy and general chairman of the world council for renewable energy . dw-world.de : what do you expect to come out of the negotiations on bali ? hermann scheer : that a decision will be made to hold another conference .
there are lots of good intentions and appeals , but nothing concrete .
too many expectations have been projected on this conference , which makes the disappointment afterward even bigger . for many governments , these meetings take the place of doing something , according to the unwritten motto : " speak globally , delay nationally . "
everything is put off until the conference , even though they know that no real break-through decisions will happen there .
the question has to be asked : is this the right level to be solving these problems at ? why are you so skeptical ?
there 's a lot of pressure for the participating countries to reach an agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer is general chairman of the world council for renewable energy all of these conferences depend on reaching a consensus .
but the principle of consensus contradicts the necessity of speeding things us .
and we desperately need to speed up the fight against climate change .
it 's time to think about not making these conferences a standard for everything that further decisions are based on . do un climate conferences have any value at all ? these conferences do have significance , which is why they should be held - that is , raising awareness of the problem and creating public pressure on the countries to act .
their value is in keeping the topic up high on the political agenda .
but you ca n't expect the necessary , practical solutions here .
action has to happen later , in the individual countries themselves . what topics should be discussed on bali ? an initiative for increased dismantling of nuclear power plants will be on the table on bali .
but you ca n't fall into the trap of thinking that nuclear power is the solution to the climate problem .
let 's just think about the problematic effects of nuclear energy , the costs associated with it , and the risks that result .
it needs to be critically discussed that the allegedly co2-free power plants lead to a dead end .
this approach is n't so much in the foreground because there 's supposed to be a guarantee of survival for the large power plants . why does co2 refinement lead to a dead end ? the concept of refining and storing co2 ca n't be successful .
it ca n't be released from the earth ever again .
it 's comparable to the atomic waste problem .
and it will be incredibly expensive .
everything will be swept to the side . it would be much better to get away from the big power plant structure and replace them with decentralized energy supplies .
and , internationally , we finally have to come to the realization that fighting climate change wo n't bring economic damage .
in fact , the opposite is true : increasing energy efficiency and switching to renewable energy sources means a huge economic benefit and is an investment in the future . what should the central points be in the successor treaty to kyoto ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer sees little future for nuclear power the cheapest method of relieving the climate situation should be put in the foreground - that is , a worldwide reforestation program that would considerably reduce the excess co2 in the atmosphere .
it would also be groundbreaking to organize a transfer of technology to developing and emerging nations . one proposal is to set up an international agency for renewable energy , but there 's too much resistant to it on bali .
i 've been following this idea for 17 years and since then it 's even been approved by the german government .
with the un consensus process , it probably would n't be possible .
the agency would have to be founded by the countries that want to participate as a government organization . are there other ways to include the developing and emerging nations ? we 'd have to talk about how we can give existing institutions more capacity and financial power to assist the countries .
that would be a topic that should be focused on at these kinds of conferences .
that 's true for unesco , when it 's a matter of training specialists .
it 's also true for unido , the un organization for industrial development that is there to support renewable energies in emerging nations .
and it applies to food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , which helps countries establish bio-energy structures in order to get away from energy imports . interview : torsten schäfer -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , urged the eu and g8 industrial nations to live up to promises on climate change .
her own country is ready to set an example , she said . the eu and the g8 summit in germany earlier this year " took international decisions to do more for climate protection , " the chancellor said in her weekly podcast . " in particular we need a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol that expires in 2012 , " she said .
she said the un climate conference starting in bali on monday needed to agree on a timetable so that negotiations on a follow-up agreement to kyoto could be completed by the end of 2009 . the kyoto protocol , which went into effect in 2005 , requires industrial countries to reduce their carbon emissions by 2012 .
but the world 's two top co2 polluters , the united states and china , are not bound to fixed reductions under the pact . although the us signed the kyoto protocol , it never ratified it .
china 's case is different : as a developing country , it was not bound by the protocol 's emissions cap . the aim of the bali meeting , which runs until dec .
14 , is to gain consensus on a formal framework for reaching a new emissions-reduction pact over the next two years . setting an example bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming is already taking its toll in the arctic " every country has to decide for itself , " merkel said .
" germany is ready to set an example . " on wednesday , the german cabinet is due to agree on a package of measures designed to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
" time is running out , " she said .
" the international climate control panel has warned that we have only until the middle of the century to reduce co2 emissions by half . " a hot issue at bali will be whether the us will join a new global treaty on climate change even if emerging economies like china and india continue to resist making cuts . although developed industrialized countries are blamed for 70 percent of the co2 currently in the atmosphere , developing countries are expected to bear the brunt of suffering from the extreme weather conditions linked to global warming . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the responses to international terrorism have not always been adequate " despite a broad consensus among the nations of europe and the united states about the danger , he told an anti-terrorism conference in werder , 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- southwest of berlin .
schäuble was joined by us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and the interior ministers of france , britain , italy , spain and poland for the two-day meeting , which ended saturday .
the talks were designed to explore ways of strengthening preventive measures against terrorist actions and improve methods of cross-border coordination in combating terrorism .
extraditing terror suspects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble wants more coordination between states the german minister said different solutions were needed because the penalties enshrined in criminal laws in force today no longer acted as a deterrent to terrorists .
one of the issues under discussion was how to deal with terrorist suspects holding foreign passports - more specifically whether they should be extradited if the countries receiving them pledge to treat them according to international law and human rights standards .
another issue covers the exchange of information related to terrorist threats and the legal aspects covering how such information is obtained .
search for common principles experts from the seven participating countries were also present at the conference , which did not pass any resolutions .
the aim of the gathering was to lay the foundation for a long-term process by which the different states can agree on common principles on how to deal with terrorism , schäuble said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the alternative nobel prize winner suggested a few other ways of protecting the earth . hermann scheer is a social democratic member of the german parliament .
he is president of the eurosolar organization for renewable energy and general chairman of the world council for renewable energy . dw-world.de : what do you expect to come out of the negotiations on bali ? hermann scheer : that a decision will be made to hold another conference .
there are lots of good intentions and appeals , but nothing concrete .
too many expectations have been projected on this conference , which makes the disappointment afterward even bigger . for many governments , these meetings take the place of doing something , according to the unwritten motto : " speak globally , delay nationally . "
everything is put off until the conference , even though they know that no real break-through decisions will happen there .
the question has to be asked : is this the right level to be solving these problems at ? why are you so skeptical ?
there 's a lot of pressure for the participating countries to reach an agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer is general chairman of the world council for renewable energy all of these conferences depend on reaching a consensus .
but the principle of consensus contradicts the necessity of speeding things us .
and we desperately need to speed up the fight against climate change .
it 's time to think about not making these conferences a standard for everything that further decisions are based on . do un climate conferences have any value at all ? these conferences do have significance , which is why they should be held - that is , raising awareness of the problem and creating public pressure on the countries to act .
their value is in keeping the topic up high on the political agenda .
but you ca n't expect the necessary , practical solutions here .
action has to happen later , in the individual countries themselves . what topics should be discussed on bali ? an initiative for increased dismantling of nuclear power plants will be on the table on bali .
but you ca n't fall into the trap of thinking that nuclear power is the solution to the climate problem .
let 's just think about the problematic effects of nuclear energy , the costs associated with it , and the risks that result .
it needs to be critically discussed that the allegedly co2-free power plants lead to a dead end .
this approach is n't so much in the foreground because there 's supposed to be a guarantee of survival for the large power plants . why does co2 refinement lead to a dead end ? the concept of refining and storing co2 ca n't be successful .
it ca n't be released from the earth ever again .
it 's comparable to the atomic waste problem .
and it will be incredibly expensive .
everything will be swept to the side . it would be much better to get away from the big power plant structure and replace them with decentralized energy supplies .
and , internationally , we finally have to come to the realization that fighting climate change wo n't bring economic damage .
in fact , the opposite is true : increasing energy efficiency and switching to renewable energy sources means a huge economic benefit and is an investment in the future . what should the central points be in the successor treaty to kyoto ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheer sees little future for nuclear power the cheapest method of relieving the climate situation should be put in the foreground - that is , a worldwide reforestation program that would considerably reduce the excess co2 in the atmosphere .
it would also be groundbreaking to organize a transfer of technology to developing and emerging nations . one proposal is to set up an international agency for renewable energy , but there 's too much resistant to it on bali .
i 've been following this idea for 17 years and since then it 's even been approved by the german government .
with the un consensus process , it probably would n't be possible .
the agency would have to be founded by the countries that want to participate as a government organization . are there other ways to include the developing and emerging nations ? we 'd have to talk about how we can give existing institutions more capacity and financial power to assist the countries .
that would be a topic that should be focused on at these kinds of conferences .
that 's true for unesco , when it 's a matter of training specialists .
it 's also true for unido , the un organization for industrial development that is there to support renewable energies in emerging nations .
and it applies to food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , which helps countries establish bio-energy structures in order to get away from energy imports . interview : torsten schäfer -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

why can there be virtually no surprises in the upcoming russian elections ?
dw-world.de spoke to russian sociologist lev gudkov about voters , their relationship to the state and their views of the political system . dw-world.de : how would you characterize the russian voters ' mood ahead of the presidential and parliamentary elections ? lev gudkov : i 'd point out that people have become increasingly content with their lives over the past year and a half .
we 're noticing for the first time that the general mood is positive : people are more satisfied than dissatisfied with their lives .
for 15 years - after 1991 - the mood was decidedly negative : people believed that the country was not developing in the right direction , that their opinions and interests were not considered , that their income was falling . all that , of course , is not equally distributed among different groups .
only 15 to 20 percent of people have actually benefited from all the changes , but the bulk of the people feel that they 're living like before .
for the first time after the crisis of 1998 , however , people have calmed down and they are not expecting any commotion in the near future .
this leads not so much to confidence and optimism as to the weakening of their feeling that something negative could happen .
we 're dealing here not so much with the formula : " look how well off we are , " but rather with the principle : " thank god , nothing bad is going on . " is that the reason why the russian president and his party are so popular ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lev gudkov thinks that most russians are satisfied with the system partly .
a large portion of people continue living with a soviet mindset .
they expect to get help , employment , social services and other things from the state .
in that sense , they are dependent on the government .
and their level of satisfaction with the government is based on whether or not the government fulfills these expectations . people , especially in the villages , although in cities , too , feel that they ca n't get through without state help - without free medical and social services etc .
putting aside the fact that voters are pressured , the opposition is getting squeezed out and the mass media are not free i.e. all those " gems " of managed democracy , people put their hopes in the party in power because it at lest can accomplish something .
and that 's also why they put their hopes in the president . so what are voters thinking nowadays ? strictly speaking , the situation is stable and will not essentially change until after the elections .
although slight surprises and mood swings are always possible .
fifty-three percent of the population is planning to take part in the elections , which means that 47 percent will not participate for political reasons . specifically , what reasons ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of russians will not be heading to the polls they do n't think that their voices can change anything .
most of them believe that the election results can be rigged , many are tired of politics and do n't trust the politicians .
only 5 percent of voters are abstaining from voting because they " do n't understand much about politics . "
basically , abstentions are fully motivated : those who are not finding a party that would represent their interests would rather abstain from voting than vote for anybody . how would you estimate party ratings ? approximately 59 percent of votes will go to -lsb- president putin 's -rsb- " one russia , " 18 percent will go to the communists , 9 percent to -lsb- moderate pro-kremlin -rsb- " just russia " and some 7 percent , i.e. around the minimum required to enter the parliament , will go to -lsb- right-winger -rsb- zhirinovsky 's party . none of the opposition democratic parties stand a chance ? unfortunately , none of them .
the -lsb- liberal -rsb- yabloko party is getting less than 3 percent and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- is in the 1 to 2 percent range . so if all the opposition democratic parties got together , they would still not pass the 7-percent barrier ? yes , the so-called democrats would not pass the minimum barrier . are you expecting any surprises from the parliamentary elections ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yabloko supporters wo n't make it to parliament i do n't expect any special surprises .
what kind of surprises could we expect when the media are so tightly controlled when it comes to political advertising and propaganda ?
it is possible that zhirinovksy 's ratings will go up in the last days before the elections - it has happened before , but only if no pressure is exerted on him .
in principle , in the current situation - in a managed democracy - he is not necessary .
to a certain extend , he 's even discrediting the kremlin . will the state parliament -lrb- duma -rrb- be controlled by the kremlin again ? the duma will have an absolute majority of pro-kremlin parties , which will make it completely steerable and in that sense dependent on the executive branch , obedient and ineffective . what do the majority of russians think about the developments of the russian political system ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " czar putin " -lrb- center -rrb- in a parody of a famous painting by ilya repin people do n't have a good idea of what a democracy is : they never lived in one .
at the same time , the populist conservative demagogy propelled by the communists in the 1990s and later by the ruling party lead to the discrediting of the very principles of democracy and democratic models . depending on their level of education and how well-informed they are , people understand the meaning of democracy as the right to criticize the authorities , the freedom to leave the country etc . , or things like chaos , dissolution , empty promises , demagogy .
people do n't understand and do n't know that democracy is a system based on the separation of powers and free competition of political parties .
only 10-12 percent of russians are truly familiar with democratic principles . are russians becoming more aware of the need to develop civil society ? no .
russian society remains very conservative with elements of feudal-state consciousness .
it is oriented towards the authorities , it is used to their caprices , it expects their patronage and entrusts its own will to those in power . interview : sergei morozov -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

why can there be virtually no surprises in the upcoming russian elections ?
dw-world.de spoke to russian sociologist lev gudkov about voters , their relationship to the state and their views of the political system . dw-world.de : how would you characterize the russian voters ' mood ahead of the presidential and parliamentary elections ? lev gudkov : i 'd point out that people have become increasingly content with their lives over the past year and a half .
we 're noticing for the first time that the general mood is positive : people are more satisfied than dissatisfied with their lives .
for 15 years - after 1991 - the mood was decidedly negative : people believed that the country was not developing in the right direction , that their opinions and interests were not considered , that their income was falling . all that , of course , is not equally distributed among different groups .
only 15 to 20 percent of people have actually benefited from all the changes , but the bulk of the people feel that they 're living like before .
for the first time after the crisis of 1998 , however , people have calmed down and they are not expecting any commotion in the near future .
this leads not so much to confidence and optimism as to the weakening of their feeling that something negative could happen .
we 're dealing here not so much with the formula : " look how well off we are , " but rather with the principle : " thank god , nothing bad is going on . " is that the reason why the russian president and his party are so popular ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lev gudkov thinks that most russians are satisfied with the system partly .
a large portion of people continue living with a soviet mindset .
they expect to get help , employment , social services and other things from the state .
in that sense , they are dependent on the government .
and their level of satisfaction with the government is based on whether or not the government fulfills these expectations . people , especially in the villages , although in cities , too , feel that they ca n't get through without state help - without free medical and social services etc .
putting aside the fact that voters are pressured , the opposition is getting squeezed out and the mass media are not free i.e. all those " gems " of managed democracy , people put their hopes in the party in power because it at lest can accomplish something .
and that 's also why they put their hopes in the president . so what are voters thinking nowadays ? strictly speaking , the situation is stable and will not essentially change until after the elections .
although slight surprises and mood swings are always possible .
fifty-three percent of the population is planning to take part in the elections , which means that 47 percent will not participate for political reasons . specifically , what reasons ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of russians will not be heading to the polls they do n't think that their voices can change anything .
most of them believe that the election results can be rigged , many are tired of politics and do n't trust the politicians .
only 5 percent of voters are abstaining from voting because they " do n't understand much about politics . "
basically , abstentions are fully motivated : those who are not finding a party that would represent their interests would rather abstain from voting than vote for anybody . how would you estimate party ratings ? approximately 59 percent of votes will go to -lsb- president putin 's -rsb- " one russia , " 18 percent will go to the communists , 9 percent to -lsb- moderate pro-kremlin -rsb- " just russia " and some 7 percent , i.e. around the minimum required to enter the parliament , will go to -lsb- right-winger -rsb- zhirinovsky 's party . none of the opposition democratic parties stand a chance ? unfortunately , none of them .
the -lsb- liberal -rsb- yabloko party is getting less than 3 percent and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- is in the 1 to 2 percent range . so if all the opposition democratic parties got together , they would still not pass the 7-percent barrier ? yes , the so-called democrats would not pass the minimum barrier . are you expecting any surprises from the parliamentary elections ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yabloko supporters wo n't make it to parliament i do n't expect any special surprises .
what kind of surprises could we expect when the media are so tightly controlled when it comes to political advertising and propaganda ?
it is possible that zhirinovksy 's ratings will go up in the last days before the elections - it has happened before , but only if no pressure is exerted on him .
in principle , in the current situation - in a managed democracy - he is not necessary .
to a certain extend , he 's even discrediting the kremlin . will the state parliament -lrb- duma -rrb- be controlled by the kremlin again ? the duma will have an absolute majority of pro-kremlin parties , which will make it completely steerable and in that sense dependent on the executive branch , obedient and ineffective . what do the majority of russians think about the developments of the russian political system ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " czar putin " -lrb- center -rrb- in a parody of a famous painting by ilya repin people do n't have a good idea of what a democracy is : they never lived in one .
at the same time , the populist conservative demagogy propelled by the communists in the 1990s and later by the ruling party lead to the discrediting of the very principles of democracy and democratic models . depending on their level of education and how well-informed they are , people understand the meaning of democracy as the right to criticize the authorities , the freedom to leave the country etc . , or things like chaos , dissolution , empty promises , demagogy .
people do n't understand and do n't know that democracy is a system based on the separation of powers and free competition of political parties .
only 10-12 percent of russians are truly familiar with democratic principles . are russians becoming more aware of the need to develop civil society ? no .
russian society remains very conservative with elements of feudal-state consciousness .
it is oriented towards the authorities , it is used to their caprices , it expects their patronage and entrusts its own will to those in power . interview : sergei morozov -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the snp have been hailing st andrew 's day as the dawn of a new era .
alex salmond has been trying to make more of st andrew 's day " we are repatriating our national day , " first minister alex salmond told his audience in glasgow .
" we are announcing to the world that scotland is resurgent and great days lie ahead . "
meanwhile , labour 's wendy alexander was telling her audience in edinburgh that she wanted scotland " to walk taller within the uk , without walking out " .
she called for a constitutional commission to reconsider the devolution settlement of 1999 , in particular to look at ways in which the scottish parliament could raise more of its own revenue .
however , ms alexander 's st andrew 's day speech was completely overwhelmed by the row over donations to the labour party , north and south of the border .
the way the story unfolded here at holyrood was less the stuff of legend and more comic opera .
ms alexander arrived on thursday morning with the newspaper headlines asking - " did she break the rules ?
was she caught up in labour 's donations row ? "
at question time she said she was submitting her accounts to the electoral commission and would await its judgement on whether a donation of £ 950 from tax exile paul green to her leadership election campaign was legitimate or not .
but no sooner had she walked down the steps of the garden lobby than she was informed by one of her team , charlie gordon msp , that , em , he 'd been misled and in fact the donation was against the law because it came from a non-uk resident .
wendy alexander has faced increased pressure over funds mr green lives in the channel islands , though he has extensive business interests in glasgow .
there was then an unseemly media scrum in labour 's " monk 's cell " at the end of the garden lobby as mr gordon announced his resignation as a labour party spokesman on transport and tom mccabe msp explained that ms alexander was too " upset " to speak .
at question time , she 'd tried to turn the tables on the snp by saying not one of their candidates in the leadership election in 2004 reported any donations to the electoral commission .
" i find that an odd state of affairs from a party now lecturing us on transparency , " she said .
unfortunately she got the list of candidates wrong ... mistaking alex neil for michael russell .
and mr salmond was able to hit back with the jibe : " surely all that proves is that the snp spent less fighting an election than labour spent not fighting an election . "
which brings us to the other small matter of the week , the snp 's budget .
the committees have begun serious work on scrutinising the figures in the 151 page document , with a st andrew 's flag on the cover of course .
no fewer than three cabinet secretaries , nicola sturgeon , john swinney and kenny macaskill , were summoned to appear in front of the health committee on tuesday to explain how much they propose to spend on the fight against alcohol and drug addiction .
fourteen per cent more , they said .
committees have begun scrutinising the snp budget in another committee room , education secretary fiona hyslop was being warned by university officials that they may not have enough money next year to increase student numbers and widen access to higher education .
in still other committee rooms , scottish enterprise officials were warning that jobs would have to go as a result of the budget .
the police were warning that the expected efficiency savings could not be found .
and professor david bell , adviser to the finance committee , warned that the freeze in council tax , planned for in the snp budget , would leave nearly two million households worse off because of the knock-on effect on their welfare benefits .
in a debate on tourism on thursday , the snp were also warned that the end of the subsidy for new air routes into scotland would seriously damage the tourist trade , which incidentally suffered a decline last year of 1.3 % in money terms .
the snp 's answer to all the criticisms was that they were doing their best in difficult circumstances .
the scottish budget of £ 30bn , handed down from london , is only increasing by 0.5 % next year , but in each case at least some more money is being provided .
one minute , it 's all bicker and battle , the next it 's as calm as loch lomond the parliament found room in its budget this week to appoint its first human rights commissioner .
professor alan miller will work with three other part-time commissioners to champion human rights in scotland and investigate alleged breaches by public bodies .
the appointment comes in the week that scottish parliament marked the european year of opportunities for all , a campaign to stamp out discrimination on the grounds of race , sex , disability , religion or age .
they might have added " language " because on thursday evening , the parliament hosted an event for that little known language , gaelic .
it was the annual gaelic schools debate followed by a performance from a gaelic clarsach band .
suddenly the garden lobby was a happier place again after the turmoil earlier in the day .
it neatly illustrated the changing fortunes of st andrew 's land .
one minute , it 's all bicker and battle , the next it 's as calm as loch lomond .

shoppers are now being urged to use their own bags , and many retailers have stocked up on compostable versions .
but while some in the powys border town embrace change for green and economic reasons , others say it has been rushed and will be difficult to abide by .
other places , such as llandysilio in pembrokeshire , and newport are also among those aiming to banish the bags .
officials say the hay-on-wye campaign is backed by the chamber of commerce and the majority of the town 's shopkeepers .
businesses supporting it have their names listed on the end of plastic bags campaign website .
hay has hosted one of the uk 's best-known literary festivals since 1988 , and each year the town welcomes the great and the good from the book world and beyond , ranging from doris lessing and martin amis to bill clinton , gordon brown and al gore .
but a visit proved it was not difficult to find those opposed to the plastic purge among permanent residents .
one who will not be found in the online list is high street butcher chris gibbons , who described the campaign as " a lot of rubbish " .
it 's going to be difficult for the campaigners to achieve what they 're trying for but hopefully in the long term people will get used to the change mickey day he said ordinary plastic bags were essential for his business and he would continue to order them .
" our bags can carry 15-20lbs in weight .
but if you put a similar weight into one of the bio-bags they have been distributing the handles snap , " explained mr gibbons .
" you would n't get a turkey in them .
" the campaigners have been coming around telling everyone to get these new bags in , but i do n't think they have really thought about it " i pay business rates - who are they to tell me what to do ? "
mr gibbons said he had ordered some of the bio-bags and would use them if his customers requested them .
ethically-produced market grocer jason beckett is in favour , but said traders could have been given more time to make the change .
" i 've only known about it for six weeks .
the town should 've been given six months .
" but most people in the town seem happy about it and everyone 's been saving their plastic bags to use them again . "
flow clothes shop owner mickey day said the anti-plastic movement fitted well with the ethos of his store , which sells ethically-produced garments .
" we finished using plastic bags in the summer because there is no need to use them anymore , " he said .
" we noticed over the last 12 months that our customers were using plastic bags far less and sometimes would n't even want one of our paper ones .
i would totally support it because i think plastic bags are a complete nuisance hayley sharp " it 's going to be difficult for the campaigners to achieve what they 're trying for but hopefully in the long term people will get used to the change . "
other shopkeepers worried that their customers would forget to bring their own bags and that they might resent having to pay extra for more eco-friendly carriers once plastic was banished .
however , shoppers in the town seemed agreed that the extinction of the plastic bag could only be good for hay and the environment in general .
" i would totally support it because i think plastic bags are a complete nuisance , " said hayley sharp , from the nearby town of talgarth .
" a friend of mine bought me a foldaway bag which you can clip on to your belt or handbag and it 's proved very useful .
it 's a strong bag and i 've shoved all sorts of stuff in there .
they are now being sold in shops in the town . "
local vet steven baird and his friend from north yorkshire matt yarnall pointed out that discarded bags were often dangerous to wildlife .
" all it takes is a bit of planning and eventually remembering to bring out a bag when you go shopping will become part of your routine , " said mr baird .

mr mckay , who insists he has done no wrong , said officers " stormed " his south yorkshire home with his family were inside and entered his bedroom .
" it was like a terrorist operation , like something out of a film , " he said .
mr mckay is one of five men arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and false accounting .
the others are portsmouth chief executive peter storrie , former chairman milan mandaric , former player amdy faye and current portsmouth boss harry redknapp .
mr mckay 's house was targeted by city of london police officers on wednesday morning .
' incredible ' " it was 6am , all i could hear was people shouting ' police ' - i got out of bed and there were police officers all over the place , " he told sky sports news .
" i got ready but i was absolutely startled and amazed ; they actually came up into my bedroom - i think there were around 28 . "
he said it was incredible that the inquiry could cause 28 officers to " storm " his house with his family inside .
mr mckay said officers were looking for transfer documents even though his lawyer had twice volunteered documentation .
" i do n't blame the officers themselves .
their orders were to come up here but it was like a terrorist operation .
it was like something out of a film . "
on thursday mr redknapp also criticised police after a dawn raid on his home with press photographers in tow - which he claimed was only to " raise the profile " of the investigation .
the inquiry is believed to centre on the transfer of mr faye to portsmouth from the french club auxerre , and from portsmouth to newcastle , deals set up by mr mckay .
mr faye is now on loan from charlton athletic to rangers .

mr mckay , who insists he has done no wrong , said officers " stormed " his south yorkshire home with his family were inside and entered his bedroom .
" it was like a terrorist operation , like something out of a film , " he said .
mr mckay is one of five men arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and false accounting .
the others are portsmouth chief executive peter storrie , former chairman milan mandaric , former player amdy faye and current portsmouth boss harry redknapp .
mr mckay 's house was targeted by city of london police officers on wednesday morning .
' incredible ' " it was 6am , all i could hear was people shouting ' police ' - i got out of bed and there were police officers all over the place , " he told sky sports news .

mr mckay said officers were looking for transfer documents even though his lawyer had twice volunteered documentation .
" i do n't blame the officers themselves .
their orders were to come up here but it was like a terrorist operation .
it was like something out of a film . "
on thursday mr redknapp also criticised police after a dawn raid on his home with press photographers in tow - which he claimed was only to " raise the profile " of the investigation .
the inquiry is believed to centre on the transfer of mr faye to portsmouth from the french club auxerre , and from portsmouth to newcastle , deals set up by mr mckay .
mr faye is now on loan from charlton athletic to rangers .

mr mckay , who insists he has done no wrong , said officers " stormed " his south yorkshire home with his family were inside and entered his bedroom .
" it was like a terrorist operation , like something out of a film , " he said .
mr mckay is one of five men arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and false accounting .
the others are portsmouth chief executive peter storrie , former chairman milan mandaric , former player amdy faye and current portsmouth boss harry redknapp .
mr mckay 's house was targeted by city of london police officers on wednesday morning .
' incredible ' " it was 6am , all i could hear was people shouting ' police ' - i got out of bed and there were police officers all over the place , " he told sky sports news .
" i got ready but i was absolutely startled and amazed ; they actually came up into my bedroom - i think there were around 28 . "
he said it was incredible that the inquiry could cause 28 officers to " storm " his house with his family inside .
mr mckay said officers were looking for transfer documents even though his lawyer had twice volunteered documentation .
" i do n't blame the officers themselves .
their orders were to come up here but it was like a terrorist operation .
it was like something out of a film . "
on thursday mr redknapp also criticised police after a dawn raid on his home with press photographers in tow - which he claimed was only to " raise the profile " of the investigation .
the inquiry is believed to centre on the transfer of mr faye to portsmouth from the french club auxerre , and from portsmouth to newcastle , deals set up by mr mckay .
mr faye is now on loan from charlton athletic to rangers .

an insurgency had been crushed under the leadership of a british soldier nicknamed mad mitch .
as the last bbc aden correspondent , brian barron reported on these seismic events - and has returned to take in the mood .
the best way i can describe the betrayal and melodrama that engulfed britain 's last post in arabia is to say that a falklands moment it was not .
among the half-dozen or so end-of-empire sagas that i have witnessed , this was the saddest , the most abject .
but at least it marked the final act - for her majesty 's forces and proconsuls - of a big mess in a very small place .
each person is chewing a bunch of green leaves of qat , a mild narcotic , which sedates millions across the nation every afternoon whoever chose things are n't what they used to be for the military band bidding farewell to the last governor - as i watched at the raf -lsb- royal air force -rsb- base in 1967 - evoked the right note of seediness and frayed national self-belief .
once - and that word " once " encompasses well over a century of unchallenged british supremacy - steamer point was as famous as piccadilly circus .
everyone came through heading east or west , from chroniclers of empire , like kipling , to viceroys of india , to millions of migrants heading for white dominions at the bottom of the world .
today steamer point looks unchanged from 1967 , but the crescent of curio shops and watch dealers stands shuttered and silent , beneath a massive rolex sign , weathered and rusting , that once enticed liner passengers ashore .
britain 's imperial stamp is everywhere , including her majesty 's moribund pillar boxes the only outlet open from colonial days is aziz 's bookshop .
aziz himself has long gone to some trinket-filled stall in paradise , but his grandson sits on the pavement at the threshold , playing cards with three friends .
each person is chewing a bunch of green leaves of qat , a mild narcotic , which sedates millions across the nation every afternoon .
the aziz emporium is a cornucopia of vinyl records still in their sleeves , christmas cards from the 1940s , photo panoramas of aden as the world 's third busiest port , and children 's books printed before world war ii .

britain 's imperial stamp is everywhere , including her majesty 's moribund pillar boxes .
what was flagstaff house , the british commander 's hq overlooking the gulf of aden , is now the president 's palace , when he is visiting from united yemen 's capital in the north .
looking back we can see the magnitude of britain 's strategic blunder here above steamer point stand the ruins of the naval semaphore station , from the heyday of the victorian empire .
it was destroyed by missiles in the 1986 civil war that finally doomed the revolutionary regime in power since britain left .
but the failure for two decades to repair one of aden 's most prominent , historic landmarks reveals the inertia today and the lack of entrepreneurial instincts .
maybe that commercial spirit sailed away with the british - and whatever remained was destroyed by the revolutionary regime .
mutiny colonial aden expired under a state of emergency .
british civilians like me were given revolvers because of the risk of assassination .
the heart of the insurgency was crater , an arab town nestling in the hot embrace of an extinct volcano .
it was here that a mutiny by the british-trained aden armed police in mid-1967 led to a massacre of british troops .
british troops reacted forcibly to demonstrations in 1967 as the british high command and london government hesitated , a controversial colonel named colin mitchell seized the initiative .
he re-occupied crater with his argyll and sutherland highlanders - earning the nickname mad mitch - and in fleet street 's judgment he restored british military honour .
a fearless soldier , he was born 100 years too late .
his mouth often ran ahead of him .
once we stood together in crater watching the argylls stacking , as in a butcher 's shop , the bodies of four arab militants they had just shot and mad mitch said : " it was like shooting grouse , a brace here and a brace there . "
today crater is calm .
any western veneer has gone .
women are veiled .
arab tea shops are thriving .
the bank building used as mad mitch 's headquarters , with his snipers on the roof , once again dispenses banknotes , not bullets .
beside it , the old anglican church is no longer the secret police interrogation centre it became following the british retreat .
battered and bruised looking back we can see the magnitude of britain 's strategic blunder here .
the political , military and diplomatic establishment in the late 1950s and early 1960s misjudged the strength of arab nationalism , completing a colossal military base despite local hostility .
there was an absence of reliable intelligence -lrb- does n't that sound familiar ? -rrb- .
as the insurgency turned deadlier , we withdrew - abandoning moderate allies .
twenty-three years of police state thuggery followed , with the soviet kgb replacing the british .
even after aden and the rest of the south merged with north yemen , there was another civil war in the 1990s .
no wonder aden today seems battered and bruised , and its people frustrated by the follies of their rulers : a forgotten place anchored to a forgotten time .

but according to one british sudanese muslim scholar , this is not the true face of islam and their anger is not shared by muslims in britain .
dr imad hassan , 45 , is a sudanese doctor and writer with a phd in comparative religious studies who has lived in britain since 1991 .
he feels that someone from the sudanese community must speak out against the ruling , and is planning to organise a protest from fellow scholars .
" i feel insulted as a muslim by the government of sudan , not by mrs gibbons , " he told the bbc .
" describing the lovely children 's toy with the name of muhammad is a compliment , it is not an insult .
' political motivation ' " if my own son calls a teddy bear muhammad i would not rebuke him , let alone a non-muslim teacher accepting children 's natural lovely choice .
" the arabs use lots of wild animals ' names as human names .
the name ' hamza ' , the most beloved uncle of the prophet means ' lion ' which is wilder than the bear .
" the prophet muhammad himself in his lifetime has been insulted by so many people and he has forgiven them , so this is not sharia law , it is politically motivated . "
dr hassan says everyone he knows in the british sudanese community feels the same way as he does . "
i 've lived here for 16 years and i feel better as a muslim here than in any muslim country " dr imad hassan ' muslims need own teachers ' " so far i have n't met somebody with a different view , either within the islamic community or the sudanese . "
he also says he feels totally accepted in this country and believes non-muslim britons are too sophisticated to be drawn into knee-jerk anti-muslim feeling .
" i 've lived here for 16 years and i feel better as a muslim here than in any muslim country .
" freedom is a fundamental value of islam .
in the koran it says faith is a matter of choice - so people can not have better faiths , it 's a matter of choice . "
dr hassan said he believed the sudanese government was using the incident to demonstrate its hard-line stance and whip up outrage , and through it , popular support . "
i would like to send my apologies to her family on the behalf of the sudanese nation " dr imad hassan " any insult or offence provokes an emotional reaction and they thought they may provoke the masses around them , " he said .
" the people who were out on the streets yesterday were gathered from mosques around the city which are led by laymen , uneducated people .
" what we saw yesterday were poor people gathered from the city who are more emotionally motivated than intellectually . "
dr hassan says he feels compelled to generate support for mrs gibbons among british muslims .
" i will try my best to motivate muslim scholars to speak out to show the original conviction was unfounded ... to show that there was no insult to the prophet and clear her name .
" i feel a sense of responsibility .
i would like to send my apologies to her family on the behalf of the sudanese nation . "
