however , critics of the system fear security gaps . according to one of the project managers behind the i-voting system , the procedure is quick and easy .
the voter pushes the electronic chip of his identity card into a reader , calls up the special electoral web page on the internet , gives two pin codes and puts his cross beside one of the parties .
" this takes no longer than 15 seconds , " says tarvy martins . up until late on thursday evening last week , about 940,000 voters registered to vote in sunday 's internet election .
after a test run during the local elections in 2005 , the number of voters accepting the i-voting system has sky-rocketed . to ease the vote , the necessary card readers have been installed in all public places with internet connections in estonia and many private individuals have bought their own home reader so they can vote from the comfort of their own home . estonia miles ahead in internet coverage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the most remote areas are online the baltic state is one of the most internet-savvy countries in the european union due to a burst of technological development soon after its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .

the pin numbers used for the i-voting system have also been adapted to make shopping , tax returns and all administrative processes possible and secure online . even the country 's administration has embraced the technology and has moved towards e-government , thus increasing political communication and information via the internet . it is no surprise , therefore , that the estonians will become the first nation worldwide to choose their government online . electoral monitoring body skeptical over security however , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , the body which observes all elections in europe , views the on-line development , with skepticism , with many officials doubting the level of protection and security of information .
but tarvy martins is convinced that the procedure is fool-proof .
" this is like a double envelope .
the choice is encoded and then sealed .
it is quite difficult to cheat . " the biggest technical challenge of the i-voting system is the authorization and identification of the user as an entitled voter , while making sure that the vote remains anonymous . " technically , this is not a big problem , " explains dieter otten , a member of the german federal ministry of economy and technology 's research group into electronic voting .
" since the 1980s there has been the principle of the digital signature and asymmetrical encoding . "
he also believes that high encoding technology makes the security and implementation of online elections " fool-proof . " " the bigger challenge is communication , " remembers otten .
it has been more difficult to persuade lawyers and politicians of the security of online voting than to design a functioning system .
the people who have to decide on whether to use the system , otten says , are dealing with something they do n't fully understand . internet-doubters holding back german progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is behind estonia in terms of election technology those with doubts and power in germany prevented the last election in 2005 from being an e-lection and it remains increasingly unlikely that a change in opinion will take place in the near future . " i-voting , for judicial and technical reasons , does not do justice to the special requirements of political elections in germany at the moment , " says annette ziesig of the ministry of internal affairs . dieter otten accuses germany of being obsessed with security to the point that the measures brought in to protect the traditional voting process can be more expensive than developing i-voting to fit the needs of the german electoral system .
he believes , in time , germany will follow the estonians into a new age of voting . back in estonia , i-voting is becoming the norm .
the system was already in place for the 2005 local elections , and last week the dress rehearsal took place for the parliamentary elections .

he was unable to specify their number . witnesses said numerous germans had played a major role in the street riots on friday night .
one person was injured by protestors throwing paving stones , setting cars on fire and putting up barricades . according to the ritzau news agency , german and danish authorities have increased border controls to prevent more violent protestors slipping into denmark en route to copenhagen out of solidarity with the danish protest . on saturday night , the violence was limited to scuffles between police and small groups of protesters who threw rocks and set fire to trash bins and barricades , but the unrest did not escalate into the full-scale riots of the two previous nights . " we are very happy that the situation was so quiet , " police spokesman lars borg said .
" the people who want to demonstrate have been more aware that the things they are doing are not the right things to do . " arrests continue despite quieter night bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police launched raids on gangs of protestors more than 30 people were arrested near the christiania hippie enclave after protesters built barricades on a major street and set them on fire in the early hours of the morning , police said . nearly 300 rioters were arrested earlier in copenhagen after police moved against an estimated 1,000 mainly teenagers , some hurling petrol bombs and stones .
police said a hard core wearing masks erected barriers and set fire to these and to cars , smashed shop windows and vandalized a school before melting away . a crowd also gathered outside city hall and prepared to march to the umgdomhuset , a building some two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- away , which has acquired a cult reputation over the last 25 years as a home to underground culture . its inhabitants were forcibly evicted on thursday , prompting two nights of violence after thursday 's dawn police raid .
the ungdomshuset has been a haven for rebels , punks and squatters since the 1980s when the city of copenhagen gave the groups permission to move into the youth centre . protestors head for youth center at heart of unrest bildunterschrift : the ungdomshuset was recently sold to the christian group fadershuset , which requested the eviction of the youths .
an august 2006 court ruling ordered the occupants to be evicted from the centre , which they insist belongs to them . the building has been a popular hang-out for copenhagen 's alternative society , serving as a venue for concerts , plays and debates .
big stars such as icelandic pop artist björk have performed at the venue . demonstrators carried banners saturday saying : " no to police violence , " and " keep the youth centre " while large numbers of police were on standby . line barfoed , spokesperson of the unity party , the former communist party , appealed to copenhagen 's mayor to seek " a political solution to the current crisis . "
she also called on police to " avoid any escalation of violence and not arrest citizens showing solidarity with young people . " supporters call for political solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violence and police operation has been costly " this entire affair is going to cost the authorities much more than it would have done if they had left this historic house with young people , " she also warned . rasmus willig , chair of the danish sociologists ' association , said it was irresponsible to take the community house away from the young people after it had served as a focal point for underground culture and a great attraction among visitors to denmark . in all , 643 people have been arrested , including 140 foreigners from other european nations and the united states , since the clashes started thursday .
they included 20 swedes , 20 norwegians and 25 germans , police said .

" a total of 288,906 voters had cast their votes by midday , making up 32.3 percent of all eligible voters , " the election commission said in a statement . in the last parliamentary elections , in 2003 - the year before estonia joined the eu - turnout at midday was 28.6 percent . since then , estonia 's economy has powered ahead , growing by 11.5 percent last year , and the baltic state has earned itself a reputation as a high-tech leader . " things are going fine in estonia , but people must come out and say who should govern next , " 31-year-old siim lepik told afp at a busy polling station in tallinn .

dw-world.de spoke to stefan kramer , the council 's secretary general , during a recent berlin conference on " religion and integration . " dw-world : the term " integration " is one of the most widely used in politics right now .
how do you define the term ? integration means becoming a part of society and enjoying equal rights , without losing sight of or repudiating one 's own roots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan kramer it should n't be about set standards of what integration means - like whether one enjoys german cuisine or not .
i think there are much more important values that define a society , and which one must share and adjust to .
if we could get to the point that jews , muslims , christians and atheists are proud of being germans or of living in germany , then i would think that we have achieved our goals .
integration , however , is a two-way street , and it should not be a form of coercion . if integration is , as you say , a two-way street , what can the majority in society do to help the process ? integration of people from different religions or those socialized in a different cultural context always means the creation of a new society to some extent .
to expect or to believe that the majority of society should n't change , or that migrants or minorities have to subordinate themselves to the larger culture , is completely outdated and unrealistic . take a look at the united states , australia or canada - the traditional countries of immigrants .
they demonstrate that immigrants are not subordinated , but integrated .
the fact is , a culture changes when immigrants are integrated .
it changes in a positive way because people realize that it 's an enriching process , and that society grows from that process , despite all the challenges and difficulties that may come along the way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has long become a multicultural society i do n't want to disregard the fears which the so-called " germans " have regarding an influx of foreigners , other cultures or other religions .
people can only respect other people 's values or those of other faiths when they have a good sense of their own .
i have a feeling that many people in various facets of german society have no sense of their personal values or beliefs and that is why they are intolerant of others or fear foreigners who come here .
that 's why we have to take a good , hard look at ourselves and work on our own principles and values before we can tell other people how they have to behave and fulfill our expectations . in your speech , you said that a dialogue between religions is the only rational way of approaching the clash between religions . how committed are jews to that process ? it 's not the only way , but it 's an important one .
talking can do no harm .
we are doing our best to hold bilateral talks with various partners , including muslim associations .
we are not always doing it publicly , because we are not interested in earning points for our diligence , but rather in establishing bridges of confidence to other people - despite the existing difficulties and differences .
after all , it 's not really organizations that are talking to other , but people .
small , but important steps are made in this direction all the time . a great deal of problems arise when religion is mixed up with politics .
how can this be avoided ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitic message appeared recently on the walls of a jewish school and kindergarten in berlin when religion is abused by politics , that 's always bad , regardless of what religion we 're talking about .
this is a problem with christianity , judaism , islam and other religions .
we have to try to keep politics out of these areas as much as possible , but we should also not live in an ivory tower and believe that we could conduct this kind of dialogue without resorting to any political arguments .
politics is a part of this society , just as religion and other basic values are .
it 's for each individual to decide how much he wants to keep these separate from each other . i think that what we 're missing is a civilized way of debating our problems .
debating is good if it 's about finding a better solution for our problems and it 's bad if it 's about converting or trying to hurt somebody , which is what , unfortunately , happens all to often in our public discussions .
the result of this negative form of discussion is silence , the feeling of not being understood , of having to find a different way of expressing oneself , which often leads to violence .
and that 's exactly what we should avoid . anti-semitism can be very damaging to the integration process .
what can be done against it ? i 'm careful about such generalizations , but the fact is that anti-semitism is , for instance , on the rise in the muslim community in germany , and that it 's increasingly prone to violence .
we agree with the majority of muslim organizations that we need to do something about it together .
at the same time , and i say it openly , jews in germany and other countries are not immune to stereotypes , clichés and prejudices about muslims , perhaps not to the same extent and certainly not exhibiting the same willingness to violence .
but there are things on both sides where we still have homework to do .
we 're working on finding possible solutions .

it changes in a positive way because people realize that it 's an enriching process , and that society grows from that process , despite all the challenges and difficulties that may come along the way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has long become a multicultural society i do n't want to disregard the fears which the so-called " germans " have regarding an influx of foreigners , other cultures or other religions .
people can only respect other people 's values or those of other faiths when they have a good sense of their own .
i have a feeling that many people in various facets of german society have no sense of their personal values or beliefs and that is why they are intolerant of others or fear foreigners who come here .
that 's why we have to take a good , hard look at ourselves and work on our own principles and values before we can tell other people how they have to behave and fulfill our expectations . in your speech , you said that a dialogue between religions is the only rational way of approaching the clash between religions . how committed are jews to that process ? it 's not the only way , but it 's an important one .
talking can do no harm .
we are doing our best to hold bilateral talks with various partners , including muslim associations .
we are not always doing it publicly , because we are not interested in earning points for our diligence , but rather in establishing bridges of confidence to other people - despite the existing difficulties and differences .
after all , it 's not really organizations that are talking to other , but people .

this is a problem with christianity , judaism , islam and other religions .
we have to try to keep politics out of these areas as much as possible , but we should also not live in an ivory tower and believe that we could conduct this kind of dialogue without resorting to any political arguments .
politics is a part of this society , just as religion and other basic values are .
it 's for each individual to decide how much he wants to keep these separate from each other . i think that what we 're missing is a civilized way of debating our problems .
debating is good if it 's about finding a better solution for our problems and it 's bad if it 's about converting or trying to hurt somebody , which is what , unfortunately , happens all to often in our public discussions .
the result of this negative form of discussion is silence , the feeling of not being understood , of having to find a different way of expressing oneself , which often leads to violence .
and that 's exactly what we should avoid . anti-semitism can be very damaging to the integration process .
what can be done against it ? i 'm careful about such generalizations , but the fact is that anti-semitism is , for instance , on the rise in the muslim community in germany , and that it 's increasingly prone to violence .
we agree with the majority of muslim organizations that we need to do something about it together .
at the same time , and i say it openly , jews in germany and other countries are not immune to stereotypes , clichés and prejudices about muslims , perhaps not to the same extent and certainly not exhibiting the same willingness to violence .

dw-world.de spoke to stefan kramer , the council 's secretary general , during a recent berlin conference on " religion and integration . " dw-world : the term " integration " is one of the most widely used in politics right now .
how do you define the term ? integration means becoming a part of society and enjoying equal rights , without losing sight of or repudiating one 's own roots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan kramer it should n't be about set standards of what integration means - like whether one enjoys german cuisine or not .
i think there are much more important values that define a society , and which one must share and adjust to .
if we could get to the point that jews , muslims , christians and atheists are proud of being germans or of living in germany , then i would think that we have achieved our goals .
integration , however , is a two-way street , and it should not be a form of coercion . if integration is , as you say , a two-way street , what can the majority in society do to help the process ? integration of people from different religions or those socialized in a different cultural context always means the creation of a new society to some extent .
to expect or to believe that the majority of society should n't change , or that migrants or minorities have to subordinate themselves to the larger culture , is completely outdated and unrealistic . take a look at the united states , australia or canada - the traditional countries of immigrants .
they demonstrate that immigrants are not subordinated , but integrated .
the fact is , a culture changes when immigrants are integrated .
it changes in a positive way because people realize that it 's an enriching process , and that society grows from that process , despite all the challenges and difficulties that may come along the way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has long become a multicultural society i do n't want to disregard the fears which the so-called " germans " have regarding an influx of foreigners , other cultures or other religions .

the voter pushes the electronic chip of his identity card into a reader , calls up the special electoral web page on the internet , gives two pin codes and puts his cross beside one of the parties .
" this takes no longer than 15 seconds , " says tarvy martins . up until late on thursday evening last week , about 940,000 voters registered to vote in sunday 's internet election .
after a test run during the local elections in 2005 , the number of voters accepting the i-voting system has sky-rocketed . to ease the vote , the necessary card readers have been installed in all public places with internet connections in estonia and many private individuals have bought their own home reader so they can vote from the comfort of their own home . estonia miles ahead in internet coverage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the most remote areas are online the baltic state is one of the most internet-savvy countries in the european union due to a burst of technological development soon after its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .

" since the 1980s there has been the principle of the digital signature and asymmetrical encoding . "
he also believes that high encoding technology makes the security and implementation of online elections " fool-proof . " " the bigger challenge is communication , " remembers otten .

he was unable to specify their number . witnesses said numerous germans had played a major role in the street riots on friday night .
one person was injured by protestors throwing paving stones , setting cars on fire and putting up barricades . according to the ritzau news agency , german and danish authorities have increased border controls to prevent more violent protestors slipping into denmark en route to copenhagen out of solidarity with the danish protest . on saturday night , the violence was limited to scuffles between police and small groups of protesters who threw rocks and set fire to trash bins and barricades , but the unrest did not escalate into the full-scale riots of the two previous nights . " we are very happy that the situation was so quiet , " police spokesman lars borg said .
" the people who want to demonstrate have been more aware that the things they are doing are not the right things to do . " arrests continue despite quieter night bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police launched raids on gangs of protestors more than 30 people were arrested near the christiania hippie enclave after protesters built barricades on a major street and set them on fire in the early hours of the morning , police said . nearly 300 rioters were arrested earlier in copenhagen after police moved against an estimated 1,000 mainly teenagers , some hurling petrol bombs and stones .
police said a hard core wearing masks erected barriers and set fire to these and to cars , smashed shop windows and vandalized a school before melting away . a crowd also gathered outside city hall and prepared to march to the umgdomhuset , a building some two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- away , which has acquired a cult reputation over the last 25 years as a home to underground culture . its inhabitants were forcibly evicted on thursday , prompting two nights of violence after thursday 's dawn police raid .
the ungdomshuset has been a haven for rebels , punks and squatters since the 1980s when the city of copenhagen gave the groups permission to move into the youth centre . protestors head for youth center at heart of unrest bildunterschrift : the ungdomshuset was recently sold to the christian group fadershuset , which requested the eviction of the youths .
an august 2006 court ruling ordered the occupants to be evicted from the centre , which they insist belongs to them . the building has been a popular hang-out for copenhagen 's alternative society , serving as a venue for concerts , plays and debates .
big stars such as icelandic pop artist björk have performed at the venue . demonstrators carried banners saturday saying : " no to police violence , " and " keep the youth centre " while large numbers of police were on standby . line barfoed , spokesperson of the unity party , the former communist party , appealed to copenhagen 's mayor to seek " a political solution to the current crisis . "
she also called on police to " avoid any escalation of violence and not arrest citizens showing solidarity with young people . " supporters call for political solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violence and police operation has been costly " this entire affair is going to cost the authorities much more than it would have done if they had left this historic house with young people , " she also warned . rasmus willig , chair of the danish sociologists ' association , said it was irresponsible to take the community house away from the young people after it had served as a focal point for underground culture and a great attraction among visitors to denmark . in all , 643 people have been arrested , including 140 foreigners from other european nations and the united states , since the clashes started thursday .
they included 20 swedes , 20 norwegians and 25 germans , police said .

" a total of 288,906 voters had cast their votes by midday , making up 32.3 percent of all eligible voters , " the election commission said in a statement . in the last parliamentary elections , in 2003 - the year before estonia joined the eu - turnout at midday was 28.6 percent . since then , estonia 's economy has powered ahead , growing by 11.5 percent last year , and the baltic state has earned itself a reputation as a high-tech leader . " things are going fine in estonia , but people must come out and say who should govern next , " 31-year-old siim lepik told afp at a busy polling station in tallinn .
" those who do n't vote wo n't have the right to criticize the state of affairs in the next four years , " he said . sunday 's turnout figure included some 170,000 people who cast ballots in advance voting earlier this week , of which 30,275 voted from a home or office computer in the world 's first national e-vote . internet vote under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian pm ansip has no qualms about online voting the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said the internet vote was one of the issues its team of election observers would focus on . " we 're very keen to learn how estonia uses remote voting on the internet in parliamentary elections , because estonia is the first in the world to use it , " osce spokeswoman urdur gunnarsdottir said . " also , in all osce countries which have significant national minorities , we look at their situation , how they can exercise their rights , " she said . russian officials have repeatedly complained that estonia is violating the rights of the baltic state 's large ethnic-russian minority , the legacy of the policy of " russifying " the baltics carried out by the soviets during five decades of occupation . around seven percent of the 1.34 million people who live in estonia still hold russian passports , and a further nine percent have no formal nationality .
neither group if allowed to vote . russia watches as former soviet state leaves past behind tensions between estonia and its former ruler were ratcheted up further last month when the outgoing estonian parliament voted to move a world war ii monument to soviet red army soldiers , who chased the nazis out of the baltics , from its place of prominence in the center of tallinn . but the divisive issue of relations with russia was expected to have little impact on the election result . only two of the 11 parties jostling for a seat in parliament campaigned on an ethnic russian ticket , and analysts gave them long odds on getting into the single-chamber legislature . " they are too marginal and not seen as trustworthy , even by the russians , " political scientist toonis saarts of tallinn university said . polling stations are due to close at 8:00 pm cet , with preliminary results expected around midnight . incumbent coalition on course to retain power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edgar savisaar a survey by the emor polling agency published on the eve of sunday 's vote suggested that the two main partners in the ruling coalition - the center party of economy and communications minister edgar savisaar and prime minister andrus ansip 's reform party - would each garner 26 percent of the vote . if they do manage to get those scores , they would be the first sitting government to be returned to power , and would enjoy between them a comfortable majority in the 101-strong single-chamber parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de estonia 's e-lection voting begins with doubts over security the parliamentary elections in estonia could be considered a world premiere : the people of the baltic state are the first to vote for a new parliament via the internet .

he was unable to specify their number . witnesses said numerous germans had played a major role in the street riots on friday night .
one person was injured by protestors throwing paving stones , setting cars on fire and putting up barricades . according to the ritzau news agency , german and danish authorities have increased border controls to prevent more violent protestors slipping into denmark en route to copenhagen out of solidarity with the danish protest . on saturday night , the violence was limited to scuffles between police and small groups of protesters who threw rocks and set fire to trash bins and barricades , but the unrest did not escalate into the full-scale riots of the two previous nights . " we are very happy that the situation was so quiet , " police spokesman lars borg said .
" the people who want to demonstrate have been more aware that the things they are doing are not the right things to do . " arrests continue despite quieter night bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police launched raids on gangs of protestors more than 30 people were arrested near the christiania hippie enclave after protesters built barricades on a major street and set them on fire in the early hours of the morning , police said . nearly 300 rioters were arrested earlier in copenhagen after police moved against an estimated 1,000 mainly teenagers , some hurling petrol bombs and stones .
police said a hard core wearing masks erected barriers and set fire to these and to cars , smashed shop windows and vandalized a school before melting away . a crowd also gathered outside city hall and prepared to march to the umgdomhuset , a building some two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- away , which has acquired a cult reputation over the last 25 years as a home to underground culture . its inhabitants were forcibly evicted on thursday , prompting two nights of violence after thursday 's dawn police raid .
the ungdomshuset has been a haven for rebels , punks and squatters since the 1980s when the city of copenhagen gave the groups permission to move into the youth centre . protestors head for youth center at heart of unrest bildunterschrift : the ungdomshuset was recently sold to the christian group fadershuset , which requested the eviction of the youths .
an august 2006 court ruling ordered the occupants to be evicted from the centre , which they insist belongs to them . the building has been a popular hang-out for copenhagen 's alternative society , serving as a venue for concerts , plays and debates .
big stars such as icelandic pop artist björk have performed at the venue . demonstrators carried banners saturday saying : " no to police violence , " and " keep the youth centre " while large numbers of police were on standby . line barfoed , spokesperson of the unity party , the former communist party , appealed to copenhagen 's mayor to seek " a political solution to the current crisis . "
she also called on police to " avoid any escalation of violence and not arrest citizens showing solidarity with young people . " supporters call for political solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violence and police operation has been costly " this entire affair is going to cost the authorities much more than it would have done if they had left this historic house with young people , " she also warned . rasmus willig , chair of the danish sociologists ' association , said it was irresponsible to take the community house away from the young people after it had served as a focal point for underground culture and a great attraction among visitors to denmark . in all , 643 people have been arrested , including 140 foreigners from other european nations and the united states , since the clashes started thursday .
they included 20 swedes , 20 norwegians and 25 germans , police said .

however , critics of the system fear security gaps . according to one of the project managers behind the i-voting system , the procedure is quick and easy .
the voter pushes the electronic chip of his identity card into a reader , calls up the special electoral web page on the internet , gives two pin codes and puts his cross beside one of the parties .
" this takes no longer than 15 seconds , " says tarvy martins . up until late on thursday evening last week , about 940,000 voters registered to vote in sunday 's internet election .
after a test run during the local elections in 2005 , the number of voters accepting the i-voting system has sky-rocketed . to ease the vote , the necessary card readers have been installed in all public places with internet connections in estonia and many private individuals have bought their own home reader so they can vote from the comfort of their own home . estonia miles ahead in internet coverage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the most remote areas are online the baltic state is one of the most internet-savvy countries in the european union due to a burst of technological development soon after its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
even in the most remote areas of the country , one can use wireless technology to surf .
the pin numbers used for the i-voting system have also been adapted to make shopping , tax returns and all administrative processes possible and secure online . even the country 's administration has embraced the technology and has moved towards e-government , thus increasing political communication and information via the internet . it is no surprise , therefore , that the estonians will become the first nation worldwide to choose their government online . electoral monitoring body skeptical over security however , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , the body which observes all elections in europe , views the on-line development , with skepticism , with many officials doubting the level of protection and security of information .
but tarvy martins is convinced that the procedure is fool-proof .
" this is like a double envelope .
the choice is encoded and then sealed .
it is quite difficult to cheat . " the biggest technical challenge of the i-voting system is the authorization and identification of the user as an entitled voter , while making sure that the vote remains anonymous . " technically , this is not a big problem , " explains dieter otten , a member of the german federal ministry of economy and technology 's research group into electronic voting .
" since the 1980s there has been the principle of the digital signature and asymmetrical encoding . "
he also believes that high encoding technology makes the security and implementation of online elections " fool-proof . " " the bigger challenge is communication , " remembers otten .
it has been more difficult to persuade lawyers and politicians of the security of online voting than to design a functioning system .
the people who have to decide on whether to use the system , otten says , are dealing with something they do n't fully understand . internet-doubters holding back german progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is behind estonia in terms of election technology those with doubts and power in germany prevented the last election in 2005 from being an e-lection and it remains increasingly unlikely that a change in opinion will take place in the near future . " i-voting , for judicial and technical reasons , does not do justice to the special requirements of political elections in germany at the moment , " says annette ziesig of the ministry of internal affairs . dieter otten accuses germany of being obsessed with security to the point that the measures brought in to protect the traditional voting process can be more expensive than developing i-voting to fit the needs of the german electoral system .
he believes , in time , germany will follow the estonians into a new age of voting . back in estonia , i-voting is becoming the norm .
the system was already in place for the 2005 local elections , and last week the dress rehearsal took place for the parliamentary elections .
in a surreal test of the system , an elk , a deer and a wild boar went head to head for the title of " king of the wood . "
because the animal vote was just a test , only those creatures involved know who finally came out with the woodland crown . coalition partners out in front in forecasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king of the wood ?
prime minister andrus ansip no such mystery will surround the result of sunday 's human poll with surveys already putting the biggest partners in the government coalition - the reform party and the center party - out in front .
despite forecasts to the contrary , the vote could be far from a shoo-in for the incumbent prime minister andrus ansip 's reform party . whatever the result , estonia will have taken a big step in leading the rest of europe - and the world - towards a new process of electoral voting . ina rottscheidt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de estonia prepares to go to the polls in first e-lection almost one million estonians go to the polls this sunday to elect a new parliament .

dw-world.de spoke to stefan kramer , the council 's secretary general , during a recent berlin conference on " religion and integration . " dw-world : the term " integration " is one of the most widely used in politics right now .
how do you define the term ? integration means becoming a part of society and enjoying equal rights , without losing sight of or repudiating one 's own roots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan kramer it should n't be about set standards of what integration means - like whether one enjoys german cuisine or not .
i think there are much more important values that define a society , and which one must share and adjust to .
if we could get to the point that jews , muslims , christians and atheists are proud of being germans or of living in germany , then i would think that we have achieved our goals .
integration , however , is a two-way street , and it should not be a form of coercion . if integration is , as you say , a two-way street , what can the majority in society do to help the process ? integration of people from different religions or those socialized in a different cultural context always means the creation of a new society to some extent .
to expect or to believe that the majority of society should n't change , or that migrants or minorities have to subordinate themselves to the larger culture , is completely outdated and unrealistic . take a look at the united states , australia or canada - the traditional countries of immigrants .
they demonstrate that immigrants are not subordinated , but integrated .
the fact is , a culture changes when immigrants are integrated .
it changes in a positive way because people realize that it 's an enriching process , and that society grows from that process , despite all the challenges and difficulties that may come along the way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has long become a multicultural society i do n't want to disregard the fears which the so-called " germans " have regarding an influx of foreigners , other cultures or other religions .
people can only respect other people 's values or those of other faiths when they have a good sense of their own .
i have a feeling that many people in various facets of german society have no sense of their personal values or beliefs and that is why they are intolerant of others or fear foreigners who come here .
that 's why we have to take a good , hard look at ourselves and work on our own principles and values before we can tell other people how they have to behave and fulfill our expectations . in your speech , you said that a dialogue between religions is the only rational way of approaching the clash between religions . how committed are jews to that process ? it 's not the only way , but it 's an important one .
talking can do no harm .
we are doing our best to hold bilateral talks with various partners , including muslim associations .
we are not always doing it publicly , because we are not interested in earning points for our diligence , but rather in establishing bridges of confidence to other people - despite the existing difficulties and differences .
after all , it 's not really organizations that are talking to other , but people .
small , but important steps are made in this direction all the time . a great deal of problems arise when religion is mixed up with politics .
how can this be avoided ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitic message appeared recently on the walls of a jewish school and kindergarten in berlin when religion is abused by politics , that 's always bad , regardless of what religion we 're talking about .
this is a problem with christianity , judaism , islam and other religions .
we have to try to keep politics out of these areas as much as possible , but we should also not live in an ivory tower and believe that we could conduct this kind of dialogue without resorting to any political arguments .
politics is a part of this society , just as religion and other basic values are .
it 's for each individual to decide how much he wants to keep these separate from each other . i think that what we 're missing is a civilized way of debating our problems .
debating is good if it 's about finding a better solution for our problems and it 's bad if it 's about converting or trying to hurt somebody , which is what , unfortunately , happens all to often in our public discussions .
the result of this negative form of discussion is silence , the feeling of not being understood , of having to find a different way of expressing oneself , which often leads to violence .
and that 's exactly what we should avoid . anti-semitism can be very damaging to the integration process .
what can be done against it ? i 'm careful about such generalizations , but the fact is that anti-semitism is , for instance , on the rise in the muslim community in germany , and that it 's increasingly prone to violence .
we agree with the majority of muslim organizations that we need to do something about it together .
at the same time , and i say it openly , jews in germany and other countries are not immune to stereotypes , clichés and prejudices about muslims , perhaps not to the same extent and certainly not exhibiting the same willingness to violence .
but there are things on both sides where we still have homework to do .
we 're working on finding possible solutions .
i 'm not saying that all this is easy and working out wonderfully , but it is important that we are talking and that we 're aware of the crisis . aladdin sarhan interviewed stefan kramer -lrb- als / tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's jews say nursery attack shows anti-semitism still alive the leader of berlin 's jewish community said on thursday that an attack on a jewish nursery school which was daubed with swastikas showed anti-semitism was still a threat .

however , critics of the system fear security gaps . according to one of the project managers behind the i-voting system , the procedure is quick and easy .
the voter pushes the electronic chip of his identity card into a reader , calls up the special electoral web page on the internet , gives two pin codes and puts his cross beside one of the parties .
" this takes no longer than 15 seconds , " says tarvy martins . up until late on thursday evening last week , about 940,000 voters registered to vote in sunday 's internet election .
after a test run during the local elections in 2005 , the number of voters accepting the i-voting system has sky-rocketed . to ease the vote , the necessary card readers have been installed in all public places with internet connections in estonia and many private individuals have bought their own home reader so they can vote from the comfort of their own home . estonia miles ahead in internet coverage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the most remote areas are online the baltic state is one of the most internet-savvy countries in the european union due to a burst of technological development soon after its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
even in the most remote areas of the country , one can use wireless technology to surf .
the pin numbers used for the i-voting system have also been adapted to make shopping , tax returns and all administrative processes possible and secure online . even the country 's administration has embraced the technology and has moved towards e-government , thus increasing political communication and information via the internet . it is no surprise , therefore , that the estonians will become the first nation worldwide to choose their government online . electoral monitoring body skeptical over security however , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , the body which observes all elections in europe , views the on-line development , with skepticism , with many officials doubting the level of protection and security of information .
but tarvy martins is convinced that the procedure is fool-proof .
" this is like a double envelope .
the choice is encoded and then sealed .
it is quite difficult to cheat . " the biggest technical challenge of the i-voting system is the authorization and identification of the user as an entitled voter , while making sure that the vote remains anonymous . " technically , this is not a big problem , " explains dieter otten , a member of the german federal ministry of economy and technology 's research group into electronic voting .
" since the 1980s there has been the principle of the digital signature and asymmetrical encoding . "
he also believes that high encoding technology makes the security and implementation of online elections " fool-proof . " " the bigger challenge is communication , " remembers otten .
it has been more difficult to persuade lawyers and politicians of the security of online voting than to design a functioning system .
the people who have to decide on whether to use the system , otten says , are dealing with something they do n't fully understand . internet-doubters holding back german progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is behind estonia in terms of election technology those with doubts and power in germany prevented the last election in 2005 from being an e-lection and it remains increasingly unlikely that a change in opinion will take place in the near future . " i-voting , for judicial and technical reasons , does not do justice to the special requirements of political elections in germany at the moment , " says annette ziesig of the ministry of internal affairs . dieter otten accuses germany of being obsessed with security to the point that the measures brought in to protect the traditional voting process can be more expensive than developing i-voting to fit the needs of the german electoral system .
he believes , in time , germany will follow the estonians into a new age of voting . back in estonia , i-voting is becoming the norm .
the system was already in place for the 2005 local elections , and last week the dress rehearsal took place for the parliamentary elections .
in a surreal test of the system , an elk , a deer and a wild boar went head to head for the title of " king of the wood . "
because the animal vote was just a test , only those creatures involved know who finally came out with the woodland crown . coalition partners out in front in forecasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king of the wood ?
prime minister andrus ansip no such mystery will surround the result of sunday 's human poll with surveys already putting the biggest partners in the government coalition - the reform party and the center party - out in front .
despite forecasts to the contrary , the vote could be far from a shoo-in for the incumbent prime minister andrus ansip 's reform party . whatever the result , estonia will have taken a big step in leading the rest of europe - and the world - towards a new process of electoral voting . ina rottscheidt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de estonia prepares to go to the polls in first e-lection almost one million estonians go to the polls this sunday to elect a new parliament .

dw-world.de spoke to stefan kramer , the council 's secretary general , during a recent berlin conference on " religion and integration . " dw-world : the term " integration " is one of the most widely used in politics right now .
how do you define the term ? integration means becoming a part of society and enjoying equal rights , without losing sight of or repudiating one 's own roots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan kramer it should n't be about set standards of what integration means - like whether one enjoys german cuisine or not .
i think there are much more important values that define a society , and which one must share and adjust to .
if we could get to the point that jews , muslims , christians and atheists are proud of being germans or of living in germany , then i would think that we have achieved our goals .
integration , however , is a two-way street , and it should not be a form of coercion . if integration is , as you say , a two-way street , what can the majority in society do to help the process ? integration of people from different religions or those socialized in a different cultural context always means the creation of a new society to some extent .
to expect or to believe that the majority of society should n't change , or that migrants or minorities have to subordinate themselves to the larger culture , is completely outdated and unrealistic . take a look at the united states , australia or canada - the traditional countries of immigrants .
they demonstrate that immigrants are not subordinated , but integrated .
the fact is , a culture changes when immigrants are integrated .
it changes in a positive way because people realize that it 's an enriching process , and that society grows from that process , despite all the challenges and difficulties that may come along the way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has long become a multicultural society i do n't want to disregard the fears which the so-called " germans " have regarding an influx of foreigners , other cultures or other religions .
people can only respect other people 's values or those of other faiths when they have a good sense of their own .
i have a feeling that many people in various facets of german society have no sense of their personal values or beliefs and that is why they are intolerant of others or fear foreigners who come here .
that 's why we have to take a good , hard look at ourselves and work on our own principles and values before we can tell other people how they have to behave and fulfill our expectations . in your speech , you said that a dialogue between religions is the only rational way of approaching the clash between religions . how committed are jews to that process ? it 's not the only way , but it 's an important one .
talking can do no harm .
we are doing our best to hold bilateral talks with various partners , including muslim associations .
we are not always doing it publicly , because we are not interested in earning points for our diligence , but rather in establishing bridges of confidence to other people - despite the existing difficulties and differences .
after all , it 's not really organizations that are talking to other , but people .
small , but important steps are made in this direction all the time . a great deal of problems arise when religion is mixed up with politics .
how can this be avoided ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitic message appeared recently on the walls of a jewish school and kindergarten in berlin when religion is abused by politics , that 's always bad , regardless of what religion we 're talking about .
this is a problem with christianity , judaism , islam and other religions .
we have to try to keep politics out of these areas as much as possible , but we should also not live in an ivory tower and believe that we could conduct this kind of dialogue without resorting to any political arguments .
politics is a part of this society , just as religion and other basic values are .
it 's for each individual to decide how much he wants to keep these separate from each other . i think that what we 're missing is a civilized way of debating our problems .
debating is good if it 's about finding a better solution for our problems and it 's bad if it 's about converting or trying to hurt somebody , which is what , unfortunately , happens all to often in our public discussions .
the result of this negative form of discussion is silence , the feeling of not being understood , of having to find a different way of expressing oneself , which often leads to violence .
and that 's exactly what we should avoid . anti-semitism can be very damaging to the integration process .
what can be done against it ? i 'm careful about such generalizations , but the fact is that anti-semitism is , for instance , on the rise in the muslim community in germany , and that it 's increasingly prone to violence .
we agree with the majority of muslim organizations that we need to do something about it together .
at the same time , and i say it openly , jews in germany and other countries are not immune to stereotypes , clichés and prejudices about muslims , perhaps not to the same extent and certainly not exhibiting the same willingness to violence .
but there are things on both sides where we still have homework to do .
we 're working on finding possible solutions .

" a total of 288,906 voters had cast their votes by midday , making up 32.3 percent of all eligible voters , " the election commission said in a statement . in the last parliamentary elections , in 2003 - the year before estonia joined the eu - turnout at midday was 28.6 percent . since then , estonia 's economy has powered ahead , growing by 11.5 percent last year , and the baltic state has earned itself a reputation as a high-tech leader . " things are going fine in estonia , but people must come out and say who should govern next , " 31-year-old siim lepik told afp at a busy polling station in tallinn .
" those who do n't vote wo n't have the right to criticize the state of affairs in the next four years , " he said . sunday 's turnout figure included some 170,000 people who cast ballots in advance voting earlier this week , of which 30,275 voted from a home or office computer in the world 's first national e-vote . internet vote under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian pm ansip has no qualms about online voting the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said the internet vote was one of the issues its team of election observers would focus on . " we 're very keen to learn how estonia uses remote voting on the internet in parliamentary elections , because estonia is the first in the world to use it , " osce spokeswoman urdur gunnarsdottir said . " also , in all osce countries which have significant national minorities , we look at their situation , how they can exercise their rights , " she said . russian officials have repeatedly complained that estonia is violating the rights of the baltic state 's large ethnic-russian minority , the legacy of the policy of " russifying " the baltics carried out by the soviets during five decades of occupation . around seven percent of the 1.34 million people who live in estonia still hold russian passports , and a further nine percent have no formal nationality .
neither group if allowed to vote . russia watches as former soviet state leaves past behind tensions between estonia and its former ruler were ratcheted up further last month when the outgoing estonian parliament voted to move a world war ii monument to soviet red army soldiers , who chased the nazis out of the baltics , from its place of prominence in the center of tallinn . but the divisive issue of relations with russia was expected to have little impact on the election result . only two of the 11 parties jostling for a seat in parliament campaigned on an ethnic russian ticket , and analysts gave them long odds on getting into the single-chamber legislature . " they are too marginal and not seen as trustworthy , even by the russians , " political scientist toonis saarts of tallinn university said . polling stations are due to close at 8:00 pm cet , with preliminary results expected around midnight . incumbent coalition on course to retain power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edgar savisaar a survey by the emor polling agency published on the eve of sunday 's vote suggested that the two main partners in the ruling coalition - the center party of economy and communications minister edgar savisaar and prime minister andrus ansip 's reform party - would each garner 26 percent of the vote . if they do manage to get those scores , they would be the first sitting government to be returned to power , and would enjoy between them a comfortable majority in the 101-strong single-chamber parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de estonia 's e-lection voting begins with doubts over security the parliamentary elections in estonia could be considered a world premiere : the people of the baltic state are the first to vote for a new parliament via the internet .

dw-world.de spoke to stefan kramer , the council 's secretary general , during a recent berlin conference on " religion and integration . " dw-world : the term " integration " is one of the most widely used in politics right now .
how do you define the term ? integration means becoming a part of society and enjoying equal rights , without losing sight of or repudiating one 's own roots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan kramer it should n't be about set standards of what integration means - like whether one enjoys german cuisine or not .
i think there are much more important values that define a society , and which one must share and adjust to .
if we could get to the point that jews , muslims , christians and atheists are proud of being germans or of living in germany , then i would think that we have achieved our goals .
integration , however , is a two-way street , and it should not be a form of coercion . if integration is , as you say , a two-way street , what can the majority in society do to help the process ? integration of people from different religions or those socialized in a different cultural context always means the creation of a new society to some extent .
to expect or to believe that the majority of society should n't change , or that migrants or minorities have to subordinate themselves to the larger culture , is completely outdated and unrealistic . take a look at the united states , australia or canada - the traditional countries of immigrants .
they demonstrate that immigrants are not subordinated , but integrated .
the fact is , a culture changes when immigrants are integrated .
it changes in a positive way because people realize that it 's an enriching process , and that society grows from that process , despite all the challenges and difficulties that may come along the way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has long become a multicultural society i do n't want to disregard the fears which the so-called " germans " have regarding an influx of foreigners , other cultures or other religions .
people can only respect other people 's values or those of other faiths when they have a good sense of their own .
i have a feeling that many people in various facets of german society have no sense of their personal values or beliefs and that is why they are intolerant of others or fear foreigners who come here .
that 's why we have to take a good , hard look at ourselves and work on our own principles and values before we can tell other people how they have to behave and fulfill our expectations . in your speech , you said that a dialogue between religions is the only rational way of approaching the clash between religions . how committed are jews to that process ? it 's not the only way , but it 's an important one .
talking can do no harm .
we are doing our best to hold bilateral talks with various partners , including muslim associations .
we are not always doing it publicly , because we are not interested in earning points for our diligence , but rather in establishing bridges of confidence to other people - despite the existing difficulties and differences .
after all , it 's not really organizations that are talking to other , but people .
small , but important steps are made in this direction all the time . a great deal of problems arise when religion is mixed up with politics .
how can this be avoided ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitic message appeared recently on the walls of a jewish school and kindergarten in berlin when religion is abused by politics , that 's always bad , regardless of what religion we 're talking about .
this is a problem with christianity , judaism , islam and other religions .
we have to try to keep politics out of these areas as much as possible , but we should also not live in an ivory tower and believe that we could conduct this kind of dialogue without resorting to any political arguments .
politics is a part of this society , just as religion and other basic values are .
it 's for each individual to decide how much he wants to keep these separate from each other . i think that what we 're missing is a civilized way of debating our problems .
debating is good if it 's about finding a better solution for our problems and it 's bad if it 's about converting or trying to hurt somebody , which is what , unfortunately , happens all to often in our public discussions .
the result of this negative form of discussion is silence , the feeling of not being understood , of having to find a different way of expressing oneself , which often leads to violence .
and that 's exactly what we should avoid . anti-semitism can be very damaging to the integration process .
what can be done against it ? i 'm careful about such generalizations , but the fact is that anti-semitism is , for instance , on the rise in the muslim community in germany , and that it 's increasingly prone to violence .
we agree with the majority of muslim organizations that we need to do something about it together .
at the same time , and i say it openly , jews in germany and other countries are not immune to stereotypes , clichés and prejudices about muslims , perhaps not to the same extent and certainly not exhibiting the same willingness to violence .
but there are things on both sides where we still have homework to do .
we 're working on finding possible solutions .
i 'm not saying that all this is easy and working out wonderfully , but it is important that we are talking and that we 're aware of the crisis . aladdin sarhan interviewed stefan kramer -lrb- als / tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's jews say nursery attack shows anti-semitism still alive the leader of berlin 's jewish community said on thursday that an attack on a jewish nursery school which was daubed with swastikas showed anti-semitism was still a threat .

dw-world.de spoke to stefan kramer , the council 's secretary general , during a recent berlin conference on " religion and integration . " dw-world : the term " integration " is one of the most widely used in politics right now .
how do you define the term ? integration means becoming a part of society and enjoying equal rights , without losing sight of or repudiating one 's own roots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan kramer it should n't be about set standards of what integration means - like whether one enjoys german cuisine or not .
i think there are much more important values that define a society , and which one must share and adjust to .
if we could get to the point that jews , muslims , christians and atheists are proud of being germans or of living in germany , then i would think that we have achieved our goals .
integration , however , is a two-way street , and it should not be a form of coercion . if integration is , as you say , a two-way street , what can the majority in society do to help the process ? integration of people from different religions or those socialized in a different cultural context always means the creation of a new society to some extent .
to expect or to believe that the majority of society should n't change , or that migrants or minorities have to subordinate themselves to the larger culture , is completely outdated and unrealistic . take a look at the united states , australia or canada - the traditional countries of immigrants .
they demonstrate that immigrants are not subordinated , but integrated .
the fact is , a culture changes when immigrants are integrated .
it changes in a positive way because people realize that it 's an enriching process , and that society grows from that process , despite all the challenges and difficulties that may come along the way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has long become a multicultural society i do n't want to disregard the fears which the so-called " germans " have regarding an influx of foreigners , other cultures or other religions .
people can only respect other people 's values or those of other faiths when they have a good sense of their own .
i have a feeling that many people in various facets of german society have no sense of their personal values or beliefs and that is why they are intolerant of others or fear foreigners who come here .
that 's why we have to take a good , hard look at ourselves and work on our own principles and values before we can tell other people how they have to behave and fulfill our expectations . in your speech , you said that a dialogue between religions is the only rational way of approaching the clash between religions . how committed are jews to that process ? it 's not the only way , but it 's an important one .
talking can do no harm .
we are doing our best to hold bilateral talks with various partners , including muslim associations .
we are not always doing it publicly , because we are not interested in earning points for our diligence , but rather in establishing bridges of confidence to other people - despite the existing difficulties and differences .
after all , it 's not really organizations that are talking to other , but people .
small , but important steps are made in this direction all the time . a great deal of problems arise when religion is mixed up with politics .
how can this be avoided ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitic message appeared recently on the walls of a jewish school and kindergarten in berlin when religion is abused by politics , that 's always bad , regardless of what religion we 're talking about .
this is a problem with christianity , judaism , islam and other religions .
we have to try to keep politics out of these areas as much as possible , but we should also not live in an ivory tower and believe that we could conduct this kind of dialogue without resorting to any political arguments .
politics is a part of this society , just as religion and other basic values are .
it 's for each individual to decide how much he wants to keep these separate from each other . i think that what we 're missing is a civilized way of debating our problems .
debating is good if it 's about finding a better solution for our problems and it 's bad if it 's about converting or trying to hurt somebody , which is what , unfortunately , happens all to often in our public discussions .
the result of this negative form of discussion is silence , the feeling of not being understood , of having to find a different way of expressing oneself , which often leads to violence .
and that 's exactly what we should avoid . anti-semitism can be very damaging to the integration process .
what can be done against it ? i 'm careful about such generalizations , but the fact is that anti-semitism is , for instance , on the rise in the muslim community in germany , and that it 's increasingly prone to violence .
we agree with the majority of muslim organizations that we need to do something about it together .
at the same time , and i say it openly , jews in germany and other countries are not immune to stereotypes , clichés and prejudices about muslims , perhaps not to the same extent and certainly not exhibiting the same willingness to violence .
but there are things on both sides where we still have homework to do .
we 're working on finding possible solutions .
i 'm not saying that all this is easy and working out wonderfully , but it is important that we are talking and that we 're aware of the crisis . aladdin sarhan interviewed stefan kramer -lrb- als / tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's jews say nursery attack shows anti-semitism still alive the leader of berlin 's jewish community said on thursday that an attack on a jewish nursery school which was daubed with swastikas showed anti-semitism was still a threat .

he was unable to specify their number . witnesses said numerous germans had played a major role in the street riots on friday night .
one person was injured by protestors throwing paving stones , setting cars on fire and putting up barricades . according to the ritzau news agency , german and danish authorities have increased border controls to prevent more violent protestors slipping into denmark en route to copenhagen out of solidarity with the danish protest . on saturday night , the violence was limited to scuffles between police and small groups of protesters who threw rocks and set fire to trash bins and barricades , but the unrest did not escalate into the full-scale riots of the two previous nights . " we are very happy that the situation was so quiet , " police spokesman lars borg said .
" the people who want to demonstrate have been more aware that the things they are doing are not the right things to do . " arrests continue despite quieter night bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police launched raids on gangs of protestors more than 30 people were arrested near the christiania hippie enclave after protesters built barricades on a major street and set them on fire in the early hours of the morning , police said . nearly 300 rioters were arrested earlier in copenhagen after police moved against an estimated 1,000 mainly teenagers , some hurling petrol bombs and stones .
police said a hard core wearing masks erected barriers and set fire to these and to cars , smashed shop windows and vandalized a school before melting away . a crowd also gathered outside city hall and prepared to march to the umgdomhuset , a building some two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- away , which has acquired a cult reputation over the last 25 years as a home to underground culture . its inhabitants were forcibly evicted on thursday , prompting two nights of violence after thursday 's dawn police raid .
the ungdomshuset has been a haven for rebels , punks and squatters since the 1980s when the city of copenhagen gave the groups permission to move into the youth centre . protestors head for youth center at heart of unrest bildunterschrift : the ungdomshuset was recently sold to the christian group fadershuset , which requested the eviction of the youths .
an august 2006 court ruling ordered the occupants to be evicted from the centre , which they insist belongs to them . the building has been a popular hang-out for copenhagen 's alternative society , serving as a venue for concerts , plays and debates .
big stars such as icelandic pop artist björk have performed at the venue . demonstrators carried banners saturday saying : " no to police violence , " and " keep the youth centre " while large numbers of police were on standby . line barfoed , spokesperson of the unity party , the former communist party , appealed to copenhagen 's mayor to seek " a political solution to the current crisis . "
she also called on police to " avoid any escalation of violence and not arrest citizens showing solidarity with young people . " supporters call for political solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violence and police operation has been costly " this entire affair is going to cost the authorities much more than it would have done if they had left this historic house with young people , " she also warned . rasmus willig , chair of the danish sociologists ' association , said it was irresponsible to take the community house away from the young people after it had served as a focal point for underground culture and a great attraction among visitors to denmark . in all , 643 people have been arrested , including 140 foreigners from other european nations and the united states , since the clashes started thursday .
they included 20 swedes , 20 norwegians and 25 germans , police said .

" a total of 288,906 voters had cast their votes by midday , making up 32.3 percent of all eligible voters , " the election commission said in a statement . in the last parliamentary elections , in 2003 - the year before estonia joined the eu - turnout at midday was 28.6 percent . since then , estonia 's economy has powered ahead , growing by 11.5 percent last year , and the baltic state has earned itself a reputation as a high-tech leader . " things are going fine in estonia , but people must come out and say who should govern next , " 31-year-old siim lepik told afp at a busy polling station in tallinn .
" those who do n't vote wo n't have the right to criticize the state of affairs in the next four years , " he said . sunday 's turnout figure included some 170,000 people who cast ballots in advance voting earlier this week , of which 30,275 voted from a home or office computer in the world 's first national e-vote . internet vote under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian pm ansip has no qualms about online voting the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said the internet vote was one of the issues its team of election observers would focus on . " we 're very keen to learn how estonia uses remote voting on the internet in parliamentary elections , because estonia is the first in the world to use it , " osce spokeswoman urdur gunnarsdottir said . " also , in all osce countries which have significant national minorities , we look at their situation , how they can exercise their rights , " she said . russian officials have repeatedly complained that estonia is violating the rights of the baltic state 's large ethnic-russian minority , the legacy of the policy of " russifying " the baltics carried out by the soviets during five decades of occupation . around seven percent of the 1.34 million people who live in estonia still hold russian passports , and a further nine percent have no formal nationality .
neither group if allowed to vote . russia watches as former soviet state leaves past behind tensions between estonia and its former ruler were ratcheted up further last month when the outgoing estonian parliament voted to move a world war ii monument to soviet red army soldiers , who chased the nazis out of the baltics , from its place of prominence in the center of tallinn . but the divisive issue of relations with russia was expected to have little impact on the election result . only two of the 11 parties jostling for a seat in parliament campaigned on an ethnic russian ticket , and analysts gave them long odds on getting into the single-chamber legislature . " they are too marginal and not seen as trustworthy , even by the russians , " political scientist toonis saarts of tallinn university said . polling stations are due to close at 8:00 pm cet , with preliminary results expected around midnight . incumbent coalition on course to retain power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edgar savisaar a survey by the emor polling agency published on the eve of sunday 's vote suggested that the two main partners in the ruling coalition - the center party of economy and communications minister edgar savisaar and prime minister andrus ansip 's reform party - would each garner 26 percent of the vote . if they do manage to get those scores , they would be the first sitting government to be returned to power , and would enjoy between them a comfortable majority in the 101-strong single-chamber parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de estonia 's e-lection voting begins with doubts over security the parliamentary elections in estonia could be considered a world premiere : the people of the baltic state are the first to vote for a new parliament via the internet .

dw-world.de spoke to stefan kramer , the council 's secretary general , during a recent berlin conference on " religion and integration . " dw-world : the term " integration " is one of the most widely used in politics right now .
how do you define the term ? integration means becoming a part of society and enjoying equal rights , without losing sight of or repudiating one 's own roots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan kramer it should n't be about set standards of what integration means - like whether one enjoys german cuisine or not .
i think there are much more important values that define a society , and which one must share and adjust to .
if we could get to the point that jews , muslims , christians and atheists are proud of being germans or of living in germany , then i would think that we have achieved our goals .
integration , however , is a two-way street , and it should not be a form of coercion . if integration is , as you say , a two-way street , what can the majority in society do to help the process ? integration of people from different religions or those socialized in a different cultural context always means the creation of a new society to some extent .
to expect or to believe that the majority of society should n't change , or that migrants or minorities have to subordinate themselves to the larger culture , is completely outdated and unrealistic . take a look at the united states , australia or canada - the traditional countries of immigrants .
they demonstrate that immigrants are not subordinated , but integrated .
the fact is , a culture changes when immigrants are integrated .
it changes in a positive way because people realize that it 's an enriching process , and that society grows from that process , despite all the challenges and difficulties that may come along the way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has long become a multicultural society i do n't want to disregard the fears which the so-called " germans " have regarding an influx of foreigners , other cultures or other religions .
people can only respect other people 's values or those of other faiths when they have a good sense of their own .
i have a feeling that many people in various facets of german society have no sense of their personal values or beliefs and that is why they are intolerant of others or fear foreigners who come here .
that 's why we have to take a good , hard look at ourselves and work on our own principles and values before we can tell other people how they have to behave and fulfill our expectations . in your speech , you said that a dialogue between religions is the only rational way of approaching the clash between religions . how committed are jews to that process ? it 's not the only way , but it 's an important one .
talking can do no harm .
we are doing our best to hold bilateral talks with various partners , including muslim associations .
we are not always doing it publicly , because we are not interested in earning points for our diligence , but rather in establishing bridges of confidence to other people - despite the existing difficulties and differences .
after all , it 's not really organizations that are talking to other , but people .
small , but important steps are made in this direction all the time . a great deal of problems arise when religion is mixed up with politics .
how can this be avoided ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitic message appeared recently on the walls of a jewish school and kindergarten in berlin when religion is abused by politics , that 's always bad , regardless of what religion we 're talking about .
this is a problem with christianity , judaism , islam and other religions .
we have to try to keep politics out of these areas as much as possible , but we should also not live in an ivory tower and believe that we could conduct this kind of dialogue without resorting to any political arguments .
politics is a part of this society , just as religion and other basic values are .
it 's for each individual to decide how much he wants to keep these separate from each other . i think that what we 're missing is a civilized way of debating our problems .
debating is good if it 's about finding a better solution for our problems and it 's bad if it 's about converting or trying to hurt somebody , which is what , unfortunately , happens all to often in our public discussions .
the result of this negative form of discussion is silence , the feeling of not being understood , of having to find a different way of expressing oneself , which often leads to violence .
and that 's exactly what we should avoid . anti-semitism can be very damaging to the integration process .
what can be done against it ? i 'm careful about such generalizations , but the fact is that anti-semitism is , for instance , on the rise in the muslim community in germany , and that it 's increasingly prone to violence .
we agree with the majority of muslim organizations that we need to do something about it together .
at the same time , and i say it openly , jews in germany and other countries are not immune to stereotypes , clichés and prejudices about muslims , perhaps not to the same extent and certainly not exhibiting the same willingness to violence .
but there are things on both sides where we still have homework to do .

dw-world.de spoke to stefan kramer , the council 's secretary general , during a recent berlin conference on " religion and integration . " dw-world : the term " integration " is one of the most widely used in politics right now .
how do you define the term ? integration means becoming a part of society and enjoying equal rights , without losing sight of or repudiating one 's own roots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan kramer it should n't be about set standards of what integration means - like whether one enjoys german cuisine or not .
i think there are much more important values that define a society , and which one must share and adjust to .
if we could get to the point that jews , muslims , christians and atheists are proud of being germans or of living in germany , then i would think that we have achieved our goals .
integration , however , is a two-way street , and it should not be a form of coercion . if integration is , as you say , a two-way street , what can the majority in society do to help the process ? integration of people from different religions or those socialized in a different cultural context always means the creation of a new society to some extent .
to expect or to believe that the majority of society should n't change , or that migrants or minorities have to subordinate themselves to the larger culture , is completely outdated and unrealistic . take a look at the united states , australia or canada - the traditional countries of immigrants .
they demonstrate that immigrants are not subordinated , but integrated .
the fact is , a culture changes when immigrants are integrated .
it changes in a positive way because people realize that it 's an enriching process , and that society grows from that process , despite all the challenges and difficulties that may come along the way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has long become a multicultural society i do n't want to disregard the fears which the so-called " germans " have regarding an influx of foreigners , other cultures or other religions .
people can only respect other people 's values or those of other faiths when they have a good sense of their own .
i have a feeling that many people in various facets of german society have no sense of their personal values or beliefs and that is why they are intolerant of others or fear foreigners who come here .
that 's why we have to take a good , hard look at ourselves and work on our own principles and values before we can tell other people how they have to behave and fulfill our expectations . in your speech , you said that a dialogue between religions is the only rational way of approaching the clash between religions . how committed are jews to that process ? it 's not the only way , but it 's an important one .
talking can do no harm .
we are doing our best to hold bilateral talks with various partners , including muslim associations .
we are not always doing it publicly , because we are not interested in earning points for our diligence , but rather in establishing bridges of confidence to other people - despite the existing difficulties and differences .
after all , it 's not really organizations that are talking to other , but people .
small , but important steps are made in this direction all the time . a great deal of problems arise when religion is mixed up with politics .
how can this be avoided ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitic message appeared recently on the walls of a jewish school and kindergarten in berlin when religion is abused by politics , that 's always bad , regardless of what religion we 're talking about .
this is a problem with christianity , judaism , islam and other religions .
we have to try to keep politics out of these areas as much as possible , but we should also not live in an ivory tower and believe that we could conduct this kind of dialogue without resorting to any political arguments .
politics is a part of this society , just as religion and other basic values are .
it 's for each individual to decide how much he wants to keep these separate from each other . i think that what we 're missing is a civilized way of debating our problems .
debating is good if it 's about finding a better solution for our problems and it 's bad if it 's about converting or trying to hurt somebody , which is what , unfortunately , happens all to often in our public discussions .
the result of this negative form of discussion is silence , the feeling of not being understood , of having to find a different way of expressing oneself , which often leads to violence .
and that 's exactly what we should avoid . anti-semitism can be very damaging to the integration process .
what can be done against it ? i 'm careful about such generalizations , but the fact is that anti-semitism is , for instance , on the rise in the muslim community in germany , and that it 's increasingly prone to violence .
we agree with the majority of muslim organizations that we need to do something about it together .
at the same time , and i say it openly , jews in germany and other countries are not immune to stereotypes , clichés and prejudices about muslims , perhaps not to the same extent and certainly not exhibiting the same willingness to violence .

" a total of 288,906 voters had cast their votes by midday , making up 32.3 percent of all eligible voters , " the election commission said in a statement . in the last parliamentary elections , in 2003 - the year before estonia joined the eu - turnout at midday was 28.6 percent . since then , estonia 's economy has powered ahead , growing by 11.5 percent last year , and the baltic state has earned itself a reputation as a high-tech leader . " things are going fine in estonia , but people must come out and say who should govern next , " 31-year-old siim lepik told afp at a busy polling station in tallinn .
" those who do n't vote wo n't have the right to criticize the state of affairs in the next four years , " he said . sunday 's turnout figure included some 170,000 people who cast ballots in advance voting earlier this week , of which 30,275 voted from a home or office computer in the world 's first national e-vote . internet vote under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian pm ansip has no qualms about online voting the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said the internet vote was one of the issues its team of election observers would focus on . " we 're very keen to learn how estonia uses remote voting on the internet in parliamentary elections , because estonia is the first in the world to use it , " osce spokeswoman urdur gunnarsdottir said . " also , in all osce countries which have significant national minorities , we look at their situation , how they can exercise their rights , " she said . russian officials have repeatedly complained that estonia is violating the rights of the baltic state 's large ethnic-russian minority , the legacy of the policy of " russifying " the baltics carried out by the soviets during five decades of occupation . around seven percent of the 1.34 million people who live in estonia still hold russian passports , and a further nine percent have no formal nationality .
neither group if allowed to vote . russia watches as former soviet state leaves past behind tensions between estonia and its former ruler were ratcheted up further last month when the outgoing estonian parliament voted to move a world war ii monument to soviet red army soldiers , who chased the nazis out of the baltics , from its place of prominence in the center of tallinn . but the divisive issue of relations with russia was expected to have little impact on the election result . only two of the 11 parties jostling for a seat in parliament campaigned on an ethnic russian ticket , and analysts gave them long odds on getting into the single-chamber legislature . " they are too marginal and not seen as trustworthy , even by the russians , " political scientist toonis saarts of tallinn university said . polling stations are due to close at 8:00 pm cet , with preliminary results expected around midnight . incumbent coalition on course to retain power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edgar savisaar a survey by the emor polling agency published on the eve of sunday 's vote suggested that the two main partners in the ruling coalition - the center party of economy and communications minister edgar savisaar and prime minister andrus ansip 's reform party - would each garner 26 percent of the vote . if they do manage to get those scores , they would be the first sitting government to be returned to power , and would enjoy between them a comfortable majority in the 101-strong single-chamber parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de estonia 's e-lection voting begins with doubts over security the parliamentary elections in estonia could be considered a world premiere : the people of the baltic state are the first to vote for a new parliament via the internet .

dw-world.de spoke to stefan kramer , the council 's secretary general , during a recent berlin conference on " religion and integration . " dw-world : the term " integration " is one of the most widely used in politics right now .
how do you define the term ? integration means becoming a part of society and enjoying equal rights , without losing sight of or repudiating one 's own roots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan kramer it should n't be about set standards of what integration means - like whether one enjoys german cuisine or not .
i think there are much more important values that define a society , and which one must share and adjust to .
if we could get to the point that jews , muslims , christians and atheists are proud of being germans or of living in germany , then i would think that we have achieved our goals .
integration , however , is a two-way street , and it should not be a form of coercion . if integration is , as you say , a two-way street , what can the majority in society do to help the process ? integration of people from different religions or those socialized in a different cultural context always means the creation of a new society to some extent .
to expect or to believe that the majority of society should n't change , or that migrants or minorities have to subordinate themselves to the larger culture , is completely outdated and unrealistic . take a look at the united states , australia or canada - the traditional countries of immigrants .
they demonstrate that immigrants are not subordinated , but integrated .
the fact is , a culture changes when immigrants are integrated .
it changes in a positive way because people realize that it 's an enriching process , and that society grows from that process , despite all the challenges and difficulties that may come along the way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has long become a multicultural society i do n't want to disregard the fears which the so-called " germans " have regarding an influx of foreigners , other cultures or other religions .
people can only respect other people 's values or those of other faiths when they have a good sense of their own .
i have a feeling that many people in various facets of german society have no sense of their personal values or beliefs and that is why they are intolerant of others or fear foreigners who come here .
that 's why we have to take a good , hard look at ourselves and work on our own principles and values before we can tell other people how they have to behave and fulfill our expectations . in your speech , you said that a dialogue between religions is the only rational way of approaching the clash between religions . how committed are jews to that process ? it 's not the only way , but it 's an important one .
talking can do no harm .
we are doing our best to hold bilateral talks with various partners , including muslim associations .
we are not always doing it publicly , because we are not interested in earning points for our diligence , but rather in establishing bridges of confidence to other people - despite the existing difficulties and differences .
after all , it 's not really organizations that are talking to other , but people .
small , but important steps are made in this direction all the time . a great deal of problems arise when religion is mixed up with politics .
how can this be avoided ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitic message appeared recently on the walls of a jewish school and kindergarten in berlin when religion is abused by politics , that 's always bad , regardless of what religion we 're talking about .
this is a problem with christianity , judaism , islam and other religions .
we have to try to keep politics out of these areas as much as possible , but we should also not live in an ivory tower and believe that we could conduct this kind of dialogue without resorting to any political arguments .
politics is a part of this society , just as religion and other basic values are .
it 's for each individual to decide how much he wants to keep these separate from each other . i think that what we 're missing is a civilized way of debating our problems .
debating is good if it 's about finding a better solution for our problems and it 's bad if it 's about converting or trying to hurt somebody , which is what , unfortunately , happens all to often in our public discussions .
the result of this negative form of discussion is silence , the feeling of not being understood , of having to find a different way of expressing oneself , which often leads to violence .
and that 's exactly what we should avoid . anti-semitism can be very damaging to the integration process .
what can be done against it ? i 'm careful about such generalizations , but the fact is that anti-semitism is , for instance , on the rise in the muslim community in germany , and that it 's increasingly prone to violence .
we agree with the majority of muslim organizations that we need to do something about it together .
at the same time , and i say it openly , jews in germany and other countries are not immune to stereotypes , clichés and prejudices about muslims , perhaps not to the same extent and certainly not exhibiting the same willingness to violence .
but there are things on both sides where we still have homework to do .
we 're working on finding possible solutions .

he was unable to specify their number . witnesses said numerous germans had played a major role in the street riots on friday night .
one person was injured by protestors throwing paving stones , setting cars on fire and putting up barricades . according to the ritzau news agency , german and danish authorities have increased border controls to prevent more violent protestors slipping into denmark en route to copenhagen out of solidarity with the danish protest . on saturday night , the violence was limited to scuffles between police and small groups of protesters who threw rocks and set fire to trash bins and barricades , but the unrest did not escalate into the full-scale riots of the two previous nights . " we are very happy that the situation was so quiet , " police spokesman lars borg said .
" the people who want to demonstrate have been more aware that the things they are doing are not the right things to do . " arrests continue despite quieter night bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police launched raids on gangs of protestors more than 30 people were arrested near the christiania hippie enclave after protesters built barricades on a major street and set them on fire in the early hours of the morning , police said . nearly 300 rioters were arrested earlier in copenhagen after police moved against an estimated 1,000 mainly teenagers , some hurling petrol bombs and stones .
police said a hard core wearing masks erected barriers and set fire to these and to cars , smashed shop windows and vandalized a school before melting away . a crowd also gathered outside city hall and prepared to march to the umgdomhuset , a building some two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- away , which has acquired a cult reputation over the last 25 years as a home to underground culture . its inhabitants were forcibly evicted on thursday , prompting two nights of violence after thursday 's dawn police raid .
the ungdomshuset has been a haven for rebels , punks and squatters since the 1980s when the city of copenhagen gave the groups permission to move into the youth centre . protestors head for youth center at heart of unrest bildunterschrift : the ungdomshuset was recently sold to the christian group fadershuset , which requested the eviction of the youths .
an august 2006 court ruling ordered the occupants to be evicted from the centre , which they insist belongs to them . the building has been a popular hang-out for copenhagen 's alternative society , serving as a venue for concerts , plays and debates .
big stars such as icelandic pop artist björk have performed at the venue . demonstrators carried banners saturday saying : " no to police violence , " and " keep the youth centre " while large numbers of police were on standby . line barfoed , spokesperson of the unity party , the former communist party , appealed to copenhagen 's mayor to seek " a political solution to the current crisis . "
she also called on police to " avoid any escalation of violence and not arrest citizens showing solidarity with young people . " supporters call for political solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violence and police operation has been costly " this entire affair is going to cost the authorities much more than it would have done if they had left this historic house with young people , " she also warned . rasmus willig , chair of the danish sociologists ' association , said it was irresponsible to take the community house away from the young people after it had served as a focal point for underground culture and a great attraction among visitors to denmark . in all , 643 people have been arrested , including 140 foreigners from other european nations and the united states , since the clashes started thursday .
they included 20 swedes , 20 norwegians and 25 germans , police said .

" we want to show that germany has the know-how , " he said , after the dlr presented its plans for the mission to the german parliament . completing a moon mission would catapult the country into the league of nations which can send spacecraft into orbit . döllinger said the federal government was mulling the project . will the government support it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientific and technological progress is the driving force of space exploration a high-ranking official in the economy ministry , helge engelhard , said berlin was " not negatively disposed " towards a moon mission . he added that the mission should have clear scientific or technical goals such as long-term improvements in radar technology or robotics .

the ohb is interested in exploring the ways to discover , measure and eventually exploit helium 3 - a lighter isotope of the noble gas helium - which is rare on earth , but thought to exist on the moon .
according to experts , helium 3 could one day be used as raw material in commercial fusion reactors . astrium , on the other hand , wants in the long term to erect a long-wave radio telescope on the moon which would could potentially not only shed more light on the origins of the universe , but also be used for various explorations of the solar system and geophysics . a space race it is estimated that sending a shuttle to orbit the moon would cost germany between 300 and 400 million euros -lrb- between $ 396 million $ 528 million -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nasa is planning a permanent base on the moon italy and britain are also currently looking into dispatching unmanned shuttles around the moon .

he was unable to specify their number . witnesses said numerous germans had played a major role in the street riots on friday night .
one person was injured by protestors throwing paving stones , setting cars on fire and putting up barricades . according to the ritzau news agency , german and danish authorities have increased border controls to prevent more violent protestors slipping into denmark en route to copenhagen out of solidarity with the danish protest . on saturday night , the violence was limited to scuffles between police and small groups of protesters who threw rocks and set fire to trash bins and barricades , but the unrest did not escalate into the full-scale riots of the two previous nights . " we are very happy that the situation was so quiet , " police spokesman lars borg said .
" the people who want to demonstrate have been more aware that the things they are doing are not the right things to do . " arrests continue despite quieter night bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police launched raids on gangs of protestors more than 30 people were arrested near the christiania hippie enclave after protesters built barricades on a major street and set them on fire in the early hours of the morning , police said . nearly 300 rioters were arrested earlier in copenhagen after police moved against an estimated 1,000 mainly teenagers , some hurling petrol bombs and stones .
police said a hard core wearing masks erected barriers and set fire to these and to cars , smashed shop windows and vandalized a school before melting away . a crowd also gathered outside city hall and prepared to march to the umgdomhuset , a building some two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- away , which has acquired a cult reputation over the last 25 years as a home to underground culture . its inhabitants were forcibly evicted on thursday , prompting two nights of violence after thursday 's dawn police raid .
the ungdomshuset has been a haven for rebels , punks and squatters since the 1980s when the city of copenhagen gave the groups permission to move into the youth centre . protestors head for youth center at heart of unrest bildunterschrift : the ungdomshuset was recently sold to the christian group fadershuset , which requested the eviction of the youths .
an august 2006 court ruling ordered the occupants to be evicted from the centre , which they insist belongs to them . the building has been a popular hang-out for copenhagen 's alternative society , serving as a venue for concerts , plays and debates .
big stars such as icelandic pop artist björk have performed at the venue . demonstrators carried banners saturday saying : " no to police violence , " and " keep the youth centre " while large numbers of police were on standby . line barfoed , spokesperson of the unity party , the former communist party , appealed to copenhagen 's mayor to seek " a political solution to the current crisis . "
she also called on police to " avoid any escalation of violence and not arrest citizens showing solidarity with young people . " supporters call for political solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violence and police operation has been costly " this entire affair is going to cost the authorities much more than it would have done if they had left this historic house with young people , " she also warned . rasmus willig , chair of the danish sociologists ' association , said it was irresponsible to take the community house away from the young people after it had served as a focal point for underground culture and a great attraction among visitors to denmark . in all , 643 people have been arrested , including 140 foreigners from other european nations and the united states , since the clashes started thursday .

dw-world.de spoke to stefan kramer , the council 's secretary general , during a recent berlin conference on " religion and integration . " dw-world : the term " integration " is one of the most widely used in politics right now .
how do you define the term ? integration means becoming a part of society and enjoying equal rights , without losing sight of or repudiating one 's own roots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan kramer it should n't be about set standards of what integration means - like whether one enjoys german cuisine or not .
i think there are much more important values that define a society , and which one must share and adjust to .
if we could get to the point that jews , muslims , christians and atheists are proud of being germans or of living in germany , then i would think that we have achieved our goals .
integration , however , is a two-way street , and it should not be a form of coercion . if integration is , as you say , a two-way street , what can the majority in society do to help the process ? integration of people from different religions or those socialized in a different cultural context always means the creation of a new society to some extent .
to expect or to believe that the majority of society should n't change , or that migrants or minorities have to subordinate themselves to the larger culture , is completely outdated and unrealistic . take a look at the united states , australia or canada - the traditional countries of immigrants .
they demonstrate that immigrants are not subordinated , but integrated .
the fact is , a culture changes when immigrants are integrated .
it changes in a positive way because people realize that it 's an enriching process , and that society grows from that process , despite all the challenges and difficulties that may come along the way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has long become a multicultural society i do n't want to disregard the fears which the so-called " germans " have regarding an influx of foreigners , other cultures or other religions .
people can only respect other people 's values or those of other faiths when they have a good sense of their own .
i have a feeling that many people in various facets of german society have no sense of their personal values or beliefs and that is why they are intolerant of others or fear foreigners who come here .
that 's why we have to take a good , hard look at ourselves and work on our own principles and values before we can tell other people how they have to behave and fulfill our expectations . in your speech , you said that a dialogue between religions is the only rational way of approaching the clash between religions . how committed are jews to that process ? it 's not the only way , but it 's an important one .
talking can do no harm .
we are doing our best to hold bilateral talks with various partners , including muslim associations .
we are not always doing it publicly , because we are not interested in earning points for our diligence , but rather in establishing bridges of confidence to other people - despite the existing difficulties and differences .
after all , it 's not really organizations that are talking to other , but people .
small , but important steps are made in this direction all the time . a great deal of problems arise when religion is mixed up with politics .
how can this be avoided ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitic message appeared recently on the walls of a jewish school and kindergarten in berlin when religion is abused by politics , that 's always bad , regardless of what religion we 're talking about .
this is a problem with christianity , judaism , islam and other religions .
we have to try to keep politics out of these areas as much as possible , but we should also not live in an ivory tower and believe that we could conduct this kind of dialogue without resorting to any political arguments .
politics is a part of this society , just as religion and other basic values are .
it 's for each individual to decide how much he wants to keep these separate from each other . i think that what we 're missing is a civilized way of debating our problems .
debating is good if it 's about finding a better solution for our problems and it 's bad if it 's about converting or trying to hurt somebody , which is what , unfortunately , happens all to often in our public discussions .
the result of this negative form of discussion is silence , the feeling of not being understood , of having to find a different way of expressing oneself , which often leads to violence .
and that 's exactly what we should avoid . anti-semitism can be very damaging to the integration process .
what can be done against it ? i 'm careful about such generalizations , but the fact is that anti-semitism is , for instance , on the rise in the muslim community in germany , and that it 's increasingly prone to violence .
we agree with the majority of muslim organizations that we need to do something about it together .
at the same time , and i say it openly , jews in germany and other countries are not immune to stereotypes , clichés and prejudices about muslims , perhaps not to the same extent and certainly not exhibiting the same willingness to violence .
but there are things on both sides where we still have homework to do .
we 're working on finding possible solutions .

if we could get to the point that jews , muslims , christians and atheists are proud of being germans or of living in germany , then i would think that we have achieved our goals .
integration , however , is a two-way street , and it should not be a form of coercion . if integration is , as you say , a two-way street , what can the majority in society do to help the process ? integration of people from different religions or those socialized in a different cultural context always means the creation of a new society to some extent .
to expect or to believe that the majority of society should n't change , or that migrants or minorities have to subordinate themselves to the larger culture , is completely outdated and unrealistic . take a look at the united states , australia or canada - the traditional countries of immigrants .
they demonstrate that immigrants are not subordinated , but integrated .
the fact is , a culture changes when immigrants are integrated .

i have a feeling that many people in various facets of german society have no sense of their personal values or beliefs and that is why they are intolerant of others or fear foreigners who come here .

we have to try to keep politics out of these areas as much as possible , but we should also not live in an ivory tower and believe that we could conduct this kind of dialogue without resorting to any political arguments .
politics is a part of this society , just as religion and other basic values are .
it 's for each individual to decide how much he wants to keep these separate from each other . i think that what we 're missing is a civilized way of debating our problems .
debating is good if it 's about finding a better solution for our problems and it 's bad if it 's about converting or trying to hurt somebody , which is what , unfortunately , happens all to often in our public discussions .
the result of this negative form of discussion is silence , the feeling of not being understood , of having to find a different way of expressing oneself , which often leads to violence .
and that 's exactly what we should avoid . anti-semitism can be very damaging to the integration process .
what can be done against it ? i 'm careful about such generalizations , but the fact is that anti-semitism is , for instance , on the rise in the muslim community in germany , and that it 's increasingly prone to violence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 04.03.2007 estonia 's e-lection voting begins with doubts over security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia has made it possible to vote online , whether at home or on the move the parliamentary elections in estonia could be considered a world premiere : the people of the baltic state are the first to vote for a new parliament via the internet .
however , critics of the system fear security gaps . according to one of the project managers behind the i-voting system , the procedure is quick and easy .
the voter pushes the electronic chip of his identity card into a reader , calls up the special electoral web page on the internet , gives two pin codes and puts his cross beside one of the parties .
" this takes no longer than 15 seconds , " says tarvy martins . up until late on thursday evening last week , about 940,000 voters registered to vote in sunday 's internet election .
after a test run during the local elections in 2005 , the number of voters accepting the i-voting system has sky-rocketed . to ease the vote , the necessary card readers have been installed in all public places with internet connections in estonia and many private individuals have bought their own home reader so they can vote from the comfort of their own home . estonia miles ahead in internet coverage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the most remote areas are online the baltic state is one of the most internet-savvy countries in the european union due to a burst of technological development soon after its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
even in the most remote areas of the country , one can use wireless technology to surf .
the pin numbers used for the i-voting system have also been adapted to make shopping , tax returns and all administrative processes possible and secure online . even the country 's administration has embraced the technology and has moved towards e-government , thus increasing political communication and information via the internet . it is no surprise , therefore , that the estonians will become the first nation worldwide to choose their government online . electoral monitoring body skeptical over security however , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , the body which observes all elections in europe , views the on-line development , with skepticism , with many officials doubting the level of protection and security of information .
but tarvy martins is convinced that the procedure is fool-proof .
" this is like a double envelope .
the choice is encoded and then sealed .
it is quite difficult to cheat . " the biggest technical challenge of the i-voting system is the authorization and identification of the user as an entitled voter , while making sure that the vote remains anonymous . " technically , this is not a big problem , " explains dieter otten , a member of the german federal ministry of economy and technology 's research group into electronic voting .
" since the 1980s there has been the principle of the digital signature and asymmetrical encoding . "
he also believes that high encoding technology makes the security and implementation of online elections " fool-proof . " " the bigger challenge is communication , " remembers otten .
it has been more difficult to persuade lawyers and politicians of the security of online voting than to design a functioning system .
the people who have to decide on whether to use the system , otten says , are dealing with something they do n't fully understand . internet-doubters holding back german progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is behind estonia in terms of election technology those with doubts and power in germany prevented the last election in 2005 from being an e-lection and it remains increasingly unlikely that a change in opinion will take place in the near future . " i-voting , for judicial and technical reasons , does not do justice to the special requirements of political elections in germany at the moment , " says annette ziesig of the ministry of internal affairs . dieter otten accuses germany of being obsessed with security to the point that the measures brought in to protect the traditional voting process can be more expensive than developing i-voting to fit the needs of the german electoral system .
he believes , in time , germany will follow the estonians into a new age of voting . back in estonia , i-voting is becoming the norm .
the system was already in place for the 2005 local elections , and last week the dress rehearsal took place for the parliamentary elections .
in a surreal test of the system , an elk , a deer and a wild boar went head to head for the title of " king of the wood . "
because the animal vote was just a test , only those creatures involved know who finally came out with the woodland crown . coalition partners out in front in forecasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king of the wood ?
prime minister andrus ansip no such mystery will surround the result of sunday 's human poll with surveys already putting the biggest partners in the government coalition - the reform party and the center party - out in front .
despite forecasts to the contrary , the vote could be far from a shoo-in for the incumbent prime minister andrus ansip 's reform party . whatever the result , estonia will have taken a big step in leading the rest of europe - and the world - towards a new process of electoral voting . ina rottscheidt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de estonia prepares to go to the polls in first e-lection almost one million estonians go to the polls this sunday to elect a new parliament .

how can this be avoided ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitic message appeared recently on the walls of a jewish school and kindergarten in berlin when religion is abused by politics , that 's always bad , regardless of what religion we 're talking about .
this is a problem with christianity , judaism , islam and other religions .
we have to try to keep politics out of these areas as much as possible , but we should also not live in an ivory tower and believe that we could conduct this kind of dialogue without resorting to any political arguments .
politics is a part of this society , just as religion and other basic values are .
it 's for each individual to decide how much he wants to keep these separate from each other . i think that what we 're missing is a civilized way of debating our problems .
debating is good if it 's about finding a better solution for our problems and it 's bad if it 's about converting or trying to hurt somebody , which is what , unfortunately , happens all to often in our public discussions .
the result of this negative form of discussion is silence , the feeling of not being understood , of having to find a different way of expressing oneself , which often leads to violence .
and that 's exactly what we should avoid . anti-semitism can be very damaging to the integration process .
what can be done against it ? i 'm careful about such generalizations , but the fact is that anti-semitism is , for instance , on the rise in the muslim community in germany , and that it 's increasingly prone to violence .
we agree with the majority of muslim organizations that we need to do something about it together .
at the same time , and i say it openly , jews in germany and other countries are not immune to stereotypes , clichés and prejudices about muslims , perhaps not to the same extent and certainly not exhibiting the same willingness to violence .
but there are things on both sides where we still have homework to do .
we 're working on finding possible solutions .
i 'm not saying that all this is easy and working out wonderfully , but it is important that we are talking and that we 're aware of the crisis . aladdin sarhan interviewed stefan kramer -lrb- als / tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's jews say nursery attack shows anti-semitism still alive the leader of berlin 's jewish community said on thursday that an attack on a jewish nursery school which was daubed with swastikas showed anti-semitism was still a threat .

he was unable to specify their number . witnesses said numerous germans had played a major role in the street riots on friday night .
one person was injured by protestors throwing paving stones , setting cars on fire and putting up barricades . according to the ritzau news agency , german and danish authorities have increased border controls to prevent more violent protestors slipping into denmark en route to copenhagen out of solidarity with the danish protest . on saturday night , the violence was limited to scuffles between police and small groups of protesters who threw rocks and set fire to trash bins and barricades , but the unrest did not escalate into the full-scale riots of the two previous nights . " we are very happy that the situation was so quiet , " police spokesman lars borg said .
" the people who want to demonstrate have been more aware that the things they are doing are not the right things to do . " arrests continue despite quieter night bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police launched raids on gangs of protestors more than 30 people were arrested near the christiania hippie enclave after protesters built barricades on a major street and set them on fire in the early hours of the morning , police said . nearly 300 rioters were arrested earlier in copenhagen after police moved against an estimated 1,000 mainly teenagers , some hurling petrol bombs and stones .
police said a hard core wearing masks erected barriers and set fire to these and to cars , smashed shop windows and vandalized a school before melting away . a crowd also gathered outside city hall and prepared to march to the umgdomhuset , a building some two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- away , which has acquired a cult reputation over the last 25 years as a home to underground culture . its inhabitants were forcibly evicted on thursday , prompting two nights of violence after thursday 's dawn police raid .
the ungdomshuset has been a haven for rebels , punks and squatters since the 1980s when the city of copenhagen gave the groups permission to move into the youth centre . protestors head for youth center at heart of unrest bildunterschrift : the ungdomshuset was recently sold to the christian group fadershuset , which requested the eviction of the youths .
an august 2006 court ruling ordered the occupants to be evicted from the centre , which they insist belongs to them . the building has been a popular hang-out for copenhagen 's alternative society , serving as a venue for concerts , plays and debates .
big stars such as icelandic pop artist björk have performed at the venue . demonstrators carried banners saturday saying : " no to police violence , " and " keep the youth centre " while large numbers of police were on standby . line barfoed , spokesperson of the unity party , the former communist party , appealed to copenhagen 's mayor to seek " a political solution to the current crisis . "
she also called on police to " avoid any escalation of violence and not arrest citizens showing solidarity with young people . " supporters call for political solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violence and police operation has been costly " this entire affair is going to cost the authorities much more than it would have done if they had left this historic house with young people , " she also warned . rasmus willig , chair of the danish sociologists ' association , said it was irresponsible to take the community house away from the young people after it had served as a focal point for underground culture and a great attraction among visitors to denmark . in all , 643 people have been arrested , including 140 foreigners from other european nations and the united states , since the clashes started thursday .
they included 20 swedes , 20 norwegians and 25 germans , police said .
" we arrested 188 people during the night and a further 90 this morning , " said a police spokesman . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police fear new riots in copenhagen after street clashes police in copenhagen were gearing up friday for a second day of riots as radical activists protested against the eviction of squatters from an underground cultural youth centre .

" a total of 288,906 voters had cast their votes by midday , making up 32.3 percent of all eligible voters , " the election commission said in a statement . in the last parliamentary elections , in 2003 - the year before estonia joined the eu - turnout at midday was 28.6 percent . since then , estonia 's economy has powered ahead , growing by 11.5 percent last year , and the baltic state has earned itself a reputation as a high-tech leader .

however , critics of the system fear security gaps . according to one of the project managers behind the i-voting system , the procedure is quick and easy .
the voter pushes the electronic chip of his identity card into a reader , calls up the special electoral web page on the internet , gives two pin codes and puts his cross beside one of the parties .
" this takes no longer than 15 seconds , " says tarvy martins . up until late on thursday evening last week , about 940,000 voters registered to vote in sunday 's internet election .
after a test run during the local elections in 2005 , the number of voters accepting the i-voting system has sky-rocketed . to ease the vote , the necessary card readers have been installed in all public places with internet connections in estonia and many private individuals have bought their own home reader so they can vote from the comfort of their own home . estonia miles ahead in internet coverage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the most remote areas are online the baltic state is one of the most internet-savvy countries in the european union due to a burst of technological development soon after its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
even in the most remote areas of the country , one can use wireless technology to surf .
the pin numbers used for the i-voting system have also been adapted to make shopping , tax returns and all administrative processes possible and secure online . even the country 's administration has embraced the technology and has moved towards e-government , thus increasing political communication and information via the internet . it is no surprise , therefore , that the estonians will become the first nation worldwide to choose their government online . electoral monitoring body skeptical over security however , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , the body which observes all elections in europe , views the on-line development , with skepticism , with many officials doubting the level of protection and security of information .
but tarvy martins is convinced that the procedure is fool-proof .
" this is like a double envelope .
the choice is encoded and then sealed .
it is quite difficult to cheat . " the biggest technical challenge of the i-voting system is the authorization and identification of the user as an entitled voter , while making sure that the vote remains anonymous . " technically , this is not a big problem , " explains dieter otten , a member of the german federal ministry of economy and technology 's research group into electronic voting .
" since the 1980s there has been the principle of the digital signature and asymmetrical encoding . "
he also believes that high encoding technology makes the security and implementation of online elections " fool-proof . " " the bigger challenge is communication , " remembers otten .
it has been more difficult to persuade lawyers and politicians of the security of online voting than to design a functioning system .
the people who have to decide on whether to use the system , otten says , are dealing with something they do n't fully understand . internet-doubters holding back german progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is behind estonia in terms of election technology those with doubts and power in germany prevented the last election in 2005 from being an e-lection and it remains increasingly unlikely that a change in opinion will take place in the near future . " i-voting , for judicial and technical reasons , does not do justice to the special requirements of political elections in germany at the moment , " says annette ziesig of the ministry of internal affairs . dieter otten accuses germany of being obsessed with security to the point that the measures brought in to protect the traditional voting process can be more expensive than developing i-voting to fit the needs of the german electoral system .
he believes , in time , germany will follow the estonians into a new age of voting . back in estonia , i-voting is becoming the norm .
the system was already in place for the 2005 local elections , and last week the dress rehearsal took place for the parliamentary elections .
in a surreal test of the system , an elk , a deer and a wild boar went head to head for the title of " king of the wood . "
because the animal vote was just a test , only those creatures involved know who finally came out with the woodland crown . coalition partners out in front in forecasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king of the wood ?
prime minister andrus ansip no such mystery will surround the result of sunday 's human poll with surveys already putting the biggest partners in the government coalition - the reform party and the center party - out in front .
despite forecasts to the contrary , the vote could be far from a shoo-in for the incumbent prime minister andrus ansip 's reform party . whatever the result , estonia will have taken a big step in leading the rest of europe - and the world - towards a new process of electoral voting . ina rottscheidt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de estonia prepares to go to the polls in first e-lection almost one million estonians go to the polls this sunday to elect a new parliament .

however , critics of the system fear security gaps . according to one of the project managers behind the i-voting system , the procedure is quick and easy .
the voter pushes the electronic chip of his identity card into a reader , calls up the special electoral web page on the internet , gives two pin codes and puts his cross beside one of the parties .
" this takes no longer than 15 seconds , " says tarvy martins . up until late on thursday evening last week , about 940,000 voters registered to vote in sunday 's internet election .
after a test run during the local elections in 2005 , the number of voters accepting the i-voting system has sky-rocketed . to ease the vote , the necessary card readers have been installed in all public places with internet connections in estonia and many private individuals have bought their own home reader so they can vote from the comfort of their own home . estonia miles ahead in internet coverage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the most remote areas are online the baltic state is one of the most internet-savvy countries in the european union due to a burst of technological development soon after its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
even in the most remote areas of the country , one can use wireless technology to surf .
the pin numbers used for the i-voting system have also been adapted to make shopping , tax returns and all administrative processes possible and secure online . even the country 's administration has embraced the technology and has moved towards e-government , thus increasing political communication and information via the internet . it is no surprise , therefore , that the estonians will become the first nation worldwide to choose their government online . electoral monitoring body skeptical over security however , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , the body which observes all elections in europe , views the on-line development , with skepticism , with many officials doubting the level of protection and security of information .
but tarvy martins is convinced that the procedure is fool-proof .
" this is like a double envelope .
the choice is encoded and then sealed .
it is quite difficult to cheat . " the biggest technical challenge of the i-voting system is the authorization and identification of the user as an entitled voter , while making sure that the vote remains anonymous . " technically , this is not a big problem , " explains dieter otten , a member of the german federal ministry of economy and technology 's research group into electronic voting .
" since the 1980s there has been the principle of the digital signature and asymmetrical encoding . "
he also believes that high encoding technology makes the security and implementation of online elections " fool-proof . " " the bigger challenge is communication , " remembers otten .
it has been more difficult to persuade lawyers and politicians of the security of online voting than to design a functioning system .
the people who have to decide on whether to use the system , otten says , are dealing with something they do n't fully understand . internet-doubters holding back german progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is behind estonia in terms of election technology those with doubts and power in germany prevented the last election in 2005 from being an e-lection and it remains increasingly unlikely that a change in opinion will take place in the near future . " i-voting , for judicial and technical reasons , does not do justice to the special requirements of political elections in germany at the moment , " says annette ziesig of the ministry of internal affairs . dieter otten accuses germany of being obsessed with security to the point that the measures brought in to protect the traditional voting process can be more expensive than developing i-voting to fit the needs of the german electoral system .
he believes , in time , germany will follow the estonians into a new age of voting . back in estonia , i-voting is becoming the norm .
the system was already in place for the 2005 local elections , and last week the dress rehearsal took place for the parliamentary elections .
in a surreal test of the system , an elk , a deer and a wild boar went head to head for the title of " king of the wood . "
because the animal vote was just a test , only those creatures involved know who finally came out with the woodland crown . coalition partners out in front in forecasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king of the wood ?
prime minister andrus ansip no such mystery will surround the result of sunday 's human poll with surveys already putting the biggest partners in the government coalition - the reform party and the center party - out in front .
despite forecasts to the contrary , the vote could be far from a shoo-in for the incumbent prime minister andrus ansip 's reform party . whatever the result , estonia will have taken a big step in leading the rest of europe - and the world - towards a new process of electoral voting . ina rottscheidt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de estonia prepares to go to the polls in first e-lection almost one million estonians go to the polls this sunday to elect a new parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : keeping the faith : religion in 21st century europe school shelves harry potter after parent complaint islam ca n't be reformed , says founder of ex-muslim group finding faith in the eu constitution as church loses appeal , protestants try rebranding religion religion -pipe- 04.03.2007 " integration is a two-way street " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is an important term in the german political vocabulary stefan kramer , secretary general of the central council of jews in germany spoke to dw-world.de about the challenges of integration and dialogue between religions . the central council of jews is the main organization representing germany 's jewish community of about 100,000 .
dw-world.de spoke to stefan kramer , the council 's secretary general , during a recent berlin conference on " religion and integration . " dw-world : the term " integration " is one of the most widely used in politics right now .
how do you define the term ? integration means becoming a part of society and enjoying equal rights , without losing sight of or repudiating one 's own roots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan kramer it should n't be about set standards of what integration means - like whether one enjoys german cuisine or not .
i think there are much more important values that define a society , and which one must share and adjust to .
if we could get to the point that jews , muslims , christians and atheists are proud of being germans or of living in germany , then i would think that we have achieved our goals .
integration , however , is a two-way street , and it should not be a form of coercion . if integration is , as you say , a two-way street , what can the majority in society do to help the process ? integration of people from different religions or those socialized in a different cultural context always means the creation of a new society to some extent .
to expect or to believe that the majority of society should n't change , or that migrants or minorities have to subordinate themselves to the larger culture , is completely outdated and unrealistic . take a look at the united states , australia or canada - the traditional countries of immigrants .
they demonstrate that immigrants are not subordinated , but integrated .
the fact is , a culture changes when immigrants are integrated .
it changes in a positive way because people realize that it 's an enriching process , and that society grows from that process , despite all the challenges and difficulties that may come along the way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has long become a multicultural society i do n't want to disregard the fears which the so-called " germans " have regarding an influx of foreigners , other cultures or other religions .
people can only respect other people 's values or those of other faiths when they have a good sense of their own .
i have a feeling that many people in various facets of german society have no sense of their personal values or beliefs and that is why they are intolerant of others or fear foreigners who come here .
that 's why we have to take a good , hard look at ourselves and work on our own principles and values before we can tell other people how they have to behave and fulfill our expectations . in your speech , you said that a dialogue between religions is the only rational way of approaching the clash between religions . how committed are jews to that process ? it 's not the only way , but it 's an important one .
talking can do no harm .
we are doing our best to hold bilateral talks with various partners , including muslim associations .
we are not always doing it publicly , because we are not interested in earning points for our diligence , but rather in establishing bridges of confidence to other people - despite the existing difficulties and differences .
after all , it 's not really organizations that are talking to other , but people .
small , but important steps are made in this direction all the time . a great deal of problems arise when religion is mixed up with politics .
how can this be avoided ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitic message appeared recently on the walls of a jewish school and kindergarten in berlin when religion is abused by politics , that 's always bad , regardless of what religion we 're talking about .
this is a problem with christianity , judaism , islam and other religions .
we have to try to keep politics out of these areas as much as possible , but we should also not live in an ivory tower and believe that we could conduct this kind of dialogue without resorting to any political arguments .
politics is a part of this society , just as religion and other basic values are .
it 's for each individual to decide how much he wants to keep these separate from each other . i think that what we 're missing is a civilized way of debating our problems .
debating is good if it 's about finding a better solution for our problems and it 's bad if it 's about converting or trying to hurt somebody , which is what , unfortunately , happens all to often in our public discussions .
the result of this negative form of discussion is silence , the feeling of not being understood , of having to find a different way of expressing oneself , which often leads to violence .
and that 's exactly what we should avoid . anti-semitism can be very damaging to the integration process .
what can be done against it ? i 'm careful about such generalizations , but the fact is that anti-semitism is , for instance , on the rise in the muslim community in germany , and that it 's increasingly prone to violence .
we agree with the majority of muslim organizations that we need to do something about it together .
at the same time , and i say it openly , jews in germany and other countries are not immune to stereotypes , clichés and prejudices about muslims , perhaps not to the same extent and certainly not exhibiting the same willingness to violence .
but there are things on both sides where we still have homework to do .
we 're working on finding possible solutions .
i 'm not saying that all this is easy and working out wonderfully , but it is important that we are talking and that we 're aware of the crisis . aladdin sarhan interviewed stefan kramer -lrb- als / tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's jews say nursery attack shows anti-semitism still alive the leader of berlin 's jewish community said on thursday that an attack on a jewish nursery school which was daubed with swastikas showed anti-semitism was still a threat .

he was unable to specify their number . witnesses said numerous germans had played a major role in the street riots on friday night .
one person was injured by protestors throwing paving stones , setting cars on fire and putting up barricades . according to the ritzau news agency , german and danish authorities have increased border controls to prevent more violent protestors slipping into denmark en route to copenhagen out of solidarity with the danish protest . on saturday night , the violence was limited to scuffles between police and small groups of protesters who threw rocks and set fire to trash bins and barricades , but the unrest did not escalate into the full-scale riots of the two previous nights . " we are very happy that the situation was so quiet , " police spokesman lars borg said .
" the people who want to demonstrate have been more aware that the things they are doing are not the right things to do . " arrests continue despite quieter night bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police launched raids on gangs of protestors more than 30 people were arrested near the christiania hippie enclave after protesters built barricades on a major street and set them on fire in the early hours of the morning , police said . nearly 300 rioters were arrested earlier in copenhagen after police moved against an estimated 1,000 mainly teenagers , some hurling petrol bombs and stones .
police said a hard core wearing masks erected barriers and set fire to these and to cars , smashed shop windows and vandalized a school before melting away . a crowd also gathered outside city hall and prepared to march to the umgdomhuset , a building some two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- away , which has acquired a cult reputation over the last 25 years as a home to underground culture . its inhabitants were forcibly evicted on thursday , prompting two nights of violence after thursday 's dawn police raid .
the ungdomshuset has been a haven for rebels , punks and squatters since the 1980s when the city of copenhagen gave the groups permission to move into the youth centre . protestors head for youth center at heart of unrest bildunterschrift : the ungdomshuset was recently sold to the christian group fadershuset , which requested the eviction of the youths .
an august 2006 court ruling ordered the occupants to be evicted from the centre , which they insist belongs to them . the building has been a popular hang-out for copenhagen 's alternative society , serving as a venue for concerts , plays and debates .
big stars such as icelandic pop artist björk have performed at the venue . demonstrators carried banners saturday saying : " no to police violence , " and " keep the youth centre " while large numbers of police were on standby . line barfoed , spokesperson of the unity party , the former communist party , appealed to copenhagen 's mayor to seek " a political solution to the current crisis . "
she also called on police to " avoid any escalation of violence and not arrest citizens showing solidarity with young people . " supporters call for political solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violence and police operation has been costly " this entire affair is going to cost the authorities much more than it would have done if they had left this historic house with young people , " she also warned . rasmus willig , chair of the danish sociologists ' association , said it was irresponsible to take the community house away from the young people after it had served as a focal point for underground culture and a great attraction among visitors to denmark . in all , 643 people have been arrested , including 140 foreigners from other european nations and the united states , since the clashes started thursday .
they included 20 swedes , 20 norwegians and 25 germans , police said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 04.03.2007 estonia 's e-lection voting begins with doubts over security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia has made it possible to vote online , whether at home or on the move the parliamentary elections in estonia could be considered a world premiere : the people of the baltic state are the first to vote for a new parliament via the internet .
however , critics of the system fear security gaps . according to one of the project managers behind the i-voting system , the procedure is quick and easy .
the voter pushes the electronic chip of his identity card into a reader , calls up the special electoral web page on the internet , gives two pin codes and puts his cross beside one of the parties .
" this takes no longer than 15 seconds , " says tarvy martins . up until late on thursday evening last week , about 940,000 voters registered to vote in sunday 's internet election .
after a test run during the local elections in 2005 , the number of voters accepting the i-voting system has sky-rocketed . to ease the vote , the necessary card readers have been installed in all public places with internet connections in estonia and many private individuals have bought their own home reader so they can vote from the comfort of their own home . estonia miles ahead in internet coverage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the most remote areas are online the baltic state is one of the most internet-savvy countries in the european union due to a burst of technological development soon after its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
even in the most remote areas of the country , one can use wireless technology to surf .
the pin numbers used for the i-voting system have also been adapted to make shopping , tax returns and all administrative processes possible and secure online . even the country 's administration has embraced the technology and has moved towards e-government , thus increasing political communication and information via the internet . it is no surprise , therefore , that the estonians will become the first nation worldwide to choose their government online . electoral monitoring body skeptical over security however , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , the body which observes all elections in europe , views the on-line development , with skepticism , with many officials doubting the level of protection and security of information .
but tarvy martins is convinced that the procedure is fool-proof .
" this is like a double envelope .
the choice is encoded and then sealed .
it is quite difficult to cheat . " the biggest technical challenge of the i-voting system is the authorization and identification of the user as an entitled voter , while making sure that the vote remains anonymous . " technically , this is not a big problem , " explains dieter otten , a member of the german federal ministry of economy and technology 's research group into electronic voting .
" since the 1980s there has been the principle of the digital signature and asymmetrical encoding . "
he also believes that high encoding technology makes the security and implementation of online elections " fool-proof . " " the bigger challenge is communication , " remembers otten .
it has been more difficult to persuade lawyers and politicians of the security of online voting than to design a functioning system .
the people who have to decide on whether to use the system , otten says , are dealing with something they do n't fully understand . internet-doubters holding back german progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is behind estonia in terms of election technology those with doubts and power in germany prevented the last election in 2005 from being an e-lection and it remains increasingly unlikely that a change in opinion will take place in the near future . " i-voting , for judicial and technical reasons , does not do justice to the special requirements of political elections in germany at the moment , " says annette ziesig of the ministry of internal affairs . dieter otten accuses germany of being obsessed with security to the point that the measures brought in to protect the traditional voting process can be more expensive than developing i-voting to fit the needs of the german electoral system .
he believes , in time , germany will follow the estonians into a new age of voting . back in estonia , i-voting is becoming the norm .
the system was already in place for the 2005 local elections , and last week the dress rehearsal took place for the parliamentary elections .
in a surreal test of the system , an elk , a deer and a wild boar went head to head for the title of " king of the wood . "
because the animal vote was just a test , only those creatures involved know who finally came out with the woodland crown . coalition partners out in front in forecasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king of the wood ?
prime minister andrus ansip no such mystery will surround the result of sunday 's human poll with surveys already putting the biggest partners in the government coalition - the reform party and the center party - out in front .
despite forecasts to the contrary , the vote could be far from a shoo-in for the incumbent prime minister andrus ansip 's reform party . whatever the result , estonia will have taken a big step in leading the rest of europe - and the world - towards a new process of electoral voting . ina rottscheidt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de estonia prepares to go to the polls in first e-lection almost one million estonians go to the polls this sunday to elect a new parliament .

however , critics of the system fear security gaps . according to one of the project managers behind the i-voting system , the procedure is quick and easy .
the voter pushes the electronic chip of his identity card into a reader , calls up the special electoral web page on the internet , gives two pin codes and puts his cross beside one of the parties .
" this takes no longer than 15 seconds , " says tarvy martins . up until late on thursday evening last week , about 940,000 voters registered to vote in sunday 's internet election .
after a test run during the local elections in 2005 , the number of voters accepting the i-voting system has sky-rocketed . to ease the vote , the necessary card readers have been installed in all public places with internet connections in estonia and many private individuals have bought their own home reader so they can vote from the comfort of their own home . estonia miles ahead in internet coverage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the most remote areas are online the baltic state is one of the most internet-savvy countries in the european union due to a burst of technological development soon after its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .

" since the 1980s there has been the principle of the digital signature and asymmetrical encoding . "
he also believes that high encoding technology makes the security and implementation of online elections " fool-proof . " " the bigger challenge is communication , " remembers otten .

" i-voting , for judicial and technical reasons , does not do justice to the special requirements of political elections in germany at the moment , " says annette ziesig of the ministry of internal affairs . dieter otten accuses germany of being obsessed with security to the point that the measures brought in to protect the traditional voting process can be more expensive than developing i-voting to fit the needs of the german electoral system .

" a total of 288,906 voters had cast their votes by midday , making up 32.3 percent of all eligible voters , " the election commission said in a statement . in the last parliamentary elections , in 2003 - the year before estonia joined the eu - turnout at midday was 28.6 percent . since then , estonia 's economy has powered ahead , growing by 11.5 percent last year , and the baltic state has earned itself a reputation as a high-tech leader . " things are going fine in estonia , but people must come out and say who should govern next , " 31-year-old siim lepik told afp at a busy polling station in tallinn .
" those who do n't vote wo n't have the right to criticize the state of affairs in the next four years , " he said . sunday 's turnout figure included some 170,000 people who cast ballots in advance voting earlier this week , of which 30,275 voted from a home or office computer in the world 's first national e-vote . internet vote under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian pm ansip has no qualms about online voting the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said the internet vote was one of the issues its team of election observers would focus on . " we 're very keen to learn how estonia uses remote voting on the internet in parliamentary elections , because estonia is the first in the world to use it , " osce spokeswoman urdur gunnarsdottir said . " also , in all osce countries which have significant national minorities , we look at their situation , how they can exercise their rights , " she said . russian officials have repeatedly complained that estonia is violating the rights of the baltic state 's large ethnic-russian minority , the legacy of the policy of " russifying " the baltics carried out by the soviets during five decades of occupation . around seven percent of the 1.34 million people who live in estonia still hold russian passports , and a further nine percent have no formal nationality .
neither group if allowed to vote . russia watches as former soviet state leaves past behind tensions between estonia and its former ruler were ratcheted up further last month when the outgoing estonian parliament voted to move a world war ii monument to soviet red army soldiers , who chased the nazis out of the baltics , from its place of prominence in the center of tallinn . but the divisive issue of relations with russia was expected to have little impact on the election result . only two of the 11 parties jostling for a seat in parliament campaigned on an ethnic russian ticket , and analysts gave them long odds on getting into the single-chamber legislature . " they are too marginal and not seen as trustworthy , even by the russians , " political scientist toonis saarts of tallinn university said . polling stations are due to close at 8:00 pm cet , with preliminary results expected around midnight . incumbent coalition on course to retain power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edgar savisaar a survey by the emor polling agency published on the eve of sunday 's vote suggested that the two main partners in the ruling coalition - the center party of economy and communications minister edgar savisaar and prime minister andrus ansip 's reform party - would each garner 26 percent of the vote . if they do manage to get those scores , they would be the first sitting government to be returned to power , and would enjoy between them a comfortable majority in the 101-strong single-chamber parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de estonia 's e-lection voting begins with doubts over security the parliamentary elections in estonia could be considered a world premiere : the people of the baltic state are the first to vote for a new parliament via the internet .

however , critics of the system fear security gaps . according to one of the project managers behind the i-voting system , the procedure is quick and easy .
the voter pushes the electronic chip of his identity card into a reader , calls up the special electoral web page on the internet , gives two pin codes and puts his cross beside one of the parties .
" this takes no longer than 15 seconds , " says tarvy martins . up until late on thursday evening last week , about 940,000 voters registered to vote in sunday 's internet election .
after a test run during the local elections in 2005 , the number of voters accepting the i-voting system has sky-rocketed . to ease the vote , the necessary card readers have been installed in all public places with internet connections in estonia and many private individuals have bought their own home reader so they can vote from the comfort of their own home . estonia miles ahead in internet coverage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the most remote areas are online the baltic state is one of the most internet-savvy countries in the european union due to a burst of technological development soon after its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
even in the most remote areas of the country , one can use wireless technology to surf .
the pin numbers used for the i-voting system have also been adapted to make shopping , tax returns and all administrative processes possible and secure online . even the country 's administration has embraced the technology and has moved towards e-government , thus increasing political communication and information via the internet . it is no surprise , therefore , that the estonians will become the first nation worldwide to choose their government online . electoral monitoring body skeptical over security however , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , the body which observes all elections in europe , views the on-line development , with skepticism , with many officials doubting the level of protection and security of information .
but tarvy martins is convinced that the procedure is fool-proof .
" this is like a double envelope .
the choice is encoded and then sealed .
it is quite difficult to cheat . " the biggest technical challenge of the i-voting system is the authorization and identification of the user as an entitled voter , while making sure that the vote remains anonymous . " technically , this is not a big problem , " explains dieter otten , a member of the german federal ministry of economy and technology 's research group into electronic voting .
" since the 1980s there has been the principle of the digital signature and asymmetrical encoding . "
he also believes that high encoding technology makes the security and implementation of online elections " fool-proof . " " the bigger challenge is communication , " remembers otten .
it has been more difficult to persuade lawyers and politicians of the security of online voting than to design a functioning system .
the people who have to decide on whether to use the system , otten says , are dealing with something they do n't fully understand . internet-doubters holding back german progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is behind estonia in terms of election technology those with doubts and power in germany prevented the last election in 2005 from being an e-lection and it remains increasingly unlikely that a change in opinion will take place in the near future . " i-voting , for judicial and technical reasons , does not do justice to the special requirements of political elections in germany at the moment , " says annette ziesig of the ministry of internal affairs . dieter otten accuses germany of being obsessed with security to the point that the measures brought in to protect the traditional voting process can be more expensive than developing i-voting to fit the needs of the german electoral system .
he believes , in time , germany will follow the estonians into a new age of voting . back in estonia , i-voting is becoming the norm .
the system was already in place for the 2005 local elections , and last week the dress rehearsal took place for the parliamentary elections .
in a surreal test of the system , an elk , a deer and a wild boar went head to head for the title of " king of the wood . "
because the animal vote was just a test , only those creatures involved know who finally came out with the woodland crown . coalition partners out in front in forecasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king of the wood ?
prime minister andrus ansip no such mystery will surround the result of sunday 's human poll with surveys already putting the biggest partners in the government coalition - the reform party and the center party - out in front .
despite forecasts to the contrary , the vote could be far from a shoo-in for the incumbent prime minister andrus ansip 's reform party . whatever the result , estonia will have taken a big step in leading the rest of europe - and the world - towards a new process of electoral voting . ina rottscheidt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de estonia prepares to go to the polls in first e-lection almost one million estonians go to the polls this sunday to elect a new parliament .

he was unable to specify their number . witnesses said numerous germans had played a major role in the street riots on friday night .
one person was injured by protestors throwing paving stones , setting cars on fire and putting up barricades . according to the ritzau news agency , german and danish authorities have increased border controls to prevent more violent protestors slipping into denmark en route to copenhagen out of solidarity with the danish protest . on saturday night , the violence was limited to scuffles between police and small groups of protesters who threw rocks and set fire to trash bins and barricades , but the unrest did not escalate into the full-scale riots of the two previous nights . " we are very happy that the situation was so quiet , " police spokesman lars borg said .
" the people who want to demonstrate have been more aware that the things they are doing are not the right things to do . " arrests continue despite quieter night bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police launched raids on gangs of protestors more than 30 people were arrested near the christiania hippie enclave after protesters built barricades on a major street and set them on fire in the early hours of the morning , police said . nearly 300 rioters were arrested earlier in copenhagen after police moved against an estimated 1,000 mainly teenagers , some hurling petrol bombs and stones .
police said a hard core wearing masks erected barriers and set fire to these and to cars , smashed shop windows and vandalized a school before melting away . a crowd also gathered outside city hall and prepared to march to the umgdomhuset , a building some two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- away , which has acquired a cult reputation over the last 25 years as a home to underground culture . its inhabitants were forcibly evicted on thursday , prompting two nights of violence after thursday 's dawn police raid .
the ungdomshuset has been a haven for rebels , punks and squatters since the 1980s when the city of copenhagen gave the groups permission to move into the youth centre . protestors head for youth center at heart of unrest bildunterschrift : the ungdomshuset was recently sold to the christian group fadershuset , which requested the eviction of the youths .
an august 2006 court ruling ordered the occupants to be evicted from the centre , which they insist belongs to them . the building has been a popular hang-out for copenhagen 's alternative society , serving as a venue for concerts , plays and debates .
big stars such as icelandic pop artist björk have performed at the venue . demonstrators carried banners saturday saying : " no to police violence , " and " keep the youth centre " while large numbers of police were on standby . line barfoed , spokesperson of the unity party , the former communist party , appealed to copenhagen 's mayor to seek " a political solution to the current crisis . "
she also called on police to " avoid any escalation of violence and not arrest citizens showing solidarity with young people . " supporters call for political solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violence and police operation has been costly " this entire affair is going to cost the authorities much more than it would have done if they had left this historic house with young people , " she also warned . rasmus willig , chair of the danish sociologists ' association , said it was irresponsible to take the community house away from the young people after it had served as a focal point for underground culture and a great attraction among visitors to denmark . in all , 643 people have been arrested , including 140 foreigners from other european nations and the united states , since the clashes started thursday .
they included 20 swedes , 20 norwegians and 25 germans , police said .

" a total of 288,906 voters had cast their votes by midday , making up 32.3 percent of all eligible voters , " the election commission said in a statement . in the last parliamentary elections , in 2003 - the year before estonia joined the eu - turnout at midday was 28.6 percent . since then , estonia 's economy has powered ahead , growing by 11.5 percent last year , and the baltic state has earned itself a reputation as a high-tech leader . " things are going fine in estonia , but people must come out and say who should govern next , " 31-year-old siim lepik told afp at a busy polling station in tallinn .
" those who do n't vote wo n't have the right to criticize the state of affairs in the next four years , " he said . sunday 's turnout figure included some 170,000 people who cast ballots in advance voting earlier this week , of which 30,275 voted from a home or office computer in the world 's first national e-vote . internet vote under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian pm ansip has no qualms about online voting the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said the internet vote was one of the issues its team of election observers would focus on . " we 're very keen to learn how estonia uses remote voting on the internet in parliamentary elections , because estonia is the first in the world to use it , " osce spokeswoman urdur gunnarsdottir said . " also , in all osce countries which have significant national minorities , we look at their situation , how they can exercise their rights , " she said . russian officials have repeatedly complained that estonia is violating the rights of the baltic state 's large ethnic-russian minority , the legacy of the policy of " russifying " the baltics carried out by the soviets during five decades of occupation . around seven percent of the 1.34 million people who live in estonia still hold russian passports , and a further nine percent have no formal nationality .
neither group if allowed to vote . russia watches as former soviet state leaves past behind tensions between estonia and its former ruler were ratcheted up further last month when the outgoing estonian parliament voted to move a world war ii monument to soviet red army soldiers , who chased the nazis out of the baltics , from its place of prominence in the center of tallinn . but the divisive issue of relations with russia was expected to have little impact on the election result . only two of the 11 parties jostling for a seat in parliament campaigned on an ethnic russian ticket , and analysts gave them long odds on getting into the single-chamber legislature . " they are too marginal and not seen as trustworthy , even by the russians , " political scientist toonis saarts of tallinn university said . polling stations are due to close at 8:00 pm cet , with preliminary results expected around midnight . incumbent coalition on course to retain power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edgar savisaar a survey by the emor polling agency published on the eve of sunday 's vote suggested that the two main partners in the ruling coalition - the center party of economy and communications minister edgar savisaar and prime minister andrus ansip 's reform party - would each garner 26 percent of the vote . if they do manage to get those scores , they would be the first sitting government to be returned to power , and would enjoy between them a comfortable majority in the 101-strong single-chamber parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de estonia 's e-lection voting begins with doubts over security the parliamentary elections in estonia could be considered a world premiere : the people of the baltic state are the first to vote for a new parliament via the internet .

dw-world.de spoke to stefan kramer , the council 's secretary general , during a recent berlin conference on " religion and integration . " dw-world : the term " integration " is one of the most widely used in politics right now .
how do you define the term ? integration means becoming a part of society and enjoying equal rights , without losing sight of or repudiating one 's own roots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan kramer it should n't be about set standards of what integration means - like whether one enjoys german cuisine or not .
i think there are much more important values that define a society , and which one must share and adjust to .
if we could get to the point that jews , muslims , christians and atheists are proud of being germans or of living in germany , then i would think that we have achieved our goals .
integration , however , is a two-way street , and it should not be a form of coercion . if integration is , as you say , a two-way street , what can the majority in society do to help the process ? integration of people from different religions or those socialized in a different cultural context always means the creation of a new society to some extent .
to expect or to believe that the majority of society should n't change , or that migrants or minorities have to subordinate themselves to the larger culture , is completely outdated and unrealistic . take a look at the united states , australia or canada - the traditional countries of immigrants .
they demonstrate that immigrants are not subordinated , but integrated .
the fact is , a culture changes when immigrants are integrated .
it changes in a positive way because people realize that it 's an enriching process , and that society grows from that process , despite all the challenges and difficulties that may come along the way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has long become a multicultural society i do n't want to disregard the fears which the so-called " germans " have regarding an influx of foreigners , other cultures or other religions .
people can only respect other people 's values or those of other faiths when they have a good sense of their own .
i have a feeling that many people in various facets of german society have no sense of their personal values or beliefs and that is why they are intolerant of others or fear foreigners who come here .
that 's why we have to take a good , hard look at ourselves and work on our own principles and values before we can tell other people how they have to behave and fulfill our expectations . in your speech , you said that a dialogue between religions is the only rational way of approaching the clash between religions . how committed are jews to that process ? it 's not the only way , but it 's an important one .
talking can do no harm .
we are doing our best to hold bilateral talks with various partners , including muslim associations .
we are not always doing it publicly , because we are not interested in earning points for our diligence , but rather in establishing bridges of confidence to other people - despite the existing difficulties and differences .
after all , it 's not really organizations that are talking to other , but people .
small , but important steps are made in this direction all the time . a great deal of problems arise when religion is mixed up with politics .
how can this be avoided ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitic message appeared recently on the walls of a jewish school and kindergarten in berlin when religion is abused by politics , that 's always bad , regardless of what religion we 're talking about .
this is a problem with christianity , judaism , islam and other religions .
we have to try to keep politics out of these areas as much as possible , but we should also not live in an ivory tower and believe that we could conduct this kind of dialogue without resorting to any political arguments .
politics is a part of this society , just as religion and other basic values are .
it 's for each individual to decide how much he wants to keep these separate from each other . i think that what we 're missing is a civilized way of debating our problems .
debating is good if it 's about finding a better solution for our problems and it 's bad if it 's about converting or trying to hurt somebody , which is what , unfortunately , happens all to often in our public discussions .
the result of this negative form of discussion is silence , the feeling of not being understood , of having to find a different way of expressing oneself , which often leads to violence .
and that 's exactly what we should avoid . anti-semitism can be very damaging to the integration process .
what can be done against it ? i 'm careful about such generalizations , but the fact is that anti-semitism is , for instance , on the rise in the muslim community in germany , and that it 's increasingly prone to violence .
we agree with the majority of muslim organizations that we need to do something about it together .
at the same time , and i say it openly , jews in germany and other countries are not immune to stereotypes , clichés and prejudices about muslims , perhaps not to the same extent and certainly not exhibiting the same willingness to violence .
but there are things on both sides where we still have homework to do .
we 're working on finding possible solutions .

dw-world.de spoke to stefan kramer , the council 's secretary general , during a recent berlin conference on " religion and integration . " dw-world : the term " integration " is one of the most widely used in politics right now .
how do you define the term ? integration means becoming a part of society and enjoying equal rights , without losing sight of or repudiating one 's own roots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan kramer it should n't be about set standards of what integration means - like whether one enjoys german cuisine or not .
i think there are much more important values that define a society , and which one must share and adjust to .
if we could get to the point that jews , muslims , christians and atheists are proud of being germans or of living in germany , then i would think that we have achieved our goals .
integration , however , is a two-way street , and it should not be a form of coercion . if integration is , as you say , a two-way street , what can the majority in society do to help the process ? integration of people from different religions or those socialized in a different cultural context always means the creation of a new society to some extent .
to expect or to believe that the majority of society should n't change , or that migrants or minorities have to subordinate themselves to the larger culture , is completely outdated and unrealistic . take a look at the united states , australia or canada - the traditional countries of immigrants .
they demonstrate that immigrants are not subordinated , but integrated .
the fact is , a culture changes when immigrants are integrated .
it changes in a positive way because people realize that it 's an enriching process , and that society grows from that process , despite all the challenges and difficulties that may come along the way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has long become a multicultural society i do n't want to disregard the fears which the so-called " germans " have regarding an influx of foreigners , other cultures or other religions .
people can only respect other people 's values or those of other faiths when they have a good sense of their own .
i have a feeling that many people in various facets of german society have no sense of their personal values or beliefs and that is why they are intolerant of others or fear foreigners who come here .
that 's why we have to take a good , hard look at ourselves and work on our own principles and values before we can tell other people how they have to behave and fulfill our expectations . in your speech , you said that a dialogue between religions is the only rational way of approaching the clash between religions . how committed are jews to that process ? it 's not the only way , but it 's an important one .
talking can do no harm .
we are doing our best to hold bilateral talks with various partners , including muslim associations .
we are not always doing it publicly , because we are not interested in earning points for our diligence , but rather in establishing bridges of confidence to other people - despite the existing difficulties and differences .
after all , it 's not really organizations that are talking to other , but people .
small , but important steps are made in this direction all the time . a great deal of problems arise when religion is mixed up with politics .
how can this be avoided ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitic message appeared recently on the walls of a jewish school and kindergarten in berlin when religion is abused by politics , that 's always bad , regardless of what religion we 're talking about .
this is a problem with christianity , judaism , islam and other religions .
we have to try to keep politics out of these areas as much as possible , but we should also not live in an ivory tower and believe that we could conduct this kind of dialogue without resorting to any political arguments .
politics is a part of this society , just as religion and other basic values are .
it 's for each individual to decide how much he wants to keep these separate from each other . i think that what we 're missing is a civilized way of debating our problems .
debating is good if it 's about finding a better solution for our problems and it 's bad if it 's about converting or trying to hurt somebody , which is what , unfortunately , happens all to often in our public discussions .
the result of this negative form of discussion is silence , the feeling of not being understood , of having to find a different way of expressing oneself , which often leads to violence .
and that 's exactly what we should avoid . anti-semitism can be very damaging to the integration process .
what can be done against it ? i 'm careful about such generalizations , but the fact is that anti-semitism is , for instance , on the rise in the muslim community in germany , and that it 's increasingly prone to violence .
we agree with the majority of muslim organizations that we need to do something about it together .
at the same time , and i say it openly , jews in germany and other countries are not immune to stereotypes , clichés and prejudices about muslims , perhaps not to the same extent and certainly not exhibiting the same willingness to violence .
but there are things on both sides where we still have homework to do .
we 're working on finding possible solutions .
i 'm not saying that all this is easy and working out wonderfully , but it is important that we are talking and that we 're aware of the crisis . aladdin sarhan interviewed stefan kramer -lrb- als / tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's jews say nursery attack shows anti-semitism still alive the leader of berlin 's jewish community said on thursday that an attack on a jewish nursery school which was daubed with swastikas showed anti-semitism was still a threat .

however , critics of the system fear security gaps . according to one of the project managers behind the i-voting system , the procedure is quick and easy .
the voter pushes the electronic chip of his identity card into a reader , calls up the special electoral web page on the internet , gives two pin codes and puts his cross beside one of the parties .
" this takes no longer than 15 seconds , " says tarvy martins . up until late on thursday evening last week , about 940,000 voters registered to vote in sunday 's internet election .
after a test run during the local elections in 2005 , the number of voters accepting the i-voting system has sky-rocketed . to ease the vote , the necessary card readers have been installed in all public places with internet connections in estonia and many private individuals have bought their own home reader so they can vote from the comfort of their own home . estonia miles ahead in internet coverage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the most remote areas are online the baltic state is one of the most internet-savvy countries in the european union due to a burst of technological development soon after its independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
even in the most remote areas of the country , one can use wireless technology to surf .
the pin numbers used for the i-voting system have also been adapted to make shopping , tax returns and all administrative processes possible and secure online . even the country 's administration has embraced the technology and has moved towards e-government , thus increasing political communication and information via the internet . it is no surprise , therefore , that the estonians will become the first nation worldwide to choose their government online . electoral monitoring body skeptical over security however , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , the body which observes all elections in europe , views the on-line development , with skepticism , with many officials doubting the level of protection and security of information .
but tarvy martins is convinced that the procedure is fool-proof .
" this is like a double envelope .
the choice is encoded and then sealed .
it is quite difficult to cheat . " the biggest technical challenge of the i-voting system is the authorization and identification of the user as an entitled voter , while making sure that the vote remains anonymous . " technically , this is not a big problem , " explains dieter otten , a member of the german federal ministry of economy and technology 's research group into electronic voting .
" since the 1980s there has been the principle of the digital signature and asymmetrical encoding . "
he also believes that high encoding technology makes the security and implementation of online elections " fool-proof . " " the bigger challenge is communication , " remembers otten .
it has been more difficult to persuade lawyers and politicians of the security of online voting than to design a functioning system .
the people who have to decide on whether to use the system , otten says , are dealing with something they do n't fully understand . internet-doubters holding back german progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is behind estonia in terms of election technology those with doubts and power in germany prevented the last election in 2005 from being an e-lection and it remains increasingly unlikely that a change in opinion will take place in the near future . " i-voting , for judicial and technical reasons , does not do justice to the special requirements of political elections in germany at the moment , " says annette ziesig of the ministry of internal affairs . dieter otten accuses germany of being obsessed with security to the point that the measures brought in to protect the traditional voting process can be more expensive than developing i-voting to fit the needs of the german electoral system .
he believes , in time , germany will follow the estonians into a new age of voting . back in estonia , i-voting is becoming the norm .
the system was already in place for the 2005 local elections , and last week the dress rehearsal took place for the parliamentary elections .

prime minister andrus ansip no such mystery will surround the result of sunday 's human poll with surveys already putting the biggest partners in the government coalition - the reform party and the center party - out in front .
despite forecasts to the contrary , the vote could be far from a shoo-in for the incumbent prime minister andrus ansip 's reform party . whatever the result , estonia will have taken a big step in leading the rest of europe - and the world - towards a new process of electoral voting . ina rottscheidt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de estonia prepares to go to the polls in first e-lection almost one million estonians go to the polls this sunday to elect a new parliament .

" a total of 288,906 voters had cast their votes by midday , making up 32.3 percent of all eligible voters , " the election commission said in a statement . in the last parliamentary elections , in 2003 - the year before estonia joined the eu - turnout at midday was 28.6 percent . since then , estonia 's economy has powered ahead , growing by 11.5 percent last year , and the baltic state has earned itself a reputation as a high-tech leader . " things are going fine in estonia , but people must come out and say who should govern next , " 31-year-old siim lepik told afp at a busy polling station in tallinn .
" those who do n't vote wo n't have the right to criticize the state of affairs in the next four years , " he said . sunday 's turnout figure included some 170,000 people who cast ballots in advance voting earlier this week , of which 30,275 voted from a home or office computer in the world 's first national e-vote . internet vote under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian pm ansip has no qualms about online voting the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said the internet vote was one of the issues its team of election observers would focus on . " we 're very keen to learn how estonia uses remote voting on the internet in parliamentary elections , because estonia is the first in the world to use it , " osce spokeswoman urdur gunnarsdottir said . " also , in all osce countries which have significant national minorities , we look at their situation , how they can exercise their rights , " she said . russian officials have repeatedly complained that estonia is violating the rights of the baltic state 's large ethnic-russian minority , the legacy of the policy of " russifying " the baltics carried out by the soviets during five decades of occupation . around seven percent of the 1.34 million people who live in estonia still hold russian passports , and a further nine percent have no formal nationality .
neither group if allowed to vote . russia watches as former soviet state leaves past behind tensions between estonia and its former ruler were ratcheted up further last month when the outgoing estonian parliament voted to move a world war ii monument to soviet red army soldiers , who chased the nazis out of the baltics , from its place of prominence in the center of tallinn . but the divisive issue of relations with russia was expected to have little impact on the election result . only two of the 11 parties jostling for a seat in parliament campaigned on an ethnic russian ticket , and analysts gave them long odds on getting into the single-chamber legislature . " they are too marginal and not seen as trustworthy , even by the russians , " political scientist toonis saarts of tallinn university said . polling stations are due to close at 8:00 pm cet , with preliminary results expected around midnight . incumbent coalition on course to retain power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edgar savisaar a survey by the emor polling agency published on the eve of sunday 's vote suggested that the two main partners in the ruling coalition - the center party of economy and communications minister edgar savisaar and prime minister andrus ansip 's reform party - would each garner 26 percent of the vote . if they do manage to get those scores , they would be the first sitting government to be returned to power , and would enjoy between them a comfortable majority in the 101-strong single-chamber parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de estonia 's e-lection voting begins with doubts over security the parliamentary elections in estonia could be considered a world premiere : the people of the baltic state are the first to vote for a new parliament via the internet .

" a total of 288,906 voters had cast their votes by midday , making up 32.3 percent of all eligible voters , " the election commission said in a statement . in the last parliamentary elections , in 2003 - the year before estonia joined the eu - turnout at midday was 28.6 percent . since then , estonia 's economy has powered ahead , growing by 11.5 percent last year , and the baltic state has earned itself a reputation as a high-tech leader . " things are going fine in estonia , but people must come out and say who should govern next , " 31-year-old siim lepik told afp at a busy polling station in tallinn .
" those who do n't vote wo n't have the right to criticize the state of affairs in the next four years , " he said . sunday 's turnout figure included some 170,000 people who cast ballots in advance voting earlier this week , of which 30,275 voted from a home or office computer in the world 's first national e-vote . internet vote under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian pm ansip has no qualms about online voting the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said the internet vote was one of the issues its team of election observers would focus on . " we 're very keen to learn how estonia uses remote voting on the internet in parliamentary elections , because estonia is the first in the world to use it , " osce spokeswoman urdur gunnarsdottir said . " also , in all osce countries which have significant national minorities , we look at their situation , how they can exercise their rights , " she said . russian officials have repeatedly complained that estonia is violating the rights of the baltic state 's large ethnic-russian minority , the legacy of the policy of " russifying " the baltics carried out by the soviets during five decades of occupation . around seven percent of the 1.34 million people who live in estonia still hold russian passports , and a further nine percent have no formal nationality .
neither group if allowed to vote . russia watches as former soviet state leaves past behind tensions between estonia and its former ruler were ratcheted up further last month when the outgoing estonian parliament voted to move a world war ii monument to soviet red army soldiers , who chased the nazis out of the baltics , from its place of prominence in the center of tallinn . but the divisive issue of relations with russia was expected to have little impact on the election result . only two of the 11 parties jostling for a seat in parliament campaigned on an ethnic russian ticket , and analysts gave them long odds on getting into the single-chamber legislature . " they are too marginal and not seen as trustworthy , even by the russians , " political scientist toonis saarts of tallinn university said . polling stations are due to close at 8:00 pm cet , with preliminary results expected around midnight . incumbent coalition on course to retain power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edgar savisaar a survey by the emor polling agency published on the eve of sunday 's vote suggested that the two main partners in the ruling coalition - the center party of economy and communications minister edgar savisaar and prime minister andrus ansip 's reform party - would each garner 26 percent of the vote . if they do manage to get those scores , they would be the first sitting government to be returned to power , and would enjoy between them a comfortable majority in the 101-strong single-chamber parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de estonia 's e-lection voting begins with doubts over security the parliamentary elections in estonia could be considered a world premiere : the people of the baltic state are the first to vote for a new parliament via the internet .
however , critics of the system fear security gaps .

he was unable to specify their number . witnesses said numerous germans had played a major role in the street riots on friday night .
one person was injured by protestors throwing paving stones , setting cars on fire and putting up barricades . according to the ritzau news agency , german and danish authorities have increased border controls to prevent more violent protestors slipping into denmark en route to copenhagen out of solidarity with the danish protest . on saturday night , the violence was limited to scuffles between police and small groups of protesters who threw rocks and set fire to trash bins and barricades , but the unrest did not escalate into the full-scale riots of the two previous nights . " we are very happy that the situation was so quiet , " police spokesman lars borg said .
" the people who want to demonstrate have been more aware that the things they are doing are not the right things to do . " arrests continue despite quieter night bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police launched raids on gangs of protestors more than 30 people were arrested near the christiania hippie enclave after protesters built barricades on a major street and set them on fire in the early hours of the morning , police said . nearly 300 rioters were arrested earlier in copenhagen after police moved against an estimated 1,000 mainly teenagers , some hurling petrol bombs and stones .
police said a hard core wearing masks erected barriers and set fire to these and to cars , smashed shop windows and vandalized a school before melting away . a crowd also gathered outside city hall and prepared to march to the umgdomhuset , a building some two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- away , which has acquired a cult reputation over the last 25 years as a home to underground culture . its inhabitants were forcibly evicted on thursday , prompting two nights of violence after thursday 's dawn police raid .
the ungdomshuset has been a haven for rebels , punks and squatters since the 1980s when the city of copenhagen gave the groups permission to move into the youth centre . protestors head for youth center at heart of unrest bildunterschrift : the ungdomshuset was recently sold to the christian group fadershuset , which requested the eviction of the youths .
an august 2006 court ruling ordered the occupants to be evicted from the centre , which they insist belongs to them . the building has been a popular hang-out for copenhagen 's alternative society , serving as a venue for concerts , plays and debates .
big stars such as icelandic pop artist björk have performed at the venue . demonstrators carried banners saturday saying : " no to police violence , " and " keep the youth centre " while large numbers of police were on standby . line barfoed , spokesperson of the unity party , the former communist party , appealed to copenhagen 's mayor to seek " a political solution to the current crisis . "
she also called on police to " avoid any escalation of violence and not arrest citizens showing solidarity with young people . " supporters call for political solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violence and police operation has been costly " this entire affair is going to cost the authorities much more than it would have done if they had left this historic house with young people , " she also warned . rasmus willig , chair of the danish sociologists ' association , said it was irresponsible to take the community house away from the young people after it had served as a focal point for underground culture and a great attraction among visitors to denmark . in all , 643 people have been arrested , including 140 foreigners from other european nations and the united states , since the clashes started thursday .
they included 20 swedes , 20 norwegians and 25 germans , police said .

dw-world.de spoke to stefan kramer , the council 's secretary general , during a recent berlin conference on " religion and integration . " dw-world : the term " integration " is one of the most widely used in politics right now .
how do you define the term ? integration means becoming a part of society and enjoying equal rights , without losing sight of or repudiating one 's own roots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan kramer it should n't be about set standards of what integration means - like whether one enjoys german cuisine or not .
i think there are much more important values that define a society , and which one must share and adjust to .
if we could get to the point that jews , muslims , christians and atheists are proud of being germans or of living in germany , then i would think that we have achieved our goals .
integration , however , is a two-way street , and it should not be a form of coercion . if integration is , as you say , a two-way street , what can the majority in society do to help the process ? integration of people from different religions or those socialized in a different cultural context always means the creation of a new society to some extent .
to expect or to believe that the majority of society should n't change , or that migrants or minorities have to subordinate themselves to the larger culture , is completely outdated and unrealistic . take a look at the united states , australia or canada - the traditional countries of immigrants .
they demonstrate that immigrants are not subordinated , but integrated .
the fact is , a culture changes when immigrants are integrated .
it changes in a positive way because people realize that it 's an enriching process , and that society grows from that process , despite all the challenges and difficulties that may come along the way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has long become a multicultural society i do n't want to disregard the fears which the so-called " germans " have regarding an influx of foreigners , other cultures or other religions .
people can only respect other people 's values or those of other faiths when they have a good sense of their own .
i have a feeling that many people in various facets of german society have no sense of their personal values or beliefs and that is why they are intolerant of others or fear foreigners who come here .
that 's why we have to take a good , hard look at ourselves and work on our own principles and values before we can tell other people how they have to behave and fulfill our expectations . in your speech , you said that a dialogue between religions is the only rational way of approaching the clash between religions . how committed are jews to that process ? it 's not the only way , but it 's an important one .
talking can do no harm .
we are doing our best to hold bilateral talks with various partners , including muslim associations .
we are not always doing it publicly , because we are not interested in earning points for our diligence , but rather in establishing bridges of confidence to other people - despite the existing difficulties and differences .
after all , it 's not really organizations that are talking to other , but people .
small , but important steps are made in this direction all the time . a great deal of problems arise when religion is mixed up with politics .
how can this be avoided ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitic message appeared recently on the walls of a jewish school and kindergarten in berlin when religion is abused by politics , that 's always bad , regardless of what religion we 're talking about .
this is a problem with christianity , judaism , islam and other religions .
we have to try to keep politics out of these areas as much as possible , but we should also not live in an ivory tower and believe that we could conduct this kind of dialogue without resorting to any political arguments .
politics is a part of this society , just as religion and other basic values are .
it 's for each individual to decide how much he wants to keep these separate from each other . i think that what we 're missing is a civilized way of debating our problems .
debating is good if it 's about finding a better solution for our problems and it 's bad if it 's about converting or trying to hurt somebody , which is what , unfortunately , happens all to often in our public discussions .
the result of this negative form of discussion is silence , the feeling of not being understood , of having to find a different way of expressing oneself , which often leads to violence .
and that 's exactly what we should avoid . anti-semitism can be very damaging to the integration process .
what can be done against it ? i 'm careful about such generalizations , but the fact is that anti-semitism is , for instance , on the rise in the muslim community in germany , and that it 's increasingly prone to violence .
we agree with the majority of muslim organizations that we need to do something about it together .
at the same time , and i say it openly , jews in germany and other countries are not immune to stereotypes , clichés and prejudices about muslims , perhaps not to the same extent and certainly not exhibiting the same willingness to violence .
but there are things on both sides where we still have homework to do .
we 're working on finding possible solutions .
i 'm not saying that all this is easy and working out wonderfully , but it is important that we are talking and that we 're aware of the crisis . aladdin sarhan interviewed stefan kramer -lrb- als / tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's jews say nursery attack shows anti-semitism still alive the leader of berlin 's jewish community said on thursday that an attack on a jewish nursery school which was daubed with swastikas showed anti-semitism was still a threat .

dw-world.de spoke to stefan kramer , the council 's secretary general , during a recent berlin conference on " religion and integration . " dw-world : the term " integration " is one of the most widely used in politics right now .
how do you define the term ? integration means becoming a part of society and enjoying equal rights , without losing sight of or repudiating one 's own roots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan kramer it should n't be about set standards of what integration means - like whether one enjoys german cuisine or not .
i think there are much more important values that define a society , and which one must share and adjust to .
if we could get to the point that jews , muslims , christians and atheists are proud of being germans or of living in germany , then i would think that we have achieved our goals .
integration , however , is a two-way street , and it should not be a form of coercion . if integration is , as you say , a two-way street , what can the majority in society do to help the process ? integration of people from different religions or those socialized in a different cultural context always means the creation of a new society to some extent .
to expect or to believe that the majority of society should n't change , or that migrants or minorities have to subordinate themselves to the larger culture , is completely outdated and unrealistic . take a look at the united states , australia or canada - the traditional countries of immigrants .
they demonstrate that immigrants are not subordinated , but integrated .
the fact is , a culture changes when immigrants are integrated .
it changes in a positive way because people realize that it 's an enriching process , and that society grows from that process , despite all the challenges and difficulties that may come along the way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has long become a multicultural society i do n't want to disregard the fears which the so-called " germans " have regarding an influx of foreigners , other cultures or other religions .
people can only respect other people 's values or those of other faiths when they have a good sense of their own .
i have a feeling that many people in various facets of german society have no sense of their personal values or beliefs and that is why they are intolerant of others or fear foreigners who come here .
that 's why we have to take a good , hard look at ourselves and work on our own principles and values before we can tell other people how they have to behave and fulfill our expectations . in your speech , you said that a dialogue between religions is the only rational way of approaching the clash between religions . how committed are jews to that process ? it 's not the only way , but it 's an important one .
talking can do no harm .
we are doing our best to hold bilateral talks with various partners , including muslim associations .
we are not always doing it publicly , because we are not interested in earning points for our diligence , but rather in establishing bridges of confidence to other people - despite the existing difficulties and differences .
after all , it 's not really organizations that are talking to other , but people .
small , but important steps are made in this direction all the time . a great deal of problems arise when religion is mixed up with politics .
how can this be avoided ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitic message appeared recently on the walls of a jewish school and kindergarten in berlin when religion is abused by politics , that 's always bad , regardless of what religion we 're talking about .
this is a problem with christianity , judaism , islam and other religions .
we have to try to keep politics out of these areas as much as possible , but we should also not live in an ivory tower and believe that we could conduct this kind of dialogue without resorting to any political arguments .
politics is a part of this society , just as religion and other basic values are .
it 's for each individual to decide how much he wants to keep these separate from each other . i think that what we 're missing is a civilized way of debating our problems .
debating is good if it 's about finding a better solution for our problems and it 's bad if it 's about converting or trying to hurt somebody , which is what , unfortunately , happens all to often in our public discussions .
the result of this negative form of discussion is silence , the feeling of not being understood , of having to find a different way of expressing oneself , which often leads to violence .
and that 's exactly what we should avoid . anti-semitism can be very damaging to the integration process .
what can be done against it ? i 'm careful about such generalizations , but the fact is that anti-semitism is , for instance , on the rise in the muslim community in germany , and that it 's increasingly prone to violence .
we agree with the majority of muslim organizations that we need to do something about it together .
at the same time , and i say it openly , jews in germany and other countries are not immune to stereotypes , clichés and prejudices about muslims , perhaps not to the same extent and certainly not exhibiting the same willingness to violence .
but there are things on both sides where we still have homework to do .
we 're working on finding possible solutions .
i 'm not saying that all this is easy and working out wonderfully , but it is important that we are talking and that we 're aware of the crisis . aladdin sarhan interviewed stefan kramer -lrb- als / tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's jews say nursery attack shows anti-semitism still alive the leader of berlin 's jewish community said on thursday that an attack on a jewish nursery school which was daubed with swastikas showed anti-semitism was still a threat .

" a total of 288,906 voters had cast their votes by midday , making up 32.3 percent of all eligible voters , " the election commission said in a statement . in the last parliamentary elections , in 2003 - the year before estonia joined the eu - turnout at midday was 28.6 percent . since then , estonia 's economy has powered ahead , growing by 11.5 percent last year , and the baltic state has earned itself a reputation as a high-tech leader . " things are going fine in estonia , but people must come out and say who should govern next , " 31-year-old siim lepik told afp at a busy polling station in tallinn .
" those who do n't vote wo n't have the right to criticize the state of affairs in the next four years , " he said . sunday 's turnout figure included some 170,000 people who cast ballots in advance voting earlier this week , of which 30,275 voted from a home or office computer in the world 's first national e-vote . internet vote under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian pm ansip has no qualms about online voting the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said the internet vote was one of the issues its team of election observers would focus on . " we 're very keen to learn how estonia uses remote voting on the internet in parliamentary elections , because estonia is the first in the world to use it , " osce spokeswoman urdur gunnarsdottir said . " also , in all osce countries which have significant national minorities , we look at their situation , how they can exercise their rights , " she said . russian officials have repeatedly complained that estonia is violating the rights of the baltic state 's large ethnic-russian minority , the legacy of the policy of " russifying " the baltics carried out by the soviets during five decades of occupation . around seven percent of the 1.34 million people who live in estonia still hold russian passports , and a further nine percent have no formal nationality .
neither group if allowed to vote . russia watches as former soviet state leaves past behind tensions between estonia and its former ruler were ratcheted up further last month when the outgoing estonian parliament voted to move a world war ii monument to soviet red army soldiers , who chased the nazis out of the baltics , from its place of prominence in the center of tallinn . but the divisive issue of relations with russia was expected to have little impact on the election result . only two of the 11 parties jostling for a seat in parliament campaigned on an ethnic russian ticket , and analysts gave them long odds on getting into the single-chamber legislature . " they are too marginal and not seen as trustworthy , even by the russians , " political scientist toonis saarts of tallinn university said . polling stations are due to close at 8:00 pm cet , with preliminary results expected around midnight . incumbent coalition on course to retain power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edgar savisaar a survey by the emor polling agency published on the eve of sunday 's vote suggested that the two main partners in the ruling coalition - the center party of economy and communications minister edgar savisaar and prime minister andrus ansip 's reform party - would each garner 26 percent of the vote . if they do manage to get those scores , they would be the first sitting government to be returned to power , and would enjoy between them a comfortable majority in the 101-strong single-chamber parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de estonia 's e-lection voting begins with doubts over security the parliamentary elections in estonia could be considered a world premiere : the people of the baltic state are the first to vote for a new parliament via the internet .
however , critics of the system fear security gaps .
-lrb- 04.03.2007 -rrb- estonia prepares to go to the polls in first e-lection almost one million estonians go to the polls this sunday to elect a new parliament .
and while it will still be possible to mark a card with a cross in person , many will vote online in the first ever internet election .

dw-world.de spoke to stefan kramer , the council 's secretary general , during a recent berlin conference on " religion and integration . " dw-world : the term " integration " is one of the most widely used in politics right now .
how do you define the term ? integration means becoming a part of society and enjoying equal rights , without losing sight of or repudiating one 's own roots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan kramer it should n't be about set standards of what integration means - like whether one enjoys german cuisine or not .
i think there are much more important values that define a society , and which one must share and adjust to .
if we could get to the point that jews , muslims , christians and atheists are proud of being germans or of living in germany , then i would think that we have achieved our goals .
integration , however , is a two-way street , and it should not be a form of coercion . if integration is , as you say , a two-way street , what can the majority in society do to help the process ? integration of people from different religions or those socialized in a different cultural context always means the creation of a new society to some extent .
to expect or to believe that the majority of society should n't change , or that migrants or minorities have to subordinate themselves to the larger culture , is completely outdated and unrealistic . take a look at the united states , australia or canada - the traditional countries of immigrants .
they demonstrate that immigrants are not subordinated , but integrated .
the fact is , a culture changes when immigrants are integrated .
it changes in a positive way because people realize that it 's an enriching process , and that society grows from that process , despite all the challenges and difficulties that may come along the way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has long become a multicultural society i do n't want to disregard the fears which the so-called " germans " have regarding an influx of foreigners , other cultures or other religions .
people can only respect other people 's values or those of other faiths when they have a good sense of their own .
i have a feeling that many people in various facets of german society have no sense of their personal values or beliefs and that is why they are intolerant of others or fear foreigners who come here .
that 's why we have to take a good , hard look at ourselves and work on our own principles and values before we can tell other people how they have to behave and fulfill our expectations . in your speech , you said that a dialogue between religions is the only rational way of approaching the clash between religions . how committed are jews to that process ? it 's not the only way , but it 's an important one .
talking can do no harm .
we are doing our best to hold bilateral talks with various partners , including muslim associations .
we are not always doing it publicly , because we are not interested in earning points for our diligence , but rather in establishing bridges of confidence to other people - despite the existing difficulties and differences .
after all , it 's not really organizations that are talking to other , but people .
small , but important steps are made in this direction all the time . a great deal of problems arise when religion is mixed up with politics .
how can this be avoided ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitic message appeared recently on the walls of a jewish school and kindergarten in berlin when religion is abused by politics , that 's always bad , regardless of what religion we 're talking about .
this is a problem with christianity , judaism , islam and other religions .
we have to try to keep politics out of these areas as much as possible , but we should also not live in an ivory tower and believe that we could conduct this kind of dialogue without resorting to any political arguments .
politics is a part of this society , just as religion and other basic values are .
it 's for each individual to decide how much he wants to keep these separate from each other . i think that what we 're missing is a civilized way of debating our problems .
debating is good if it 's about finding a better solution for our problems and it 's bad if it 's about converting or trying to hurt somebody , which is what , unfortunately , happens all to often in our public discussions .
the result of this negative form of discussion is silence , the feeling of not being understood , of having to find a different way of expressing oneself , which often leads to violence .
and that 's exactly what we should avoid . anti-semitism can be very damaging to the integration process .
what can be done against it ? i 'm careful about such generalizations , but the fact is that anti-semitism is , for instance , on the rise in the muslim community in germany , and that it 's increasingly prone to violence .
we agree with the majority of muslim organizations that we need to do something about it together .
at the same time , and i say it openly , jews in germany and other countries are not immune to stereotypes , clichés and prejudices about muslims , perhaps not to the same extent and certainly not exhibiting the same willingness to violence .
but there are things on both sides where we still have homework to do .
we 're working on finding possible solutions .

it is unclear whether the 48-year-old will also perform at the event , which is due to take place on thursday .
jackson made his first official appearance in japan after being cleared of child molestation charges in 2005 .
earlier this year , the singer said that japan is " one of my favourite places in the entire world " .
" my fans in japan helped me achieve historic milestones in the music industry , " he added in a rare interview with the associated press news agency in january .
disappointed jackson is also attending a fan art contest in tokyo for those who are unable to afford tickets to the " platinum vip " party , which was originally scheduled for december .
the winning artists will have brunch with the singer and have their photographs taken with him .
organisers have refused to comment on any fee jackson may receive for his appearances .
jackson , who has lived in bahrain , france and ireland since his court case , appeared on stage at the world music awards in london last november .
but he disappointed fans by singing only a few lines of we are the world , when it was believed he would perform a version of his hit thriller .
