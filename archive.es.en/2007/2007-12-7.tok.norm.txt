serbia 's path to closer ties with the european union has been consistently blocked by its failure to arrest four war crimes suspects including mladic .
del ponte argued that if the eu signed a partnership accord before their arrest , " it will weaken the real -lrb- serbian -rrb- intention to give us the fugitives " .
" it will depend exclusively on the eu if we will have mladic in the hague in the next weeks and months , " del ponte told news agencies .
mladic and former bosnian serb president radovan karadzic are still at large , wanted on genocide charges during the 1991-95 bosnian war , including masterminding the 1995 srebrenica massacre of nearly 8,000 muslims .

serbia 's path to closer ties with the european union has been consistently blocked by its failure to arrest four war crimes suspects including mladic .
del ponte argued that if the eu signed a partnership accord before their arrest , " it will weaken the real -lrb- serbian -rrb- intention to give us the fugitives " .
" it will depend exclusively on the eu if we will have mladic in the hague in the next weeks and months , " del ponte told news agencies .
mladic and former bosnian serb president radovan karadzic are still at large , wanted on genocide charges during the 1991-95 bosnian war , including masterminding the 1995 srebrenica massacre of nearly 8,000 muslims .

the future of the province with its ethnic albanian majority has played a key role in her efforts to arrest mladic .
the un security council is also set to discuss the status of kosovo on monday - the last day of the un mandate on the serbian province , when serbia 's negotiations with kosovo formally end .

7 .
merkel promised to publicly speak out against mugabe 's corrupt government and contrast the economic chaos in zimbabwe with progress being made elsewhere in africa .
mugabe 's presence at the summit has posed a moral dilemma for many european leaders .
while african countries insisted on his presence , he is viewed as a dictator in the west .
british prime minister gordon brown cancelled after learning mugabe would attend .
merkel will take a more confrontational approach .
" this is such an important summit meeting that we should not let the presence of one country keep us from paying our respects to the rest of the continent , " merkel said wednesday .
europe wants more influence in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to strengthen economic ties with africa the eu recently restated its commitment to promoting democracy and human rights in any partnership with africa .
yet it 's also unlikely that merkel and other european leaders ' insistence on discussing human rights will derail eu efforts to increase economic ties with africa .
merkel , like many of her european counterparts , sees the summit as a rare chance to form a strategic alliance with africa on issues such as trade and security .
it 's the first time in seven years eu and african leaders have met .
along with important economic agreements , countries hope to discuss immigration and climate change .
the summit is also seen as being crucial to counteracting china 's growing sway on the continent .
europe is currently africa 's biggest trading partner , but china has been steadily increasing its aid , investments and influence in africa .
merkel 's ethical stance is heartfelt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with the dalai lama despite criticism from china growing up as the daughter of a lutheran minister in communist east germany , gave merkel personal experience with human rights issues .
merkel has said that she would never promote business at the expense of human rights .
" human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .
" they should never be opposed to each another . "
merkel has shown that she understands the linkage between democratic values and economic prosperity , said ulrike guerot , a senior policy fellow in the german office of the european council on foreign relations .
merkel has made human rights a cornerstone of her foreign policy .
she has not shied away from criticizing the human rights record of important trading partners like russia and china .
she has even chastized her ally united states president george bush for holding suspected terrorists without due process in guantanamo bay , cuba . her unwavering position has earned her respect from fellow christian democrats as well as internationally , guerot said .
on the other hand , merkel is not likely to derail talks with africa over her human rights stance , guerot said , as " it 's a twofold dialogue . "
criticism unlikely to sway mugabe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has been a lightning rod of criticism mugabe , 83 , came to power in 1980 after zimbabwe gained independence from britain .
along with being accused of a variety of human rights abuses , he is also blamed for sinking zimbabwe into an economic crisis .
unemployment in the country stands at 80 percent and inflation has reached some 3,700 percent in recent years .
yet the bilateral summit would n't have taken place without him .
many african leaders view him as a hero of independence and insisted on his presence in lisbon .
while brown boycotted the summit , nearly 80 other eu and african leaders will attend .
both brown 's boycott and merkel 's confrontation send mugabe an important message of disapproval , said dzikamai machingura , the national director of zimrights , a human rights group based in zimbabwe 's capital city of harare .
yet machingura hopes europe wo n't give mugabe 's government a blank check .
aid money without evidence of human rights improvements would be like " feeding a bully , " machingura said .
merkel also should n't be under any delusions that her tough talk will change the situation in zimbabwe .
most likely , when faced with criticism at the summit , mugabe will react arrogantly and dismissively , machingura predicted .
diplomacy will determine outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is a vital partner in africa it 's hard to predict how mugabe or other african leaders will comport themselves at the summit , said ross herbert , head of the governance program for the south african institute of international affairs .
there 's growing recognition among african leaders that human rights are an important part of bringing economic and democratic progress to their countries .
yet europeans will need to be careful in how they single out zimbabwe or sudan for criticism as there 's also a tradition in africa of " closing ranks against outside critics , " herbert said .
in the end , it 's criticism from other african leaders , not from europe , that could convince mugabe to change , machingura and herbert said .

it 's the first time in seven years eu and african leaders have met .
along with important economic agreements , countries hope to discuss immigration and climate change .
the summit is also seen as being crucial to counteracting china 's growing sway on the continent .
europe is currently africa 's biggest trading partner , but china has been steadily increasing its aid , investments and influence in africa .
merkel 's ethical stance is heartfelt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with the dalai lama despite criticism from china growing up as the daughter of a lutheran minister in communist east germany , gave merkel personal experience with human rights issues .
merkel has said that she would never promote business at the expense of human rights .
" human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .
" they should never be opposed to each another . "
merkel has shown that she understands the linkage between democratic values and economic prosperity , said ulrike guerot , a senior policy fellow in the german office of the european council on foreign relations .
merkel has made human rights a cornerstone of her foreign policy .
she has not shied away from criticizing the human rights record of important trading partners like russia and china .
she has even chastized her ally united states president george bush for holding suspected terrorists without due process in guantanamo bay , cuba . her unwavering position has earned her respect from fellow christian democrats as well as internationally , guerot said .
on the other hand , merkel is not likely to derail talks with africa over her human rights stance , guerot said , as " it 's a twofold dialogue . "

unemployment in the country stands at 80 percent and inflation has reached some 3,700 percent in recent years .
yet the bilateral summit would n't have taken place without him .
many african leaders view him as a hero of independence and insisted on his presence in lisbon .
while brown boycotted the summit , nearly 80 other eu and african leaders will attend .
both brown 's boycott and merkel 's confrontation send mugabe an important message of disapproval , said dzikamai machingura , the national director of zimrights , a human rights group based in zimbabwe 's capital city of harare .
yet machingura hopes europe wo n't give mugabe 's government a blank check .
aid money without evidence of human rights improvements would be like " feeding a bully , " machingura said .
merkel also should n't be under any delusions that her tough talk will change the situation in zimbabwe .

7 .
merkel promised to publicly speak out against mugabe 's corrupt government and contrast the economic chaos in zimbabwe with progress being made elsewhere in africa .
mugabe 's presence at the summit has posed a moral dilemma for many european leaders .
while african countries insisted on his presence , he is viewed as a dictator in the west .
british prime minister gordon brown cancelled after learning mugabe would attend .
merkel will take a more confrontational approach .
" this is such an important summit meeting that we should not let the presence of one country keep us from paying our respects to the rest of the continent , " merkel said wednesday .

one day after five boys were apparently murdered by their mother , the bodies of a young woman and her baby were found in a berlin apartment .

their mother , who had been undergoing psychiatric treatment , alerted doctors to what had happened . social services told reporters thursday that they had been in close contact with the family since august after one of the two fathers of the children reported difficulties .

after she failed to attend an appointment at a welfare office last week , a social worker went to her apartment .

police have ruled out both suicide and murder . on wednesday , dec .

their mother , who had been undergoing psychiatric treatment , alerted doctors to what had happened . social services told reporters thursday that they had been in close contact with the family since august after one of the two fathers of the children reported difficulties .
prosecutors said they were preparing charges of murder , but would take into account the woman 's diminished responsibility . earlier this week , a 28-year-old woman was arrested on serial murder charges after the remains of three newborns were found on an apartment balcony in the town of plauen in saxony .

they also agreed to rescind the non-profit status of groups associated with the far-right npd party . the interior ministers of the nation 's 16 states as well as federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble " consider scientology to be an organization that is not compatible with the constitution , " berlin interior minister erhart körting told reporters after a two-day meeting of the officials , on friday , dec .
7 . körting said germany 's domestic intelligence agencies would collect material that could possibly serve as the basis for a ban of the sect .
federal interior minister schäuble said there was not yet enough information to justify a ban . germany does not recognize scientology as a religion but sees it as a money-making venture .
the german authorities have viewed scientology with suspicion for years .
the group , which opened a center in berlin in january , has around 6,000 followers in germany .
no money for extreme right-wing the ministers also decided to prevent organizations close to the far-right npd party from gaining or retaining non-profit status or receiving state subsidies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd has avoided being banned so far " we 're going to the place that it hurts them the most , " said schleswig-holstein 's interior minister , ralf stegner . currently there are n't any such groups that get money from the state .
due to the npd 's presence in several regional parliaments , however , foundations associated with the party would theoretically have the right to apply for subsidies . germany has been debating whether to ban the npd for years , but so far every attempt has failed to establish that the party violates the country 's constitution . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but insiders say there are other factors at work . the indian army scrapped the deal with eads subsidiary , eurocopter - the largest manufacturer of civil and military helicopters in the world - amid newspaper reports about irregularities in the bidding process and the illegal use of middlemen .
" we will issue a fresh request for proposals in the next two or three months , " said sitanshu kar , a defence ministry spokesman .
kar said the ministry was not commenting on why the deal collapsed ; although he went on to say that newspaper reports about the bidding process were " more or less correct . "
setback for eads the news comes as a painful surprise to eads , not just because of the loss of the huge military deal , but also because of the hopes the european defence and aerospace group had pinned on india 's fast-growing civil aviation market for future sales of its airbus commercial jets .
only on wednesday this week , eads had expressed hope that its deal with india would be wrapped up soon .
the group had planned to renew india 's ageing soviet-era fleet with 37 light helicopters manufactured in europe , as well as oversee the production of an additional 160 choppers in india .
earlier this week , an unnamed indian official from the country 's defence acquisition committee told news agency afp that there was some justification for the accusations against eads .
" there are elements of truth in the complaints , especially the one involving an officer who was part of the evaluation committee while his brother headed the company that is eurocopter 's sole distributor in india , " the official said .
eads representatives in india have so far refused to comment on the indian government 's decision .
the company has said it complies with all french and european regulations concerning the bidding and evaluating process and the use of middlemen .

but insiders say there are other factors at work . the indian army scrapped the deal with eads subsidiary , eurocopter - the largest manufacturer of civil and military helicopters in the world - amid newspaper reports about irregularities in the bidding process and the illegal use of middlemen .
" we will issue a fresh request for proposals in the next two or three months , " said sitanshu kar , a defence ministry spokesman .
kar said the ministry was not commenting on why the deal collapsed ; although he went on to say that newspaper reports about the bidding process were " more or less correct . "
setback for eads the news comes as a painful surprise to eads , not just because of the loss of the huge military deal , but also because of the hopes the european defence and aerospace group had pinned on india 's fast-growing civil aviation market for future sales of its airbus commercial jets .
only on wednesday this week , eads had expressed hope that its deal with india would be wrapped up soon .
the group had planned to renew india 's ageing soviet-era fleet with 37 light helicopters manufactured in europe , as well as oversee the production of an additional 160 choppers in india .
earlier this week , an unnamed indian official from the country 's defence acquisition committee told news agency afp that there was some justification for the accusations against eads .
" there are elements of truth in the complaints , especially the one involving an officer who was part of the evaluation committee while his brother headed the company that is eurocopter 's sole distributor in india , " the official said .
eads representatives in india have so far refused to comment on the indian government 's decision .
the company has said it complies with all french and european regulations concerning the bidding and evaluating process and the use of middlemen .
insiders suspect us influence india put out the tender for 197 military helicopters in 2001 , and in february of this year , named eurocopter as the winner of the contract , choosing the company 's as 550 c3 fennec over us-based bell helicopter 's bell 407 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is keen to sell fighterjets to india next year speculation is rife among diplomats and industry insiders that washington put pressure on the indian government in order to win the contract back for bell helicopter .
the german business daily handelsblatt said that washington is exerting its growing influence in new delhi at a critical time , given india 's plans to buy 126 fighter jets next year in a deal worth some $ 10 billion .
eads is in the running with the eurofighter , but the us is represented with lockheed 's f-16 and boeing 's f-18 .

one day after five boys were apparently murdered by their mother , the bodies of a young woman and her baby were found in a berlin apartment .

their mother , who had been undergoing psychiatric treatment , alerted doctors to what had happened . social services told reporters thursday that they had been in close contact with the family since august after one of the two fathers of the children reported difficulties .
prosecutors said they were preparing charges of murder , but would take into account the woman 's diminished responsibility . earlier this week , a 28-year-old woman was arrested on serial murder charges after the remains of three newborns were found on an apartment balcony in the town of plauen in saxony .

one day after five boys were apparently murdered by their mother , the bodies of a young woman and her baby were found in a berlin apartment .
as the cases mount up , chancellor merkel said it is time to stop looking away . the 24-year-old woman , a drug user who allegedly lived alone with her 6-week-old baby , was believed to be hiv positive .
after she failed to attend an appointment at a welfare office last week , a social worker went to her apartment .
when no one answered , she called the police , who found the bodies .
police have ruled out both suicide and murder . on wednesday , dec .
5 , five children aged 3 to 9 were found suffocated at their home in darry , schleswig-holstein .
their mother , who had been undergoing psychiatric treatment , alerted doctors to what had happened . social services told reporters thursday that they had been in close contact with the family since august after one of the two fathers of the children reported difficulties .
prosecutors said they were preparing charges of murder , but would take into account the woman 's diminished responsibility . earlier this week , a 28-year-old woman was arrested on serial murder charges after the remains of three newborns were found on an apartment balcony in the town of plauen in saxony .

even so , the recent infanticides have left politicians and public alike wondering if these tragedies could have been prevented , had social services been quicker to react . " society has to take action to ensure there is no repeat of such cases , " said heide simonis , head of the german section of the children 's relief organization unicef . weighing in on the debate about the protection of young children in germany and the role of the welfare offices , family affairs minister ursula von der leyen called the latest cases " a tragedy " and said investigations needed to be conducted to see if there had been indications something was wrong . " society as a whole has to take responsibility and not turn its back when it sees that a family is in despair or unable to cope , " said the minister . she also added her voice to calls for compulsory medical check-ups , on the grounds that these could help avert neglect and abuse . " if a family fails to attend , they will get an immediate visit from social services , " she told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" this is a way of filtering out families who might be at risk , so that they can be paid special attention . " on nov.21 , the schleswig-holstein parliament did indeed pass a law requiring compulsory health checks for children - too late for the five children who died this week in darry . society 's responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen , herself a mother of seven but according to georg ehrmann from the children 's aid organization , deutsche kinderhilfe direkt , these cases point to a " nationwide structural crisis in children 's aid .

it would be a " difficult test " for the eu , if a second union were to be established , she added . sarkozy wants to create an economic , political and cultural union of mediterranean rim states and invited those interested in participating to a summit in june .

serbia 's path to closer ties with the european union has been consistently blocked by its failure to arrest four war crimes suspects including mladic .
del ponte argued that if the eu signed a partnership accord before their arrest , " it will weaken the real -lrb- serbian -rrb- intention to give us the fugitives " .
" it will depend exclusively on the eu if we will have mladic in the hague in the next weeks and months , " del ponte told news agencies .
mladic and former bosnian serb president radovan karadzic are still at large , wanted on genocide charges during the 1991-95 bosnian war , including masterminding the 1995 srebrenica massacre of nearly 8,000 muslims .

if mladic is not in custody in the hague by monday , " there will be a negative assessment on -lrb- serbia 's -rrb- cooperation with the tribunal , " said del ponte .
eu officials initialed a pre-membership deal with serbia on nov .
7 , after saying it was satisfied with belgrade 's efforts . but del ponte , says a formal signing of that agreement hinges on full cooperation .
" for me , it means mladic , " she said thursday in an interview with the associated press .
" mladic in the hague . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international opinion on the future make-up of kosovo is divided but the outgoing war crimes prosecutor also pointed out that making mladic 's arrest all the more unlikely is the issue of kosovo independence , which is currently " distracting belgrade , " she told reuters .
the future of the province with its ethnic albanian majority has played a key role in her efforts to arrest mladic .
the un security council is also set to discuss the status of kosovo on monday - the last day of the un mandate on the serbian province , when serbia 's negotiations with kosovo formally end .
" politically , it is a very delicate situation , " said del ponte in an interview with reuters . " in the end the kosovo decision … prevents the arrest of mladic . "
" the kosovo issue is unfortunately combined with our request -lrb- to the eu -rrb- , " del ponte has said .
" they have other political priorities and that makes it difficult for us to obtain the arrest and transfer of mladic " . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

setback for eads the news comes as a painful surprise to eads , not just because of the loss of the huge military deal , but also because of the hopes the european defence and aerospace group had pinned on india 's fast-growing civil aviation market for future sales of its airbus commercial jets .

the group had planned to renew india 's ageing soviet-era fleet with 37 light helicopters manufactured in europe , as well as oversee the production of an additional 160 choppers in india .

but insiders say there are other factors at work . the indian army scrapped the deal with eads subsidiary , eurocopter - the largest manufacturer of civil and military helicopters in the world - amid newspaper reports about irregularities in the bidding process and the illegal use of middlemen .
" we will issue a fresh request for proposals in the next two or three months , " said sitanshu kar , a defence ministry spokesman .
kar said the ministry was not commenting on why the deal collapsed ; although he went on to say that newspaper reports about the bidding process were " more or less correct . "
setback for eads the news comes as a painful surprise to eads , not just because of the loss of the huge military deal , but also because of the hopes the european defence and aerospace group had pinned on india 's fast-growing civil aviation market for future sales of its airbus commercial jets .
only on wednesday this week , eads had expressed hope that its deal with india would be wrapped up soon .
the group had planned to renew india 's ageing soviet-era fleet with 37 light helicopters manufactured in europe , as well as oversee the production of an additional 160 choppers in india .
earlier this week , an unnamed indian official from the country 's defence acquisition committee told news agency afp that there was some justification for the accusations against eads .
" there are elements of truth in the complaints , especially the one involving an officer who was part of the evaluation committee while his brother headed the company that is eurocopter 's sole distributor in india , " the official said .
eads representatives in india have so far refused to comment on the indian government 's decision .
the company has said it complies with all french and european regulations concerning the bidding and evaluating process and the use of middlemen .

" regardless of the outcome of the status process , kosovo will remain and has to remain a place where kosovar albanians , serbs and others must be able to live in peace together , free from fear and free from intimidation , " he said .
following the failure of an international mediation effort to find a compromise on the future status of kosovo , ethnic albanian leaders in the province are expected to declare independence in the coming weeks , a move that could potentially unleash a new bout of unrest in the balkans .
nato currently has a 16,000-strong force deployed in the region , with four reserve battalions each comprised of several hundred troops on standby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the eu has to take responsibility on the ground " we renew our commitment to maintain kfor 's national force contributions , including reserves , at current levels and with no new caveats , " ministers said in a final communique .
eu nations divided over independence however , ministers acknowledged that there was no agreement on the wider issue of kosovo 's independence .
" a lot more discussion will be needed , " said belgiam foreign minister karel de gucht following an informal dinner on thursday .
several eu states - including spain , slovakia and greece - are wary of the prospect of an independent kosovo , concerned that it could set a precedent for separatist movements in other regions .
other nations recognize that independence is now inevitable for kosovo after the failed attempt to reach an agreement with serbian leaders , and are seeking a gradual move toward independence under international supervision .
kosovo has been run by the united nations , backed by nato troops , since 1999 when an allied bombing campaign ended a serb crackdown on the separatists . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will act resolutely against anyone who seeks to resort to violence , " said nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer as he opened the meeting .
" regardless of the outcome of the status process , kosovo will remain and has to remain a place where kosovar albanians , serbs and others must be able to live in peace together , free from fear and free from intimidation , " he said .
following the failure of an international mediation effort to find a compromise on the future status of kosovo , ethnic albanian leaders in the province are expected to declare independence in the coming weeks , a move that could potentially unleash a new bout of unrest in the balkans .
nato currently has a 16,000-strong force deployed in the region , with four reserve battalions each comprised of several hundred troops on standby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the eu has to take responsibility on the ground " we renew our commitment to maintain kfor 's national force contributions , including reserves , at current levels and with no new caveats , " ministers said in a final communique .
eu nations divided over independence however , ministers acknowledged that there was no agreement on the wider issue of kosovo 's independence .
" a lot more discussion will be needed , " said belgiam foreign minister karel de gucht following an informal dinner on thursday .
several eu states - including spain , slovakia and greece - are wary of the prospect of an independent kosovo , concerned that it could set a precedent for separatist movements in other regions .
other nations recognize that independence is now inevitable for kosovo after the failed attempt to reach an agreement with serbian leaders , and are seeking a gradual move toward independence under international supervision .

serbia 's path to closer ties with the european union has been consistently blocked by its failure to arrest four war crimes suspects including mladic .
del ponte argued that if the eu signed a partnership accord before their arrest , " it will weaken the real -lrb- serbian -rrb- intention to give us the fugitives " .
" it will depend exclusively on the eu if we will have mladic in the hague in the next weeks and months , " del ponte told news agencies .
mladic and former bosnian serb president radovan karadzic are still at large , wanted on genocide charges during the 1991-95 bosnian war , including masterminding the 1995 srebrenica massacre of nearly 8,000 muslims .

the future of the province with its ethnic albanian majority has played a key role in her efforts to arrest mladic .
the un security council is also set to discuss the status of kosovo on monday - the last day of the un mandate on the serbian province , when serbia 's negotiations with kosovo formally end .
" politically , it is a very delicate situation , " said del ponte in an interview with reuters . " in the end the kosovo decision … prevents the arrest of mladic . "

" we will act resolutely against anyone who seeks to resort to violence , " said nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer as he opened the meeting .
" regardless of the outcome of the status process , kosovo will remain and has to remain a place where kosovar albanians , serbs and others must be able to live in peace together , free from fear and free from intimidation , " he said .
following the failure of an international mediation effort to find a compromise on the future status of kosovo , ethnic albanian leaders in the province are expected to declare independence in the coming weeks , a move that could potentially unleash a new bout of unrest in the balkans .
nato currently has a 16,000-strong force deployed in the region , with four reserve battalions each comprised of several hundred troops on standby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the eu has to take responsibility on the ground " we renew our commitment to maintain kfor 's national force contributions , including reserves , at current levels and with no new caveats , " ministers said in a final communique .
eu nations divided over independence however , ministers acknowledged that there was no agreement on the wider issue of kosovo 's independence .
" a lot more discussion will be needed , " said belgiam foreign minister karel de gucht following an informal dinner on thursday .
several eu states - including spain , slovakia and greece - are wary of the prospect of an independent kosovo , concerned that it could set a precedent for separatist movements in other regions .
other nations recognize that independence is now inevitable for kosovo after the failed attempt to reach an agreement with serbian leaders , and are seeking a gradual move toward independence under international supervision .
kosovo has been run by the united nations , backed by nato troops , since 1999 when an allied bombing campaign ended a serb crackdown on the separatists . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

serbia 's path to closer ties with the european union has been consistently blocked by its failure to arrest four war crimes suspects including mladic .
del ponte argued that if the eu signed a partnership accord before their arrest , " it will weaken the real -lrb- serbian -rrb- intention to give us the fugitives " .
" it will depend exclusively on the eu if we will have mladic in the hague in the next weeks and months , " del ponte told news agencies .
mladic and former bosnian serb president radovan karadzic are still at large , wanted on genocide charges during the 1991-95 bosnian war , including masterminding the 1995 srebrenica massacre of nearly 8,000 muslims .

if mladic is not in custody in the hague by monday , " there will be a negative assessment on -lrb- serbia 's -rrb- cooperation with the tribunal , " said del ponte .
eu officials initialed a pre-membership deal with serbia on nov .

" for me , it means mladic , " she said thursday in an interview with the associated press .
" mladic in the hague . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international opinion on the future make-up of kosovo is divided but the outgoing war crimes prosecutor also pointed out that making mladic 's arrest all the more unlikely is the issue of kosovo independence , which is currently " distracting belgrade , " she told reuters .
the future of the province with its ethnic albanian majority has played a key role in her efforts to arrest mladic .
the un security council is also set to discuss the status of kosovo on monday - the last day of the un mandate on the serbian province , when serbia 's negotiations with kosovo formally end .
" politically , it is a very delicate situation , " said del ponte in an interview with reuters . " in the end the kosovo decision … prevents the arrest of mladic . "
" the kosovo issue is unfortunately combined with our request -lrb- to the eu -rrb- , " del ponte has said .

serbia 's path to closer ties with the european union has been consistently blocked by its failure to arrest four war crimes suspects including mladic .
del ponte argued that if the eu signed a partnership accord before their arrest , " it will weaken the real -lrb- serbian -rrb- intention to give us the fugitives " .
" it will depend exclusively on the eu if we will have mladic in the hague in the next weeks and months , " del ponte told news agencies .
mladic and former bosnian serb president radovan karadzic are still at large , wanted on genocide charges during the 1991-95 bosnian war , including masterminding the 1995 srebrenica massacre of nearly 8,000 muslims .

if mladic is not in custody in the hague by monday , " there will be a negative assessment on -lrb- serbia 's -rrb- cooperation with the tribunal , " said del ponte .
eu officials initialed a pre-membership deal with serbia on nov .
7 , after saying it was satisfied with belgrade 's efforts . but del ponte , says a formal signing of that agreement hinges on full cooperation .
" for me , it means mladic , " she said thursday in an interview with the associated press .
" mladic in the hague . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international opinion on the future make-up of kosovo is divided but the outgoing war crimes prosecutor also pointed out that making mladic 's arrest all the more unlikely is the issue of kosovo independence , which is currently " distracting belgrade , " she told reuters .
the future of the province with its ethnic albanian majority has played a key role in her efforts to arrest mladic .
the un security council is also set to discuss the status of kosovo on monday - the last day of the un mandate on the serbian province , when serbia 's negotiations with kosovo formally end .
" politically , it is a very delicate situation , " said del ponte in an interview with reuters . " in the end the kosovo decision … prevents the arrest of mladic . "
" the kosovo issue is unfortunately combined with our request -lrb- to the eu -rrb- , " del ponte has said .

they also agreed to rescind the non-profit status of groups associated with the far-right npd party . the interior ministers of the nation 's 16 states as well as federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble " consider scientology to be an organization that is not compatible with the constitution , " berlin interior minister erhart körting told reporters after a two-day meeting of the officials , on friday , dec .
7 . körting said germany 's domestic intelligence agencies would collect material that could possibly serve as the basis for a ban of the sect .
federal interior minister schäuble said there was not yet enough information to justify a ban . germany does not recognize scientology as a religion but sees it as a money-making venture .
the german authorities have viewed scientology with suspicion for years .
the group , which opened a center in berlin in january , has around 6,000 followers in germany .
no money for extreme right-wing the ministers also decided to prevent organizations close to the far-right npd party from gaining or retaining non-profit status or receiving state subsidies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd has avoided being banned so far " we 're going to the place that it hurts them the most , " said schleswig-holstein 's interior minister , ralf stegner . currently there are n't any such groups that get money from the state .
due to the npd 's presence in several regional parliaments , however , foundations associated with the party would theoretically have the right to apply for subsidies . germany has been debating whether to ban the npd for years , but so far every attempt has failed to establish that the party violates the country 's constitution . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the cases mount up , chancellor merkel said it is time to stop looking away . the 24-year-old woman , a drug user who allegedly lived alone with her 6-week-old baby , was believed to be hiv positive .
after she failed to attend an appointment at a welfare office last week , a social worker went to her apartment .

7 .
merkel promised to publicly speak out against mugabe 's corrupt government and contrast the economic chaos in zimbabwe with progress being made elsewhere in africa .
mugabe 's presence at the summit has posed a moral dilemma for many european leaders .
while african countries insisted on his presence , he is viewed as a dictator in the west .
british prime minister gordon brown cancelled after learning mugabe would attend .
merkel will take a more confrontational approach .
" this is such an important summit meeting that we should not let the presence of one country keep us from paying our respects to the rest of the continent , " merkel said wednesday .
europe wants more influence in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to strengthen economic ties with africa the eu recently restated its commitment to promoting democracy and human rights in any partnership with africa .
yet it 's also unlikely that merkel and other european leaders ' insistence on discussing human rights will derail eu efforts to increase economic ties with africa .
merkel , like many of her european counterparts , sees the summit as a rare chance to form a strategic alliance with africa on issues such as trade and security .
it 's the first time in seven years eu and african leaders have met .
along with important economic agreements , countries hope to discuss immigration and climate change .
the summit is also seen as being crucial to counteracting china 's growing sway on the continent .
europe is currently africa 's biggest trading partner , but china has been steadily increasing its aid , investments and influence in africa .
merkel 's ethical stance is heartfelt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with the dalai lama despite criticism from china growing up as the daughter of a lutheran minister in communist east germany , gave merkel personal experience with human rights issues .
merkel has said that she would never promote business at the expense of human rights .
" human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .
" they should never be opposed to each another . "
merkel has shown that she understands the linkage between democratic values and economic prosperity , said ulrike guerot , a senior policy fellow in the german office of the european council on foreign relations .
merkel has made human rights a cornerstone of her foreign policy .
she has not shied away from criticizing the human rights record of important trading partners like russia and china .
she has even chastized her ally united states president george bush for holding suspected terrorists without due process in guantanamo bay , cuba . her unwavering position has earned her respect from fellow christian democrats as well as internationally , guerot said .
on the other hand , merkel is not likely to derail talks with africa over her human rights stance , guerot said , as " it 's a twofold dialogue . "
criticism unlikely to sway mugabe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has been a lightning rod of criticism mugabe , 83 , came to power in 1980 after zimbabwe gained independence from britain .
along with being accused of a variety of human rights abuses , he is also blamed for sinking zimbabwe into an economic crisis .
unemployment in the country stands at 80 percent and inflation has reached some 3,700 percent in recent years .
yet the bilateral summit would n't have taken place without him .
many african leaders view him as a hero of independence and insisted on his presence in lisbon .
while brown boycotted the summit , nearly 80 other eu and african leaders will attend .
both brown 's boycott and merkel 's confrontation send mugabe an important message of disapproval , said dzikamai machingura , the national director of zimrights , a human rights group based in zimbabwe 's capital city of harare .
yet machingura hopes europe wo n't give mugabe 's government a blank check .
aid money without evidence of human rights improvements would be like " feeding a bully , " machingura said .
merkel also should n't be under any delusions that her tough talk will change the situation in zimbabwe .
most likely , when faced with criticism at the summit , mugabe will react arrogantly and dismissively , machingura predicted .
diplomacy will determine outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is a vital partner in africa it 's hard to predict how mugabe or other african leaders will comport themselves at the summit , said ross herbert , head of the governance program for the south african institute of international affairs .
there 's growing recognition among african leaders that human rights are an important part of bringing economic and democratic progress to their countries .
yet europeans will need to be careful in how they single out zimbabwe or sudan for criticism as there 's also a tradition in africa of " closing ranks against outside critics , " herbert said .
in the end , it 's criticism from other african leaders , not from europe , that could convince mugabe to change , machingura and herbert said .

7 .
merkel promised to publicly speak out against mugabe 's corrupt government and contrast the economic chaos in zimbabwe with progress being made elsewhere in africa .
mugabe 's presence at the summit has posed a moral dilemma for many european leaders .
while african countries insisted on his presence , he is viewed as a dictator in the west .
british prime minister gordon brown cancelled after learning mugabe would attend .
merkel will take a more confrontational approach .
" this is such an important summit meeting that we should not let the presence of one country keep us from paying our respects to the rest of the continent , " merkel said wednesday .
europe wants more influence in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to strengthen economic ties with africa the eu recently restated its commitment to promoting democracy and human rights in any partnership with africa .
yet it 's also unlikely that merkel and other european leaders ' insistence on discussing human rights will derail eu efforts to increase economic ties with africa .
merkel , like many of her european counterparts , sees the summit as a rare chance to form a strategic alliance with africa on issues such as trade and security .
it 's the first time in seven years eu and african leaders have met .
along with important economic agreements , countries hope to discuss immigration and climate change .
the summit is also seen as being crucial to counteracting china 's growing sway on the continent .
europe is currently africa 's biggest trading partner , but china has been steadily increasing its aid , investments and influence in africa .
merkel 's ethical stance is heartfelt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with the dalai lama despite criticism from china growing up as the daughter of a lutheran minister in communist east germany , gave merkel personal experience with human rights issues .
merkel has said that she would never promote business at the expense of human rights .
" human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .
" they should never be opposed to each another . "
merkel has shown that she understands the linkage between democratic values and economic prosperity , said ulrike guerot , a senior policy fellow in the german office of the european council on foreign relations .

she has not shied away from criticizing the human rights record of important trading partners like russia and china .

serbia 's path to closer ties with the european union has been consistently blocked by its failure to arrest four war crimes suspects including mladic .
del ponte argued that if the eu signed a partnership accord before their arrest , " it will weaken the real -lrb- serbian -rrb- intention to give us the fugitives " .
" it will depend exclusively on the eu if we will have mladic in the hague in the next weeks and months , " del ponte told news agencies .
mladic and former bosnian serb president radovan karadzic are still at large , wanted on genocide charges during the 1991-95 bosnian war , including masterminding the 1995 srebrenica massacre of nearly 8,000 muslims .
negative assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radovan karadzic -lrb- r -rrb- und ratko mladic - still on the loose the prosecutor will be submitting a report on serbia 's work with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to the un security council on december 10 , when eu foreign ministers will also be discussing serbia 's eu accession .
if mladic is not in custody in the hague by monday , " there will be a negative assessment on -lrb- serbia 's -rrb- cooperation with the tribunal , " said del ponte .
eu officials initialed a pre-membership deal with serbia on nov .
7 , after saying it was satisfied with belgrade 's efforts . but del ponte , says a formal signing of that agreement hinges on full cooperation .
" for me , it means mladic , " she said thursday in an interview with the associated press .
" mladic in the hague . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international opinion on the future make-up of kosovo is divided but the outgoing war crimes prosecutor also pointed out that making mladic 's arrest all the more unlikely is the issue of kosovo independence , which is currently " distracting belgrade , " she told reuters .
the future of the province with its ethnic albanian majority has played a key role in her efforts to arrest mladic .
the un security council is also set to discuss the status of kosovo on monday - the last day of the un mandate on the serbian province , when serbia 's negotiations with kosovo formally end .
" politically , it is a very delicate situation , " said del ponte in an interview with reuters . " in the end the kosovo decision … prevents the arrest of mladic . "
" the kosovo issue is unfortunately combined with our request -lrb- to the eu -rrb- , " del ponte has said .
" they have other political priorities and that makes it difficult for us to obtain the arrest and transfer of mladic " . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

serbia 's path to closer ties with the european union has been consistently blocked by its failure to arrest four war crimes suspects including mladic .
del ponte argued that if the eu signed a partnership accord before their arrest , " it will weaken the real -lrb- serbian -rrb- intention to give us the fugitives " .
" it will depend exclusively on the eu if we will have mladic in the hague in the next weeks and months , " del ponte told news agencies .
mladic and former bosnian serb president radovan karadzic are still at large , wanted on genocide charges during the 1991-95 bosnian war , including masterminding the 1995 srebrenica massacre of nearly 8,000 muslims .

but insiders say there are other factors at work . the indian army scrapped the deal with eads subsidiary , eurocopter - the largest manufacturer of civil and military helicopters in the world - amid newspaper reports about irregularities in the bidding process and the illegal use of middlemen .
" we will issue a fresh request for proposals in the next two or three months , " said sitanshu kar , a defence ministry spokesman .
kar said the ministry was not commenting on why the deal collapsed ; although he went on to say that newspaper reports about the bidding process were " more or less correct . "
setback for eads the news comes as a painful surprise to eads , not just because of the loss of the huge military deal , but also because of the hopes the european defence and aerospace group had pinned on india 's fast-growing civil aviation market for future sales of its airbus commercial jets .

the group had planned to renew india 's ageing soviet-era fleet with 37 light helicopters manufactured in europe , as well as oversee the production of an additional 160 choppers in india .

" there are elements of truth in the complaints , especially the one involving an officer who was part of the evaluation committee while his brother headed the company that is eurocopter 's sole distributor in india , " the official said .
eads representatives in india have so far refused to comment on the indian government 's decision .

one day after five boys were apparently murdered by their mother , the bodies of a young woman and her baby were found in a berlin apartment .
as the cases mount up , chancellor merkel said it is time to stop looking away . the 24-year-old woman , a drug user who allegedly lived alone with her 6-week-old baby , was believed to be hiv positive .
after she failed to attend an appointment at a welfare office last week , a social worker went to her apartment .
when no one answered , she called the police , who found the bodies .
police have ruled out both suicide and murder . on wednesday , dec .
5 , five children aged 3 to 9 were found suffocated at their home in darry , schleswig-holstein .
their mother , who had been undergoing psychiatric treatment , alerted doctors to what had happened . social services told reporters thursday that they had been in close contact with the family since august after one of the two fathers of the children reported difficulties .
prosecutors said they were preparing charges of murder , but would take into account the woman 's diminished responsibility . earlier this week , a 28-year-old woman was arrested on serial murder charges after the remains of three newborns were found on an apartment balcony in the town of plauen in saxony .

" society as a whole has to take responsibility and not turn its back when it sees that a family is in despair or unable to cope , " said the minister . she also added her voice to calls for compulsory medical check-ups , on the grounds that these could help avert neglect and abuse . " if a family fails to attend , they will get an immediate visit from social services , " she told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" this is a way of filtering out families who might be at risk , so that they can be paid special attention .

one day after five boys were apparently murdered by their mother , the bodies of a young woman and her baby were found in a berlin apartment .
as the cases mount up , chancellor merkel said it is time to stop looking away . the 24-year-old woman , a drug user who allegedly lived alone with her 6-week-old baby , was believed to be hiv positive .
after she failed to attend an appointment at a welfare office last week , a social worker went to her apartment .
when no one answered , she called the police , who found the bodies .
police have ruled out both suicide and murder . on wednesday , dec .
5 , five children aged 3 to 9 were found suffocated at their home in darry , schleswig-holstein .
their mother , who had been undergoing psychiatric treatment , alerted doctors to what had happened . social services told reporters thursday that they had been in close contact with the family since august after one of the two fathers of the children reported difficulties .
prosecutors said they were preparing charges of murder , but would take into account the woman 's diminished responsibility . earlier this week , a 28-year-old woman was arrested on serial murder charges after the remains of three newborns were found on an apartment balcony in the town of plauen in saxony .

" this is a way of filtering out families who might be at risk , so that they can be paid special attention .

7 .
merkel promised to publicly speak out against mugabe 's corrupt government and contrast the economic chaos in zimbabwe with progress being made elsewhere in africa .
mugabe 's presence at the summit has posed a moral dilemma for many european leaders .
while african countries insisted on his presence , he is viewed as a dictator in the west .
british prime minister gordon brown cancelled after learning mugabe would attend .
merkel will take a more confrontational approach .
" this is such an important summit meeting that we should not let the presence of one country keep us from paying our respects to the rest of the continent , " merkel said wednesday .
europe wants more influence in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to strengthen economic ties with africa the eu recently restated its commitment to promoting democracy and human rights in any partnership with africa .
yet it 's also unlikely that merkel and other european leaders ' insistence on discussing human rights will derail eu efforts to increase economic ties with africa .
merkel , like many of her european counterparts , sees the summit as a rare chance to form a strategic alliance with africa on issues such as trade and security .
it 's the first time in seven years eu and african leaders have met .
along with important economic agreements , countries hope to discuss immigration and climate change .
the summit is also seen as being crucial to counteracting china 's growing sway on the continent .
europe is currently africa 's biggest trading partner , but china has been steadily increasing its aid , investments and influence in africa .
merkel 's ethical stance is heartfelt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with the dalai lama despite criticism from china growing up as the daughter of a lutheran minister in communist east germany , gave merkel personal experience with human rights issues .
merkel has said that she would never promote business at the expense of human rights .
" human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .
" they should never be opposed to each another . "
merkel has shown that she understands the linkage between democratic values and economic prosperity , said ulrike guerot , a senior policy fellow in the german office of the european council on foreign relations .
merkel has made human rights a cornerstone of her foreign policy .
she has not shied away from criticizing the human rights record of important trading partners like russia and china .
she has even chastized her ally united states president george bush for holding suspected terrorists without due process in guantanamo bay , cuba . her unwavering position has earned her respect from fellow christian democrats as well as internationally , guerot said .
on the other hand , merkel is not likely to derail talks with africa over her human rights stance , guerot said , as " it 's a twofold dialogue . "
criticism unlikely to sway mugabe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has been a lightning rod of criticism mugabe , 83 , came to power in 1980 after zimbabwe gained independence from britain .
along with being accused of a variety of human rights abuses , he is also blamed for sinking zimbabwe into an economic crisis .
unemployment in the country stands at 80 percent and inflation has reached some 3,700 percent in recent years .
yet the bilateral summit would n't have taken place without him .
many african leaders view him as a hero of independence and insisted on his presence in lisbon .
while brown boycotted the summit , nearly 80 other eu and african leaders will attend .
both brown 's boycott and merkel 's confrontation send mugabe an important message of disapproval , said dzikamai machingura , the national director of zimrights , a human rights group based in zimbabwe 's capital city of harare .
yet machingura hopes europe wo n't give mugabe 's government a blank check .
aid money without evidence of human rights improvements would be like " feeding a bully , " machingura said .
merkel also should n't be under any delusions that her tough talk will change the situation in zimbabwe .
most likely , when faced with criticism at the summit , mugabe will react arrogantly and dismissively , machingura predicted .
diplomacy will determine outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is a vital partner in africa it 's hard to predict how mugabe or other african leaders will comport themselves at the summit , said ross herbert , head of the governance program for the south african institute of international affairs .
there 's growing recognition among african leaders that human rights are an important part of bringing economic and democratic progress to their countries .
yet europeans will need to be careful in how they single out zimbabwe or sudan for criticism as there 's also a tradition in africa of " closing ranks against outside critics , " herbert said .
in the end , it 's criticism from other african leaders , not from europe , that could convince mugabe to change , machingura and herbert said .

merkel promised to publicly speak out against mugabe 's corrupt government and contrast the economic chaos in zimbabwe with progress being made elsewhere in africa .
mugabe 's presence at the summit has posed a moral dilemma for many european leaders .
while african countries insisted on his presence , he is viewed as a dictator in the west .
british prime minister gordon brown cancelled after learning mugabe would attend .
merkel will take a more confrontational approach .
" this is such an important summit meeting that we should not let the presence of one country keep us from paying our respects to the rest of the continent , " merkel said wednesday .
europe wants more influence in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to strengthen economic ties with africa the eu recently restated its commitment to promoting democracy and human rights in any partnership with africa .
yet it 's also unlikely that merkel and other european leaders ' insistence on discussing human rights will derail eu efforts to increase economic ties with africa .
merkel , like many of her european counterparts , sees the summit as a rare chance to form a strategic alliance with africa on issues such as trade and security .
it 's the first time in seven years eu and african leaders have met .
along with important economic agreements , countries hope to discuss immigration and climate change .
the summit is also seen as being crucial to counteracting china 's growing sway on the continent .
europe is currently africa 's biggest trading partner , but china has been steadily increasing its aid , investments and influence in africa .
merkel 's ethical stance is heartfelt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with the dalai lama despite criticism from china growing up as the daughter of a lutheran minister in communist east germany , gave merkel personal experience with human rights issues .
merkel has said that she would never promote business at the expense of human rights .
" human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .
" they should never be opposed to each another . "
merkel has shown that she understands the linkage between democratic values and economic prosperity , said ulrike guerot , a senior policy fellow in the german office of the european council on foreign relations .
merkel has made human rights a cornerstone of her foreign policy .
she has not shied away from criticizing the human rights record of important trading partners like russia and china .
she has even chastized her ally united states president george bush for holding suspected terrorists without due process in guantanamo bay , cuba . her unwavering position has earned her respect from fellow christian democrats as well as internationally , guerot said .
on the other hand , merkel is not likely to derail talks with africa over her human rights stance , guerot said , as " it 's a twofold dialogue . "
criticism unlikely to sway mugabe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has been a lightning rod of criticism mugabe , 83 , came to power in 1980 after zimbabwe gained independence from britain .
along with being accused of a variety of human rights abuses , he is also blamed for sinking zimbabwe into an economic crisis .
unemployment in the country stands at 80 percent and inflation has reached some 3,700 percent in recent years .
yet the bilateral summit would n't have taken place without him .
many african leaders view him as a hero of independence and insisted on his presence in lisbon .
while brown boycotted the summit , nearly 80 other eu and african leaders will attend .
both brown 's boycott and merkel 's confrontation send mugabe an important message of disapproval , said dzikamai machingura , the national director of zimrights , a human rights group based in zimbabwe 's capital city of harare .
yet machingura hopes europe wo n't give mugabe 's government a blank check .
aid money without evidence of human rights improvements would be like " feeding a bully , " machingura said .
merkel also should n't be under any delusions that her tough talk will change the situation in zimbabwe .
most likely , when faced with criticism at the summit , mugabe will react arrogantly and dismissively , machingura predicted .
diplomacy will determine outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is a vital partner in africa it 's hard to predict how mugabe or other african leaders will comport themselves at the summit , said ross herbert , head of the governance program for the south african institute of international affairs .
there 's growing recognition among african leaders that human rights are an important part of bringing economic and democratic progress to their countries .
yet europeans will need to be careful in how they single out zimbabwe or sudan for criticism as there 's also a tradition in africa of " closing ranks against outside critics , " herbert said .
in the end , it 's criticism from other african leaders , not from europe , that could convince mugabe to change , machingura and herbert said .

7 .
merkel promised to publicly speak out against mugabe 's corrupt government and contrast the economic chaos in zimbabwe with progress being made elsewhere in africa .
mugabe 's presence at the summit has posed a moral dilemma for many european leaders .
while african countries insisted on his presence , he is viewed as a dictator in the west .
british prime minister gordon brown cancelled after learning mugabe would attend .
merkel will take a more confrontational approach .
" this is such an important summit meeting that we should not let the presence of one country keep us from paying our respects to the rest of the continent , " merkel said wednesday .
europe wants more influence in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to strengthen economic ties with africa the eu recently restated its commitment to promoting democracy and human rights in any partnership with africa .
yet it 's also unlikely that merkel and other european leaders ' insistence on discussing human rights will derail eu efforts to increase economic ties with africa .
merkel , like many of her european counterparts , sees the summit as a rare chance to form a strategic alliance with africa on issues such as trade and security .
it 's the first time in seven years eu and african leaders have met .
along with important economic agreements , countries hope to discuss immigration and climate change .
the summit is also seen as being crucial to counteracting china 's growing sway on the continent .
europe is currently africa 's biggest trading partner , but china has been steadily increasing its aid , investments and influence in africa .
merkel 's ethical stance is heartfelt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with the dalai lama despite criticism from china growing up as the daughter of a lutheran minister in communist east germany , gave merkel personal experience with human rights issues .
merkel has said that she would never promote business at the expense of human rights .
" human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .
" they should never be opposed to each another . "
merkel has shown that she understands the linkage between democratic values and economic prosperity , said ulrike guerot , a senior policy fellow in the german office of the european council on foreign relations .
merkel has made human rights a cornerstone of her foreign policy .
she has not shied away from criticizing the human rights record of important trading partners like russia and china .
she has even chastized her ally united states president george bush for holding suspected terrorists without due process in guantanamo bay , cuba . her unwavering position has earned her respect from fellow christian democrats as well as internationally , guerot said .
on the other hand , merkel is not likely to derail talks with africa over her human rights stance , guerot said , as " it 's a twofold dialogue . "
criticism unlikely to sway mugabe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has been a lightning rod of criticism mugabe , 83 , came to power in 1980 after zimbabwe gained independence from britain .
along with being accused of a variety of human rights abuses , he is also blamed for sinking zimbabwe into an economic crisis .
unemployment in the country stands at 80 percent and inflation has reached some 3,700 percent in recent years .
yet the bilateral summit would n't have taken place without him .
many african leaders view him as a hero of independence and insisted on his presence in lisbon .
while brown boycotted the summit , nearly 80 other eu and african leaders will attend .
both brown 's boycott and merkel 's confrontation send mugabe an important message of disapproval , said dzikamai machingura , the national director of zimrights , a human rights group based in zimbabwe 's capital city of harare .
yet machingura hopes europe wo n't give mugabe 's government a blank check .
aid money without evidence of human rights improvements would be like " feeding a bully , " machingura said .
merkel also should n't be under any delusions that her tough talk will change the situation in zimbabwe .
most likely , when faced with criticism at the summit , mugabe will react arrogantly and dismissively , machingura predicted .
diplomacy will determine outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is a vital partner in africa it 's hard to predict how mugabe or other african leaders will comport themselves at the summit , said ross herbert , head of the governance program for the south african institute of international affairs .
there 's growing recognition among african leaders that human rights are an important part of bringing economic and democratic progress to their countries .
yet europeans will need to be careful in how they single out zimbabwe or sudan for criticism as there 's also a tradition in africa of " closing ranks against outside critics , " herbert said .
in the end , it 's criticism from other african leaders , not from europe , that could convince mugabe to change , machingura and herbert said .

" we will act resolutely against anyone who seeks to resort to violence , " said nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer as he opened the meeting .
" regardless of the outcome of the status process , kosovo will remain and has to remain a place where kosovar albanians , serbs and others must be able to live in peace together , free from fear and free from intimidation , " he said .
following the failure of an international mediation effort to find a compromise on the future status of kosovo , ethnic albanian leaders in the province are expected to declare independence in the coming weeks , a move that could potentially unleash a new bout of unrest in the balkans .
nato currently has a 16,000-strong force deployed in the region , with four reserve battalions each comprised of several hundred troops on standby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the eu has to take responsibility on the ground " we renew our commitment to maintain kfor 's national force contributions , including reserves , at current levels and with no new caveats , " ministers said in a final communique .
eu nations divided over independence however , ministers acknowledged that there was no agreement on the wider issue of kosovo 's independence .
" a lot more discussion will be needed , " said belgiam foreign minister karel de gucht following an informal dinner on thursday .
several eu states - including spain , slovakia and greece - are wary of the prospect of an independent kosovo , concerned that it could set a precedent for separatist movements in other regions .
other nations recognize that independence is now inevitable for kosovo after the failed attempt to reach an agreement with serbian leaders , and are seeking a gradual move toward independence under international supervision .
kosovo has been run by the united nations , backed by nato troops , since 1999 when an allied bombing campaign ended a serb crackdown on the separatists . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

serbia 's path to closer ties with the european union has been consistently blocked by its failure to arrest four war crimes suspects including mladic .

serbia 's path to closer ties with the european union has been consistently blocked by its failure to arrest four war crimes suspects including mladic .
del ponte argued that if the eu signed a partnership accord before their arrest , " it will weaken the real -lrb- serbian -rrb- intention to give us the fugitives " .
" it will depend exclusively on the eu if we will have mladic in the hague in the next weeks and months , " del ponte told news agencies .
mladic and former bosnian serb president radovan karadzic are still at large , wanted on genocide charges during the 1991-95 bosnian war , including masterminding the 1995 srebrenica massacre of nearly 8,000 muslims .
negative assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radovan karadzic -lrb- r -rrb- und ratko mladic - still on the loose the prosecutor will be submitting a report on serbia 's work with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to the un security council on december 10 , when eu foreign ministers will also be discussing serbia 's eu accession .
if mladic is not in custody in the hague by monday , " there will be a negative assessment on -lrb- serbia 's -rrb- cooperation with the tribunal , " said del ponte .
eu officials initialed a pre-membership deal with serbia on nov .
7 , after saying it was satisfied with belgrade 's efforts . but del ponte , says a formal signing of that agreement hinges on full cooperation .
" for me , it means mladic , " she said thursday in an interview with the associated press .
" mladic in the hague . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international opinion on the future make-up of kosovo is divided but the outgoing war crimes prosecutor also pointed out that making mladic 's arrest all the more unlikely is the issue of kosovo independence , which is currently " distracting belgrade , " she told reuters .
the future of the province with its ethnic albanian majority has played a key role in her efforts to arrest mladic .
the un security council is also set to discuss the status of kosovo on monday - the last day of the un mandate on the serbian province , when serbia 's negotiations with kosovo formally end .
" politically , it is a very delicate situation , " said del ponte in an interview with reuters . " in the end the kosovo decision … prevents the arrest of mladic . "
" the kosovo issue is unfortunately combined with our request -lrb- to the eu -rrb- , " del ponte has said .
" they have other political priorities and that makes it difficult for us to obtain the arrest and transfer of mladic " . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but insiders say there are other factors at work . the indian army scrapped the deal with eads subsidiary , eurocopter - the largest manufacturer of civil and military helicopters in the world - amid newspaper reports about irregularities in the bidding process and the illegal use of middlemen .
" we will issue a fresh request for proposals in the next two or three months , " said sitanshu kar , a defence ministry spokesman .
kar said the ministry was not commenting on why the deal collapsed ; although he went on to say that newspaper reports about the bidding process were " more or less correct . "
setback for eads the news comes as a painful surprise to eads , not just because of the loss of the huge military deal , but also because of the hopes the european defence and aerospace group had pinned on india 's fast-growing civil aviation market for future sales of its airbus commercial jets .
only on wednesday this week , eads had expressed hope that its deal with india would be wrapped up soon .
the group had planned to renew india 's ageing soviet-era fleet with 37 light helicopters manufactured in europe , as well as oversee the production of an additional 160 choppers in india .
earlier this week , an unnamed indian official from the country 's defence acquisition committee told news agency afp that there was some justification for the accusations against eads .
" there are elements of truth in the complaints , especially the one involving an officer who was part of the evaluation committee while his brother headed the company that is eurocopter 's sole distributor in india , " the official said .
eads representatives in india have so far refused to comment on the indian government 's decision .
the company has said it complies with all french and european regulations concerning the bidding and evaluating process and the use of middlemen .
insiders suspect us influence india put out the tender for 197 military helicopters in 2001 , and in february of this year , named eurocopter as the winner of the contract , choosing the company 's as 550 c3 fennec over us-based bell helicopter 's bell 407 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is keen to sell fighterjets to india next year speculation is rife among diplomats and industry insiders that washington put pressure on the indian government in order to win the contract back for bell helicopter .
the german business daily handelsblatt said that washington is exerting its growing influence in new delhi at a critical time , given india 's plans to buy 126 fighter jets next year in a deal worth some $ 10 billion .
eads is in the running with the eurofighter , but the us is represented with lockheed 's f-16 and boeing 's f-18 .
according to handelsblatt , the cancellation of the helicopter deal highlights the political hurdles faced by european weapon manufacturers trying to do business on the lucrative indian market . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany improved its standing by two places . the main reasons for germany 's improvement were its efforts to further international climate protection at summits of the european union and the g8 this year , bodies which berlin chaired at the time , according to the groups . " when it comes to politics , germany even gets first place , " germanwatch 's jan burck told german news agency dpa from the un climate change conference in bali , indonesia . but even sweden , which held the top spot on the climate change performance index last year as well , was not an example of ideal performance , the study determined .
and the international community was far from honoring its responsibilities , the groups said . better , but not good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's leaders should do more , the groups said " hardly any state is on the route that we need overall to keep the global temperature increase below two degrees and prevent a global climate destabilization , " matthias duwe , director of climate action network europe -lrb- can-europe -rrb- , told dpa . neither germany nor sweden , however , should see the study as a reason to boast about their current ranking , burck said in an interview with deutsche welle . " none of the countries , even in the top ten , are doing a quite good job , " burck told dw .
" even the front-runners are more the one-eyed king among of the blind than really good climate protectors . " he added that the ranking compared countries relative to each other , " -lsb- the top nations -rsb- do better than the rest , but actually they do not sufficient work to combat dangerous climate change . "
us the worst twelve eu countries were among the top 20 states on the index , including britain , france hungary and malta . australia , the united states and saudi arabia were at the very bottom of the index , at spots 54 , 55 and 56 respectively . the 10 highest emitters of carbon dioxide were the same as in 2006 , with the united states in the top slot , followed by china .
germany held sixth place on that list . the climate change performance index ranked 56 countries that can-europe and germanwatch said were responsible for more than 90 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions .
it looked at three indicators to establish countries ' rankings : per-capita emissions trends over previous years , absolute energy-related co2 emissions and domestic and international climate policy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 .
merkel promised to publicly speak out against mugabe 's corrupt government and contrast the economic chaos in zimbabwe with progress being made elsewhere in africa .
mugabe 's presence at the summit has posed a moral dilemma for many european leaders .
while african countries insisted on his presence , he is viewed as a dictator in the west .
british prime minister gordon brown cancelled after learning mugabe would attend .
merkel will take a more confrontational approach .
" this is such an important summit meeting that we should not let the presence of one country keep us from paying our respects to the rest of the continent , " merkel said wednesday .
europe wants more influence in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to strengthen economic ties with africa the eu recently restated its commitment to promoting democracy and human rights in any partnership with africa .
yet it 's also unlikely that merkel and other european leaders ' insistence on discussing human rights will derail eu efforts to increase economic ties with africa .
merkel , like many of her european counterparts , sees the summit as a rare chance to form a strategic alliance with africa on issues such as trade and security .
it 's the first time in seven years eu and african leaders have met .
along with important economic agreements , countries hope to discuss immigration and climate change .
the summit is also seen as being crucial to counteracting china 's growing sway on the continent .
europe is currently africa 's biggest trading partner , but china has been steadily increasing its aid , investments and influence in africa .
merkel 's ethical stance is heartfelt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with the dalai lama despite criticism from china growing up as the daughter of a lutheran minister in communist east germany , gave merkel personal experience with human rights issues .
merkel has said that she would never promote business at the expense of human rights .
" human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .
" they should never be opposed to each another . "
merkel has shown that she understands the linkage between democratic values and economic prosperity , said ulrike guerot , a senior policy fellow in the german office of the european council on foreign relations .
merkel has made human rights a cornerstone of her foreign policy .
she has not shied away from criticizing the human rights record of important trading partners like russia and china .
she has even chastized her ally united states president george bush for holding suspected terrorists without due process in guantanamo bay , cuba . her unwavering position has earned her respect from fellow christian democrats as well as internationally , guerot said .
on the other hand , merkel is not likely to derail talks with africa over her human rights stance , guerot said , as " it 's a twofold dialogue . "
criticism unlikely to sway mugabe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has been a lightning rod of criticism mugabe , 83 , came to power in 1980 after zimbabwe gained independence from britain .
along with being accused of a variety of human rights abuses , he is also blamed for sinking zimbabwe into an economic crisis .
unemployment in the country stands at 80 percent and inflation has reached some 3,700 percent in recent years .
yet the bilateral summit would n't have taken place without him .
many african leaders view him as a hero of independence and insisted on his presence in lisbon .
while brown boycotted the summit , nearly 80 other eu and african leaders will attend .
both brown 's boycott and merkel 's confrontation send mugabe an important message of disapproval , said dzikamai machingura , the national director of zimrights , a human rights group based in zimbabwe 's capital city of harare .
yet machingura hopes europe wo n't give mugabe 's government a blank check .
aid money without evidence of human rights improvements would be like " feeding a bully , " machingura said .
merkel also should n't be under any delusions that her tough talk will change the situation in zimbabwe .
most likely , when faced with criticism at the summit , mugabe will react arrogantly and dismissively , machingura predicted .
diplomacy will determine outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is a vital partner in africa it 's hard to predict how mugabe or other african leaders will comport themselves at the summit , said ross herbert , head of the governance program for the south african institute of international affairs .
there 's growing recognition among african leaders that human rights are an important part of bringing economic and democratic progress to their countries .
yet europeans will need to be careful in how they single out zimbabwe or sudan for criticism as there 's also a tradition in africa of " closing ranks against outside critics , " herbert said .
in the end , it 's criticism from other african leaders , not from europe , that could convince mugabe to change , machingura and herbert said .

merkel promised to publicly speak out against mugabe 's corrupt government and contrast the economic chaos in zimbabwe with progress being made elsewhere in africa .
mugabe 's presence at the summit has posed a moral dilemma for many european leaders .
while african countries insisted on his presence , he is viewed as a dictator in the west .
british prime minister gordon brown cancelled after learning mugabe would attend .
merkel will take a more confrontational approach .
" this is such an important summit meeting that we should not let the presence of one country keep us from paying our respects to the rest of the continent , " merkel said wednesday .
europe wants more influence in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to strengthen economic ties with africa the eu recently restated its commitment to promoting democracy and human rights in any partnership with africa .
yet it 's also unlikely that merkel and other european leaders ' insistence on discussing human rights will derail eu efforts to increase economic ties with africa .
merkel , like many of her european counterparts , sees the summit as a rare chance to form a strategic alliance with africa on issues such as trade and security .
it 's the first time in seven years eu and african leaders have met .
along with important economic agreements , countries hope to discuss immigration and climate change .
the summit is also seen as being crucial to counteracting china 's growing sway on the continent .
europe is currently africa 's biggest trading partner , but china has been steadily increasing its aid , investments and influence in africa .
merkel 's ethical stance is heartfelt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with the dalai lama despite criticism from china growing up as the daughter of a lutheran minister in communist east germany , gave merkel personal experience with human rights issues .
merkel has said that she would never promote business at the expense of human rights .
" human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .
" they should never be opposed to each another . "
merkel has shown that she understands the linkage between democratic values and economic prosperity , said ulrike guerot , a senior policy fellow in the german office of the european council on foreign relations .
merkel has made human rights a cornerstone of her foreign policy .
she has not shied away from criticizing the human rights record of important trading partners like russia and china .
she has even chastized her ally united states president george bush for holding suspected terrorists without due process in guantanamo bay , cuba . her unwavering position has earned her respect from fellow christian democrats as well as internationally , guerot said .
on the other hand , merkel is not likely to derail talks with africa over her human rights stance , guerot said , as " it 's a twofold dialogue . "
criticism unlikely to sway mugabe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has been a lightning rod of criticism mugabe , 83 , came to power in 1980 after zimbabwe gained independence from britain .
along with being accused of a variety of human rights abuses , he is also blamed for sinking zimbabwe into an economic crisis .
unemployment in the country stands at 80 percent and inflation has reached some 3,700 percent in recent years .
yet the bilateral summit would n't have taken place without him .
many african leaders view him as a hero of independence and insisted on his presence in lisbon .
while brown boycotted the summit , nearly 80 other eu and african leaders will attend .
both brown 's boycott and merkel 's confrontation send mugabe an important message of disapproval , said dzikamai machingura , the national director of zimrights , a human rights group based in zimbabwe 's capital city of harare .
yet machingura hopes europe wo n't give mugabe 's government a blank check .
aid money without evidence of human rights improvements would be like " feeding a bully , " machingura said .
merkel also should n't be under any delusions that her tough talk will change the situation in zimbabwe .
most likely , when faced with criticism at the summit , mugabe will react arrogantly and dismissively , machingura predicted .

serbia 's path to closer ties with the european union has been consistently blocked by its failure to arrest four war crimes suspects including mladic .
del ponte argued that if the eu signed a partnership accord before their arrest , " it will weaken the real -lrb- serbian -rrb- intention to give us the fugitives " .
" it will depend exclusively on the eu if we will have mladic in the hague in the next weeks and months , " del ponte told news agencies .

serbia 's path to closer ties with the european union has been consistently blocked by its failure to arrest four war crimes suspects including mladic .

" it will depend exclusively on the eu if we will have mladic in the hague in the next weeks and months , " del ponte told news agencies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 07.12.2007 india cancels deal to buy eads helicopters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads had high hopes for the indian market the indian defence ministry has cancelled a $ 600-million deal to buy 197 military helicopters from eads , saying irregularities in the bidding process were to blame .
but insiders say there are other factors at work . the indian army scrapped the deal with eads subsidiary , eurocopter - the largest manufacturer of civil and military helicopters in the world - amid newspaper reports about irregularities in the bidding process and the illegal use of middlemen .
" we will issue a fresh request for proposals in the next two or three months , " said sitanshu kar , a defence ministry spokesman .
kar said the ministry was not commenting on why the deal collapsed ; although he went on to say that newspaper reports about the bidding process were " more or less correct . "
setback for eads the news comes as a painful surprise to eads , not just because of the loss of the huge military deal , but also because of the hopes the european defence and aerospace group had pinned on india 's fast-growing civil aviation market for future sales of its airbus commercial jets .
only on wednesday this week , eads had expressed hope that its deal with india would be wrapped up soon .
the group had planned to renew india 's ageing soviet-era fleet with 37 light helicopters manufactured in europe , as well as oversee the production of an additional 160 choppers in india .
earlier this week , an unnamed indian official from the country 's defence acquisition committee told news agency afp that there was some justification for the accusations against eads .
" there are elements of truth in the complaints , especially the one involving an officer who was part of the evaluation committee while his brother headed the company that is eurocopter 's sole distributor in india , " the official said .
eads representatives in india have so far refused to comment on the indian government 's decision .
the company has said it complies with all french and european regulations concerning the bidding and evaluating process and the use of middlemen .
insiders suspect us influence india put out the tender for 197 military helicopters in 2001 , and in february of this year , named eurocopter as the winner of the contract , choosing the company 's as 550 c3 fennec over us-based bell helicopter 's bell 407 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is keen to sell fighterjets to india next year speculation is rife among diplomats and industry insiders that washington put pressure on the indian government in order to win the contract back for bell helicopter .

" we will act resolutely against anyone who seeks to resort to violence , " said nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer as he opened the meeting .
" regardless of the outcome of the status process , kosovo will remain and has to remain a place where kosovar albanians , serbs and others must be able to live in peace together , free from fear and free from intimidation , " he said .
following the failure of an international mediation effort to find a compromise on the future status of kosovo , ethnic albanian leaders in the province are expected to declare independence in the coming weeks , a move that could potentially unleash a new bout of unrest in the balkans .
nato currently has a 16,000-strong force deployed in the region , with four reserve battalions each comprised of several hundred troops on standby .

germany improved its standing by two places . the main reasons for germany 's improvement were its efforts to further international climate protection at summits of the european union and the g8 this year , bodies which berlin chaired at the time , according to the groups . " when it comes to politics , germany even gets first place , " germanwatch 's jan burck told german news agency dpa from the un climate change conference in bali , indonesia . but even sweden , which held the top spot on the climate change performance index last year as well , was not an example of ideal performance , the study determined .
and the international community was far from honoring its responsibilities , the groups said . better , but not good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's leaders should do more , the groups said " hardly any state is on the route that we need overall to keep the global temperature increase below two degrees and prevent a global climate destabilization , " matthias duwe , director of climate action network europe -lrb- can-europe -rrb- , told dpa . neither germany nor sweden , however , should see the study as a reason to boast about their current ranking , burck said in an interview with deutsche welle . " none of the countries , even in the top ten , are doing a quite good job , " burck told dw .
" even the front-runners are more the one-eyed king among of the blind than really good climate protectors . " he added that the ranking compared countries relative to each other , " -lsb- the top nations -rsb- do better than the rest , but actually they do not sufficient work to combat dangerous climate change . "
us the worst twelve eu countries were among the top 20 states on the index , including britain , france hungary and malta . australia , the united states and saudi arabia were at the very bottom of the index , at spots 54 , 55 and 56 respectively . the 10 highest emitters of carbon dioxide were the same as in 2006 , with the united states in the top slot , followed by china .
germany held sixth place on that list . the climate change performance index ranked 56 countries that can-europe and germanwatch said were responsible for more than 90 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions .
it looked at three indicators to establish countries ' rankings : per-capita emissions trends over previous years , absolute energy-related co2 emissions and domestic and international climate policy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one day after five boys were apparently murdered by their mother , the bodies of a young woman and her baby were found in a berlin apartment .
as the cases mount up , chancellor merkel said it is time to stop looking away . the 24-year-old woman , a drug user who allegedly lived alone with her 6-week-old baby , was believed to be hiv positive .
after she failed to attend an appointment at a welfare office last week , a social worker went to her apartment .
when no one answered , she called the police , who found the bodies .
police have ruled out both suicide and murder . on wednesday , dec .
5 , five children aged 3 to 9 were found suffocated at their home in darry , schleswig-holstein .
their mother , who had been undergoing psychiatric treatment , alerted doctors to what had happened . social services told reporters thursday that they had been in close contact with the family since august after one of the two fathers of the children reported difficulties .
prosecutors said they were preparing charges of murder , but would take into account the woman 's diminished responsibility . earlier this week , a 28-year-old woman was arrested on serial murder charges after the remains of three newborns were found on an apartment balcony in the town of plauen in saxony .
police said she told interrogators each of her three daughters " died suddenly " soon after birth in 2002 , 2004 and 2005 . statistics stable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : society needs to look after its children better , politicians said contrary to public perception , incidents of child death in the home are not on the increase , according to the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- .
even so , the recent infanticides have left politicians and public alike wondering if these tragedies could have been prevented , had social services been quicker to react . " society has to take action to ensure there is no repeat of such cases , " said heide simonis , head of the german section of the children 's relief organization unicef . weighing in on the debate about the protection of young children in germany and the role of the welfare offices , family affairs minister ursula von der leyen called the latest cases " a tragedy " and said investigations needed to be conducted to see if there had been indications something was wrong . " society as a whole has to take responsibility and not turn its back when it sees that a family is in despair or unable to cope , " said the minister . she also added her voice to calls for compulsory medical check-ups , on the grounds that these could help avert neglect and abuse . " if a family fails to attend , they will get an immediate visit from social services , " she told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" this is a way of filtering out families who might be at risk , so that they can be paid special attention . " on nov.21 , the schleswig-holstein parliament did indeed pass a law requiring compulsory health checks for children - too late for the five children who died this week in darry . society 's responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen , herself a mother of seven but according to georg ehrmann from the children 's aid organization , deutsche kinderhilfe direkt , these cases point to a " nationwide structural crisis in children 's aid . " neither social services nor neighbors offered the women in darry any help , he was quoted as saying the daily berliner zeitung . " we need better resources for welfare offices , compulsory check-ups and earlier intervention , " agreed marlis herterich from the german association for child protection . chancellor angela merkel , meanwhile , called on germans " not to look away " in cases where they suspect children are suffering from neglect . it was not just the responsibility of local authorities , the chancellor said . " it is something that concerns all of us , " she added .

7 .
germany improved its standing by two places . the main reasons for germany 's improvement were its efforts to further international climate protection at summits of the european union and the g8 this year , bodies which berlin chaired at the time , according to the groups . " when it comes to politics , germany even gets first place , " germanwatch 's jan burck told german news agency dpa from the un climate change conference in bali , indonesia . but even sweden , which held the top spot on the climate change performance index last year as well , was not an example of ideal performance , the study determined .
and the international community was far from honoring its responsibilities , the groups said . better , but not good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's leaders should do more , the groups said " hardly any state is on the route that we need overall to keep the global temperature increase below two degrees and prevent a global climate destabilization , " matthias duwe , director of climate action network europe -lrb- can-europe -rrb- , told dpa . neither germany nor sweden , however , should see the study as a reason to boast about their current ranking , burck said in an interview with deutsche welle . " none of the countries , even in the top ten , are doing a quite good job , " burck told dw .
" even the front-runners are more the one-eyed king among of the blind than really good climate protectors .

but insiders say there are other factors at work . the indian army scrapped the deal with eads subsidiary , eurocopter - the largest manufacturer of civil and military helicopters in the world - amid newspaper reports about irregularities in the bidding process and the illegal use of middlemen .
" we will issue a fresh request for proposals in the next two or three months , " said sitanshu kar , a defence ministry spokesman .
kar said the ministry was not commenting on why the deal collapsed ; although he went on to say that newspaper reports about the bidding process were " more or less correct . "

merkel promised to publicly speak out against mugabe 's corrupt government and contrast the economic chaos in zimbabwe with progress being made elsewhere in africa .
mugabe 's presence at the summit has posed a moral dilemma for many european leaders .
while african countries insisted on his presence , he is viewed as a dictator in the west .
british prime minister gordon brown cancelled after learning mugabe would attend .
merkel will take a more confrontational approach .
" this is such an important summit meeting that we should not let the presence of one country keep us from paying our respects to the rest of the continent , " merkel said wednesday .
europe wants more influence in africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to strengthen economic ties with africa the eu recently restated its commitment to promoting democracy and human rights in any partnership with africa .
yet it 's also unlikely that merkel and other european leaders ' insistence on discussing human rights will derail eu efforts to increase economic ties with africa .
merkel , like many of her european counterparts , sees the summit as a rare chance to form a strategic alliance with africa on issues such as trade and security .
it 's the first time in seven years eu and african leaders have met .
along with important economic agreements , countries hope to discuss immigration and climate change .
the summit is also seen as being crucial to counteracting china 's growing sway on the continent .
europe is currently africa 's biggest trading partner , but china has been steadily increasing its aid , investments and influence in africa .
merkel 's ethical stance is heartfelt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with the dalai lama despite criticism from china growing up as the daughter of a lutheran minister in communist east germany , gave merkel personal experience with human rights issues .
merkel has said that she would never promote business at the expense of human rights .
" human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .
" they should never be opposed to each another . "
merkel has shown that she understands the linkage between democratic values and economic prosperity , said ulrike guerot , a senior policy fellow in the german office of the european council on foreign relations .
merkel has made human rights a cornerstone of her foreign policy .
she has not shied away from criticizing the human rights record of important trading partners like russia and china .
she has even chastized her ally united states president george bush for holding suspected terrorists without due process in guantanamo bay , cuba . her unwavering position has earned her respect from fellow christian democrats as well as internationally , guerot said .
on the other hand , merkel is not likely to derail talks with africa over her human rights stance , guerot said , as " it 's a twofold dialogue . "
criticism unlikely to sway mugabe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has been a lightning rod of criticism mugabe , 83 , came to power in 1980 after zimbabwe gained independence from britain .
along with being accused of a variety of human rights abuses , he is also blamed for sinking zimbabwe into an economic crisis .
unemployment in the country stands at 80 percent and inflation has reached some 3,700 percent in recent years .
yet the bilateral summit would n't have taken place without him .
many african leaders view him as a hero of independence and insisted on his presence in lisbon .
while brown boycotted the summit , nearly 80 other eu and african leaders will attend .
both brown 's boycott and merkel 's confrontation send mugabe an important message of disapproval , said dzikamai machingura , the national director of zimrights , a human rights group based in zimbabwe 's capital city of harare .
yet machingura hopes europe wo n't give mugabe 's government a blank check .
aid money without evidence of human rights improvements would be like " feeding a bully , " machingura said .
merkel also should n't be under any delusions that her tough talk will change the situation in zimbabwe .
most likely , when faced with criticism at the summit , mugabe will react arrogantly and dismissively , machingura predicted .
diplomacy will determine outcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is a vital partner in africa it 's hard to predict how mugabe or other african leaders will comport themselves at the summit , said ross herbert , head of the governance program for the south african institute of international affairs .
there 's growing recognition among african leaders that human rights are an important part of bringing economic and democratic progress to their countries .
yet europeans will need to be careful in how they single out zimbabwe or sudan for criticism as there 's also a tradition in africa of " closing ranks against outside critics , " herbert said .

germany improved its standing by two places . the main reasons for germany 's improvement were its efforts to further international climate protection at summits of the european union and the g8 this year , bodies which berlin chaired at the time , according to the groups . " when it comes to politics , germany even gets first place , " germanwatch 's jan burck told german news agency dpa from the un climate change conference in bali , indonesia . but even sweden , which held the top spot on the climate change performance index last year as well , was not an example of ideal performance , the study determined .
and the international community was far from honoring its responsibilities , the groups said . better , but not good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's leaders should do more , the groups said " hardly any state is on the route that we need overall to keep the global temperature increase below two degrees and prevent a global climate destabilization , " matthias duwe , director of climate action network europe -lrb- can-europe -rrb- , told dpa . neither germany nor sweden , however , should see the study as a reason to boast about their current ranking , burck said in an interview with deutsche welle . " none of the countries , even in the top ten , are doing a quite good job , " burck told dw .
" even the front-runners are more the one-eyed king among of the blind than really good climate protectors . " he added that the ranking compared countries relative to each other , " -lsb- the top nations -rsb- do better than the rest , but actually they do not sufficient work to combat dangerous climate change . "
us the worst twelve eu countries were among the top 20 states on the index , including britain , france hungary and malta . australia , the united states and saudi arabia were at the very bottom of the index , at spots 54 , 55 and 56 respectively . the 10 highest emitters of carbon dioxide were the same as in 2006 , with the united states in the top slot , followed by china .
germany held sixth place on that list . the climate change performance index ranked 56 countries that can-europe and germanwatch said were responsible for more than 90 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions .
it looked at three indicators to establish countries ' rankings : per-capita emissions trends over previous years , absolute energy-related co2 emissions and domestic and international climate policy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is n't about restricting freedom of opinion ; it 's about examining what the limits are . " schubert told reuters she hoped that by filing the case , she would encourage public debate on how far internet platforms should be allowed to aid proponents of extremist , anti-semitic and racist ideologies .

serbia 's path to closer ties with the european union has been consistently blocked by its failure to arrest four war crimes suspects including mladic .
del ponte argued that if the eu signed a partnership accord before their arrest , " it will weaken the real -lrb- serbian -rrb- intention to give us the fugitives " .
" it will depend exclusively on the eu if we will have mladic in the hague in the next weeks and months , " del ponte told news agencies .
mladic and former bosnian serb president radovan karadzic are still at large , wanted on genocide charges during the 1991-95 bosnian war , including masterminding the 1995 srebrenica massacre of nearly 8,000 muslims .
negative assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radovan karadzic -lrb- r -rrb- und ratko mladic - still on the loose the prosecutor will be submitting a report on serbia 's work with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to the un security council on december 10 , when eu foreign ministers will also be discussing serbia 's eu accession .
if mladic is not in custody in the hague by monday , " there will be a negative assessment on -lrb- serbia 's -rrb- cooperation with the tribunal , " said del ponte .
eu officials initialed a pre-membership deal with serbia on nov .
7 , after saying it was satisfied with belgrade 's efforts . but del ponte , says a formal signing of that agreement hinges on full cooperation .
" for me , it means mladic , " she said thursday in an interview with the associated press .
" mladic in the hague . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international opinion on the future make-up of kosovo is divided but the outgoing war crimes prosecutor also pointed out that making mladic 's arrest all the more unlikely is the issue of kosovo independence , which is currently " distracting belgrade , " she told reuters .
the future of the province with its ethnic albanian majority has played a key role in her efforts to arrest mladic .
the un security council is also set to discuss the status of kosovo on monday - the last day of the un mandate on the serbian province , when serbia 's negotiations with kosovo formally end .
" politically , it is a very delicate situation , " said del ponte in an interview with reuters . " in the end the kosovo decision … prevents the arrest of mladic . "
" the kosovo issue is unfortunately combined with our request -lrb- to the eu -rrb- , " del ponte has said .
" they have other political priorities and that makes it difficult for us to obtain the arrest and transfer of mladic " . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

serbia 's path to closer ties with the european union has been consistently blocked by its failure to arrest four war crimes suspects including mladic .
del ponte argued that if the eu signed a partnership accord before their arrest , " it will weaken the real -lrb- serbian -rrb- intention to give us the fugitives " .
" it will depend exclusively on the eu if we will have mladic in the hague in the next weeks and months , " del ponte told news agencies .
mladic and former bosnian serb president radovan karadzic are still at large , wanted on genocide charges during the 1991-95 bosnian war , including masterminding the 1995 srebrenica massacre of nearly 8,000 muslims .
negative assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radovan karadzic -lrb- r -rrb- und ratko mladic - still on the loose the prosecutor will be submitting a report on serbia 's work with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to the un security council on december 10 , when eu foreign ministers will also be discussing serbia 's eu accession .
if mladic is not in custody in the hague by monday , " there will be a negative assessment on -lrb- serbia 's -rrb- cooperation with the tribunal , " said del ponte .
eu officials initialed a pre-membership deal with serbia on nov .
7 , after saying it was satisfied with belgrade 's efforts . but del ponte , says a formal signing of that agreement hinges on full cooperation .
" for me , it means mladic , " she said thursday in an interview with the associated press .
" mladic in the hague . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international opinion on the future make-up of kosovo is divided but the outgoing war crimes prosecutor also pointed out that making mladic 's arrest all the more unlikely is the issue of kosovo independence , which is currently " distracting belgrade , " she told reuters .
the future of the province with its ethnic albanian majority has played a key role in her efforts to arrest mladic .
the un security council is also set to discuss the status of kosovo on monday - the last day of the un mandate on the serbian province , when serbia 's negotiations with kosovo formally end .
" politically , it is a very delicate situation , " said del ponte in an interview with reuters . " in the end the kosovo decision … prevents the arrest of mladic . "
" the kosovo issue is unfortunately combined with our request -lrb- to the eu -rrb- , " del ponte has said .
" they have other political priorities and that makes it difficult for us to obtain the arrest and transfer of mladic " . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 .
germany improved its standing by two places . the main reasons for germany 's improvement were its efforts to further international climate protection at summits of the european union and the g8 this year , bodies which berlin chaired at the time , according to the groups . " when it comes to politics , germany even gets first place , " germanwatch 's jan burck told german news agency dpa from the un climate change conference in bali , indonesia . but even sweden , which held the top spot on the climate change performance index last year as well , was not an example of ideal performance , the study determined .
and the international community was far from honoring its responsibilities , the groups said . better , but not good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's leaders should do more , the groups said " hardly any state is on the route that we need overall to keep the global temperature increase below two degrees and prevent a global climate destabilization , " matthias duwe , director of climate action network europe -lrb- can-europe -rrb- , told dpa . neither germany nor sweden , however , should see the study as a reason to boast about their current ranking , burck said in an interview with deutsche welle . " none of the countries , even in the top ten , are doing a quite good job , " burck told dw .
" even the front-runners are more the one-eyed king among of the blind than really good climate protectors . " he added that the ranking compared countries relative to each other , " -lsb- the top nations -rsb- do better than the rest , but actually they do not sufficient work to combat dangerous climate change . "
us the worst twelve eu countries were among the top 20 states on the index , including britain , france hungary and malta . australia , the united states and saudi arabia were at the very bottom of the index , at spots 54 , 55 and 56 respectively . the 10 highest emitters of carbon dioxide were the same as in 2006 , with the united states in the top slot , followed by china .
germany held sixth place on that list . the climate change performance index ranked 56 countries that can-europe and germanwatch said were responsible for more than 90 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions .
it looked at three indicators to establish countries ' rankings : per-capita emissions trends over previous years , absolute energy-related co2 emissions and domestic and international climate policy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so that dictates part of the sensing system you will bring with you .

you need to send those high definition signals back , so you will need a high bandwidth system .
that is one of the technical challenges that we are addressing . "

top-of-the-range four-wheel drive vehicles can be seen parked outside and whisky seems to be the favoured drink .
each glass costs several times the average daily income of less than $ 1 a day .
this money is not coming from the country 's traditional mainstay , cashew nuts .
it is coming from cocaine .
" we can see these people walking in complete freedom ; they are parading their wealth , " says jamel handem , the head of a coalition of civic groups known as platform gb .
" they 're showing it completely openly . "
no prison mr handem says that everyone knows someone who has been cashing in on the drugs trade .
the traffickers , mainly colombians trying to get their produce to europe , have been drawn to this tiny country of just one-and-half million people by a number of factors .
see map of west african cocaine seizures the geography of the country is crucial , according to university rector and social commentator fafali kudawo .
" this is a country that has a mainland , and a group of islands - an archipelago - and the maritime part of the country is bigger than the mainland , " he says .
" and the country does n't have a navy to control all that space .
it 's an open border for whoever wants to bring drugs into the country . "
the near-total absence of the rule of law also makes guinea bissau attractive to drugs .
lucinda aukarie : tonnes of cocaine pass through guinea bissau each week " law enforcement has literally no control for two reasons : there is no capacity and there is no equipment , " says amado philip de andres , the deputy regional head of the un office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- .
" it 's a country where there 's not even a prison ... it 's an easy country to actually be active if you 're mafia , an organised crime lord . "
even by the standards of guinea bissau 's desperately under-funded state institutions , the judicial police are hard-up .
while criminal gangs use satellite phones , aircraft , and speedboats , the judicial police struggle on without so much as a computer .
the head of the judicial police , lucinda aukarie , knows she is confronting a massive problem .
" we not sure exactly how much cocaine is moving through the country , but we think each week there are tonnes , " she says .
" at the moment , we believe that the drug traffickers are making more use of ports and the branches of rivers . "
army suspects but it is not just a lack of resources hampering the police .
there are also indications that members of the armed forces are involved in the trade .
in april , two military personnel were arrested in a vehicle carrying 635kg of cocaine .
they were soon released from detention and have yet to stand trial .
where is the evidence ?
just please , bring the evidence .
that 's what we 're asking for colonel arsenio balde , on allegations the military are involved in drug trafficking but army spokesman colonel arsenio balde says they were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time .
" they were on the road waiting for a ride and they saw this car driving by , " he explains .
" they asked for a ride and then this guy stopped , and later on this car was arrested , the car and everybody . "
and he rejects the un 's suggestion that senior military personnel are involved .
" where is the evidence ?
just please , bring the evidence .
that 's what we 're asking for . "
but there are also well-founded suspicions that parts of the government are protecting the traffickers .
last year , two-thirds of a tonne of cocaine went missing from the treasury , where it had been deposited for safe-keeping after being seized by the police .
asked if the government was involved in the illegal trade , its spokesman , pedro da costa , told me that he had no information on the subject .
he did , though , acknowledge that he shared the concerns of some observers that drug trafficking could push the country back into a repeat of civil war of the late 1990s .
call for action the unodc has drawn up a detailed plan to help guinea bissau reform its security services , boost the judicial police , and build a jail .
the navy is ill-equipped to cover all of guinea bissau 's islands the estimated cost is $ 20m , but funding has only been secured for 1 % of the budget .
mr de andres , says the world must take immediate action .
" this is now actually the last wake-up call that the international community can receive , " he says .
" please act now , we have to act now .
if we do n't the situation will explode .
" drug traffickers know that they can move freely in bissau , they will do it , they will take control of the region , they will coordinate and we 'll all be the losers - meaning the international community and west african countries . "
a donor conference to be held in portugal on 19 december may signal a change of attitude .
if not , guinea bissau faces the prospect of becoming a unique type of failed state - a " narco-state " - run mainly for the benefit of drugs gangs .

" at the moment , we believe that the drug traffickers are making more use of ports and the branches of rivers . "
army suspects but it is not just a lack of resources hampering the police .
there are also indications that members of the armed forces are involved in the trade .
in april , two military personnel were arrested in a vehicle carrying 635kg of cocaine .
they were soon released from detention and have yet to stand trial .
where is the evidence ?
just please , bring the evidence .
that 's what we 're asking for colonel arsenio balde , on allegations the military are involved in drug trafficking but army spokesman colonel arsenio balde says they were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time .
" they were on the road waiting for a ride and they saw this car driving by , " he explains .
" they asked for a ride and then this guy stopped , and later on this car was arrested , the car and everybody . "
and he rejects the un 's suggestion that senior military personnel are involved .
" where is the evidence ?
just please , bring the evidence .
that 's what we 're asking for . "
but there are also well-founded suspicions that parts of the government are protecting the traffickers .
last year , two-thirds of a tonne of cocaine went missing from the treasury , where it had been deposited for safe-keeping after being seized by the police .
asked if the government was involved in the illegal trade , its spokesman , pedro da costa , told me that he had no information on the subject .
he did , though , acknowledge that he shared the concerns of some observers that drug trafficking could push the country back into a repeat of civil war of the late 1990s .
call for action the unodc has drawn up a detailed plan to help guinea bissau reform its security services , boost the judicial police , and build a jail .
the navy is ill-equipped to cover all of guinea bissau 's islands the estimated cost is $ 20m , but funding has only been secured for 1 % of the budget .
mr de andres , says the world must take immediate action .
" this is now actually the last wake-up call that the international community can receive , " he says .
" please act now , we have to act now .
if we do n't the situation will explode .
" drug traffickers know that they can move freely in bissau , they will do it , they will take control of the region , they will coordinate and we 'll all be the losers - meaning the international community and west african countries . "
a donor conference to be held in portugal on 19 december may signal a change of attitude .
if not , guinea bissau faces the prospect of becoming a unique type of failed state - a " narco-state " - run mainly for the benefit of drugs gangs .

state media says the managers of the mine have been arrested for causing the accident by mining a coal seam that had not been authorised for production .
they also allegedly delayed reporting the accident for six hours while conducting their own rescue operation .
china 's coal mines are among the most dangerous in the world .
the underground blast occurred at the rui zhiyuan mine in shanxi province 's linfen city , state-run news agency xinhua said .
it is not clear what caused it .
xinhua said rescue workers believed managers at the mine had tried to launch a rescue operation by themselves , " which magnified the number of casualties " .
no surprise the facts of this latest mine disaster are grimly familiar , says the bbc correspondent in shanghai , quentin somerville .
china - and perhaps the rest of the world - is growing used to this loss of life .
an average of 13 miners are killed every single day down the pits .
in august , 181 miners were killed when floodwater poured into a mine in shandong province in the east of the country .
rising demand for energy and fuel means that owners and local officials often ignore safety issues in pursuit of profits .
the government has launched an ongoing safety campaign , and keeps calling for more to be done .
officials warned recently that as mines increased output to meet increasing winter demand , accidents were even more likely to happen in the next few months .

state media says the managers of the mine have been arrested for causing the accident by mining a coal seam that had not been authorised for production .
they also allegedly delayed reporting the accident for six hours while conducting their own rescue operation .
china 's coal mines are among the most dangerous in the world .
the underground blast occurred at the rui zhiyuan mine in shanxi province 's linfen city , state-run news agency xinhua said .
it is not clear what caused it .
xinhua said rescue workers believed managers at the mine had tried to launch a rescue operation by themselves , " which magnified the number of casualties " .
no surprise the facts of this latest mine disaster are grimly familiar , says the bbc correspondent in shanghai , quentin somerville .
china - and perhaps the rest of the world - is growing used to this loss of life .
an average of 13 miners are killed every single day down the pits .
in august , 181 miners were killed when floodwater poured into a mine in shandong province in the east of the country .
rising demand for energy and fuel means that owners and local officials often ignore safety issues in pursuit of profits .
the government has launched an ongoing safety campaign , and keeps calling for more to be done .
officials warned recently that as mines increased output to meet increasing winter demand , accidents were even more likely to happen in the next few months .

speaking at the online information conference at london 's olympia , he played down the long-running controversy over the site 's authority .
he said young students should be able to reference the online encyclopaedia in their work .
mr wales said the site , which is edited by users , should be seen as a " stepping stone " to other sources .
as long as an article included accurate citations , he said he had " no problem " with it being used as a reference for younger students , although academics would " probably be better off doing their own research " .
" you can ban kids from listening to rock ' n ' roll music , but they 're going to anyway , " he added .
" it 's the same with information , and it 's a bad educator that bans their students from reading wikipedia . "
in 2005 , at the height of the controversy over the site 's accuracy , mr wales told the bbc that students who copied information from wikipedia " deserved to get an f grade " .
mr wales said the website still lacked the authority to be used as a citeable source for college-aged and university students .
but he said new editing and checking procedures had made wikipedia more trustworthy .
changing procedures since the controversy , in which it emerged that the " free editing " policy had allowed articles containing inaccuracies and bias to appear , the site has introduced a system of real-time peer review , in which volunteers check new and updated articles for accuracy and impartiality .
volunteers check wikipedia entries for inaccuracies and bias despite advances in technology , there are no plans to automate this process .
" there is no substitute for peer critique , " mr wales told delegates .
it is this perceived lack of authority that has drawn criticism from other information sources .
ian allgar of encyclopaedia britannica maintains that , with 239 years of history and rigorous fact-checking procedures , britannica should remain a leader in authoritative , politically-neutral information .
mr allgar pointed out the trustworthy nature of paid-for , thoroughly-reviewed content , and noted that wikipedia is still prone to vandalism .
but britannica and wikipedia should not be seen as direct competitors .
wikipedia , he said , had made the use of encyclopaedias " trendy and popular " with young people , which could only benefit britannica 's subscription-led service .
content licensing jimmy wales also said that the free software foundation would be rolling out a new version of its free documentation licence , which wikipedia may adopt .
we are the red cross for information .
we wo n't sell out to google jimmy wales although wikipedia allows users to copy , modify and redistribute information , commercially or non-commercially , the new licensing regime , based on the existing creative commons scheme , would " bring wikipedia into line with the rest of the free content culture " , if adopted .
mr wales reiterated his commitment to keeping the wikimedia foundation free of corporate sponsorship , and of major donors who might want control of online information .
" we are the red cross for information .
we wo n't sell out to google , " he said .
the foundation is , however , expanding into the search function , with july 's announcement of the wikia search facility which combines open-source searching and social networking .
" this is a political statement against proprietary-driven software tools , " mr wales said .
" wiki wants to give people the maximum freedom to do good . "
bbc monitoring selects and translates news from radio , television , press , news agencies and the internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages .
it is based in caversham , uk , and has several bureaux abroad .

speaking at the online information conference at london 's olympia , he played down the long-running controversy over the site 's authority .
he said young students should be able to reference the online encyclopaedia in their work .
mr wales said the site , which is edited by users , should be seen as a " stepping stone " to other sources .
as long as an article included accurate citations , he said he had " no problem " with it being used as a reference for younger students , although academics would " probably be better off doing their own research " .
" you can ban kids from listening to rock ' n ' roll music , but they 're going to anyway , " he added .
" it 's the same with information , and it 's a bad educator that bans their students from reading wikipedia . "
in 2005 , at the height of the controversy over the site 's accuracy , mr wales told the bbc that students who copied information from wikipedia " deserved to get an f grade " .
mr wales said the website still lacked the authority to be used as a citeable source for college-aged and university students .
but he said new editing and checking procedures had made wikipedia more trustworthy .
changing procedures since the controversy , in which it emerged that the " free editing " policy had allowed articles containing inaccuracies and bias to appear , the site has introduced a system of real-time peer review , in which volunteers check new and updated articles for accuracy and impartiality .
volunteers check wikipedia entries for inaccuracies and bias despite advances in technology , there are no plans to automate this process .
" there is no substitute for peer critique , " mr wales told delegates .
it is this perceived lack of authority that has drawn criticism from other information sources .
ian allgar of encyclopaedia britannica maintains that , with 239 years of history and rigorous fact-checking procedures , britannica should remain a leader in authoritative , politically-neutral information .
mr allgar pointed out the trustworthy nature of paid-for , thoroughly-reviewed content , and noted that wikipedia is still prone to vandalism .
but britannica and wikipedia should not be seen as direct competitors .
wikipedia , he said , had made the use of encyclopaedias " trendy and popular " with young people , which could only benefit britannica 's subscription-led service .
content licensing jimmy wales also said that the free software foundation would be rolling out a new version of its free documentation licence , which wikipedia may adopt .
we are the red cross for information .
we wo n't sell out to google jimmy wales although wikipedia allows users to copy , modify and redistribute information , commercially or non-commercially , the new licensing regime , based on the existing creative commons scheme , would " bring wikipedia into line with the rest of the free content culture " , if adopted .
mr wales reiterated his commitment to keeping the wikimedia foundation free of corporate sponsorship , and of major donors who might want control of online information .
" we are the red cross for information .
we wo n't sell out to google , " he said .
the foundation is , however , expanding into the search function , with july 's announcement of the wikia search facility which combines open-source searching and social networking .
" this is a political statement against proprietary-driven software tools , " mr wales said .
" wiki wants to give people the maximum freedom to do good . "

speaking at the online information conference at london 's olympia , he played down the long-running controversy over the site 's authority .
he said young students should be able to reference the online encyclopaedia in their work .
mr wales said the site , which is edited by users , should be seen as a " stepping stone " to other sources .
as long as an article included accurate citations , he said he had " no problem " with it being used as a reference for younger students , although academics would " probably be better off doing their own research " .
" you can ban kids from listening to rock ' n ' roll music , but they 're going to anyway , " he added .
" it 's the same with information , and it 's a bad educator that bans their students from reading wikipedia . "
in 2005 , at the height of the controversy over the site 's accuracy , mr wales told the bbc that students who copied information from wikipedia " deserved to get an f grade " .
mr wales said the website still lacked the authority to be used as a citeable source for college-aged and university students .
but he said new editing and checking procedures had made wikipedia more trustworthy .
changing procedures since the controversy , in which it emerged that the " free editing " policy had allowed articles containing inaccuracies and bias to appear , the site has introduced a system of real-time peer review , in which volunteers check new and updated articles for accuracy and impartiality .
volunteers check wikipedia entries for inaccuracies and bias despite advances in technology , there are no plans to automate this process .
" there is no substitute for peer critique , " mr wales told delegates .
it is this perceived lack of authority that has drawn criticism from other information sources .
ian allgar of encyclopaedia britannica maintains that , with 239 years of history and rigorous fact-checking procedures , britannica should remain a leader in authoritative , politically-neutral information .
mr allgar pointed out the trustworthy nature of paid-for , thoroughly-reviewed content , and noted that wikipedia is still prone to vandalism .
but britannica and wikipedia should not be seen as direct competitors .
wikipedia , he said , had made the use of encyclopaedias " trendy and popular " with young people , which could only benefit britannica 's subscription-led service .
content licensing jimmy wales also said that the free software foundation would be rolling out a new version of its free documentation licence , which wikipedia may adopt .

we wo n't sell out to google jimmy wales although wikipedia allows users to copy , modify and redistribute information , commercially or non-commercially , the new licensing regime , based on the existing creative commons scheme , would " bring wikipedia into line with the rest of the free content culture " , if adopted .
mr wales reiterated his commitment to keeping the wikimedia foundation free of corporate sponsorship , and of major donors who might want control of online information .
" we are the red cross for information .
we wo n't sell out to google , " he said .
the foundation is , however , expanding into the search function , with july 's announcement of the wikia search facility which combines open-source searching and social networking .

speaking at the online information conference at london 's olympia , he played down the long-running controversy over the site 's authority .
he said young students should be able to reference the online encyclopaedia in their work .
mr wales said the site , which is edited by users , should be seen as a " stepping stone " to other sources .
as long as an article included accurate citations , he said he had " no problem " with it being used as a reference for younger students , although academics would " probably be better off doing their own research " .
" you can ban kids from listening to rock ' n ' roll music , but they 're going to anyway , " he added .
" it 's the same with information , and it 's a bad educator that bans their students from reading wikipedia . "
in 2005 , at the height of the controversy over the site 's accuracy , mr wales told the bbc that students who copied information from wikipedia " deserved to get an f grade " .
mr wales said the website still lacked the authority to be used as a citeable source for college-aged and university students .
but he said new editing and checking procedures had made wikipedia more trustworthy .
changing procedures since the controversy , in which it emerged that the " free editing " policy had allowed articles containing inaccuracies and bias to appear , the site has introduced a system of real-time peer review , in which volunteers check new and updated articles for accuracy and impartiality .
despite advances in technology , there are no plans to automate this process .
" there is no substitute for peer critique , " mr wales told delegates .
it is this perceived lack of authority that has drawn criticism from other information sources .
ian allgar of encyclopaedia britannica maintains that , with 239 years of history and rigorous fact-checking procedures , britannica should remain a leader in authoritative , politically-neutral information .
mr allgar pointed out the trustworthy nature of paid-for , thoroughly-reviewed content , and noted that wikipedia is still prone to vandalism .
but britannica and wikipedia should not be seen as direct competitors .
wikipedia , he said , had made the use of encyclopaedias " trendy and popular " with young people , which could only benefit britannica 's subscription-led service .
content licensing jimmy wales also said that the free software foundation would be rolling out a new version of its free documentation licence , which wikipedia may adopt . "
we are the red cross for information .
we wo n't sell out to google " jimmy wales although wikipedia allows users to copy , modify and redistribute information , commercially or non-commercially , the new licensing regime , based on the existing creative commons scheme , would " bring wikipedia into line with the rest of the free content culture " , if adopted .
mr wales reiterated his commitment to keeping the wikimedia foundation free of corporate sponsorship , and of major donors who might want control of online information .
" we are the red cross for information .
we wo n't sell out to google , " he said .
the foundation is , however , expanding into the search function , with july 's announcement of the wikia search facility which combines open-source searching and social networking .
" this is a political statement against proprietary-driven software tools , " mr wales said .
" wiki wants to give people the maximum freedom to do good . "
bbc monitoring selects and translates news from radio , television , press , news agencies and the internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages .
it is based in caversham , uk , and has several bureaux abroad .

by reprogramming skin cells in the lab to become stem cells , the us team were able to treat mice with a human type of sickle cell anaemia , science reports .
as well as being in plentiful supply , using skin cells as a therapy also gets round the ethics surrounding the use of other stem-cell based treatments .
experts stressed more safety work was needed before moving trials to humans .
stem cells stem cells are at an early stage of development and retain the potential to turn into many different types of cell , which means they have the scope to treat a number of diseases .
scientists believe the most useful stem cells come from the tissue of embryos .
this is because they are pluripotent - they have the ability to become virtually any type of cell within the body .
stem cells are also found within adult organs , including skin .
while the reprogrammed skin cells in the latest study - called induced pluripotent stem cells or ips cells - hold tremendous promise , the scientists caution they also have the potential to cause dangerous side effects .
safety issues to make the ips cells , the scientists started with cells from the skin of the diseased mice , then used viruses , called retroviruses , to insert therapeutic genes into the dna of these cells .
while this was effective , the retroviruses have the ability to make random changes to dna elsewhere in the body , which could potentially lead to complications , such as cancer .
lead researcher rudolf jaenisch , of the whitehead institute for biomedical research in massachusetts , said : " we need a delivery system that does n't integrate itself into the genome . "
we need more research .
there are still significant hurdles to overcome " professor azim surani of the university of cambridge " retroviruses can disrupt genes that should not be disrupted or activate genes that should not be activated . "
professor azim surani of the university of cambridge said : " this is an important step forwards .
" but in addition to the safety concerns , we have to be cautious about extrapolating from mouse studies to humans .
" the mouse ips cells are not identical to human ips cells .
we need more research .
there are still significant hurdles to overcome . "
more than 12,500 people in the uk have sickle cell anaemia .
it is an inherited disease which affects the ability of red blood cells to carry oxygen and can cause severe pain , and damage to the organs .

this is because they are pluripotent - they have the ability to become virtually any type of cell within the body .
stem cells are also found within adult organs , including skin .
while the reprogrammed skin cells in the latest study - called induced pluripotent stem cells or ips cells - hold tremendous promise , the scientists caution they also have the potential to cause dangerous side effects .
safety issues to make the ips cells , the scientists started with cells from the skin of the diseased mice , then used viruses , called retroviruses , to insert therapeutic genes into the dna of these cells .
while this was effective , the retroviruses have the ability to make random changes to dna elsewhere in the body , which could potentially lead to complications , such as cancer .
lead researcher rudolf jaenisch , of the whitehead institute for biomedical research in massachusetts , said : " we need a delivery system that does n't integrate itself into the genome .
we need more research .
there are still significant hurdles to overcome professor azim surani of the university of cambridge " retroviruses can disrupt genes that should not be disrupted or activate genes that should not be activated . "
professor azim surani of the university of cambridge said : " this is an important step forwards .
" but in addition to the safety concerns , we have to be cautious about extrapolating from mouse studies to humans .
" the mouse ips cells are not identical to human ips cells .
we need more research .
there are still significant hurdles to overcome . "
more than 12,500 people in the uk have sickle cell anaemia .
it is an inherited disease which affects the ability of red blood cells to carry oxygen and can cause severe pain , and damage to the organs .

government statistics say one in three male drivers aged 17-20 crash within two years of passing their test .
the right direction scheme will see learners between 16-25 receive training to improve risk analysis and on understanding driver limitations .
the two-week programme involves driving simulators , commentary driving lessons and road safety education .
the project has been developed by members of the road safety partnership , including merseyside fire and rescue service , merseyside road safety officers group and the british school of motoring .
gill roberts , chair of merseyside road safety officers group , said : " too many young drivers drive too fast , take undue risks and lack experience in anticipating hazards on the road .
" the right direction addresses these issues in a practical way while they are learning to drive .
we are confident that this will result in fewer injuries for this most vulnerable group . "
if the pilot scheme proves successful it is expected the driving standards agency will adopt it nationwide .

government statistics say one in three male drivers aged 17-20 crash within two years of passing their test .
the right direction scheme will see learners between 16-25 receive training to improve risk analysis and on understanding driver limitations .
the two-week programme involves driving simulators , commentary driving lessons and road safety education .
the project has been developed by members of the road safety partnership , including merseyside fire and rescue service , merseyside road safety officers group and the british school of motoring .
gill roberts , chair of merseyside road safety officers group , said : " too many young drivers drive too fast , take undue risks and lack experience in anticipating hazards on the road .
" the right direction addresses these issues in a practical way while they are learning to drive .
we are confident that this will result in fewer injuries for this most vulnerable group . "
if the pilot scheme proves successful it is expected the driving standards agency will adopt it nationwide .

more people are watching video online already people are seeing the amount of bandwidth they can use limited by monthly caps and , in the us , operators have just won the right to charge more for bandwidth-hungry services .
with next-generation networks likely to cost billions to roll out , the issue of how operators will make money from them becomes even more pertinent .
network operators in the us , and increasingly also in the uk , believe that rather than pass all of the costs on to the end user , content providers should also put their hands in their pockets in order to guarantee the best delivery of their services .
but others feel that allowing operators to prioritise certain traffic over other is fundamentally at odds with the free principles of the net which has allowed companies to flourish from very humble beginnings .
pipe-dreams ?
plusnet offers a service tailored to gamers operators argue that it is unrealistic to expect all the services available via a broadband connection to go on being treated equally within the highly commercial world the net now operates within .
" it could be time for a new pricing model , " said simon gunter , head of strategy at uk isp tiscali .
he added : " we have to handle much more video and the question is - how do we square the costs of distributing lots of content ?
we could look to minimise the costs of distribution and in that the content originators may need to contribute . "
already some operators offer tailored packages .
for example , uk internet service provider plusnet offers a broadband package aimed just at gamers .
" it offers a better performance .
gamers are assured of a faster gaming service , " said neil laycock , chief executive of plusnet .
going forward he expects more and more consumers to demand a certain quality of service from specific applications such as broadband telephony .
" net neutrality is an issue no isp can escape .
we 're convinced that demand for bandwidth driven by innovative applications will always outstrip the physical and economic supply of network , " he said .
" for that reason , net neutrality is a pipe-dream .
we believe it is vital to put the customer in control of what takes priority on their line and we 're already developing that capability , " he said .
quality of service the debate to maintain a neutral net has been raging most vehemently across the pond where competition between cable and rival operators is fierce .
in the us network providers such as verizon and at & t have effectively already won the right to prioritise the traffic of certain content providers , a power that has horrified net activists .
" the problem with the system in the us is that in order to guarantee one player 's content it is prioritised over someone else 's " explained antony walker , head of the uk 's broadband stakeholder 's group .
" that is moving away from the basic model of the net that created innovators such as myspace and youtube on the basis that all bits of content were equal , " he said .
competition could the us learn lessons from the uk broadband market ?
the issue in the us is being fought by organisations such as the open internet coalition .
companies with a huge net presence such as google and microsoft have also joined the campaign .
the open internet coalition says some companies are employing network management tools to deliberately block file-sharing traffic , irrespective of what files are being shared .
it also accuses companies of blocking content that they feel is too political in nature or is in someway derogatory to them .
for companies such as operax , which offers the network management tools that allow operators to prioritise traffic , the issue is being blown out of proportion .
" the major arguers for net neutrality say that access to the network will be locked down for commercial advantage but i think that is a myth .
there is no evil plan and everyone recognises that a competitive net is a key driver , " said chris merrick , chief marketing officer with operax .
the prices that companies such as verizon - which is investing $ 18bn in a fibre network to reach huge swathes of the us - are paying to connect people need to be recouped somehow , he argues .
" what people are saying is ' let 's have quality of service for specific services such as voice-over ip and iptv .
let 's allocate resources to make sure they work effectively while still guaranteeing access to the free-for-all internet . ' , " he said .
many believe the debate is unlikely to become quite so heated in the uk as it has in the us , largely down to the fact that the uk has a far more competitive market .
" essentially the issue of net neutrality is about competition .
in the us the broadband market operates like a duopoly , " said antony walker .
pricier services ?
the regulatory landscape in the uk is such that there is far more competition with 60 % of homes having a choice of at least four broadband providers .
and ofcom forces bt to act with so-called " equivalence " so that any services it offers to consumers must also be offered in a wholesale version .
it is a system that the us is looking closely at .
one thing which most commentators agree on is that the cost of rolling out next-generation broadband is unlikely to be passed on to the consumer .
" the question is not whether you can charge more but rather whether you will even be able to charge what you charge today , " said ian fogg , an analyst with research firm jupiter .
and whether consumers are going to be accept their content in a series of differently tailored packages is also open to debate , he thinks .
" people are used to the concept that when they pay for broadband they are paying for access to the whole internet , with a choice of websites .
packaging it is going against what the internet is about , " he said .
