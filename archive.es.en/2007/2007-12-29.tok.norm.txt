" nuclear weapons should never fall into the hands of islamists .
despite the current unstable situation , there is not yet any concrete risk -lrb- that it could happen -rrb- but the situation has to be put right for that to remain true , " steinmeier told weekly bild am sonntag in an interview to be published sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is n't the only one fretting about pakistan 's nuclear weapons " we will discuss what we can do to this end with the united nations , the united states and the europeans , " he added . " we are horrified by the cruel attack " which cost former prime minister bhutto her life and " which has created a situation which could lead to the most serious crisis in the history of pakistan , " he said .
he called on pakistani politicians " to work together now to stand up to the -lrb- islamist -rrb- fundamentalists . " west concerned by pakistan unrest steinmeier 's comments reflect growing concerns among western leaders about pakistan 's slide into violence after bhutto was killed in a suicide attack after an election rally in the city of rawalpindi on dec .
27 . more than 40 people have been killed in pakistan in rioting and shootings as inflamed supporters of bhutto went on the rampage in several cities and towns .
violence continued on saturday , dec 29 , as protesters in the southern province of sindh , bhutto 's political stronghold , torched shops , lorries , welfare centres and ambulances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto was killed in a suicide attack after an election rally bhutto 's killing has also thrown into doubt whether pakistan can hold an election in 10 days time that was meant to complete a transition to civilian rule . the united states and other western allies have urged president pervez musharraf to press ahead with polls they hope will bring stability to a country emerging from eight years of military rule while facing growing violence from islamist militants allied to al qaeda . pakistan 's nuclear status sparks jitters but it 's the thought of pakistan 's nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands that has sparked profound unease in the west . france echoed germany 's concerns over pakistan 's nuclear capability falling into the hands of extremists and the killing threatening stability throughout south asia .
" that is why we regard pakistan and the odious assassination of benazir bhutto in part as an assassination of democracy ... and we must not allow that , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner . in addition to bordering volatile afghanistan , al qaeda 's sway in the country 's tribal areas and its reputation as a breeding ground for islamists , pakistan remains the only muslim country known to have nuclear weapons .
the country carried out its first nuclear test in 1998 and claims to have about 80 to 120 warheads .
pakistan 's nuclear weapons are stored in bunkers in about half-a-dozen military bases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : founder of pakistan 's nuclear program , abdul qadeer khan pakistan 's image was dealt a massive blow in 2004 when it emerged that its chief nuclear scientist abdul qadeer khan had been peddling nuclear equipment on a global black market .
khan confessed to passing atomic secrets to iran , libya and north korea .
he was pardoned by musharraf but remains under virtual house arrest .
but analysts said pakistan 's military was firmly in control of the nuclear arsenal and that it was unlikely al qaeda or taliban militants could get hold of the weapon components and missiles , which are kept separately .
leonard spector , deputy director of the james martin center for non-proliferation studies at the monterey institute of international studies told news agency afp he thought the risk of weapons falling into rogue hands was slight .
" pakistan 's weapons are under the control of the military and by and large that will remain unchanged , i think .
from a standpoint of security we 'll probably have continuity and relatively satisfactory control , " he said .
not advisable to travel to pakistan the chaos and violence in pakistan has prompted many western governments to advise their citizens against traveling to pakistan . a travel update on the german foreign ministry 's website said it was advisable to delay visits to pakistan until the situation had calmed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters throng bhutto 's coffin before her burial the chairman of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , ruprecht polenz , said he feared the assassination would push the country towards anarchy .
polenz said in a radio interview that it was important for the population to heed president pervez musharraf 's call for calm in order not to exacerbate the situation . german parliamentarian sebastian edathy , who is travelling to pakistan as an official observer of the forthcoming elections , told german news agency dpa that the country was at a decisive moment . edathy warned that the stability of the entire region depended on pakistan and he recommended sticking to the january 8 polling date , as postponing it would leave the country without legitimate political leadership for even longer . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are horrified by the cruel attack " which cost former prime minister bhutto her life and " which has created a situation which could lead to the most serious crisis in the history of pakistan , " he said .
he called on pakistani politicians " to work together now to stand up to the -lrb- islamist -rrb- fundamentalists .

27 . more than 40 people have been killed in pakistan in rioting and shootings as inflamed supporters of bhutto went on the rampage in several cities and towns .
violence continued on saturday , dec 29 , as protesters in the southern province of sindh , bhutto 's political stronghold , torched shops , lorries , welfare centres and ambulances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto was killed in a suicide attack after an election rally bhutto 's killing has also thrown into doubt whether pakistan can hold an election in 10 days time that was meant to complete a transition to civilian rule . the united states and other western allies have urged president pervez musharraf to press ahead with polls they hope will bring stability to a country emerging from eight years of military rule while facing growing violence from islamist militants allied to al qaeda . pakistan 's nuclear status sparks jitters but it 's the thought of pakistan 's nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands that has sparked profound unease in the west . france echoed germany 's concerns over pakistan 's nuclear capability falling into the hands of extremists and the killing threatening stability throughout south asia .

pakistan 's nuclear weapons are stored in bunkers in about half-a-dozen military bases .

he was pardoned by musharraf but remains under virtual house arrest .

" pakistan 's weapons are under the control of the military and by and large that will remain unchanged , i think .
from a standpoint of security we 'll probably have continuity and relatively satisfactory control , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.12.2007 germany underscores nuclear threat in pakistan crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence has engulfed pakistan after inflamed bhutto supporters went on the rampage german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has voiced concern that nuclear weapons could fall into the wrong hands if instability in pakistan worsens in the wake of benazir bhutto 's death . " nuclear weapons should never fall into the hands of islamists .
despite the current unstable situation , there is not yet any concrete risk -lrb- that it could happen -rrb- but the situation has to be put right for that to remain true , " steinmeier told weekly bild am sonntag in an interview to be published sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is n't the only one fretting about pakistan 's nuclear weapons " we will discuss what we can do to this end with the united nations , the united states and the europeans , " he added . " we are horrified by the cruel attack " which cost former prime minister bhutto her life and " which has created a situation which could lead to the most serious crisis in the history of pakistan , " he said .
he called on pakistani politicians " to work together now to stand up to the -lrb- islamist -rrb- fundamentalists . " west concerned by pakistan unrest steinmeier 's comments reflect growing concerns among western leaders about pakistan 's slide into violence after bhutto was killed in a suicide attack after an election rally in the city of rawalpindi on dec .
27 . more than 40 people have been killed in pakistan in rioting and shootings as inflamed supporters of bhutto went on the rampage in several cities and towns .
violence continued on saturday , dec 29 , as protesters in the southern province of sindh , bhutto 's political stronghold , torched shops , lorries , welfare centres and ambulances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto was killed in a suicide attack after an election rally bhutto 's killing has also thrown into doubt whether pakistan can hold an election in 10 days time that was meant to complete a transition to civilian rule . the united states and other western allies have urged president pervez musharraf to press ahead with polls they hope will bring stability to a country emerging from eight years of military rule while facing growing violence from islamist militants allied to al qaeda . pakistan 's nuclear status sparks jitters but it 's the thought of pakistan 's nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands that has sparked profound unease in the west . france echoed germany 's concerns over pakistan 's nuclear capability falling into the hands of extremists and the killing threatening stability throughout south asia .
" that is why we regard pakistan and the odious assassination of benazir bhutto in part as an assassination of democracy ... and we must not allow that , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner . in addition to bordering volatile afghanistan , al qaeda 's sway in the country 's tribal areas and its reputation as a breeding ground for islamists , pakistan remains the only muslim country known to have nuclear weapons .
the country carried out its first nuclear test in 1998 and claims to have about 80 to 120 warheads .
pakistan 's nuclear weapons are stored in bunkers in about half-a-dozen military bases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : founder of pakistan 's nuclear program , abdul qadeer khan pakistan 's image was dealt a massive blow in 2004 when it emerged that its chief nuclear scientist abdul qadeer khan had been peddling nuclear equipment on a global black market .
khan confessed to passing atomic secrets to iran , libya and north korea .
he was pardoned by musharraf but remains under virtual house arrest .
but analysts said pakistan 's military was firmly in control of the nuclear arsenal and that it was unlikely al qaeda or taliban militants could get hold of the weapon components and missiles , which are kept separately .
leonard spector , deputy director of the james martin center for non-proliferation studies at the monterey institute of international studies told news agency afp he thought the risk of weapons falling into rogue hands was slight .
" pakistan 's weapons are under the control of the military and by and large that will remain unchanged , i think .
from a standpoint of security we 'll probably have continuity and relatively satisfactory control , " he said .
not advisable to travel to pakistan the chaos and violence in pakistan has prompted many western governments to advise their citizens against traveling to pakistan . a travel update on the german foreign ministry 's website said it was advisable to delay visits to pakistan until the situation had calmed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters throng bhutto 's coffin before her burial the chairman of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , ruprecht polenz , said he feared the assassination would push the country towards anarchy .
polenz said in a radio interview that it was important for the population to heed president pervez musharraf 's call for calm in order not to exacerbate the situation . german parliamentarian sebastian edathy , who is travelling to pakistan as an official observer of the forthcoming elections , told german news agency dpa that the country was at a decisive moment . edathy warned that the stability of the entire region depended on pakistan and he recommended sticking to the january 8 polling date , as postponing it would leave the country without legitimate political leadership for even longer . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

donald tsang said the announcement was a " most important step " for the future of the former british colony , which became part of china in 1997 .
the move comes after mr tsang submitted a report requesting elections by 2012 .
hong kong 's leader is chosen currently by an 800-member committee .
half the 60-seat legislative council is elected .
the region is governed under the principle of " one country , two systems " , under which china has agreed to give it a high degree of autonomy and to preserve its economic and social systems for 50 years from the date of the handover .
its constitution provides for the development of universal suffrage as the " ultimate aim " , but is vague about the date .
' hard-earned opportunity ' the standing committee of the national people 's congress -lrb- npc -rrb- , china 's parliament , issued a ruling on saturday saying it would consider allowing direct elections for the election of hong kong 's leader in 2017 .

the standing committee added that if the chief executive was elected directly , it would then consider introducing universal suffrage for the legislative council election in 2020 .
however , it ruled out full democracy at the chief executive election in 2012 , saying only " appropriate revisions " might be made to the selection method .
hong kong became a special administrative region of china in 1997 mr tsang , the current chief executive , said in a report submitted to the npc before the decision that a majority of hong kong wanted direct elections by 2012 , although he said a delay until 2017 stood a " better chance of being accepted " .
at a televised press conference held after the npc 's decision was announced , mr tsang said hong kong had " entered an important new phase " with a target date for universal suffrage having been defined .
" we are grateful and we welcome beijing 's decision .
it sets a clear timetable for electing the chief executive and legislators , " he said .

the move comes after mr tsang submitted a report requesting elections by 2012 .
hong kong 's leader is chosen currently by an 800-member committee .

i will remember many faces of the benazir bhutto i saw over 20 years of following her turbulent political career : a charismatic populist who could hold forth for hours in her native urdu language to huge , often frenzied crowds ; a prime minister who would stride , head held high , through the corridors of power nodding " asalamaleikhum " to everyone on the way ; a woman who could be downright silly ; a mother who doted on her three children .
over the years we have discussed everything from the nature of democracy to her latest diet , persistent allegations of corruption against her and her husband asif ali zardari , and the unrelenting demands of her very political life .
she disappointed many during her two terms as prime minister .
but whatever her flaws , she had courage .
the political game was in her blood .
and , there was that deeply held belief - she would deny - that as a bhutto she was " born to rule , " that her destiny and pakistan 's was one and the same .
i have watched her closely since her momentous return from eight years in exile in october .
emotional return in our last meeting outside islamabad in november she spoke with glee of returning to her homes in pakistan and finding her bright - now congealed - nail polishes and the shalwar kameezes that no longer fitted and were out of fashion .
benazir bhutto commanded the unstinting loyalty of her supporters then we shifted to the tough political questions in a recorded interview .
but with perhaps one question too many on the controversial deal she had done with general musharraf , and an interview she felt had now gone on too long , she suddenly snapped .
i saw , for a flash , a woman still overwhelmed by the emotion of a tumultuous return scarred by violence , and the pressures of controversial decisions she felt she had to take to have corruption charges dropped in order to come home .
her eyes began to well with tears .
but she also collected herself , in a flash .
and then hurried off to another round of meetings .
there was no doubting her energy and palpable happiness as she travelled across pakistan again , with her trademark white " dupatta " or headscarf , always flanked by the same loyal women and men of her pakistan people 's party who linked their fate to hers .
this was vintage benazir - the same huge political processions we had reported on for years , that showered her with rose petals and the chants of jeay bhutto !
-lrb- long live bhutto -rrb- .
i could not see how she would have it any other way .
it cost her her life .
dynastic politics it puzzled me when i first went to pakistan in 1988 that , in this conservative islamic country , so many would vote for her .
benazir bhutto was the political heir of her father , zulfikar when i asked why , many pakistanis told me they were really voting for her charismatic father ali zulfikar bhutto .
he was hanged in 1979 by the then military ruler general zia ul haq .
she was her father 's daughter , the heir to his legacy .
she could be imperious , the scion , after all , of a dynastic feudal family .
she did not always make the wisest choices on everything from policy to some of the people around her .
she was bb to her friends , and " pinky " to her closest .
determined but vulnerable in recent years even some of her dearest companions accused her of betraying their political principles .
i am not pregnant .
i am fat .
and , as the prime minister , its my right to be fat if i want to benazir bhutto but she was still adored by countless followers who supported her with a blind unswerving loyalty .
however , she sometimes vented her frustration that her life was not her own .
during her first term , she also earned the distinction of being the first prime minister to give birth in office .
and she withstood the barbs of politicians who said there was no provision for a prime minister to take maternity leave .
and then for years after , a woman with a weakness for sweets had to withstand questions from the press about her fluctuating weight .
one of my colleagues once asked her if she was pregnant again and she turned on him with a sharp retort : " no , i am not pregnant .
i am fat .
and , as the prime minister , its my right to be fat if i want to . "
" silk and steel , " was how she described the late indian leader indira gandhi in her memoirs .
this was benazir too - a steely determination matched by very human vulnerability .
lyse doucet first reported for the bbc from pakistan in 1988 and went on to become the bbc correspondent there from 1989 to 1993 .
she has continued to report on the country since then .

over the years we have discussed everything from the nature of democracy to her latest diet , persistent allegations of corruption against her and her husband asif ali zardari , and the unrelenting demands of her very political life .
she disappointed many during her two terms as prime minister .
but whatever her flaws , she had courage .
the political game was in her blood .
and , there was that deeply held belief - she would deny - that as a bhutto she was " born to rule , " that her destiny and pakistan 's was one and the same .
i have watched her closely since her momentous return from eight years in exile in october .
emotional return in our last meeting outside islamabad in november she spoke with glee of returning to her homes in pakistan and finding her bright - now congealed - nail polishes and the shalwar kameezes that no longer fitted and were out of fashion .
benazir bhutto commanded the unstinting loyalty of her supporters then we shifted to the tough political questions in a recorded interview .
but with perhaps one question too many on the controversial deal she had done with general musharraf , and an interview she felt had now gone on too long , she suddenly snapped .
i saw , for a flash , a woman still overwhelmed by the emotion of a tumultuous return scarred by violence , and the pressures of controversial decisions she felt she had to take to have corruption charges dropped in order to come home .
her eyes began to well with tears .
but she also collected herself , in a flash .
and then hurried off to another round of meetings .
there was no doubting her energy and palpable happiness as she travelled across pakistan again , with her trademark white " dupatta " or headscarf , always flanked by the same loyal women and men of her pakistan people 's party who linked their fate to hers .
this was vintage benazir - the same huge political processions we had reported on for years , that showered her with rose petals and the chants of jeay bhutto !
-lrb- long live bhutto -rrb- .
i could not see how she would have it any other way .
it cost her her life .
dynastic politics it puzzled me when i first went to pakistan in 1988 that , in this conservative islamic country , so many would vote for her .
benazir bhutto was the political heir of her father , zulfikar when i asked why , many pakistanis told me they were really voting for her charismatic father ali zulfikar bhutto .
he was hanged in 1979 by the then military ruler general zia ul haq .
she was her father 's daughter , the heir to his legacy .
she could be imperious , the scion , after all , of a dynastic feudal family .
she did not always make the wisest choices on everything from policy to some of the people around her .
she was bb to her friends , and " pinky " to her closest .
determined but vulnerable in recent years even some of her dearest companions accused her of betraying their political principles .
i am not pregnant .
i am fat .
and , as the prime minister , its my right to be fat if i want to benazir bhutto but she was still adored by countless followers who supported her with a blind unswerving loyalty .
however , she sometimes vented her frustration that her life was not her own .
during her first term , she also earned the distinction of being the first prime minister to give birth in office .
and she withstood the barbs of politicians who said there was no provision for a prime minister to take maternity leave .
and then for years after , a woman with a weakness for sweets had to withstand questions from the press about her fluctuating weight .
one of my colleagues once asked her if she was pregnant again and she turned on him with a sharp retort : " no , i am not pregnant .
i am fat .
and , as the prime minister , its my right to be fat if i want to . "
" silk and steel , " was how she described the late indian leader indira gandhi in her memoirs .
this was benazir too - a steely determination matched by very human vulnerability .
lyse doucet first reported for the bbc from pakistan in 1988 and went on to become the bbc correspondent there from 1989 to 1993 .
she has continued to report on the country since then .

i will remember many faces of the benazir bhutto i saw over 20 years of following her turbulent political career : a charismatic populist who could hold forth for hours in her native urdu language to huge , often frenzied crowds ; a prime minister who would stride , head held high , through the corridors of power nodding " asalamaleikhum " to everyone on the way ; a woman who could be downright silly ; a mother who doted on her three children .
over the years we have discussed everything from the nature of democracy to her latest diet , persistent allegations of corruption against her and her husband asif ali zardari , and the unrelenting demands of her very political life .
she disappointed many during her two terms as prime minister .
but whatever her flaws , she had courage .
the political game was in her blood .
and , there was that deeply held belief - she would deny - that as a bhutto she was " born to rule , " that her destiny and pakistan 's was one and the same .
i have watched her closely since her momentous return from eight years in exile in october .
emotional return in our last meeting outside islamabad in november she spoke with glee of returning to her homes in pakistan and finding her bright - now congealed - nail polishes and the shalwar kameezes that no longer fitted and were out of fashion .
benazir bhutto commanded the unstinting loyalty of her supporters then we shifted to the tough political questions in a recorded interview .
but with perhaps one question too many on the controversial deal she had done with general musharraf , and an interview she felt had now gone on too long , she suddenly snapped .
i saw , for a flash , a woman still overwhelmed by the emotion of a tumultuous return scarred by violence , and the pressures of controversial decisions she felt she had to take to have corruption charges dropped in order to come home .
her eyes began to well with tears .
but she also collected herself , in a flash .
and then hurried off to another round of meetings .
there was no doubting her energy and palpable happiness as she travelled across pakistan again , with her trademark white " dupatta " or headscarf , always flanked by the same loyal women and men of her pakistan people 's party who linked their fate to hers .
this was vintage benazir - the same huge political processions we had reported on for years , that showered her with rose petals and the chants of jeay bhutto !
-lrb- long live bhutto -rrb- .
i could not see how she would have it any other way .
it cost her her life .
dynastic politics it puzzled me when i first went to pakistan in 1988 that , in this conservative islamic country , so many would vote for her .
benazir bhutto was the political heir of her father , zulfikar when i asked why , many pakistanis told me they were really voting for her charismatic father ali zulfikar bhutto .
he was hanged in 1979 by the then military ruler general zia ul haq .
she was her father 's daughter , the heir to his legacy .
she could be imperious , the scion , after all , of a dynastic feudal family .
she did not always make the wisest choices on everything from policy to some of the people around her .
she was bb to her friends , and " pinky " to her closest .
determined but vulnerable in recent years even some of her dearest companions accused her of betraying their political principles .
i am not pregnant .
i am fat .
and , as the prime minister , its my right to be fat if i want to benazir bhutto but she was still adored by countless followers who supported her with a blind unswerving loyalty .
however , she sometimes vented her frustration that her life was not her own .
during her first term , she also earned the distinction of being the first prime minister to give birth in office .
and she withstood the barbs of politicians who said there was no provision for a prime minister to take maternity leave .
and then for years after , a woman with a weakness for sweets had to withstand questions from the press about her fluctuating weight .
one of my colleagues once asked her if she was pregnant again and she turned on him with a sharp retort : " no , i am not pregnant .
i am fat .
and , as the prime minister , its my right to be fat if i want to . "
