program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : british prisoner crisis in iran european press review : " sophisticated political theater " iran 's ahmadinejad says british sailors to be freed germany hopes iran move also a signal on nuclear issue in iran-britain standoff , nuclear issue still lurks in background europe -pipe- 01.04.2007 britain and iran keep diplomacy option open for sailors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tone is harsh between tehran and london as their diplomats are busy president mahmoud ahmadinejad slammed " arrogant " britain over iran 's seizure of 15 british sailors even as both sides sought a diplomatic solution and us president george w. bush urged tehran to back down . in washington , bush branded iran 's seizure on march 23 of the 15 britons as inexcusable and demanded the " hostages " ' release . " it 's inexcusable behavior and i strongly support the -lrb- british prime minister tony -rrb- blair government 's attempts to resolve this peacefully , " bush told a news conference on saturday of iran 's capture of 14 men and one woman in what tehran insists were iranian waters . " i support the prime minister when he made it clear there were no quid pro quos , " said bush , whose country 's ties with tehran have been severed for decades .
" the iranians must give back the hostages . "
brits favor diplomatic approach most britons favor a negotiated settlement to the standoff , according to the results of a poll published in britain 's sunday telegraph newspaper . the paper also reported that london hopes to send a top navy officer to tehran to promise that the royal navy will never knowingly enter iranian waters without permission . the survey found that 48 percent of british voters rejected force even as a " last resort , " while 44 percent backed it if diplomacy failed .
it also found that 40 percent of voters support the london government 's stance of pursuing diplomatic action to win the release of the 15 without apologizing . tehran has so far refused to bow to pressure to free the captives , who are being held in a secret location and occasionally paraded on state television allegedly confessing and apologizing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain says its soldiers were on a routine patrol britain insists they were on a routine anti-smuggling patrol in iraqi waters under a un mandate , but the islamic republic says they strayed into its territorial waters .
tehran waits for " appropriate " response ahmadinejad on saturday again called for britain to apologize . " the arrogant issue statements and issue demands against the iranian people , instead of apologizing and expressing regret over the british sailors entering iranian waters , " he said , quoted by the state news agency irna . tehran has warned against politicizing the incident , saying it had begun legal proceedings against the sailors for illegally entering iranian waters , but denying reports of a trial . but in a sign both sides wish to pursue the diplomatic option , the iranian foreign ministry said a diplomatic note it had received from london in response to its formal protest contained " different points which could be examined . " however , the ministry also added that tehran was awaiting " a correction of attitude on britain 's part . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckett said the incident was regrettable british foreign secretary margaret beckett confirmed her ministry had received a diplomatic note from tehran and responded to it , without elaborating . " i think everyone regrets that this position has arisen .
what we want is a way out of it ; we want it peacefully , and we want it as soon as possible , " beckett said after a meeting her european union counterparts in germany . on friday , the eu foreign ministers deplored the seizure of the britons as a breach of international law and threatened to take " appropriate measures " if they were not freed soon .

" we are going through a period where we feel that things are moving , " merkel said in a speech at hebrew university in jerusalem , where she received an honorary doctorate . " there is a window of opportunity ...
the arab world is ready to talk about the mideast conflict and its solutions .
there is a real chance of reaching a breakthrough and we must grasp it , " she said , according to the hebrew translation of her remarks in german . merkel met shortly with israeli prime minister ehud olmert after her arrival on saturday and will meet again with him on sunday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and abbas met in ramallah palestinian president mahmud abbas , said his parley with her in ramallah on sunday was important and focused on " the political movements the area is witnessing , " as well as on ways of spurring on the peace process , according to german news agency dpa . merkel 's trip comes amid increased international efforts to restart stalled middle east peace talks and follows last week 's arab summit in riyadh that revived a five-year-old peace plan for the region . the arab proposal offers israel peace and normal ties if it withdraws from all land seized in the 1967 middle east war and allows for the creation of a palestinian state and the return of palestinian refugees . israel welcomed the prospect of dialogue with moderate arab states , but has stopped short of endorsing the blueprint as is , saying negotiations were needed on the refugee issue .
merkel hails arab plan the german chancellor hailed the blueprint , along with the creation of the new palestinian unity government which united the radical islamist hamas with western-backed moderates , and which israel has refused to recognize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel laid a wreath at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem the european union 's official decision on saturday to deal with cabinet members not belonging to hamas , considered a terror group by the west , was likely to be a sticking point in merkel 's talks with olmert later on sunday . " there is going to be talk about the issue , " government spokeswoman miri eisin told afp .
" israel continues to say clearly that the new palestinian government headed by -lrb- hamas premier -rrb- ismail haniya openly supports terror , funds terror and we have stated clearly that we that all members of this government ... should not be recognized , " eisin said . merkel said that she would tell abbas that the new palestinian coalition must agree to abide by quartet conditions of renouncing violence , recognizing israel and agreeing to abide by past peace deals . she said she would also urge the new coalition to secure the release of an israeli soldier seized nine months ago by gaza-based militants , including the armed wing of hamas - a major stumbling block in israeli-palestinian relations . " we are still waiting for a serious gesture of goodwill , the release of soldier shalit , and we expect the unity government to recognize the quartet conditions , " she said .
eu aid to palestinians still frozen the quartet slapped a diplomatic and direct aid embargo on the palestinian government last year after hamas formed a cabinet alone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with jordan 's king abdullah ii on saturday since the inauguration of a unity cabinet on march 17 , the european union - the largest donor of aid to the palestinians - has eased the diplomatic freeze , meeting with non-hamas ministers , but has not lifted the embargo on direct aid to the cabinet . merkel began her regional tour in jordan on saturday and is due to end her visit to the region in lebanon on monday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lends support to arab-led middle east peace efforts eu foreign ministers agreed saturday to fully support a renewed arab-led middle east peace initiative and to work with the non-hamas members of the new palestinian government , an official said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.04.2007 russians buy airbus jets , but want influence in parent eads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing 's dreamliner costs less than the a350 xwb , but aeroflot still chose the airbus jet the recently agreed upon russia-european aerospace partnership has boosted sales of airbus jets , but closer ties between the kremlin and airbus parent eads could hurt the aircraft maker 's pentagon prospects . when it comes to the kremlin 's investments and partnership deals in european business , political goals often take precedence over the bottom line in determining who gets a major contract , especially in traditionally state-controlled industries , such as aerospace and energy .
russian airline aeroflot recently confirmed a pledge to buy 22 of airbus ' upcoming a350 xwb long-haul jets instead of arch-rival boeing 's 787 dreamliner , even though the american counterpart costs less and could be delivered earlier .
" from an official point of view , aeroflot states that the airbus planes are a better fit for its routes , but it is obvious that the decision -lrb- to choose airbus over boeing -rrb- is in part politically driven , " said maxim syssoev , a spokesman for united aircraft corporation -lrb- uac -rrb- , an umbrella group of state-controlled russian aerospace and defense companies which also cinched a series of production deals with airbus parent eads in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outsourcing jobs to russia is deeply unpopular at home the pan-european aircraft maker will cede 5 percent of its upcoming a350 xwb 's design and production to uac .
" uac 's partnership with eads is linked to aeroflot 's decision to choose airbus , " added syssoev .
tying production deals with aircraft orders is nothing new for airbus .
in china , airbus won an order for 150 single-aisle a320 jets last year , some of which are being assembled in the northern port city tianjin .
co-production deals lead to more aircraft orders " it makes sense for partners in aircraft production to become customers , " commented eads spokesman gregor von kursell .
these work-share agreements are a question of survival .
by selling more planes worldwide , we can support jobs back home . "
although outsourcing jobs outside the euro zone may save on development and labor costs , such moves are deeply unpopular at airbus plants in europe , where 10,000 jobs are being slashed over the next four years , partly due to massive structural problems and a two-year delay in rolling out the super jumbo a380 jet .
aerospace analysts looking at the bottom line , however , are deeply skeptical about whether linking such cooperation deals with future orders necessarily makes good business sense for both the russian and european sides .
" russian companies have a rich socialist history of market cluelessness , " said richard aboulafia , an executive at the teal group , a us-based aerospace consulting firm .
" aeroflot originally held boeing 's 787 order positions .
it 's safe to assume the switch to a350 xwb was purely political . "
partnership deals are dandy , but not controlling stakes aboulafia and others are even more wary of eu-russia relations being strengthened through equity crossholdings in each other 's defense industries .
in 2005 , eads had acquired a 10 percent stake in russia 's irkut , which is part of the uac group and manufactures fighter jets , while russia 's state controlled vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- now has slightly more than 5 percent of eads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants stakes in europe 's strategic industries russian president vladimir putin has made no secret of his ambition for state-controlled entities to buy their way into european industry , especially in germany .
düsseldorf-based e.on , for example , tried to thwart russia 's gazprom from acquiring a substantial stake in the energy concern .
as for eads , which not only owns airbus , but is also involved in the defense business , russian officials have hinted that they wanted to double their stake , represented by vtb bank , to 10 percent .
the present eads shareholding structure , however , strictly limits control to french-german interests , represented by the french government , lagardere and daimlerchrysler as well as spain 's construcciones aeronauticas .
differing views on increased russian stake in eads " increased russian ownership would be disastrous for eads , " aboulafia said , referring to eads 's attempt to procure a pentagon contract for airborne refueling tankers .
" it would prevent further expansion into the most important defense market in the world - the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greater russian control in eads could jeopardize pentagon deals at present there are no plans to change the eads voting structure , said von kursell , a decision supported by german chancellor angela merkel , who is concerned about tighter links with russia jeopardizing relations with the united states .
but there are russia experts , such as sabine fischer of the eu institute for security studies , who do not see the kremlin 's desire for a voting stake in eads as a national security threat .
" you can not open up a company to russian investment and say we can not give you voting power for security reasons , " she said .
" the russians have their own highly developed defense industry anyway .
if the russians play by the market rules , it is difficult to justify keeping them out . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia , eads cozy up with new airbus deals russia cemented new ties with european aerospace group eads , winning a slice of production of the new airbus a350 plane after placing an order for 22 new aircraft .

" from an official point of view , aeroflot states that the airbus planes are a better fit for its routes , but it is obvious that the decision -lrb- to choose airbus over boeing -rrb- is in part politically driven , " said maxim syssoev , a spokesman for united aircraft corporation -lrb- uac -rrb- , an umbrella group of state-controlled russian aerospace and defense companies which also cinched a series of production deals with airbus parent eads in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outsourcing jobs to russia is deeply unpopular at home the pan-european aircraft maker will cede 5 percent of its upcoming a350 xwb 's design and production to uac .
" uac 's partnership with eads is linked to aeroflot 's decision to choose airbus , " added syssoev .
tying production deals with aircraft orders is nothing new for airbus .
in china , airbus won an order for 150 single-aisle a320 jets last year , some of which are being assembled in the northern port city tianjin .
co-production deals lead to more aircraft orders " it makes sense for partners in aircraft production to become customers , " commented eads spokesman gregor von kursell .
these work-share agreements are a question of survival .
by selling more planes worldwide , we can support jobs back home . "
although outsourcing jobs outside the euro zone may save on development and labor costs , such moves are deeply unpopular at airbus plants in europe , where 10,000 jobs are being slashed over the next four years , partly due to massive structural problems and a two-year delay in rolling out the super jumbo a380 jet .
aerospace analysts looking at the bottom line , however , are deeply skeptical about whether linking such cooperation deals with future orders necessarily makes good business sense for both the russian and european sides .
" russian companies have a rich socialist history of market cluelessness , " said richard aboulafia , an executive at the teal group , a us-based aerospace consulting firm .
" aeroflot originally held boeing 's 787 order positions .
it 's safe to assume the switch to a350 xwb was purely political . "
partnership deals are dandy , but not controlling stakes aboulafia and others are even more wary of eu-russia relations being strengthened through equity crossholdings in each other 's defense industries .
in 2005 , eads had acquired a 10 percent stake in russia 's irkut , which is part of the uac group and manufactures fighter jets , while russia 's state controlled vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- now has slightly more than 5 percent of eads .

as for eads , which not only owns airbus , but is also involved in the defense business , russian officials have hinted that they wanted to double their stake , represented by vtb bank , to 10 percent .
the present eads shareholding structure , however , strictly limits control to french-german interests , represented by the french government , lagardere and daimlerchrysler as well as spain 's construcciones aeronauticas .

russian airline aeroflot recently confirmed a pledge to buy 22 of airbus ' upcoming a350 xwb long-haul jets instead of arch-rival boeing 's 787 dreamliner , even though the american counterpart costs less and could be delivered earlier .
" from an official point of view , aeroflot states that the airbus planes are a better fit for its routes , but it is obvious that the decision -lrb- to choose airbus over boeing -rrb- is in part politically driven , " said maxim syssoev , a spokesman for united aircraft corporation -lrb- uac -rrb- , an umbrella group of state-controlled russian aerospace and defense companies which also cinched a series of production deals with airbus parent eads in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outsourcing jobs to russia is deeply unpopular at home the pan-european aircraft maker will cede 5 percent of its upcoming a350 xwb 's design and production to uac .
" uac 's partnership with eads is linked to aeroflot 's decision to choose airbus , " added syssoev .
tying production deals with aircraft orders is nothing new for airbus .
in china , airbus won an order for 150 single-aisle a320 jets last year , some of which are being assembled in the northern port city tianjin .
co-production deals lead to more aircraft orders " it makes sense for partners in aircraft production to become customers , " commented eads spokesman gregor von kursell .
these work-share agreements are a question of survival .
by selling more planes worldwide , we can support jobs back home . "
although outsourcing jobs outside the euro zone may save on development and labor costs , such moves are deeply unpopular at airbus plants in europe , where 10,000 jobs are being slashed over the next four years , partly due to massive structural problems and a two-year delay in rolling out the super jumbo a380 jet .
aerospace analysts looking at the bottom line , however , are deeply skeptical about whether linking such cooperation deals with future orders necessarily makes good business sense for both the russian and european sides .
" russian companies have a rich socialist history of market cluelessness , " said richard aboulafia , an executive at the teal group , a us-based aerospace consulting firm .
" aeroflot originally held boeing 's 787 order positions .
it 's safe to assume the switch to a350 xwb was purely political . "
partnership deals are dandy , but not controlling stakes aboulafia and others are even more wary of eu-russia relations being strengthened through equity crossholdings in each other 's defense industries .
in 2005 , eads had acquired a 10 percent stake in russia 's irkut , which is part of the uac group and manufactures fighter jets , while russia 's state controlled vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- now has slightly more than 5 percent of eads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants stakes in europe 's strategic industries russian president vladimir putin has made no secret of his ambition for state-controlled entities to buy their way into european industry , especially in germany .
düsseldorf-based e.on , for example , tried to thwart russia 's gazprom from acquiring a substantial stake in the energy concern .
as for eads , which not only owns airbus , but is also involved in the defense business , russian officials have hinted that they wanted to double their stake , represented by vtb bank , to 10 percent .
the present eads shareholding structure , however , strictly limits control to french-german interests , represented by the french government , lagardere and daimlerchrysler as well as spain 's construcciones aeronauticas .
differing views on increased russian stake in eads " increased russian ownership would be disastrous for eads , " aboulafia said , referring to eads 's attempt to procure a pentagon contract for airborne refueling tankers .
" it would prevent further expansion into the most important defense market in the world - the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greater russian control in eads could jeopardize pentagon deals at present there are no plans to change the eads voting structure , said von kursell , a decision supported by german chancellor angela merkel , who is concerned about tighter links with russia jeopardizing relations with the united states .
but there are russia experts , such as sabine fischer of the eu institute for security studies , who do not see the kremlin 's desire for a voting stake in eads as a national security threat .
" you can not open up a company to russian investment and say we can not give you voting power for security reasons , " she said .
" the russians have their own highly developed defense industry anyway .

" we are still waiting for a serious gesture of goodwill , the release of soldier shalit , and we expect the unity government to recognize the quartet conditions , " she said .
eu aid to palestinians still frozen the quartet slapped a diplomatic and direct aid embargo on the palestinian government last year after hamas formed a cabinet alone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.04.2007 russians buy airbus jets , but want influence in parent eads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing 's dreamliner costs less than the a350 xwb , but aeroflot still chose the airbus jet the recently agreed upon russia-european aerospace partnership has boosted sales of airbus jets , but closer ties between the kremlin and airbus parent eads could hurt the aircraft maker 's pentagon prospects . when it comes to the kremlin 's investments and partnership deals in european business , political goals often take precedence over the bottom line in determining who gets a major contract , especially in traditionally state-controlled industries , such as aerospace and energy .
russian airline aeroflot recently confirmed a pledge to buy 22 of airbus ' upcoming a350 xwb long-haul jets instead of arch-rival boeing 's 787 dreamliner , even though the american counterpart costs less and could be delivered earlier .
" from an official point of view , aeroflot states that the airbus planes are a better fit for its routes , but it is obvious that the decision -lrb- to choose airbus over boeing -rrb- is in part politically driven , " said maxim syssoev , a spokesman for united aircraft corporation -lrb- uac -rrb- , an umbrella group of state-controlled russian aerospace and defense companies which also cinched a series of production deals with airbus parent eads in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outsourcing jobs to russia is deeply unpopular at home the pan-european aircraft maker will cede 5 percent of its upcoming a350 xwb 's design and production to uac .
" uac 's partnership with eads is linked to aeroflot 's decision to choose airbus , " added syssoev .
tying production deals with aircraft orders is nothing new for airbus .
in china , airbus won an order for 150 single-aisle a320 jets last year , some of which are being assembled in the northern port city tianjin .
co-production deals lead to more aircraft orders " it makes sense for partners in aircraft production to become customers , " commented eads spokesman gregor von kursell .
these work-share agreements are a question of survival .
by selling more planes worldwide , we can support jobs back home . "
although outsourcing jobs outside the euro zone may save on development and labor costs , such moves are deeply unpopular at airbus plants in europe , where 10,000 jobs are being slashed over the next four years , partly due to massive structural problems and a two-year delay in rolling out the super jumbo a380 jet .
aerospace analysts looking at the bottom line , however , are deeply skeptical about whether linking such cooperation deals with future orders necessarily makes good business sense for both the russian and european sides .
" russian companies have a rich socialist history of market cluelessness , " said richard aboulafia , an executive at the teal group , a us-based aerospace consulting firm .
" aeroflot originally held boeing 's 787 order positions .
it 's safe to assume the switch to a350 xwb was purely political . "
partnership deals are dandy , but not controlling stakes aboulafia and others are even more wary of eu-russia relations being strengthened through equity crossholdings in each other 's defense industries .
in 2005 , eads had acquired a 10 percent stake in russia 's irkut , which is part of the uac group and manufactures fighter jets , while russia 's state controlled vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- now has slightly more than 5 percent of eads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants stakes in europe 's strategic industries russian president vladimir putin has made no secret of his ambition for state-controlled entities to buy their way into european industry , especially in germany .
düsseldorf-based e.on , for example , tried to thwart russia 's gazprom from acquiring a substantial stake in the energy concern .
as for eads , which not only owns airbus , but is also involved in the defense business , russian officials have hinted that they wanted to double their stake , represented by vtb bank , to 10 percent .
the present eads shareholding structure , however , strictly limits control to french-german interests , represented by the french government , lagardere and daimlerchrysler as well as spain 's construcciones aeronauticas .
differing views on increased russian stake in eads " increased russian ownership would be disastrous for eads , " aboulafia said , referring to eads 's attempt to procure a pentagon contract for airborne refueling tankers .
" it would prevent further expansion into the most important defense market in the world - the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greater russian control in eads could jeopardize pentagon deals at present there are no plans to change the eads voting structure , said von kursell , a decision supported by german chancellor angela merkel , who is concerned about tighter links with russia jeopardizing relations with the united states .
but there are russia experts , such as sabine fischer of the eu institute for security studies , who do not see the kremlin 's desire for a voting stake in eads as a national security threat .
" you can not open up a company to russian investment and say we can not give you voting power for security reasons , " she said .
" the russians have their own highly developed defense industry anyway .
if the russians play by the market rules , it is difficult to justify keeping them out . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia , eads cozy up with new airbus deals russia cemented new ties with european aerospace group eads , winning a slice of production of the new airbus a350 plane after placing an order for 22 new aircraft .
airbus expects the agreement to lower the a350 's cost .
-lrb- 23.03.2007 -rrb- merkel wants equality in eu-russia investments german chancellor angela merkel said she was opposed to russia being part of the pact of shareholders currently controlling european aerospace giant eads and that moscow should open its markets to the eu .
-lrb- 05.03.2007 -rrb- euro aerospace industry sighs with relief as airbus oks a350 european plane maker airbus is to develop its a350 passenger jet , parent company eads announced late friday , ending months of speculation and handing a boost to the european aerospace industry .
-lrb- 02.12.2006 -rrb- feedback is russia 's interest in eads something that european governments should be worried about ?

" it 's inexcusable behavior and i strongly support the -lrb- british prime minister tony -rrb- blair government 's attempts to resolve this peacefully , " bush told a news conference on saturday of iran 's capture of 14 men and one woman in what tehran insists were iranian waters . " i support the prime minister when he made it clear there were no quid pro quos , " said bush , whose country 's ties with tehran have been severed for decades .
" the iranians must give back the hostages . "
brits favor diplomatic approach most britons favor a negotiated settlement to the standoff , according to the results of a poll published in britain 's sunday telegraph newspaper . the paper also reported that london hopes to send a top navy officer to tehran to promise that the royal navy will never knowingly enter iranian waters without permission . the survey found that 48 percent of british voters rejected force even as a " last resort , " while 44 percent backed it if diplomacy failed .
it also found that 40 percent of voters support the london government 's stance of pursuing diplomatic action to win the release of the 15 without apologizing . tehran has so far refused to bow to pressure to free the captives , who are being held in a secret location and occasionally paraded on state television allegedly confessing and apologizing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain says its soldiers were on a routine patrol britain insists they were on a routine anti-smuggling patrol in iraqi waters under a un mandate , but the islamic republic says they strayed into its territorial waters .
tehran waits for " appropriate " response ahmadinejad on saturday again called for britain to apologize . " the arrogant issue statements and issue demands against the iranian people , instead of apologizing and expressing regret over the british sailors entering iranian waters , " he said , quoted by the state news agency irna . tehran has warned against politicizing the incident , saying it had begun legal proceedings against the sailors for illegally entering iranian waters , but denying reports of a trial . but in a sign both sides wish to pursue the diplomatic option , the iranian foreign ministry said a diplomatic note it had received from london in response to its formal protest contained " different points which could be examined . " however , the ministry also added that tehran was awaiting " a correction of attitude on britain 's part . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckett said the incident was regrettable british foreign secretary margaret beckett confirmed her ministry had received a diplomatic note from tehran and responded to it , without elaborating . " i think everyone regrets that this position has arisen .
what we want is a way out of it ; we want it peacefully , and we want it as soon as possible , " beckett said after a meeting her european union counterparts in germany . on friday , the eu foreign ministers deplored the seizure of the britons as a breach of international law and threatened to take " appropriate measures " if they were not freed soon .
tehran : sailors on tv as evidence of well-being britain has frozen most ties with iran , a move tehran blamed for its decision not to free the sole woman detained as promised . leading seaman faye turney , 26 , was pictured on iranian television " confessing , " as was 21-year-old nathan summers . " it is wrong to parade the captives on television ...
but i can not tell you what a relief it was to see my boy alive and well , " said his father roy , who added he did not believe nathan 's words were his own . the foreign ministry in tehran said " showing videos of detainees took place in line with humanitarian considerations in order to alleviate their families ' concerns and to show they are fine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.04.2007 russians buy airbus jets , but want influence in parent eads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing 's dreamliner costs less than the a350 xwb , but aeroflot still chose the airbus jet the recently agreed upon russia-european aerospace partnership has boosted sales of airbus jets , but closer ties between the kremlin and airbus parent eads could hurt the aircraft maker 's pentagon prospects . when it comes to the kremlin 's investments and partnership deals in european business , political goals often take precedence over the bottom line in determining who gets a major contract , especially in traditionally state-controlled industries , such as aerospace and energy .
russian airline aeroflot recently confirmed a pledge to buy 22 of airbus ' upcoming a350 xwb long-haul jets instead of arch-rival boeing 's 787 dreamliner , even though the american counterpart costs less and could be delivered earlier .
" from an official point of view , aeroflot states that the airbus planes are a better fit for its routes , but it is obvious that the decision -lrb- to choose airbus over boeing -rrb- is in part politically driven , " said maxim syssoev , a spokesman for united aircraft corporation -lrb- uac -rrb- , an umbrella group of state-controlled russian aerospace and defense companies which also cinched a series of production deals with airbus parent eads in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outsourcing jobs to russia is deeply unpopular at home the pan-european aircraft maker will cede 5 percent of its upcoming a350 xwb 's design and production to uac .
" uac 's partnership with eads is linked to aeroflot 's decision to choose airbus , " added syssoev .
tying production deals with aircraft orders is nothing new for airbus .
in china , airbus won an order for 150 single-aisle a320 jets last year , some of which are being assembled in the northern port city tianjin .
co-production deals lead to more aircraft orders " it makes sense for partners in aircraft production to become customers , " commented eads spokesman gregor von kursell .
these work-share agreements are a question of survival .
by selling more planes worldwide , we can support jobs back home . "
although outsourcing jobs outside the euro zone may save on development and labor costs , such moves are deeply unpopular at airbus plants in europe , where 10,000 jobs are being slashed over the next four years , partly due to massive structural problems and a two-year delay in rolling out the super jumbo a380 jet .
aerospace analysts looking at the bottom line , however , are deeply skeptical about whether linking such cooperation deals with future orders necessarily makes good business sense for both the russian and european sides .
" russian companies have a rich socialist history of market cluelessness , " said richard aboulafia , an executive at the teal group , a us-based aerospace consulting firm .
" aeroflot originally held boeing 's 787 order positions .
it 's safe to assume the switch to a350 xwb was purely political . "
partnership deals are dandy , but not controlling stakes aboulafia and others are even more wary of eu-russia relations being strengthened through equity crossholdings in each other 's defense industries .
in 2005 , eads had acquired a 10 percent stake in russia 's irkut , which is part of the uac group and manufactures fighter jets , while russia 's state controlled vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- now has slightly more than 5 percent of eads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants stakes in europe 's strategic industries russian president vladimir putin has made no secret of his ambition for state-controlled entities to buy their way into european industry , especially in germany .
düsseldorf-based e.on , for example , tried to thwart russia 's gazprom from acquiring a substantial stake in the energy concern .
as for eads , which not only owns airbus , but is also involved in the defense business , russian officials have hinted that they wanted to double their stake , represented by vtb bank , to 10 percent .
the present eads shareholding structure , however , strictly limits control to french-german interests , represented by the french government , lagardere and daimlerchrysler as well as spain 's construcciones aeronauticas .
differing views on increased russian stake in eads " increased russian ownership would be disastrous for eads , " aboulafia said , referring to eads 's attempt to procure a pentagon contract for airborne refueling tankers .
" it would prevent further expansion into the most important defense market in the world - the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greater russian control in eads could jeopardize pentagon deals at present there are no plans to change the eads voting structure , said von kursell , a decision supported by german chancellor angela merkel , who is concerned about tighter links with russia jeopardizing relations with the united states .
but there are russia experts , such as sabine fischer of the eu institute for security studies , who do not see the kremlin 's desire for a voting stake in eads as a national security threat .
" you can not open up a company to russian investment and say we can not give you voting power for security reasons , " she said .
" the russians have their own highly developed defense industry anyway .
if the russians play by the market rules , it is difficult to justify keeping them out . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia , eads cozy up with new airbus deals russia cemented new ties with european aerospace group eads , winning a slice of production of the new airbus a350 plane after placing an order for 22 new aircraft .

russian airline aeroflot recently confirmed a pledge to buy 22 of airbus ' upcoming a350 xwb long-haul jets instead of arch-rival boeing 's 787 dreamliner , even though the american counterpart costs less and could be delivered earlier .
" from an official point of view , aeroflot states that the airbus planes are a better fit for its routes , but it is obvious that the decision -lrb- to choose airbus over boeing -rrb- is in part politically driven , " said maxim syssoev , a spokesman for united aircraft corporation -lrb- uac -rrb- , an umbrella group of state-controlled russian aerospace and defense companies which also cinched a series of production deals with airbus parent eads in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outsourcing jobs to russia is deeply unpopular at home the pan-european aircraft maker will cede 5 percent of its upcoming a350 xwb 's design and production to uac .
" uac 's partnership with eads is linked to aeroflot 's decision to choose airbus , " added syssoev .
tying production deals with aircraft orders is nothing new for airbus .
in china , airbus won an order for 150 single-aisle a320 jets last year , some of which are being assembled in the northern port city tianjin .
co-production deals lead to more aircraft orders " it makes sense for partners in aircraft production to become customers , " commented eads spokesman gregor von kursell .
these work-share agreements are a question of survival .
by selling more planes worldwide , we can support jobs back home . "
although outsourcing jobs outside the euro zone may save on development and labor costs , such moves are deeply unpopular at airbus plants in europe , where 10,000 jobs are being slashed over the next four years , partly due to massive structural problems and a two-year delay in rolling out the super jumbo a380 jet .
aerospace analysts looking at the bottom line , however , are deeply skeptical about whether linking such cooperation deals with future orders necessarily makes good business sense for both the russian and european sides .
" russian companies have a rich socialist history of market cluelessness , " said richard aboulafia , an executive at the teal group , a us-based aerospace consulting firm .
" aeroflot originally held boeing 's 787 order positions .
it 's safe to assume the switch to a350 xwb was purely political . "
partnership deals are dandy , but not controlling stakes aboulafia and others are even more wary of eu-russia relations being strengthened through equity crossholdings in each other 's defense industries .
in 2005 , eads had acquired a 10 percent stake in russia 's irkut , which is part of the uac group and manufactures fighter jets , while russia 's state controlled vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- now has slightly more than 5 percent of eads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants stakes in europe 's strategic industries russian president vladimir putin has made no secret of his ambition for state-controlled entities to buy their way into european industry , especially in germany .
düsseldorf-based e.on , for example , tried to thwart russia 's gazprom from acquiring a substantial stake in the energy concern .
as for eads , which not only owns airbus , but is also involved in the defense business , russian officials have hinted that they wanted to double their stake , represented by vtb bank , to 10 percent .
the present eads shareholding structure , however , strictly limits control to french-german interests , represented by the french government , lagardere and daimlerchrysler as well as spain 's construcciones aeronauticas .
differing views on increased russian stake in eads " increased russian ownership would be disastrous for eads , " aboulafia said , referring to eads 's attempt to procure a pentagon contract for airborne refueling tankers .
" it would prevent further expansion into the most important defense market in the world - the us , " he added .

but there are russia experts , such as sabine fischer of the eu institute for security studies , who do not see the kremlin 's desire for a voting stake in eads as a national security threat .

" it 's inexcusable behavior and i strongly support the -lrb- british prime minister tony -rrb- blair government 's attempts to resolve this peacefully , " bush told a news conference on saturday of iran 's capture of 14 men and one woman in what tehran insists were iranian waters . " i support the prime minister when he made it clear there were no quid pro quos , " said bush , whose country 's ties with tehran have been severed for decades .
" the iranians must give back the hostages . "
brits favor diplomatic approach most britons favor a negotiated settlement to the standoff , according to the results of a poll published in britain 's sunday telegraph newspaper . the paper also reported that london hopes to send a top navy officer to tehran to promise that the royal navy will never knowingly enter iranian waters without permission . the survey found that 48 percent of british voters rejected force even as a " last resort , " while 44 percent backed it if diplomacy failed .
it also found that 40 percent of voters support the london government 's stance of pursuing diplomatic action to win the release of the 15 without apologizing . tehran has so far refused to bow to pressure to free the captives , who are being held in a secret location and occasionally paraded on state television allegedly confessing and apologizing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain says its soldiers were on a routine patrol britain insists they were on a routine anti-smuggling patrol in iraqi waters under a un mandate , but the islamic republic says they strayed into its territorial waters .
tehran waits for " appropriate " response ahmadinejad on saturday again called for britain to apologize . " the arrogant issue statements and issue demands against the iranian people , instead of apologizing and expressing regret over the british sailors entering iranian waters , " he said , quoted by the state news agency irna . tehran has warned against politicizing the incident , saying it had begun legal proceedings against the sailors for illegally entering iranian waters , but denying reports of a trial . but in a sign both sides wish to pursue the diplomatic option , the iranian foreign ministry said a diplomatic note it had received from london in response to its formal protest contained " different points which could be examined . " however , the ministry also added that tehran was awaiting " a correction of attitude on britain 's part . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckett said the incident was regrettable british foreign secretary margaret beckett confirmed her ministry had received a diplomatic note from tehran and responded to it , without elaborating . " i think everyone regrets that this position has arisen .
what we want is a way out of it ; we want it peacefully , and we want it as soon as possible , " beckett said after a meeting her european union counterparts in germany . on friday , the eu foreign ministers deplored the seizure of the britons as a breach of international law and threatened to take " appropriate measures " if they were not freed soon .
tehran : sailors on tv as evidence of well-being britain has frozen most ties with iran , a move tehran blamed for its decision not to free the sole woman detained as promised . leading seaman faye turney , 26 , was pictured on iranian television " confessing , " as was 21-year-old nathan summers . " it is wrong to parade the captives on television ...
but i can not tell you what a relief it was to see my boy alive and well , " said his father roy , who added he did not believe nathan 's words were his own . the foreign ministry in tehran said " showing videos of detainees took place in line with humanitarian considerations in order to alleviate their families ' concerns and to show they are fine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.04.2007 russians buy airbus jets , but want influence in parent eads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing 's dreamliner costs less than the a350 xwb , but aeroflot still chose the airbus jet the recently agreed upon russia-european aerospace partnership has boosted sales of airbus jets , but closer ties between the kremlin and airbus parent eads could hurt the aircraft maker 's pentagon prospects . when it comes to the kremlin 's investments and partnership deals in european business , political goals often take precedence over the bottom line in determining who gets a major contract , especially in traditionally state-controlled industries , such as aerospace and energy .
russian airline aeroflot recently confirmed a pledge to buy 22 of airbus ' upcoming a350 xwb long-haul jets instead of arch-rival boeing 's 787 dreamliner , even though the american counterpart costs less and could be delivered earlier .
" from an official point of view , aeroflot states that the airbus planes are a better fit for its routes , but it is obvious that the decision -lrb- to choose airbus over boeing -rrb- is in part politically driven , " said maxim syssoev , a spokesman for united aircraft corporation -lrb- uac -rrb- , an umbrella group of state-controlled russian aerospace and defense companies which also cinched a series of production deals with airbus parent eads in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outsourcing jobs to russia is deeply unpopular at home the pan-european aircraft maker will cede 5 percent of its upcoming a350 xwb 's design and production to uac .
" uac 's partnership with eads is linked to aeroflot 's decision to choose airbus , " added syssoev .
tying production deals with aircraft orders is nothing new for airbus .
in china , airbus won an order for 150 single-aisle a320 jets last year , some of which are being assembled in the northern port city tianjin .
co-production deals lead to more aircraft orders " it makes sense for partners in aircraft production to become customers , " commented eads spokesman gregor von kursell .
these work-share agreements are a question of survival .
by selling more planes worldwide , we can support jobs back home . "
although outsourcing jobs outside the euro zone may save on development and labor costs , such moves are deeply unpopular at airbus plants in europe , where 10,000 jobs are being slashed over the next four years , partly due to massive structural problems and a two-year delay in rolling out the super jumbo a380 jet .
aerospace analysts looking at the bottom line , however , are deeply skeptical about whether linking such cooperation deals with future orders necessarily makes good business sense for both the russian and european sides .
" russian companies have a rich socialist history of market cluelessness , " said richard aboulafia , an executive at the teal group , a us-based aerospace consulting firm .
" aeroflot originally held boeing 's 787 order positions .
it 's safe to assume the switch to a350 xwb was purely political . "
partnership deals are dandy , but not controlling stakes aboulafia and others are even more wary of eu-russia relations being strengthened through equity crossholdings in each other 's defense industries .
in 2005 , eads had acquired a 10 percent stake in russia 's irkut , which is part of the uac group and manufactures fighter jets , while russia 's state controlled vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- now has slightly more than 5 percent of eads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants stakes in europe 's strategic industries russian president vladimir putin has made no secret of his ambition for state-controlled entities to buy their way into european industry , especially in germany .
düsseldorf-based e.on , for example , tried to thwart russia 's gazprom from acquiring a substantial stake in the energy concern .
as for eads , which not only owns airbus , but is also involved in the defense business , russian officials have hinted that they wanted to double their stake , represented by vtb bank , to 10 percent .
the present eads shareholding structure , however , strictly limits control to french-german interests , represented by the french government , lagardere and daimlerchrysler as well as spain 's construcciones aeronauticas .
differing views on increased russian stake in eads " increased russian ownership would be disastrous for eads , " aboulafia said , referring to eads 's attempt to procure a pentagon contract for airborne refueling tankers .
" it would prevent further expansion into the most important defense market in the world - the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greater russian control in eads could jeopardize pentagon deals at present there are no plans to change the eads voting structure , said von kursell , a decision supported by german chancellor angela merkel , who is concerned about tighter links with russia jeopardizing relations with the united states .
but there are russia experts , such as sabine fischer of the eu institute for security studies , who do not see the kremlin 's desire for a voting stake in eads as a national security threat .
" you can not open up a company to russian investment and say we can not give you voting power for security reasons , " she said .
" the russians have their own highly developed defense industry anyway .
if the russians play by the market rules , it is difficult to justify keeping them out . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia , eads cozy up with new airbus deals russia cemented new ties with european aerospace group eads , winning a slice of production of the new airbus a350 plane after placing an order for 22 new aircraft .
airbus expects the agreement to lower the a350 's cost .

russian airline aeroflot recently confirmed a pledge to buy 22 of airbus ' upcoming a350 xwb long-haul jets instead of arch-rival boeing 's 787 dreamliner , even though the american counterpart costs less and could be delivered earlier .
" from an official point of view , aeroflot states that the airbus planes are a better fit for its routes , but it is obvious that the decision -lrb- to choose airbus over boeing -rrb- is in part politically driven , " said maxim syssoev , a spokesman for united aircraft corporation -lrb- uac -rrb- , an umbrella group of state-controlled russian aerospace and defense companies which also cinched a series of production deals with airbus parent eads in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outsourcing jobs to russia is deeply unpopular at home the pan-european aircraft maker will cede 5 percent of its upcoming a350 xwb 's design and production to uac .
" uac 's partnership with eads is linked to aeroflot 's decision to choose airbus , " added syssoev .
tying production deals with aircraft orders is nothing new for airbus .
in china , airbus won an order for 150 single-aisle a320 jets last year , some of which are being assembled in the northern port city tianjin .
co-production deals lead to more aircraft orders " it makes sense for partners in aircraft production to become customers , " commented eads spokesman gregor von kursell .
these work-share agreements are a question of survival .
by selling more planes worldwide , we can support jobs back home . "
although outsourcing jobs outside the euro zone may save on development and labor costs , such moves are deeply unpopular at airbus plants in europe , where 10,000 jobs are being slashed over the next four years , partly due to massive structural problems and a two-year delay in rolling out the super jumbo a380 jet .
aerospace analysts looking at the bottom line , however , are deeply skeptical about whether linking such cooperation deals with future orders necessarily makes good business sense for both the russian and european sides .
" russian companies have a rich socialist history of market cluelessness , " said richard aboulafia , an executive at the teal group , a us-based aerospace consulting firm .
" aeroflot originally held boeing 's 787 order positions .
it 's safe to assume the switch to a350 xwb was purely political . "
partnership deals are dandy , but not controlling stakes aboulafia and others are even more wary of eu-russia relations being strengthened through equity crossholdings in each other 's defense industries .
in 2005 , eads had acquired a 10 percent stake in russia 's irkut , which is part of the uac group and manufactures fighter jets , while russia 's state controlled vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- now has slightly more than 5 percent of eads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants stakes in europe 's strategic industries russian president vladimir putin has made no secret of his ambition for state-controlled entities to buy their way into european industry , especially in germany .
düsseldorf-based e.on , for example , tried to thwart russia 's gazprom from acquiring a substantial stake in the energy concern .
as for eads , which not only owns airbus , but is also involved in the defense business , russian officials have hinted that they wanted to double their stake , represented by vtb bank , to 10 percent .
the present eads shareholding structure , however , strictly limits control to french-german interests , represented by the french government , lagardere and daimlerchrysler as well as spain 's construcciones aeronauticas .
differing views on increased russian stake in eads " increased russian ownership would be disastrous for eads , " aboulafia said , referring to eads 's attempt to procure a pentagon contract for airborne refueling tankers .
" it would prevent further expansion into the most important defense market in the world - the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greater russian control in eads could jeopardize pentagon deals at present there are no plans to change the eads voting structure , said von kursell , a decision supported by german chancellor angela merkel , who is concerned about tighter links with russia jeopardizing relations with the united states .
but there are russia experts , such as sabine fischer of the eu institute for security studies , who do not see the kremlin 's desire for a voting stake in eads as a national security threat .
" you can not open up a company to russian investment and say we can not give you voting power for security reasons , " she said .

russian airline aeroflot recently confirmed a pledge to buy 22 of airbus ' upcoming a350 xwb long-haul jets instead of arch-rival boeing 's 787 dreamliner , even though the american counterpart costs less and could be delivered earlier .
" from an official point of view , aeroflot states that the airbus planes are a better fit for its routes , but it is obvious that the decision -lrb- to choose airbus over boeing -rrb- is in part politically driven , " said maxim syssoev , a spokesman for united aircraft corporation -lrb- uac -rrb- , an umbrella group of state-controlled russian aerospace and defense companies which also cinched a series of production deals with airbus parent eads in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outsourcing jobs to russia is deeply unpopular at home the pan-european aircraft maker will cede 5 percent of its upcoming a350 xwb 's design and production to uac .
" uac 's partnership with eads is linked to aeroflot 's decision to choose airbus , " added syssoev .
tying production deals with aircraft orders is nothing new for airbus .
in china , airbus won an order for 150 single-aisle a320 jets last year , some of which are being assembled in the northern port city tianjin .
co-production deals lead to more aircraft orders " it makes sense for partners in aircraft production to become customers , " commented eads spokesman gregor von kursell .
these work-share agreements are a question of survival .
by selling more planes worldwide , we can support jobs back home . "
although outsourcing jobs outside the euro zone may save on development and labor costs , such moves are deeply unpopular at airbus plants in europe , where 10,000 jobs are being slashed over the next four years , partly due to massive structural problems and a two-year delay in rolling out the super jumbo a380 jet .
aerospace analysts looking at the bottom line , however , are deeply skeptical about whether linking such cooperation deals with future orders necessarily makes good business sense for both the russian and european sides .
" russian companies have a rich socialist history of market cluelessness , " said richard aboulafia , an executive at the teal group , a us-based aerospace consulting firm .
" aeroflot originally held boeing 's 787 order positions .
it 's safe to assume the switch to a350 xwb was purely political . "
partnership deals are dandy , but not controlling stakes aboulafia and others are even more wary of eu-russia relations being strengthened through equity crossholdings in each other 's defense industries .
in 2005 , eads had acquired a 10 percent stake in russia 's irkut , which is part of the uac group and manufactures fighter jets , while russia 's state controlled vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- now has slightly more than 5 percent of eads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants stakes in europe 's strategic industries russian president vladimir putin has made no secret of his ambition for state-controlled entities to buy their way into european industry , especially in germany .
düsseldorf-based e.on , for example , tried to thwart russia 's gazprom from acquiring a substantial stake in the energy concern .
as for eads , which not only owns airbus , but is also involved in the defense business , russian officials have hinted that they wanted to double their stake , represented by vtb bank , to 10 percent .
the present eads shareholding structure , however , strictly limits control to french-german interests , represented by the french government , lagardere and daimlerchrysler as well as spain 's construcciones aeronauticas .

a german animal pr firm is already looking for the next big thing . this sunday , the whole of cologne will be celebrating the first official birthday of marlar with parties and celebrations taking place across the city . if you are now thinking " who or what is marlar ? " then you are not alone .
the further you venture outside the cologne city limits , the fewer people you will meet who will be able to tell you that marlar is the city 's baby elephant . if you reach berlin and ask any one of the thousands of people cramming in to see a certain ball of white fluff in their own zoo , the answer you will get will probably be that they neither know nor care who or what marlar is - because they have knut . berlin 's polar bear cub has achieved worldwide fame in a very short amount of time due to the fact that he is unbearably cute and has a truly heart-warming story of survival to back up the photogenic fuzziness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " see ?
i can be cute too " however , marlar - the first asian elephant calf to be born at cologne zoo - is hardly a boring eyesore .
with her seemingly electro-charged spiky hair and heavy , yet playful galloping stride , the live-wire baby elephant has her fair share of " ahh " factor . add to this the fact that her mother had to be put down due to illness when the calf was barely six months old , leaving the rearing to a benevolent aunt , and you have the ' elephant-enclosure-of-hard-knocks ' back story to make her a global star . marlar 's people miss a gilt-edged opportunity and yet , when marlar trumpets out the candle on her fruit loaf on sunday , it will barely register on the media seismograph .
why ?
because marlar did n't have the right representation when it really mattered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " vanity fair " will feature knut on its cover animal stars , like their human counterparts , need a good publicity team behind them to work the media and break them on a worldwide scale .
knut undoubtedly has a huge entourage behind the scenes ; a publicist , a stylist , a rolling-in-the-dirt coach .
the cub is not yet four months old and yet his media persona is already a cultivated one .
celebrity photographers jet in to snap him , and he 's just had his first cover shoot for german vanity fair . marlar , on the other hand , has a few amateurish posters slapped up on the cologne underground system and the odd photo in the local press . " if marlar 's people had talked to my people shortly after the birth , i would have her modeling for stella mccartney by now , " said lena pfote , the managing director of german animal public relations firm media horse .
" obviously , karl lagerfeld would have been our first choice , but he has size issues . " making up for lost knut the düsseldorf-based pr company was established in november 2006 and already has a number of german zoo animals on its books but missed out on the big one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astute knut : the clued-up cub has got a solid pr team while early efforts were made to entice knut to the media horse stable , the berlin zoo authorities made it clear that the polar bear 's physical development was more important than that of his celebrity status . " that 's very honorable to say so , " said pfote , " but i know this business .
that cub has got some serious representation .
annie leibowitz ?
please .
she does n't get on a transatlantic flight to photograph some bear unless there are some serious players involved . " " we totally underestimated the impact , and someone at media horse dropped the ball on that one , " pfote added .
" take it from me , they 're flipping burgers now . " license to print animal money cute and cuddly animals are big business .
the berlin zoo sold 2,400 stuffed toy versions of knut on the weekend of his first public appearance and is rushing thousands more into production to re-stock its souvenir shop and meet orders from austria and the united states . meanwhile , german confectionery maker haribo plans to add a new knut-shaped design to its existing range of sweets by the end of the week .
it all goes to show that not being human need not interfere with a successful career in the media spotlight .
in fact , in the right hands , an animal can be even more omnipresent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pandering to our needs : the next big pr success ?
" our company turns an animal 's potential into a marketable reality , " said pfote " while an animal 's appeal can get families through the turnstiles , the right pr strategy can have those families leaving at the end of the day with baskets of merchandise . " " we have a red panda cub signed up who 's going to be huge , " she added .
" knut will be relegated to advertising sanitary towels when this baby hits .
you name it , the panda 's face will be on it . " only winners in pr game when asked about the potential by-product of animal - and human - exploitation , pfote denied media horse had anything but good intentions at the heart of its business . " the animal gets adored , the zoo gets money and publicity which helps fund all its programs , plus the public is made to feel good , companies that invest get massive returns , and we , of course , get our slice .
everyone 's a winner . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.04.2007 russians buy airbus jets , but want influence in parent eads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing 's dreamliner costs less than the a350 xwb , but aeroflot still chose the airbus jet the recently agreed upon russia-european aerospace partnership has boosted sales of airbus jets , but closer ties between the kremlin and airbus parent eads could hurt the aircraft maker 's pentagon prospects . when it comes to the kremlin 's investments and partnership deals in european business , political goals often take precedence over the bottom line in determining who gets a major contract , especially in traditionally state-controlled industries , such as aerospace and energy .
russian airline aeroflot recently confirmed a pledge to buy 22 of airbus ' upcoming a350 xwb long-haul jets instead of arch-rival boeing 's 787 dreamliner , even though the american counterpart costs less and could be delivered earlier .
" from an official point of view , aeroflot states that the airbus planes are a better fit for its routes , but it is obvious that the decision -lrb- to choose airbus over boeing -rrb- is in part politically driven , " said maxim syssoev , a spokesman for united aircraft corporation -lrb- uac -rrb- , an umbrella group of state-controlled russian aerospace and defense companies which also cinched a series of production deals with airbus parent eads in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outsourcing jobs to russia is deeply unpopular at home the pan-european aircraft maker will cede 5 percent of its upcoming a350 xwb 's design and production to uac .
" uac 's partnership with eads is linked to aeroflot 's decision to choose airbus , " added syssoev .
tying production deals with aircraft orders is nothing new for airbus .
in china , airbus won an order for 150 single-aisle a320 jets last year , some of which are being assembled in the northern port city tianjin .
co-production deals lead to more aircraft orders " it makes sense for partners in aircraft production to become customers , " commented eads spokesman gregor von kursell .
these work-share agreements are a question of survival .
by selling more planes worldwide , we can support jobs back home . "
although outsourcing jobs outside the euro zone may save on development and labor costs , such moves are deeply unpopular at airbus plants in europe , where 10,000 jobs are being slashed over the next four years , partly due to massive structural problems and a two-year delay in rolling out the super jumbo a380 jet .
aerospace analysts looking at the bottom line , however , are deeply skeptical about whether linking such cooperation deals with future orders necessarily makes good business sense for both the russian and european sides .
" russian companies have a rich socialist history of market cluelessness , " said richard aboulafia , an executive at the teal group , a us-based aerospace consulting firm .
" aeroflot originally held boeing 's 787 order positions .
it 's safe to assume the switch to a350 xwb was purely political . "
partnership deals are dandy , but not controlling stakes aboulafia and others are even more wary of eu-russia relations being strengthened through equity crossholdings in each other 's defense industries .
in 2005 , eads had acquired a 10 percent stake in russia 's irkut , which is part of the uac group and manufactures fighter jets , while russia 's state controlled vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- now has slightly more than 5 percent of eads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants stakes in europe 's strategic industries russian president vladimir putin has made no secret of his ambition for state-controlled entities to buy their way into european industry , especially in germany .
düsseldorf-based e.on , for example , tried to thwart russia 's gazprom from acquiring a substantial stake in the energy concern .
as for eads , which not only owns airbus , but is also involved in the defense business , russian officials have hinted that they wanted to double their stake , represented by vtb bank , to 10 percent .
the present eads shareholding structure , however , strictly limits control to french-german interests , represented by the french government , lagardere and daimlerchrysler as well as spain 's construcciones aeronauticas .
differing views on increased russian stake in eads " increased russian ownership would be disastrous for eads , " aboulafia said , referring to eads 's attempt to procure a pentagon contract for airborne refueling tankers .
" it would prevent further expansion into the most important defense market in the world - the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greater russian control in eads could jeopardize pentagon deals at present there are no plans to change the eads voting structure , said von kursell , a decision supported by german chancellor angela merkel , who is concerned about tighter links with russia jeopardizing relations with the united states .
but there are russia experts , such as sabine fischer of the eu institute for security studies , who do not see the kremlin 's desire for a voting stake in eads as a national security threat .
" you can not open up a company to russian investment and say we can not give you voting power for security reasons , " she said .
" the russians have their own highly developed defense industry anyway .
if the russians play by the market rules , it is difficult to justify keeping them out . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia , eads cozy up with new airbus deals russia cemented new ties with european aerospace group eads , winning a slice of production of the new airbus a350 plane after placing an order for 22 new aircraft .

russian airline aeroflot recently confirmed a pledge to buy 22 of airbus ' upcoming a350 xwb long-haul jets instead of arch-rival boeing 's 787 dreamliner , even though the american counterpart costs less and could be delivered earlier .
" from an official point of view , aeroflot states that the airbus planes are a better fit for its routes , but it is obvious that the decision -lrb- to choose airbus over boeing -rrb- is in part politically driven , " said maxim syssoev , a spokesman for united aircraft corporation -lrb- uac -rrb- , an umbrella group of state-controlled russian aerospace and defense companies which also cinched a series of production deals with airbus parent eads in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outsourcing jobs to russia is deeply unpopular at home the pan-european aircraft maker will cede 5 percent of its upcoming a350 xwb 's design and production to uac .
" uac 's partnership with eads is linked to aeroflot 's decision to choose airbus , " added syssoev .
tying production deals with aircraft orders is nothing new for airbus .
in china , airbus won an order for 150 single-aisle a320 jets last year , some of which are being assembled in the northern port city tianjin .
co-production deals lead to more aircraft orders " it makes sense for partners in aircraft production to become customers , " commented eads spokesman gregor von kursell .
these work-share agreements are a question of survival .
by selling more planes worldwide , we can support jobs back home . "
although outsourcing jobs outside the euro zone may save on development and labor costs , such moves are deeply unpopular at airbus plants in europe , where 10,000 jobs are being slashed over the next four years , partly due to massive structural problems and a two-year delay in rolling out the super jumbo a380 jet .
aerospace analysts looking at the bottom line , however , are deeply skeptical about whether linking such cooperation deals with future orders necessarily makes good business sense for both the russian and european sides .
" russian companies have a rich socialist history of market cluelessness , " said richard aboulafia , an executive at the teal group , a us-based aerospace consulting firm .
" aeroflot originally held boeing 's 787 order positions .
it 's safe to assume the switch to a350 xwb was purely political . "
partnership deals are dandy , but not controlling stakes aboulafia and others are even more wary of eu-russia relations being strengthened through equity crossholdings in each other 's defense industries .
in 2005 , eads had acquired a 10 percent stake in russia 's irkut , which is part of the uac group and manufactures fighter jets , while russia 's state controlled vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- now has slightly more than 5 percent of eads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants stakes in europe 's strategic industries russian president vladimir putin has made no secret of his ambition for state-controlled entities to buy their way into european industry , especially in germany .
düsseldorf-based e.on , for example , tried to thwart russia 's gazprom from acquiring a substantial stake in the energy concern .
as for eads , which not only owns airbus , but is also involved in the defense business , russian officials have hinted that they wanted to double their stake , represented by vtb bank , to 10 percent .
the present eads shareholding structure , however , strictly limits control to french-german interests , represented by the french government , lagardere and daimlerchrysler as well as spain 's construcciones aeronauticas .
differing views on increased russian stake in eads " increased russian ownership would be disastrous for eads , " aboulafia said , referring to eads 's attempt to procure a pentagon contract for airborne refueling tankers .
" it would prevent further expansion into the most important defense market in the world - the us , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : british prisoner crisis in iran european press review : " sophisticated political theater " iran 's ahmadinejad says british sailors to be freed germany hopes iran move also a signal on nuclear issue in iran-britain standoff , nuclear issue still lurks in background europe -pipe- 01.04.2007 britain and iran keep diplomacy option open for sailors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tone is harsh between tehran and london as their diplomats are busy president mahmoud ahmadinejad slammed " arrogant " britain over iran 's seizure of 15 british sailors even as both sides sought a diplomatic solution and us president george w. bush urged tehran to back down . in washington , bush branded iran 's seizure on march 23 of the 15 britons as inexcusable and demanded the " hostages " ' release . " it 's inexcusable behavior and i strongly support the -lrb- british prime minister tony -rrb- blair government 's attempts to resolve this peacefully , " bush told a news conference on saturday of iran 's capture of 14 men and one woman in what tehran insists were iranian waters . " i support the prime minister when he made it clear there were no quid pro quos , " said bush , whose country 's ties with tehran have been severed for decades .
" the iranians must give back the hostages . "
brits favor diplomatic approach most britons favor a negotiated settlement to the standoff , according to the results of a poll published in britain 's sunday telegraph newspaper . the paper also reported that london hopes to send a top navy officer to tehran to promise that the royal navy will never knowingly enter iranian waters without permission . the survey found that 48 percent of british voters rejected force even as a " last resort , " while 44 percent backed it if diplomacy failed .
it also found that 40 percent of voters support the london government 's stance of pursuing diplomatic action to win the release of the 15 without apologizing . tehran has so far refused to bow to pressure to free the captives , who are being held in a secret location and occasionally paraded on state television allegedly confessing and apologizing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain says its soldiers were on a routine patrol britain insists they were on a routine anti-smuggling patrol in iraqi waters under a un mandate , but the islamic republic says they strayed into its territorial waters .
tehran waits for " appropriate " response ahmadinejad on saturday again called for britain to apologize . " the arrogant issue statements and issue demands against the iranian people , instead of apologizing and expressing regret over the british sailors entering iranian waters , " he said , quoted by the state news agency irna . tehran has warned against politicizing the incident , saying it had begun legal proceedings against the sailors for illegally entering iranian waters , but denying reports of a trial . but in a sign both sides wish to pursue the diplomatic option , the iranian foreign ministry said a diplomatic note it had received from london in response to its formal protest contained " different points which could be examined . " however , the ministry also added that tehran was awaiting " a correction of attitude on britain 's part . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckett said the incident was regrettable british foreign secretary margaret beckett confirmed her ministry had received a diplomatic note from tehran and responded to it , without elaborating . " i think everyone regrets that this position has arisen .
what we want is a way out of it ; we want it peacefully , and we want it as soon as possible , " beckett said after a meeting her european union counterparts in germany . on friday , the eu foreign ministers deplored the seizure of the britons as a breach of international law and threatened to take " appropriate measures " if they were not freed soon .
tehran : sailors on tv as evidence of well-being britain has frozen most ties with iran , a move tehran blamed for its decision not to free the sole woman detained as promised . leading seaman faye turney , 26 , was pictured on iranian television " confessing , " as was 21-year-old nathan summers .

" it 's inexcusable behavior and i strongly support the -lrb- british prime minister tony -rrb- blair government 's attempts to resolve this peacefully , " bush told a news conference on saturday of iran 's capture of 14 men and one woman in what tehran insists were iranian waters . " i support the prime minister when he made it clear there were no quid pro quos , " said bush , whose country 's ties with tehran have been severed for decades .
" the iranians must give back the hostages . "
brits favor diplomatic approach most britons favor a negotiated settlement to the standoff , according to the results of a poll published in britain 's sunday telegraph newspaper . the paper also reported that london hopes to send a top navy officer to tehran to promise that the royal navy will never knowingly enter iranian waters without permission . the survey found that 48 percent of british voters rejected force even as a " last resort , " while 44 percent backed it if diplomacy failed .
it also found that 40 percent of voters support the london government 's stance of pursuing diplomatic action to win the release of the 15 without apologizing . tehran has so far refused to bow to pressure to free the captives , who are being held in a secret location and occasionally paraded on state television allegedly confessing and apologizing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain says its soldiers were on a routine patrol britain insists they were on a routine anti-smuggling patrol in iraqi waters under a un mandate , but the islamic republic says they strayed into its territorial waters .
tehran waits for " appropriate " response ahmadinejad on saturday again called for britain to apologize . " the arrogant issue statements and issue demands against the iranian people , instead of apologizing and expressing regret over the british sailors entering iranian waters , " he said , quoted by the state news agency irna . tehran has warned against politicizing the incident , saying it had begun legal proceedings against the sailors for illegally entering iranian waters , but denying reports of a trial . but in a sign both sides wish to pursue the diplomatic option , the iranian foreign ministry said a diplomatic note it had received from london in response to its formal protest contained " different points which could be examined . " however , the ministry also added that tehran was awaiting " a correction of attitude on britain 's part . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckett said the incident was regrettable british foreign secretary margaret beckett confirmed her ministry had received a diplomatic note from tehran and responded to it , without elaborating . " i think everyone regrets that this position has arisen .
what we want is a way out of it ; we want it peacefully , and we want it as soon as possible , " beckett said after a meeting her european union counterparts in germany . on friday , the eu foreign ministers deplored the seizure of the britons as a breach of international law and threatened to take " appropriate measures " if they were not freed soon .
tehran : sailors on tv as evidence of well-being britain has frozen most ties with iran , a move tehran blamed for its decision not to free the sole woman detained as promised . leading seaman faye turney , 26 , was pictured on iranian television " confessing , " as was 21-year-old nathan summers . " it is wrong to parade the captives on television ...
but i can not tell you what a relief it was to see my boy alive and well , " said his father roy , who added he did not believe nathan 's words were his own . the foreign ministry in tehran said " showing videos of detainees took place in line with humanitarian considerations in order to alleviate their families ' concerns and to show they are fine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : british prisoner crisis in iran european press review : " sophisticated political theater " iran 's ahmadinejad says british sailors to be freed germany hopes iran move also a signal on nuclear issue in iran-britain standoff , nuclear issue still lurks in background europe -pipe- 01.04.2007 britain and iran keep diplomacy option open for sailors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tone is harsh between tehran and london as their diplomats are busy president mahmoud ahmadinejad slammed " arrogant " britain over iran 's seizure of 15 british sailors even as both sides sought a diplomatic solution and us president george w. bush urged tehran to back down . in washington , bush branded iran 's seizure on march 23 of the 15 britons as inexcusable and demanded the " hostages " ' release . " it 's inexcusable behavior and i strongly support the -lrb- british prime minister tony -rrb- blair government 's attempts to resolve this peacefully , " bush told a news conference on saturday of iran 's capture of 14 men and one woman in what tehran insists were iranian waters . " i support the prime minister when he made it clear there were no quid pro quos , " said bush , whose country 's ties with tehran have been severed for decades .
" the iranians must give back the hostages . "
brits favor diplomatic approach most britons favor a negotiated settlement to the standoff , according to the results of a poll published in britain 's sunday telegraph newspaper . the paper also reported that london hopes to send a top navy officer to tehran to promise that the royal navy will never knowingly enter iranian waters without permission . the survey found that 48 percent of british voters rejected force even as a " last resort , " while 44 percent backed it if diplomacy failed .
it also found that 40 percent of voters support the london government 's stance of pursuing diplomatic action to win the release of the 15 without apologizing . tehran has so far refused to bow to pressure to free the captives , who are being held in a secret location and occasionally paraded on state television allegedly confessing and apologizing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain says its soldiers were on a routine patrol britain insists they were on a routine anti-smuggling patrol in iraqi waters under a un mandate , but the islamic republic says they strayed into its territorial waters .
tehran waits for " appropriate " response ahmadinejad on saturday again called for britain to apologize . " the arrogant issue statements and issue demands against the iranian people , instead of apologizing and expressing regret over the british sailors entering iranian waters , " he said , quoted by the state news agency irna . tehran has warned against politicizing the incident , saying it had begun legal proceedings against the sailors for illegally entering iranian waters , but denying reports of a trial . but in a sign both sides wish to pursue the diplomatic option , the iranian foreign ministry said a diplomatic note it had received from london in response to its formal protest contained " different points which could be examined . " however , the ministry also added that tehran was awaiting " a correction of attitude on britain 's part . "

a german animal pr firm is already looking for the next big thing . this sunday , the whole of cologne will be celebrating the first official birthday of marlar with parties and celebrations taking place across the city . if you are now thinking " who or what is marlar ? " then you are not alone .
the further you venture outside the cologne city limits , the fewer people you will meet who will be able to tell you that marlar is the city 's baby elephant . if you reach berlin and ask any one of the thousands of people cramming in to see a certain ball of white fluff in their own zoo , the answer you will get will probably be that they neither know nor care who or what marlar is - because they have knut . berlin 's polar bear cub has achieved worldwide fame in a very short amount of time due to the fact that he is unbearably cute and has a truly heart-warming story of survival to back up the photogenic fuzziness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " see ?
i can be cute too " however , marlar - the first asian elephant calf to be born at cologne zoo - is hardly a boring eyesore .
with her seemingly electro-charged spiky hair and heavy , yet playful galloping stride , the live-wire baby elephant has her fair share of " ahh " factor . add to this the fact that her mother had to be put down due to illness when the calf was barely six months old , leaving the rearing to a benevolent aunt , and you have the ' elephant-enclosure-of-hard-knocks ' back story to make her a global star . marlar 's people miss a gilt-edged opportunity and yet , when marlar trumpets out the candle on her fruit loaf on sunday , it will barely register on the media seismograph .
why ?
because marlar did n't have the right representation when it really mattered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " vanity fair " will feature knut on its cover animal stars , like their human counterparts , need a good publicity team behind them to work the media and break them on a worldwide scale .
knut undoubtedly has a huge entourage behind the scenes ; a publicist , a stylist , a rolling-in-the-dirt coach .
the cub is not yet four months old and yet his media persona is already a cultivated one .
celebrity photographers jet in to snap him , and he 's just had his first cover shoot for german vanity fair . marlar , on the other hand , has a few amateurish posters slapped up on the cologne underground system and the odd photo in the local press . " if marlar 's people had talked to my people shortly after the birth , i would have her modeling for stella mccartney by now , " said lena pfote , the managing director of german animal public relations firm media horse .
" obviously , karl lagerfeld would have been our first choice , but he has size issues . " making up for lost knut the düsseldorf-based pr company was established in november 2006 and already has a number of german zoo animals on its books but missed out on the big one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astute knut : the clued-up cub has got a solid pr team while early efforts were made to entice knut to the media horse stable , the berlin zoo authorities made it clear that the polar bear 's physical development was more important than that of his celebrity status . " that 's very honorable to say so , " said pfote , " but i know this business .
that cub has got some serious representation .
annie leibowitz ?
please .
she does n't get on a transatlantic flight to photograph some bear unless there are some serious players involved . " " we totally underestimated the impact , and someone at media horse dropped the ball on that one , " pfote added .
" take it from me , they 're flipping burgers now . " license to print animal money cute and cuddly animals are big business .
the berlin zoo sold 2,400 stuffed toy versions of knut on the weekend of his first public appearance and is rushing thousands more into production to re-stock its souvenir shop and meet orders from austria and the united states . meanwhile , german confectionery maker haribo plans to add a new knut-shaped design to its existing range of sweets by the end of the week .
it all goes to show that not being human need not interfere with a successful career in the media spotlight .
in fact , in the right hands , an animal can be even more omnipresent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pandering to our needs : the next big pr success ?
" our company turns an animal 's potential into a marketable reality , " said pfote " while an animal 's appeal can get families through the turnstiles , the right pr strategy can have those families leaving at the end of the day with baskets of merchandise . " " we have a red panda cub signed up who 's going to be huge , " she added .
" knut will be relegated to advertising sanitary towels when this baby hits .
you name it , the panda 's face will be on it . " only winners in pr game when asked about the potential by-product of animal - and human - exploitation , pfote denied media horse had anything but good intentions at the heart of its business . " the animal gets adored , the zoo gets money and publicity which helps fund all its programs , plus the public is made to feel good , companies that invest get massive returns , and we , of course , get our slice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.04.2007 russians buy airbus jets , but want influence in parent eads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing 's dreamliner costs less than the a350 xwb , but aeroflot still chose the airbus jet the recently agreed upon russia-european aerospace partnership has boosted sales of airbus jets , but closer ties between the kremlin and airbus parent eads could hurt the aircraft maker 's pentagon prospects . when it comes to the kremlin 's investments and partnership deals in european business , political goals often take precedence over the bottom line in determining who gets a major contract , especially in traditionally state-controlled industries , such as aerospace and energy .
russian airline aeroflot recently confirmed a pledge to buy 22 of airbus ' upcoming a350 xwb long-haul jets instead of arch-rival boeing 's 787 dreamliner , even though the american counterpart costs less and could be delivered earlier .
" from an official point of view , aeroflot states that the airbus planes are a better fit for its routes , but it is obvious that the decision -lrb- to choose airbus over boeing -rrb- is in part politically driven , " said maxim syssoev , a spokesman for united aircraft corporation -lrb- uac -rrb- , an umbrella group of state-controlled russian aerospace and defense companies which also cinched a series of production deals with airbus parent eads in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outsourcing jobs to russia is deeply unpopular at home the pan-european aircraft maker will cede 5 percent of its upcoming a350 xwb 's design and production to uac .
" uac 's partnership with eads is linked to aeroflot 's decision to choose airbus , " added syssoev .
tying production deals with aircraft orders is nothing new for airbus .
in china , airbus won an order for 150 single-aisle a320 jets last year , some of which are being assembled in the northern port city tianjin .
co-production deals lead to more aircraft orders " it makes sense for partners in aircraft production to become customers , " commented eads spokesman gregor von kursell .
these work-share agreements are a question of survival .
by selling more planes worldwide , we can support jobs back home . "
although outsourcing jobs outside the euro zone may save on development and labor costs , such moves are deeply unpopular at airbus plants in europe , where 10,000 jobs are being slashed over the next four years , partly due to massive structural problems and a two-year delay in rolling out the super jumbo a380 jet .
aerospace analysts looking at the bottom line , however , are deeply skeptical about whether linking such cooperation deals with future orders necessarily makes good business sense for both the russian and european sides .
" russian companies have a rich socialist history of market cluelessness , " said richard aboulafia , an executive at the teal group , a us-based aerospace consulting firm .
" aeroflot originally held boeing 's 787 order positions .
it 's safe to assume the switch to a350 xwb was purely political . "
partnership deals are dandy , but not controlling stakes aboulafia and others are even more wary of eu-russia relations being strengthened through equity crossholdings in each other 's defense industries .
in 2005 , eads had acquired a 10 percent stake in russia 's irkut , which is part of the uac group and manufactures fighter jets , while russia 's state controlled vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- now has slightly more than 5 percent of eads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants stakes in europe 's strategic industries russian president vladimir putin has made no secret of his ambition for state-controlled entities to buy their way into european industry , especially in germany .
düsseldorf-based e.on , for example , tried to thwart russia 's gazprom from acquiring a substantial stake in the energy concern .
as for eads , which not only owns airbus , but is also involved in the defense business , russian officials have hinted that they wanted to double their stake , represented by vtb bank , to 10 percent .
the present eads shareholding structure , however , strictly limits control to french-german interests , represented by the french government , lagardere and daimlerchrysler as well as spain 's construcciones aeronauticas .
differing views on increased russian stake in eads " increased russian ownership would be disastrous for eads , " aboulafia said , referring to eads 's attempt to procure a pentagon contract for airborne refueling tankers .
" it would prevent further expansion into the most important defense market in the world - the us , " he added .

" we are going through a period where we feel that things are moving , " merkel said in a speech at hebrew university in jerusalem , where she received an honorary doctorate . " there is a window of opportunity ...
the arab world is ready to talk about the mideast conflict and its solutions .
there is a real chance of reaching a breakthrough and we must grasp it , " she said , according to the hebrew translation of her remarks in german . merkel met shortly with israeli prime minister ehud olmert after her arrival on saturday and will meet again with him on sunday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and abbas met in ramallah palestinian president mahmud abbas , said his parley with her in ramallah on sunday was important and focused on " the political movements the area is witnessing , " as well as on ways of spurring on the peace process , according to german news agency dpa . merkel 's trip comes amid increased international efforts to restart stalled middle east peace talks and follows last week 's arab summit in riyadh that revived a five-year-old peace plan for the region . the arab proposal offers israel peace and normal ties if it withdraws from all land seized in the 1967 middle east war and allows for the creation of a palestinian state and the return of palestinian refugees . israel welcomed the prospect of dialogue with moderate arab states , but has stopped short of endorsing the blueprint as is , saying negotiations were needed on the refugee issue .
merkel hails arab plan the german chancellor hailed the blueprint , along with the creation of the new palestinian unity government which united the radical islamist hamas with western-backed moderates , and which israel has refused to recognize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel laid a wreath at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem the european union 's official decision on saturday to deal with cabinet members not belonging to hamas , considered a terror group by the west , was likely to be a sticking point in merkel 's talks with olmert later on sunday . " there is going to be talk about the issue , " government spokeswoman miri eisin told afp .
" israel continues to say clearly that the new palestinian government headed by -lrb- hamas premier -rrb- ismail haniya openly supports terror , funds terror and we have stated clearly that we that all members of this government ... should not be recognized , " eisin said . merkel said that she would tell abbas that the new palestinian coalition must agree to abide by quartet conditions of renouncing violence , recognizing israel and agreeing to abide by past peace deals . she said she would also urge the new coalition to secure the release of an israeli soldier seized nine months ago by gaza-based militants , including the armed wing of hamas - a major stumbling block in israeli-palestinian relations . " we are still waiting for a serious gesture of goodwill , the release of soldier shalit , and we expect the unity government to recognize the quartet conditions , " she said .

russian airline aeroflot recently confirmed a pledge to buy 22 of airbus ' upcoming a350 xwb long-haul jets instead of arch-rival boeing 's 787 dreamliner , even though the american counterpart costs less and could be delivered earlier .
" from an official point of view , aeroflot states that the airbus planes are a better fit for its routes , but it is obvious that the decision -lrb- to choose airbus over boeing -rrb- is in part politically driven , " said maxim syssoev , a spokesman for united aircraft corporation -lrb- uac -rrb- , an umbrella group of state-controlled russian aerospace and defense companies which also cinched a series of production deals with airbus parent eads in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outsourcing jobs to russia is deeply unpopular at home the pan-european aircraft maker will cede 5 percent of its upcoming a350 xwb 's design and production to uac .
" uac 's partnership with eads is linked to aeroflot 's decision to choose airbus , " added syssoev .
tying production deals with aircraft orders is nothing new for airbus .
in china , airbus won an order for 150 single-aisle a320 jets last year , some of which are being assembled in the northern port city tianjin .
co-production deals lead to more aircraft orders " it makes sense for partners in aircraft production to become customers , " commented eads spokesman gregor von kursell .
these work-share agreements are a question of survival .
by selling more planes worldwide , we can support jobs back home . "
although outsourcing jobs outside the euro zone may save on development and labor costs , such moves are deeply unpopular at airbus plants in europe , where 10,000 jobs are being slashed over the next four years , partly due to massive structural problems and a two-year delay in rolling out the super jumbo a380 jet .
aerospace analysts looking at the bottom line , however , are deeply skeptical about whether linking such cooperation deals with future orders necessarily makes good business sense for both the russian and european sides .
" russian companies have a rich socialist history of market cluelessness , " said richard aboulafia , an executive at the teal group , a us-based aerospace consulting firm .
" aeroflot originally held boeing 's 787 order positions .
it 's safe to assume the switch to a350 xwb was purely political . "
partnership deals are dandy , but not controlling stakes aboulafia and others are even more wary of eu-russia relations being strengthened through equity crossholdings in each other 's defense industries .
in 2005 , eads had acquired a 10 percent stake in russia 's irkut , which is part of the uac group and manufactures fighter jets , while russia 's state controlled vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- now has slightly more than 5 percent of eads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants stakes in europe 's strategic industries russian president vladimir putin has made no secret of his ambition for state-controlled entities to buy their way into european industry , especially in germany .
düsseldorf-based e.on , for example , tried to thwart russia 's gazprom from acquiring a substantial stake in the energy concern .
as for eads , which not only owns airbus , but is also involved in the defense business , russian officials have hinted that they wanted to double their stake , represented by vtb bank , to 10 percent .
the present eads shareholding structure , however , strictly limits control to french-german interests , represented by the french government , lagardere and daimlerchrysler as well as spain 's construcciones aeronauticas .
differing views on increased russian stake in eads " increased russian ownership would be disastrous for eads , " aboulafia said , referring to eads 's attempt to procure a pentagon contract for airborne refueling tankers .
" it would prevent further expansion into the most important defense market in the world - the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greater russian control in eads could jeopardize pentagon deals at present there are no plans to change the eads voting structure , said von kursell , a decision supported by german chancellor angela merkel , who is concerned about tighter links with russia jeopardizing relations with the united states .
but there are russia experts , such as sabine fischer of the eu institute for security studies , who do not see the kremlin 's desire for a voting stake in eads as a national security threat .
" you can not open up a company to russian investment and say we can not give you voting power for security reasons , " she said .

it 's safe to assume the switch to a350 xwb was purely political . "
partnership deals are dandy , but not controlling stakes aboulafia and others are even more wary of eu-russia relations being strengthened through equity crossholdings in each other 's defense industries .
in 2005 , eads had acquired a 10 percent stake in russia 's irkut , which is part of the uac group and manufactures fighter jets , while russia 's state controlled vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- now has slightly more than 5 percent of eads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants stakes in europe 's strategic industries russian president vladimir putin has made no secret of his ambition for state-controlled entities to buy their way into european industry , especially in germany .
düsseldorf-based e.on , for example , tried to thwart russia 's gazprom from acquiring a substantial stake in the energy concern .
as for eads , which not only owns airbus , but is also involved in the defense business , russian officials have hinted that they wanted to double their stake , represented by vtb bank , to 10 percent .
the present eads shareholding structure , however , strictly limits control to french-german interests , represented by the french government , lagardere and daimlerchrysler as well as spain 's construcciones aeronauticas .
differing views on increased russian stake in eads " increased russian ownership would be disastrous for eads , " aboulafia said , referring to eads 's attempt to procure a pentagon contract for airborne refueling tankers .
" it would prevent further expansion into the most important defense market in the world - the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greater russian control in eads could jeopardize pentagon deals at present there are no plans to change the eads voting structure , said von kursell , a decision supported by german chancellor angela merkel , who is concerned about tighter links with russia jeopardizing relations with the united states .
but there are russia experts , such as sabine fischer of the eu institute for security studies , who do not see the kremlin 's desire for a voting stake in eads as a national security threat .
" you can not open up a company to russian investment and say we can not give you voting power for security reasons , " she said .
" the russians have their own highly developed defense industry anyway .
if the russians play by the market rules , it is difficult to justify keeping them out . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia , eads cozy up with new airbus deals russia cemented new ties with european aerospace group eads , winning a slice of production of the new airbus a350 plane after placing an order for 22 new aircraft .
airbus expects the agreement to lower the a350 's cost .
-lrb- 23.03.2007 -rrb- merkel wants equality in eu-russia investments german chancellor angela merkel said she was opposed to russia being part of the pact of shareholders currently controlling european aerospace giant eads and that moscow should open its markets to the eu .
-lrb- 05.03.2007 -rrb- euro aerospace industry sighs with relief as airbus oks a350 european plane maker airbus is to develop its a350 passenger jet , parent company eads announced late friday , ending months of speculation and handing a boost to the european aerospace industry .

" we are going through a period where we feel that things are moving , " merkel said in a speech at hebrew university in jerusalem , where she received an honorary doctorate . " there is a window of opportunity ...
the arab world is ready to talk about the mideast conflict and its solutions .
there is a real chance of reaching a breakthrough and we must grasp it , " she said , according to the hebrew translation of her remarks in german . merkel met shortly with israeli prime minister ehud olmert after her arrival on saturday and will meet again with him on sunday evening .

" there is going to be talk about the issue , " government spokeswoman miri eisin told afp .
" israel continues to say clearly that the new palestinian government headed by -lrb- hamas premier -rrb- ismail haniya openly supports terror , funds terror and we have stated clearly that we that all members of this government ... should not be recognized , " eisin said . merkel said that she would tell abbas that the new palestinian coalition must agree to abide by quartet conditions of renouncing violence , recognizing israel and agreeing to abide by past peace deals . she said she would also urge the new coalition to secure the release of an israeli soldier seized nine months ago by gaza-based militants , including the armed wing of hamas - a major stumbling block in israeli-palestinian relations . " we are still waiting for a serious gesture of goodwill , the release of soldier shalit , and we expect the unity government to recognize the quartet conditions , " she said .
eu aid to palestinians still frozen the quartet slapped a diplomatic and direct aid embargo on the palestinian government last year after hamas formed a cabinet alone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with jordan 's king abdullah ii on saturday since the inauguration of a unity cabinet on march 17 , the european union - the largest donor of aid to the palestinians - has eased the diplomatic freeze , meeting with non-hamas ministers , but has not lifted the embargo on direct aid to the cabinet . merkel began her regional tour in jordan on saturday and is due to end her visit to the region in lebanon on monday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lends support to arab-led middle east peace efforts eu foreign ministers agreed saturday to fully support a renewed arab-led middle east peace initiative and to work with the non-hamas members of the new palestinian government , an official said .

a german animal pr firm is already looking for the next big thing . this sunday , the whole of cologne will be celebrating the first official birthday of marlar with parties and celebrations taking place across the city . if you are now thinking " who or what is marlar ? " then you are not alone .
the further you venture outside the cologne city limits , the fewer people you will meet who will be able to tell you that marlar is the city 's baby elephant . if you reach berlin and ask any one of the thousands of people cramming in to see a certain ball of white fluff in their own zoo , the answer you will get will probably be that they neither know nor care who or what marlar is - because they have knut . berlin 's polar bear cub has achieved worldwide fame in a very short amount of time due to the fact that he is unbearably cute and has a truly heart-warming story of survival to back up the photogenic fuzziness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " see ?
i can be cute too " however , marlar - the first asian elephant calf to be born at cologne zoo - is hardly a boring eyesore .
with her seemingly electro-charged spiky hair and heavy , yet playful galloping stride , the live-wire baby elephant has her fair share of " ahh " factor . add to this the fact that her mother had to be put down due to illness when the calf was barely six months old , leaving the rearing to a benevolent aunt , and you have the ' elephant-enclosure-of-hard-knocks ' back story to make her a global star . marlar 's people miss a gilt-edged opportunity and yet , when marlar trumpets out the candle on her fruit loaf on sunday , it will barely register on the media seismograph .
why ?
because marlar did n't have the right representation when it really mattered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " vanity fair " will feature knut on its cover animal stars , like their human counterparts , need a good publicity team behind them to work the media and break them on a worldwide scale .
knut undoubtedly has a huge entourage behind the scenes ; a publicist , a stylist , a rolling-in-the-dirt coach .
the cub is not yet four months old and yet his media persona is already a cultivated one .
celebrity photographers jet in to snap him , and he 's just had his first cover shoot for german vanity fair . marlar , on the other hand , has a few amateurish posters slapped up on the cologne underground system and the odd photo in the local press . " if marlar 's people had talked to my people shortly after the birth , i would have her modeling for stella mccartney by now , " said lena pfote , the managing director of german animal public relations firm media horse .
" obviously , karl lagerfeld would have been our first choice , but he has size issues . " making up for lost knut the düsseldorf-based pr company was established in november 2006 and already has a number of german zoo animals on its books but missed out on the big one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astute knut : the clued-up cub has got a solid pr team while early efforts were made to entice knut to the media horse stable , the berlin zoo authorities made it clear that the polar bear 's physical development was more important than that of his celebrity status .

that cub has got some serious representation .

the berlin zoo sold 2,400 stuffed toy versions of knut on the weekend of his first public appearance and is rushing thousands more into production to re-stock its souvenir shop and meet orders from austria and the united states . meanwhile , german confectionery maker haribo plans to add a new knut-shaped design to its existing range of sweets by the end of the week .
it all goes to show that not being human need not interfere with a successful career in the media spotlight .
in fact , in the right hands , an animal can be even more omnipresent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pandering to our needs : the next big pr success ?
" our company turns an animal 's potential into a marketable reality , " said pfote " while an animal 's appeal can get families through the turnstiles , the right pr strategy can have those families leaving at the end of the day with baskets of merchandise .

" cars older than 10 years are the worst polluters , " said zhelev , " and while germany and italy are imposing ever stricter environment norms on old cars , our country runs the risk of becoming europe 's car dump . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the models clogging bulgarian roads are obsolete in western europe " we pay with our children 's health problems and frequent deaths in car accidents , " he added . every day , thousands of old vehicles wait for their new bulgarian owners in sofia 's largest open-air car market in gorublyane .
some of these are so ancient they have long been taken out of circulation in their countries of origin . shady dealers and ailing infrastructure the surprisingly short mileages rarely correspond to the age of cars , but dealers have a ready-made answer : " the car belonged to an old lady . " customers will always run the risk of being ripped off here if the authorities do not apply stricter regulations and control , said anastas todorov , chairman of the association of -lrb- used -rrb- car importers , which includes some 70 small and medium dealers . " sales have already risen sharply , since many people have hurried to buy a car before the government implements its plans to introduce higher environmental taxes for the registration of old vehicles , " todorov said . " car prices will also drop by 10 to 15 percent in the second half of the year after we sell stocks imported back in 2005 and 2006 , " he added . " there are 520 cars for every 1,000 residents in sofia - a ratio the municipal authorities expected to reach in around 2020 .
at the same time , the infrastructure remains as it was back in 1977 , " said transport expert georgy popchev of the sofia-based center for economic development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria is one of the poorest countries in the eu in sofia , where all the major boulevards converge downtown and the pothole-filled ring road is the frequent site of accidents , traffic jams have become a part of daily life and occur at all times of the day . parking spaces are so scarce that drivers line their cars along the sides of streets or leave them on sidewalks . plans for improvement " the only solution is improving public transportation and city planning , " popchev said . since the fall of communism in 1989 , booming construction on the outskirts of the ever-growing city has not been matched by projects to develop transportation , he added . sofia municipal authorities plan to pour some 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.07 billion -rrb- - mainly money from european funds - into improving infrastructure . there are plans to construct two-level roads , complete and extend the single metro line and widen the ring road . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de toyota hybrid takes on german car market toyota 's new president for germany is pushing hybrid cars in a bid to protect the environment in europe 's biggest economy - and snare a greater share of a massive automobile markets .

" we are going through a period where we feel that things are moving , " merkel said in a speech at hebrew university in jerusalem , where she received an honorary doctorate . " there is a window of opportunity ...
the arab world is ready to talk about the mideast conflict and its solutions .
there is a real chance of reaching a breakthrough and we must grasp it , " she said , according to the hebrew translation of her remarks in german . merkel met shortly with israeli prime minister ehud olmert after her arrival on saturday and will meet again with him on sunday evening .

" there is going to be talk about the issue , " government spokeswoman miri eisin told afp .
" israel continues to say clearly that the new palestinian government headed by -lrb- hamas premier -rrb- ismail haniya openly supports terror , funds terror and we have stated clearly that we that all members of this government ... should not be recognized , " eisin said . merkel said that she would tell abbas that the new palestinian coalition must agree to abide by quartet conditions of renouncing violence , recognizing israel and agreeing to abide by past peace deals . she said she would also urge the new coalition to secure the release of an israeli soldier seized nine months ago by gaza-based militants , including the armed wing of hamas - a major stumbling block in israeli-palestinian relations . " we are still waiting for a serious gesture of goodwill , the release of soldier shalit , and we expect the unity government to recognize the quartet conditions , " she said .
eu aid to palestinians still frozen the quartet slapped a diplomatic and direct aid embargo on the palestinian government last year after hamas formed a cabinet alone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with jordan 's king abdullah ii on saturday since the inauguration of a unity cabinet on march 17 , the european union - the largest donor of aid to the palestinians - has eased the diplomatic freeze , meeting with non-hamas ministers , but has not lifted the embargo on direct aid to the cabinet . merkel began her regional tour in jordan on saturday and is due to end her visit to the region in lebanon on monday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lends support to arab-led middle east peace efforts eu foreign ministers agreed saturday to fully support a renewed arab-led middle east peace initiative and to work with the non-hamas members of the new palestinian government , an official said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : british prisoner crisis in iran european press review : " sophisticated political theater " iran 's ahmadinejad says british sailors to be freed germany hopes iran move also a signal on nuclear issue in iran-britain standoff , nuclear issue still lurks in background europe -pipe- 01.04.2007 britain and iran keep diplomacy option open for sailors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tone is harsh between tehran and london as their diplomats are busy president mahmoud ahmadinejad slammed " arrogant " britain over iran 's seizure of 15 british sailors even as both sides sought a diplomatic solution and us president george w. bush urged tehran to back down . in washington , bush branded iran 's seizure on march 23 of the 15 britons as inexcusable and demanded the " hostages " ' release . " it 's inexcusable behavior and i strongly support the -lrb- british prime minister tony -rrb- blair government 's attempts to resolve this peacefully , " bush told a news conference on saturday of iran 's capture of 14 men and one woman in what tehran insists were iranian waters . " i support the prime minister when he made it clear there were no quid pro quos , " said bush , whose country 's ties with tehran have been severed for decades .
" the iranians must give back the hostages . "
brits favor diplomatic approach most britons favor a negotiated settlement to the standoff , according to the results of a poll published in britain 's sunday telegraph newspaper . the paper also reported that london hopes to send a top navy officer to tehran to promise that the royal navy will never knowingly enter iranian waters without permission . the survey found that 48 percent of british voters rejected force even as a " last resort , " while 44 percent backed it if diplomacy failed .
it also found that 40 percent of voters support the london government 's stance of pursuing diplomatic action to win the release of the 15 without apologizing . tehran has so far refused to bow to pressure to free the captives , who are being held in a secret location and occasionally paraded on state television allegedly confessing and apologizing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain says its soldiers were on a routine patrol britain insists they were on a routine anti-smuggling patrol in iraqi waters under a un mandate , but the islamic republic says they strayed into its territorial waters .
tehran waits for " appropriate " response ahmadinejad on saturday again called for britain to apologize . " the arrogant issue statements and issue demands against the iranian people , instead of apologizing and expressing regret over the british sailors entering iranian waters , " he said , quoted by the state news agency irna . tehran has warned against politicizing the incident , saying it had begun legal proceedings against the sailors for illegally entering iranian waters , but denying reports of a trial . but in a sign both sides wish to pursue the diplomatic option , the iranian foreign ministry said a diplomatic note it had received from london in response to its formal protest contained " different points which could be examined . " however , the ministry also added that tehran was awaiting " a correction of attitude on britain 's part . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckett said the incident was regrettable british foreign secretary margaret beckett confirmed her ministry had received a diplomatic note from tehran and responded to it , without elaborating .

" we are going through a period where we feel that things are moving , " merkel said in a speech at hebrew university in jerusalem , where she received an honorary doctorate . " there is a window of opportunity ...
the arab world is ready to talk about the mideast conflict and its solutions .

" there is going to be talk about the issue , " government spokeswoman miri eisin told afp .
" israel continues to say clearly that the new palestinian government headed by -lrb- hamas premier -rrb- ismail haniya openly supports terror , funds terror and we have stated clearly that we that all members of this government ... should not be recognized , " eisin said . merkel said that she would tell abbas that the new palestinian coalition must agree to abide by quartet conditions of renouncing violence , recognizing israel and agreeing to abide by past peace deals . she said she would also urge the new coalition to secure the release of an israeli soldier seized nine months ago by gaza-based militants , including the armed wing of hamas - a major stumbling block in israeli-palestinian relations . " we are still waiting for a serious gesture of goodwill , the release of soldier shalit , and we expect the unity government to recognize the quartet conditions , " she said .
eu aid to palestinians still frozen the quartet slapped a diplomatic and direct aid embargo on the palestinian government last year after hamas formed a cabinet alone .

russian airline aeroflot recently confirmed a pledge to buy 22 of airbus ' upcoming a350 xwb long-haul jets instead of arch-rival boeing 's 787 dreamliner , even though the american counterpart costs less and could be delivered earlier .
" from an official point of view , aeroflot states that the airbus planes are a better fit for its routes , but it is obvious that the decision -lrb- to choose airbus over boeing -rrb- is in part politically driven , " said maxim syssoev , a spokesman for united aircraft corporation -lrb- uac -rrb- , an umbrella group of state-controlled russian aerospace and defense companies which also cinched a series of production deals with airbus parent eads in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outsourcing jobs to russia is deeply unpopular at home the pan-european aircraft maker will cede 5 percent of its upcoming a350 xwb 's design and production to uac .
" uac 's partnership with eads is linked to aeroflot 's decision to choose airbus , " added syssoev .
tying production deals with aircraft orders is nothing new for airbus .
in china , airbus won an order for 150 single-aisle a320 jets last year , some of which are being assembled in the northern port city tianjin .
co-production deals lead to more aircraft orders " it makes sense for partners in aircraft production to become customers , " commented eads spokesman gregor von kursell .
these work-share agreements are a question of survival .
by selling more planes worldwide , we can support jobs back home . "
although outsourcing jobs outside the euro zone may save on development and labor costs , such moves are deeply unpopular at airbus plants in europe , where 10,000 jobs are being slashed over the next four years , partly due to massive structural problems and a two-year delay in rolling out the super jumbo a380 jet .
aerospace analysts looking at the bottom line , however , are deeply skeptical about whether linking such cooperation deals with future orders necessarily makes good business sense for both the russian and european sides .
" russian companies have a rich socialist history of market cluelessness , " said richard aboulafia , an executive at the teal group , a us-based aerospace consulting firm .
" aeroflot originally held boeing 's 787 order positions .
it 's safe to assume the switch to a350 xwb was purely political . "
partnership deals are dandy , but not controlling stakes aboulafia and others are even more wary of eu-russia relations being strengthened through equity crossholdings in each other 's defense industries .
in 2005 , eads had acquired a 10 percent stake in russia 's irkut , which is part of the uac group and manufactures fighter jets , while russia 's state controlled vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- now has slightly more than 5 percent of eads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants stakes in europe 's strategic industries russian president vladimir putin has made no secret of his ambition for state-controlled entities to buy their way into european industry , especially in germany .
düsseldorf-based e.on , for example , tried to thwart russia 's gazprom from acquiring a substantial stake in the energy concern .
as for eads , which not only owns airbus , but is also involved in the defense business , russian officials have hinted that they wanted to double their stake , represented by vtb bank , to 10 percent .
the present eads shareholding structure , however , strictly limits control to french-german interests , represented by the french government , lagardere and daimlerchrysler as well as spain 's construcciones aeronauticas .
differing views on increased russian stake in eads " increased russian ownership would be disastrous for eads , " aboulafia said , referring to eads 's attempt to procure a pentagon contract for airborne refueling tankers .
" it would prevent further expansion into the most important defense market in the world - the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greater russian control in eads could jeopardize pentagon deals at present there are no plans to change the eads voting structure , said von kursell , a decision supported by german chancellor angela merkel , who is concerned about tighter links with russia jeopardizing relations with the united states .
but there are russia experts , such as sabine fischer of the eu institute for security studies , who do not see the kremlin 's desire for a voting stake in eads as a national security threat .
" you can not open up a company to russian investment and say we can not give you voting power for security reasons , " she said .

russian airline aeroflot recently confirmed a pledge to buy 22 of airbus ' upcoming a350 xwb long-haul jets instead of arch-rival boeing 's 787 dreamliner , even though the american counterpart costs less and could be delivered earlier .
" from an official point of view , aeroflot states that the airbus planes are a better fit for its routes , but it is obvious that the decision -lrb- to choose airbus over boeing -rrb- is in part politically driven , " said maxim syssoev , a spokesman for united aircraft corporation -lrb- uac -rrb- , an umbrella group of state-controlled russian aerospace and defense companies which also cinched a series of production deals with airbus parent eads in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outsourcing jobs to russia is deeply unpopular at home the pan-european aircraft maker will cede 5 percent of its upcoming a350 xwb 's design and production to uac .
" uac 's partnership with eads is linked to aeroflot 's decision to choose airbus , " added syssoev .
tying production deals with aircraft orders is nothing new for airbus .
in china , airbus won an order for 150 single-aisle a320 jets last year , some of which are being assembled in the northern port city tianjin .
co-production deals lead to more aircraft orders " it makes sense for partners in aircraft production to become customers , " commented eads spokesman gregor von kursell .
these work-share agreements are a question of survival .
by selling more planes worldwide , we can support jobs back home . "
although outsourcing jobs outside the euro zone may save on development and labor costs , such moves are deeply unpopular at airbus plants in europe , where 10,000 jobs are being slashed over the next four years , partly due to massive structural problems and a two-year delay in rolling out the super jumbo a380 jet .
aerospace analysts looking at the bottom line , however , are deeply skeptical about whether linking such cooperation deals with future orders necessarily makes good business sense for both the russian and european sides .
" russian companies have a rich socialist history of market cluelessness , " said richard aboulafia , an executive at the teal group , a us-based aerospace consulting firm .
" aeroflot originally held boeing 's 787 order positions .
it 's safe to assume the switch to a350 xwb was purely political . "
partnership deals are dandy , but not controlling stakes aboulafia and others are even more wary of eu-russia relations being strengthened through equity crossholdings in each other 's defense industries .
in 2005 , eads had acquired a 10 percent stake in russia 's irkut , which is part of the uac group and manufactures fighter jets , while russia 's state controlled vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- now has slightly more than 5 percent of eads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants stakes in europe 's strategic industries russian president vladimir putin has made no secret of his ambition for state-controlled entities to buy their way into european industry , especially in germany .
düsseldorf-based e.on , for example , tried to thwart russia 's gazprom from acquiring a substantial stake in the energy concern .
as for eads , which not only owns airbus , but is also involved in the defense business , russian officials have hinted that they wanted to double their stake , represented by vtb bank , to 10 percent .
the present eads shareholding structure , however , strictly limits control to french-german interests , represented by the french government , lagardere and daimlerchrysler as well as spain 's construcciones aeronauticas .
differing views on increased russian stake in eads " increased russian ownership would be disastrous for eads , " aboulafia said , referring to eads 's attempt to procure a pentagon contract for airborne refueling tankers .
" it would prevent further expansion into the most important defense market in the world - the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greater russian control in eads could jeopardize pentagon deals at present there are no plans to change the eads voting structure , said von kursell , a decision supported by german chancellor angela merkel , who is concerned about tighter links with russia jeopardizing relations with the united states .
but there are russia experts , such as sabine fischer of the eu institute for security studies , who do not see the kremlin 's desire for a voting stake in eads as a national security threat .
" you can not open up a company to russian investment and say we can not give you voting power for security reasons , " she said .
" the russians have their own highly developed defense industry anyway .
if the russians play by the market rules , it is difficult to justify keeping them out . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia , eads cozy up with new airbus deals russia cemented new ties with european aerospace group eads , winning a slice of production of the new airbus a350 plane after placing an order for 22 new aircraft .
airbus expects the agreement to lower the a350 's cost .

be careful though : if you fall into the stream downtown , legend has it you 'll marry a resident . freiburg has twice as many bicycles as cars .
bikes are the trademark of a very environmentally conscious community .
the small southern city considers itself the environmental capital of germany . life is difficult for car owners in freiburg as parking spaces in the city center are rare .
however , there is an abundance of bicycle racks , especially around the university campus .
it 's easy to forget where you " parked " in the maze of thousands of bicycles . a 400-kilometer -lrb- 250-mile -rrb- network of bike paths criss-crosses the city .
two-wheeled traffic can get clogged along some of the routes .
one of the biggest bottlenecks occurs along the blaue brücke -lrb- blue bridge -rrb- , which intersects the railroad tracks on the way to the university .
more than 10,000 cyclists traverse that route every day . wet feet and wedding bells bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faithful cyclists , rain or shine freiburg 's picturesque historic center , however , is off-limits to cyclists .
the narrow alleyways and winding curves are more suited for a stroll than a bike ride anyway . and then there are the " bächle " - small canals , about 30 centimeters -lrb- 1 foot -rrb- wide and 10 to 12 centimeters -lrb- 4 to 5 inches -rrb- deep , which are unique to freiburg .
they wind through the city center on both sides of most streets .
one wrong step will land you in the water . local legend has it that if you step in a bächle , you 'll soon marry a freiburg citizen .
so be careful - or careless , as you like . environmental capital bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stop for a beer when you get tired of cycling the cyclists are a fundamental part of freiburg 's environmentally friendly image , but there 's more to it than that .
no other city in germany has as many environment-related institutions as freiburg , for example . in addition , solar energy plays a pivotal role in the city of just over 200,000 residents .
conveniently , freiburg is located in the middle of the sunniest region in germany .
there are 2,000 square meters -lrb- 21,500 square feet -rrb- of solar cells on freiburg 's roofs , and the sports stadium even uses solar power to operate its floodlights . it may just be a matter of time before the residents will be riding to work on solar-powered bicycles . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de family winery cultivates the grape for 27 generations the fürst zu hohenlohe-oehringen winery in baden-württemberg , whose wines have graced the tables of german princes and royalty for 750 years , is the country 's oldest family-owned and operated business .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 01.04.2007 animal public relations firm looking to capitalize on knut fever großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in the industry say marlar could have been huge with the right pr team with knut fever stretching beyond germany 's borders , the cuddly cub looks set to consolidate his position as the world 's number one animal celebrity .
a german animal pr firm is already looking for the next big thing . this sunday , the whole of cologne will be celebrating the first official birthday of marlar with parties and celebrations taking place across the city . if you are now thinking " who or what is marlar ? " then you are not alone .
the further you venture outside the cologne city limits , the fewer people you will meet who will be able to tell you that marlar is the city 's baby elephant . if you reach berlin and ask any one of the thousands of people cramming in to see a certain ball of white fluff in their own zoo , the answer you will get will probably be that they neither know nor care who or what marlar is - because they have knut . berlin 's polar bear cub has achieved worldwide fame in a very short amount of time due to the fact that he is unbearably cute and has a truly heart-warming story of survival to back up the photogenic fuzziness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " see ?
i can be cute too " however , marlar - the first asian elephant calf to be born at cologne zoo - is hardly a boring eyesore .
with her seemingly electro-charged spiky hair and heavy , yet playful galloping stride , the live-wire baby elephant has her fair share of " ahh " factor . add to this the fact that her mother had to be put down due to illness when the calf was barely six months old , leaving the rearing to a benevolent aunt , and you have the ' elephant-enclosure-of-hard-knocks ' back story to make her a global star . marlar 's people miss a gilt-edged opportunity and yet , when marlar trumpets out the candle on her fruit loaf on sunday , it will barely register on the media seismograph .
why ?

a german animal pr firm is already looking for the next big thing . this sunday , the whole of cologne will be celebrating the first official birthday of marlar with parties and celebrations taking place across the city . if you are now thinking " who or what is marlar ? " then you are not alone .
the further you venture outside the cologne city limits , the fewer people you will meet who will be able to tell you that marlar is the city 's baby elephant . if you reach berlin and ask any one of the thousands of people cramming in to see a certain ball of white fluff in their own zoo , the answer you will get will probably be that they neither know nor care who or what marlar is - because they have knut . berlin 's polar bear cub has achieved worldwide fame in a very short amount of time due to the fact that he is unbearably cute and has a truly heart-warming story of survival to back up the photogenic fuzziness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " see ?
i can be cute too " however , marlar - the first asian elephant calf to be born at cologne zoo - is hardly a boring eyesore .
with her seemingly electro-charged spiky hair and heavy , yet playful galloping stride , the live-wire baby elephant has her fair share of " ahh " factor . add to this the fact that her mother had to be put down due to illness when the calf was barely six months old , leaving the rearing to a benevolent aunt , and you have the ' elephant-enclosure-of-hard-knocks ' back story to make her a global star . marlar 's people miss a gilt-edged opportunity and yet , when marlar trumpets out the candle on her fruit loaf on sunday , it will barely register on the media seismograph .
why ?
because marlar did n't have the right representation when it really mattered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german " vanity fair " will feature knut on its cover animal stars , like their human counterparts , need a good publicity team behind them to work the media and break them on a worldwide scale .

the cub is not yet four months old and yet his media persona is already a cultivated one .
celebrity photographers jet in to snap him , and he 's just had his first cover shoot for german vanity fair . marlar , on the other hand , has a few amateurish posters slapped up on the cologne underground system and the odd photo in the local press . " if marlar 's people had talked to my people shortly after the birth , i would have her modeling for stella mccartney by now , " said lena pfote , the managing director of german animal public relations firm media horse .
" obviously , karl lagerfeld would have been our first choice , but he has size issues . " making up for lost knut the düsseldorf-based pr company was established in november 2006 and already has a number of german zoo animals on its books but missed out on the big one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astute knut : the clued-up cub has got a solid pr team while early efforts were made to entice knut to the media horse stable , the berlin zoo authorities made it clear that the polar bear 's physical development was more important than that of his celebrity status .

the berlin zoo sold 2,400 stuffed toy versions of knut on the weekend of his first public appearance and is rushing thousands more into production to re-stock its souvenir shop and meet orders from austria and the united states . meanwhile , german confectionery maker haribo plans to add a new knut-shaped design to its existing range of sweets by the end of the week .
it all goes to show that not being human need not interfere with a successful career in the media spotlight .
in fact , in the right hands , an animal can be even more omnipresent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pandering to our needs : the next big pr success ?

" cars older than 10 years are the worst polluters , " said zhelev , " and while germany and italy are imposing ever stricter environment norms on old cars , our country runs the risk of becoming europe 's car dump . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the models clogging bulgarian roads are obsolete in western europe " we pay with our children 's health problems and frequent deaths in car accidents , " he added . every day , thousands of old vehicles wait for their new bulgarian owners in sofia 's largest open-air car market in gorublyane .
some of these are so ancient they have long been taken out of circulation in their countries of origin . shady dealers and ailing infrastructure the surprisingly short mileages rarely correspond to the age of cars , but dealers have a ready-made answer : " the car belonged to an old lady . " customers will always run the risk of being ripped off here if the authorities do not apply stricter regulations and control , said anastas todorov , chairman of the association of -lrb- used -rrb- car importers , which includes some 70 small and medium dealers . " sales have already risen sharply , since many people have hurried to buy a car before the government implements its plans to introduce higher environmental taxes for the registration of old vehicles , " todorov said . " car prices will also drop by 10 to 15 percent in the second half of the year after we sell stocks imported back in 2005 and 2006 , " he added . " there are 520 cars for every 1,000 residents in sofia - a ratio the municipal authorities expected to reach in around 2020 .
at the same time , the infrastructure remains as it was back in 1977 , " said transport expert georgy popchev of the sofia-based center for economic development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria is one of the poorest countries in the eu in sofia , where all the major boulevards converge downtown and the pothole-filled ring road is the frequent site of accidents , traffic jams have become a part of daily life and occur at all times of the day . parking spaces are so scarce that drivers line their cars along the sides of streets or leave them on sidewalks . plans for improvement " the only solution is improving public transportation and city planning , " popchev said . since the fall of communism in 1989 , booming construction on the outskirts of the ever-growing city has not been matched by projects to develop transportation , he added . sofia municipal authorities plan to pour some 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.07 billion -rrb- - mainly money from european funds - into improving infrastructure . there are plans to construct two-level roads , complete and extend the single metro line and widen the ring road . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de toyota hybrid takes on german car market toyota 's new president for germany is pushing hybrid cars in a bid to protect the environment in europe 's biggest economy - and snare a greater share of a massive automobile markets .

russian airline aeroflot recently confirmed a pledge to buy 22 of airbus ' upcoming a350 xwb long-haul jets instead of arch-rival boeing 's 787 dreamliner , even though the american counterpart costs less and could be delivered earlier .
" from an official point of view , aeroflot states that the airbus planes are a better fit for its routes , but it is obvious that the decision -lrb- to choose airbus over boeing -rrb- is in part politically driven , " said maxim syssoev , a spokesman for united aircraft corporation -lrb- uac -rrb- , an umbrella group of state-controlled russian aerospace and defense companies which also cinched a series of production deals with airbus parent eads in march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outsourcing jobs to russia is deeply unpopular at home the pan-european aircraft maker will cede 5 percent of its upcoming a350 xwb 's design and production to uac .
" uac 's partnership with eads is linked to aeroflot 's decision to choose airbus , " added syssoev .
tying production deals with aircraft orders is nothing new for airbus .
in china , airbus won an order for 150 single-aisle a320 jets last year , some of which are being assembled in the northern port city tianjin .
co-production deals lead to more aircraft orders " it makes sense for partners in aircraft production to become customers , " commented eads spokesman gregor von kursell .
these work-share agreements are a question of survival .
by selling more planes worldwide , we can support jobs back home . "
although outsourcing jobs outside the euro zone may save on development and labor costs , such moves are deeply unpopular at airbus plants in europe , where 10,000 jobs are being slashed over the next four years , partly due to massive structural problems and a two-year delay in rolling out the super jumbo a380 jet .
aerospace analysts looking at the bottom line , however , are deeply skeptical about whether linking such cooperation deals with future orders necessarily makes good business sense for both the russian and european sides .
" russian companies have a rich socialist history of market cluelessness , " said richard aboulafia , an executive at the teal group , a us-based aerospace consulting firm .
" aeroflot originally held boeing 's 787 order positions .
it 's safe to assume the switch to a350 xwb was purely political . "
partnership deals are dandy , but not controlling stakes aboulafia and others are even more wary of eu-russia relations being strengthened through equity crossholdings in each other 's defense industries .
in 2005 , eads had acquired a 10 percent stake in russia 's irkut , which is part of the uac group and manufactures fighter jets , while russia 's state controlled vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- now has slightly more than 5 percent of eads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants stakes in europe 's strategic industries russian president vladimir putin has made no secret of his ambition for state-controlled entities to buy their way into european industry , especially in germany .
düsseldorf-based e.on , for example , tried to thwart russia 's gazprom from acquiring a substantial stake in the energy concern .
as for eads , which not only owns airbus , but is also involved in the defense business , russian officials have hinted that they wanted to double their stake , represented by vtb bank , to 10 percent .
the present eads shareholding structure , however , strictly limits control to french-german interests , represented by the french government , lagardere and daimlerchrysler as well as spain 's construcciones aeronauticas .
differing views on increased russian stake in eads " increased russian ownership would be disastrous for eads , " aboulafia said , referring to eads 's attempt to procure a pentagon contract for airborne refueling tankers .
" it would prevent further expansion into the most important defense market in the world - the us , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greater russian control in eads could jeopardize pentagon deals at present there are no plans to change the eads voting structure , said von kursell , a decision supported by german chancellor angela merkel , who is concerned about tighter links with russia jeopardizing relations with the united states .
but there are russia experts , such as sabine fischer of the eu institute for security studies , who do not see the kremlin 's desire for a voting stake in eads as a national security threat .
" you can not open up a company to russian investment and say we can not give you voting power for security reasons , " she said .
" the russians have their own highly developed defense industry anyway .
if the russians play by the market rules , it is difficult to justify keeping them out . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : russia , eads cozy up with new airbus deals russia cemented new ties with european aerospace group eads , winning a slice of production of the new airbus a350 plane after placing an order for 22 new aircraft .

prescription charges had been gradually reduced to £ 3 - but welsh assembly members voted earlier this year to scrap them altogether from 1 april .
gp and pharmacist representatives in wales said scrapping the charges was " good news " for those who find paying for medicines difficult .
however , manufacturers have warned it could lead to drugs going to waste .
prescription charges are rising by 20p in england , scotland and northern ireland .
last year the price of prescriptions in wales dropped from £ 4 to £ 3 .
the aim of the policy is to reduce patient inequality and it is expected to cost £ 29.5m in the first year .
evidence dr andrew dearden , chairman of the bma 's general practitioners committee in wales , said : " the introduction of free prescriptions in wales is good news for those who find paying for their vital medications difficult .
" evidence shows that some patients do not take their medicines due to not being able to afford all those prescribed by their gps .
" this should aid people in taking their medications as advised , free of the worry of payment . "
prescription fact file the price of prescriptions was frozen at £ 6 in wales in 2001 , then reduced to £ 5 in 2004 , £ 4 in 2005 and £ 3 in 2006 .
previously prescriptions were free to those under 25 and over 60 or who had certain medical conditions or low income .
over-the-counter drugs , which do need a prescription , are not included .
gps will continue to assess if patients should have medicines on prescription .
the 3m patients registered with a welsh gp or 15,000 welsh patients with an english gp and an entitlement card will qualify .
but anglesey gp dr catrin ellis williams said : " i do n't think necessarily it will good idea for everybody because there are many people who are perfectly able to pay the £ 3 prescription fee as it is .
" we hope it does n't change people 's attitudes towards the service and people wo n't be phoning their doctor for a simple medication which is accessible over the counter . "
the scrapping of charges was welcomed by patient organisations .
peter johnson , director of arthritis care cymru , said : " having this scheme available to welsh arthritis sufferers will benefit them enormously , lessening the financial strain for them . "
trish hughes , general manager for wales at the stroke association , said : " this will be a great relief to many stroke sufferers in wales .
we wholeheartedly support this measure . "
the scrapping of the charge will apply to just over 3m patients registered with a welsh gp and those 15,000 welsh patients who have an english gp , who with an entitlement card will be able to get free prescriptions from a welsh pharmacist .
difficult decisions the association of the british pharmaceutical industry has already warned that free prescriptions could lead to demand for medicines increasing and pressure on the medicines budget .
but steve symonds , a swansea-based representative of the national pharmacy association , said he believed reductions in prescription charges since 2001 had not resulted in greater demand and would bring a number of positive aspects for pharmacists .
he said it would mean an end to difficult decisions at the counter facing some patients , who would drop items off their prescriptions to save money .
mr symonds said : " the system is very inequitable .
" you may have a lady in her mid 20s earning just above the minimum wage who will have to pay for prescriptions and she may be living next to a multi-millionaire , who has prescriptions free simply because he is over 60 . "
former health minister edwina currie , now a trustee of the patients association , said the move undermined the idea of a single nhs .
she added : " it seems quite bizarre that on opposite side of the severn bridge we 're going to have completely different rules , and it is certainly going to make patients on the english side feel really quite hard done by . "

prescription charges had been gradually reduced to £ 3 - but welsh assembly members voted earlier this year to scrap them altogether from 1 april .
gp and pharmacist representatives in wales said scrapping the charges was " good news " for those who find paying for medicines difficult .
however , manufacturers have warned it could lead to drugs going to waste .
prescription charges are rising by 20p in england , scotland and northern ireland .
last year the price of prescriptions in wales dropped from £ 4 to £ 3 .
the aim of the policy is to reduce patient inequality and it is expected to cost £ 29.5m in the first year .
evidence dr andrew dearden , chairman of the bma 's general practitioners committee in wales , said : " the introduction of free prescriptions in wales is good news for those who find paying for their vital medications difficult .
" evidence shows that some patients do not take their medicines due to not being able to afford all those prescribed by their gps .
" this should aid people in taking their medications as advised , free of the worry of payment . "
prescription fact file the price of prescriptions was frozen at £ 6 in wales in 2001 , then reduced to £ 5 in 2004 , £ 4 in 2005 and £ 3 in 2006 .
previously prescriptions were free to those under 25 and over 60 or who had certain medical conditions or low income .
over-the-counter drugs , which do need a prescription , are not included .
gps will continue to assess if patients should have medicines on prescription .
the 3m patients registered with a welsh gp or 15,000 welsh patients with an english gp and an entitlement card will qualify .
but anglesey gp dr catrin ellis williams said : " i do n't think necessarily it will good idea for everybody because there are many people who are perfectly able to pay the £ 3 prescription fee as it is .
" we hope it does n't change people 's attitudes towards the service and people wo n't be phoning their doctor for a simple medication which is accessible over the counter . "
the scrapping of charges was welcomed by patient organisations .
peter johnson , director of arthritis care cymru , said : " having this scheme available to welsh arthritis sufferers will benefit them enormously , lessening the financial strain for them . "
trish hughes , general manager for wales at the stroke association , said : " this will be a great relief to many stroke sufferers in wales .
we wholeheartedly support this measure . "
the scrapping of the charge will apply to just over 3m patients registered with a welsh gp and those 15,000 welsh patients who have an english gp , who with an entitlement card will be able to get free prescriptions from a welsh pharmacist .
difficult decisions the association of the british pharmaceutical industry has already warned that free prescriptions could lead to demand for medicines increasing and pressure on the medicines budget .
but steve symonds , a swansea-based representative of the national pharmacy association , said he believed reductions in prescription charges since 2001 had not resulted in greater demand and would bring a number of positive aspects for pharmacists .
he said it would mean an end to difficult decisions at the counter facing some patients , who would drop items off their prescriptions to save money .
mr symonds said : " the system is very inequitable .
" you may have a lady in her mid 20s earning just above the minimum wage who will have to pay for prescriptions and she may be living next to a multi-millionaire , who has prescriptions free simply because he is over 60 . "
former health minister edwina currie , now a trustee of the patients association , said the move undermined the idea of a single nhs .
she added : " it seems quite bizarre that on opposite side of the severn bridge we 're going to have completely different rules , and it is certainly going to make patients on the english side feel really quite hard done by . "

the new rule means adverts for food and drinks high in fat , salt or sugar can not be broadcast around shows aimed at four to nine-year-olds .
some tv channels and advertisers fear the ban - introduced over fears about childhood obesity - is too harsh .
but dr david haslam , from the national obesity forum , said he believes the ban does not go far enough .
pressure he told the bbc 's radio five live : " if you go into a supermarket there are , once again , sweets and chocolates at eye-level for a child at the till .
" now we had a phase when that was banned and we did n't see it , but now they are creeping back again in some of the major stores - well , that 's something that should be stopped instantly .
" it 's all very well banning advertising of the food to kids , but kids are still going to be eating the food because there 's point-of-sales advertising and there 's the pressure that 's put on the parents to go out and get a fast food burger . "
from 1 january 2008 the restrictions will be extended to tv shows aimed at children up to 15 years , as well as adult programmes watched by a large number of children .
dedicated children 's tv channels are allowed to phase in the restrictions affecting four to nine-year-olds from 1 april , but must have the full ban in place by 1 january 2009 .

tv channels and the broadcast advertising clearance centre -lrb- bacc -rrb- are responsible for ensuring commercials comply with the new rules , while food standards agency guidelines will be used to decide which products are subject to the rules .
hamish pringle , director general of the institute of practitioners in advertising , told bbc news 24 he was confident that the ban would not affect the industry too much .
" yes , advertisers have lost the opportunity to communicate directly to children , -lsb- but -rsb- they still have the opportunity to talk to their parents , " he said .

the new rule means adverts for food and drinks high in fat , salt or sugar can not be broadcast around shows aimed at four to nine-year-olds .
some tv channels and advertisers fear the ban - introduced over fears about childhood obesity - is too harsh .
but dr david haslam , from the national obesity forum , said he believes the ban does not go far enough .
pressure he told the bbc 's radio five live : " if you go into a supermarket there are , once again , sweets and chocolates at eye-level for a child at the till .
" now we had a phase when that was banned and we did n't see it , but now they are creeping back again in some of the major stores - well , that 's something that should be stopped instantly .
" it 's all very well banning advertising of the food to kids , but kids are still going to be eating the food because there 's point-of-sales advertising and there 's the pressure that 's put on the parents to go out and get a fast food burger . "
from 1 january 2008 the restrictions will be extended to tv shows aimed at children up to 15 years , as well as adult programmes watched by a large number of children .
dedicated children 's tv channels are allowed to phase in the restrictions affecting four to nine-year-olds from 1 april , but must have the full ban in place by 1 january 2009 .
advertisers ... still have the opportunity to talk to their parents hamish pringle , institute of practitioners in advertising an spokeswoman for ofcom - which introduced the ban - said : " the new rules are one of a wide range of measures aimed at tackling child obesity .
" by reducing the exposure of children to advertising for products that are high in fat , salt and sugar , the advertising restrictions will contribute to wider efforts to promote healthier diets amongst children . "
tv channels and the broadcast advertising clearance centre -lrb- bacc -rrb- are responsible for ensuring commercials comply with the new rules , while food standards agency guidelines will be used to decide which products are subject to the rules .
hamish pringle , director general of the institute of practitioners in advertising , told bbc news 24 he was confident that the ban would not affect the industry too much .
" yes , advertisers have lost the opportunity to communicate directly to children , -lsb- but -rsb- they still have the opportunity to talk to their parents , " he said .
" advertisers can still compete with each other , they can still bring in new products , and i think that 's a good thing for the economy as a whole . "

up to 20,000 non-russians currently work in moscow markets alone in a tradition going back to soviet times .
president vladimir putin said earlier that the interests of russian citizens were at stake .
migrant groups have condemned the law , passed after ethnic violence last year , as unfair and unworkable . "
the dirty job i was doing will not be taken over eagerly by locals " zafar firouz , yavan , tajikistan bbc news website reader enforcing migrant quotas while foreigners will not be allowed to sell directly they still have the right to work in markets as loaders , cleaners , wholesalers or managers , according to an official from the russian federal migration service , vyacheslav postavnin .
the law was introduced after a number of incidents , but chiefly unrest in the northern town of kondopoga where two local men were killed in a brawl with ethnic chechens .
price rise fears this law has changed the face of retail in russia , the bbc 's james rodgers reports from moscow .
markets provided jobs for people from poorer countries if they were willing to work long hours , often for low pay , but that is now illegal .
anyone working in a shop or on a stall has to hold russian citizenship .
officials responsible for enforcing the law say they are not planning any major operations to coincide with the new deadline .
they believe market administrators will make sure the law is observed .
russian media reports have warned of price rises as a consequence of the new law but the authorities insist that any increases are due to inflation .
migration clampdown the new law is the latest in a series on immigration .
on 15 january , migrants from cis member-states coming to russia under a visa-free regime were banned from selling alcohol and pharmaceuticals .
ahead of 1 april , the number of foreigners working in russian markets was reduced to 40 % of the workforce .
mr postavnin said the new legislation was aimed at combating the shadow economy .
" people have really begun to emerge from the shadow - it 's very good , " he told russian news agency itar-tass .
your comments the vegetable and fruit stall that i had here in sennaya square market , st. petersburg , is empty now .
i am one of the thousands who are kicked out of the russia by the new law .
almost 70 % of the market stalls are empty also , with long queues at those stalls whose owners managed to get citizenship legally on time .
we found our way to russia after 1994 , fleeing the civil war in tajikistan .
this market has become our saviour , with remittances we sent home , our families survived .
for the last 9 years , i was selling competitively priced potatoes and onions , that was affordable to the city 's lowpaid pensioners .
that 's why they never swapped spacious supermarkets for a crowded market .
the dirty job i was doing will not be taken over eagerly by locals .
zafar firouz , yavan , tajikistan it 's true that many of the -lrb- dark-skinned -rrb- non-russians working in the markets are involved in criminality .
however , the -lrb- mostly white -rrb- russian police happily turn a blind eye in return for bribes .
and white russian gangsters are involved in the same kind of activities and much worse , but officials practically work hand in hand with them in many cases .
this is clearly a racist and populist initiative designed to win votes in the forthcoming election .
ch , reading , uk i have personally seen many people from tajikistan going to moscow for work , and nobody can deny the fact that migrant workers do contribute to the development of the economy , even developed countries have accepted it .
banning workforce is not a solution , but the need of the hour is proper regulation that promotes interest of all parties .
russia is already facing a demographic crisis , and i do n't feel it is a right move .
the government should clamp down on the vested interest and protect the right and livelihood of poor migrant workers , who once belonged to part of grand old ussr .
v.balaji venkatachalam , dubai i am an afghan in australia and i know too many afghans are working illegally in moscow , and they have families back in afghanistan , who are in desperate need of money for their living back in afghanistan , and i know it would hit them hard if they lose that income .
apart from that i do n't blame russian authorities for this action , because there are too many russians who are jobless .
i hope they would find a solution for both. reza zamani , sydney australia i am resident in canada but originally from southern africa .
what i do see is that if southern african governments had to copy what the russians have done then there is bound to be total chaos in the region .
take johannesburg as an example , almost all of the retail sector flea markets , restaurants and street vendors are supplied and manned by foreigners of chinese , lebanese , russian , european origin and of course africans .
i also know in zambia there is a big problem with chinese , indian and lebanese traders in the retail trade including markets which were originally meant for indigenous zambians but the new government gave the contract to operate these markets to foreigners .
the whole idea may sound good but it is savagely discriminatory and undemocratic in this global 21st century economy .
trade should not be limited to exchange of goods and services alone but also the exchange of cultures is even more important ...
just imagine , you wake up one day and go to london , paris , brussels or new york and all you see are english , french , belgian , white americans in shops and markets and so forth .
the whole place would look spooky !
unreal !
just like a flower garden with a one colour code .
totally meaningless .
professor mwiine lubemba , ottawa , canada the friendly kebab vendor on my street corner left two weeks ago , and despite the heavy traffic his stand always enjoyed , no ethnic russians have stepped up to open a stand selling this non-russian food , nor does anyone seem likely to .
his was the only independent , non-chain food stand - now they 're all franchises .
this is not a victory for " the little guy . "
alex , when " foreigners " have formed criminal syndicates , is n't the real problem here crime rather than ethnicity ?
when produce mafias are allowed to exist , with police accepting bribes for looking the other way , why do you expect this whole system to change just because the ethnic makeup of its participants is changing ?
nor does it make sense to quell ethnic violence by getting rid of all the " foreigners . "
chris , moscow as a briton living in moscow , it was apparent from when i first arrived that foreigners as they 're called , formed a large percentage of the food and retail market .
and when i first arrived those same foreigners were publicly known to have formed criminal syndicates , regulating by means of intimidation or worse just who could sell in moscow and beyond .
there were several incidents shortly after i arrived of shootings and beatings of native russians being forcibly prevented from setting up shop , or producing goods in their own country .
since then , and more recently , there has been a marked improvement in the mix of native russians to foreigners , as a result of the russian government 's crackdown on corruption , and criminal gangs .
it may seem hard to outsiders , but a balance is being restored in this country ...
unseen to the press , or simply unreported , is a large slice of native russians who are expected to follow the rules in manufacturing and food standards up to a european level quality control , with stiff penalties for non-compliance , and yet they are constantly undermined by the black economy , who have shipped in cheap and often inferior goods , -lrb- or made them here in sweat shops -rrb- then flooded the market with these goods at inflated prices , with brutal intimidation if challenged by locals .
this has hindered natural economic growth , and made things very much harder for native russians determined to make a success of their lives ...
another important consideration is : the foreigners tend to employ their own and very few native russians , and to a large extent , ship the profits out of the country , paying little or nothing into the russian economy or tax system ...
i am in no way an apologist for this country , and know everything 's not perfect here ... but simply a briton who has seen the real situation through the eyes of objective ' fair play ' ... alex stone , moscow actually in the retail markets in moscow and other russian cities work people who came from former ussr republics mainly from azerbaijan -lrb- they are owners or managers of the business -rrb- , uzbekistan -lrb- mostly they are salespeople -rrb- and tajikistan -lrb- they work as a cleaners and loaders -rrb- .
i know some market guys here in moscow who had been deported back to home because of absence of permission to work legally in moscow -lrb- but real reason was that they refused to pay bribe to local policeman -rrb- .
they had their own fruit selling business and they hired even russian woman to work as seller .
i wonder why russian authorities try to prevent such hardworking people for whom russia really need , who can be basis of fuel to develop small business and whole economy as well .
anz , moscow as a citizen of slovenia , living in moscow for many years , i can witness that dominance of non-russians on local russian markets is main reason for high prices .
ethnic mafias prevent local producers to sell directly .
