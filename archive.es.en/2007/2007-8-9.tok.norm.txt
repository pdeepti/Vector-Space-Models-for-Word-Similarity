" only 6.7 percent of germans invest in stocks , " leven said .
" that is absolutely too low . " it 's too low because the aversion to equities could mean smaller profits for germans when they trade their investments in for cash .
regarded over the long-term , stocks have proven to bring in higher returns than any other type of investment , according to dai statistics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax reached all-time highs in mid-july and is currently up about 14 percent for the year " though it does not apply to every stock or every year , broad investments yield higher returns , " leven said , adding that the stock market averages annual returns of between 8 percent and 10 percent in the long term .
that 's about 2 percent higher than other investment options .
on average , 12 percent of europeans and 22 percent of americans put some of their savings into stocks .
at the same time , bonds and other investment options with guaranteed returns remain considerably more popular in germany , surveys by the nuremburg-based society for consumer research -lrb- gfk -rrb- have shown . about 44 percent of germans put at least some of their savings in bonds and accounts with guaranteed returns , and 42 percent of germans are not investing their money at all , according to a july gfk survey .
traditional interest since savings accounts and other forms of low-risk investment are most familiar to people in germany , many do not consider investing in equities or even know about all their options , according to matthias von arnim , an economics journalist and author of the book " erfolgreich mit aktien " -lrb- " successful with stocks " -rrb- .
" the money is basically there , but the knowledge is not , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do germans still see this as their best savings option ?
germans also tend to overestimate the amount of money they need to begin investing in stocks , leven said . the dai recommends investors have about 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 55,250 -rrb- in savings to invest directly in stocks .
investors with less are safer with other forms of investment , such as index funds , whose shares are broadly invested and can be purchased with smaller lump sums of money , leven said .
both von arnim and the dai 's leven emphasized that such returns only occur when money is invested for at least 10 years and that there is always some risk involved in buying stocks , though it is reduced by owning a wide variety of stock for a long period of time .
once bitten " over the short-term the stock market can change quickly , " von arnim said .
" it 's not the right place to try and make money quickly . "
viewing the stock market as a place to make a quick buck has left a bad taste in the mouths of many german investors , especially after the value of highly promoted stocks in deutsche telekom plummeted and the dot-com crash in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom shares closed at 13.07 euros on wednesday as a result , germans moved their money out of equities .
assets held in stocks dropped to about 8 percent in 2006 , down from 13.5 percent in 1999 , according to dai figures .
" some people definitely stopped enjoying stocks after the telekom crash , " von arnim said .
" i met people who sold their businesses and decided to make a living selling stocks .
they were ruined . "
crash as confirmation after going public in 1996 , deutsche telekom promoted itself to small , private investors , calling its shares " volksaktien , " or " people 's stocks . "
the campaign was a success , with 3 million people purchasing a part of the former monopoly .
they watched their shares ' value grow to over 100 euros each - and then fall to less than 10 euros in just over two years .
the losses were so serious that then-telekom ceo ron sommer was pushed out of his job for the shares ' poor performance .
in addition to annihilating shareholders ' savings , the telekom and dot-com crashes also affected germans who had not invested in stocks , leven said .
" the people who lost money were naturally put off stocks , " he said .
" and the people who did not lose anything felt confirmed that investing in stocks is very risky . " sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the question today is how to integrate ancient traditions into contemporary society .
the people of papua new guinea are also trying to bridge the gap . the traditional dance of papua new guinea 's so-called " bonesmen " is only danced at very large festivals or if tourists pay for it .
the bright painted bodies , the spectacular feathers , the masks and the intricate bamboo skirts have long been replaced by a fashion known as " seconhandclos " in the local language .
tribes ’ people wear a combination of old clothes from the west .
but despite some changes , a pig is still a pig and a bigman is still a bigman , so long as he owns enough pigs .
if somebody wants to be a bigman , a chief or a village head , he has to produce at least five pigs .
" if a man has a pig , he is rich and people respect him , " one tribe member named daniel explained .
" if you have lots of pigs , you can also have lots of women .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de competition -pipe- 09.08.2007 deutsche post in uproar over planned market changes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post carriers worry they will end up unemployed out in the rain , snow , sleet and hail at the end of this year , the remains of germany 's postal monopoly are slated to be fully dismantled .
but deutsche post says it faces a less-than-level playing field and unfair competition on the open market . the eu said germany and four other countries have to fully open up their markets to national and international competition on jan .
1 , 2008 , even though the eu 's 22 other countries wo n't be required to do the same until 2011 .
this means that starting in 2008 , finland 's postal system , for example , can expand into germany , where the finnish companies can concentrate on lucrative big-city markets .
while facing competition from abroad in the cities , deutsche post will also be left to deliver mail to german rural regions - a costlier and more difficult service to provide .
if deutsche post wants to deliver mail in finland , however , it will be obliged to fork over 20 percent of its turnover to the finnish state .
it is that kind of scenario , what deutsche post calls a very uneven playing field , that is causing an uproar at the former mail monopoly .
the german mail carrier has a legal obligation to provide universal service , covering routes that are money making as well as those that are not .
liberalization woes even more troublesome are competing mail services within germany , which pay their mail carriers lower wages than deutsche post , that company 's ceo klaus zumwinkel said as he lashed out at eu rules to liberalize postal services , which he called " a true mess . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post ceo klaus zumwinkel says he will fight alongside his employees the european postal sector was opened to competition a decade ago for the delivery of packages weighing more than 350 grams -lrb- 12 ounces -rrb- .
in 2003 , the measure was extended to items of more than 100 grams and in 2006 , to letters weighing more than 50 grams .
the latest plan allows competition for letters weighing less than 50 grams .
in july , european lawmakers voted in favor of deregulating the eu market for letter delivery from 2011 , two years later than a proposal from the european commission .
britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden have already opened their postal markets to competition .
lawmakers see bonus for consumers the eu has predicted that customers will notice few of the changes .
however , lawmakers believe new competitors are likely to try to distinguish themselves from existing state-controlled post offices with lower costs and special services .
since the partial break up of the german postal monopoly in 1998 , germany 's governing post and telecommunications body has granted some 1,000 business licenses for delivering mail . unlike employees at deutsche post , the mail carriers for these start-ups are often part-time or temporary workers , who do n't enjoy the job security or compensation rates of deutsche post employees .
deutsche post pays its mail carriers a basic 10.14 euros -lrb- $ 13.87 -rrb- per hour , while the competition pays around 5.90 euros in the east and 7 euros per hour in the west of the country .
on top of that , more and more postal services only pay their mail carriers for mail delivered .
this means that in periods of low demand , the welfare office steps in to fill the gaps .
fear of job losses " it can not be the case that steady jobs with social benefits are lost because of the pressure from this kind of competition , " zumwinkel said , adding that some 32,000 jobs are endangered at deutsche post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some new carriers pay per piece of mail delivered zumwinkel has said the postal service should be covered by the temporary personnel assignment act , passed in 1996 to prevent foreign companies from importing labor to germany at below-market wages .
he said a minimum wage should be set for the sector .
deutsche post is also seeking a permanent exemption from paying value-added tax .
it currently does not pay the tax because of its universal service obligation .
on that point , the competition says the exemption gives the former monopolist its own bit of an unfair advantage .
but zumwinkel insisted that given the disadvantages he says deutsche post faces , political action needs to take place soon .
" you can imagine that my employees are at the barricades , " zumwinkel said .
" and i 'm with them on the front lines ... -lsb- the situation -rsb- is almost obscene .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de competition -pipe- 09.08.2007 deutsche post in uproar over planned market changes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post carriers worry they will end up unemployed out in the rain , snow , sleet and hail at the end of this year , the remains of germany 's postal monopoly are slated to be fully dismantled .
but deutsche post says it faces a less-than-level playing field and unfair competition on the open market . the eu said germany and four other countries have to fully open up their markets to national and international competition on jan .
1 , 2008 , even though the eu 's 22 other countries wo n't be required to do the same until 2011 .
this means that starting in 2008 , finland 's postal system , for example , can expand into germany , where the finnish companies can concentrate on lucrative big-city markets .
while facing competition from abroad in the cities , deutsche post will also be left to deliver mail to german rural regions - a costlier and more difficult service to provide .
if deutsche post wants to deliver mail in finland , however , it will be obliged to fork over 20 percent of its turnover to the finnish state .
it is that kind of scenario , what deutsche post calls a very uneven playing field , that is causing an uproar at the former mail monopoly .
the german mail carrier has a legal obligation to provide universal service , covering routes that are money making as well as those that are not .
liberalization woes even more troublesome are competing mail services within germany , which pay their mail carriers lower wages than deutsche post , that company 's ceo klaus zumwinkel said as he lashed out at eu rules to liberalize postal services , which he called " a true mess . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post ceo klaus zumwinkel says he will fight alongside his employees the european postal sector was opened to competition a decade ago for the delivery of packages weighing more than 350 grams -lrb- 12 ounces -rrb- .
in 2003 , the measure was extended to items of more than 100 grams and in 2006 , to letters weighing more than 50 grams .
the latest plan allows competition for letters weighing less than 50 grams .
in july , european lawmakers voted in favor of deregulating the eu market for letter delivery from 2011 , two years later than a proposal from the european commission .
britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden have already opened their postal markets to competition .
lawmakers see bonus for consumers the eu has predicted that customers will notice few of the changes .
however , lawmakers believe new competitors are likely to try to distinguish themselves from existing state-controlled post offices with lower costs and special services .
since the partial break up of the german postal monopoly in 1998 , germany 's governing post and telecommunications body has granted some 1,000 business licenses for delivering mail . unlike employees at deutsche post , the mail carriers for these start-ups are often part-time or temporary workers , who do n't enjoy the job security or compensation rates of deutsche post employees .
deutsche post pays its mail carriers a basic 10.14 euros -lrb- $ 13.87 -rrb- per hour , while the competition pays around 5.90 euros in the east and 7 euros per hour in the west of the country .
on top of that , more and more postal services only pay their mail carriers for mail delivered .
this means that in periods of low demand , the welfare office steps in to fill the gaps .
fear of job losses " it can not be the case that steady jobs with social benefits are lost because of the pressure from this kind of competition , " zumwinkel said , adding that some 32,000 jobs are endangered at deutsche post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some new carriers pay per piece of mail delivered zumwinkel has said the postal service should be covered by the temporary personnel assignment act , passed in 1996 to prevent foreign companies from importing labor to germany at below-market wages .
he said a minimum wage should be set for the sector .
deutsche post is also seeking a permanent exemption from paying value-added tax .
it currently does not pay the tax because of its universal service obligation .
on that point , the competition says the exemption gives the former monopolist its own bit of an unfair advantage .
but zumwinkel insisted that given the disadvantages he says deutsche post faces , political action needs to take place soon .
" you can imagine that my employees are at the barricades , " zumwinkel said .
" and i 'm with them on the front lines ... -lsb- the situation -rsb- is almost obscene .

but deutsche post says it faces a less-than-level playing field and unfair competition on the open market . the eu said germany and four other countries have to fully open up their markets to national and international competition on jan .
1 , 2008 , even though the eu 's 22 other countries wo n't be required to do the same until 2011 .
this means that starting in 2008 , finland 's postal system , for example , can expand into germany , where the finnish companies can concentrate on lucrative big-city markets .
while facing competition from abroad in the cities , deutsche post will also be left to deliver mail to german rural regions - a costlier and more difficult service to provide .
if deutsche post wants to deliver mail in finland , however , it will be obliged to fork over 20 percent of its turnover to the finnish state .
it is that kind of scenario , what deutsche post calls a very uneven playing field , that is causing an uproar at the former mail monopoly .
the german mail carrier has a legal obligation to provide universal service , covering routes that are money making as well as those that are not .
liberalization woes even more troublesome are competing mail services within germany , which pay their mail carriers lower wages than deutsche post , that company 's ceo klaus zumwinkel said as he lashed out at eu rules to liberalize postal services , which he called " a true mess . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post ceo klaus zumwinkel says he will fight alongside his employees the european postal sector was opened to competition a decade ago for the delivery of packages weighing more than 350 grams -lrb- 12 ounces -rrb- .
in 2003 , the measure was extended to items of more than 100 grams and in 2006 , to letters weighing more than 50 grams .
the latest plan allows competition for letters weighing less than 50 grams .
in july , european lawmakers voted in favor of deregulating the eu market for letter delivery from 2011 , two years later than a proposal from the european commission .
britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden have already opened their postal markets to competition .
lawmakers see bonus for consumers the eu has predicted that customers will notice few of the changes .
however , lawmakers believe new competitors are likely to try to distinguish themselves from existing state-controlled post offices with lower costs and special services .
since the partial break up of the german postal monopoly in 1998 , germany 's governing post and telecommunications body has granted some 1,000 business licenses for delivering mail . unlike employees at deutsche post , the mail carriers for these start-ups are often part-time or temporary workers , who do n't enjoy the job security or compensation rates of deutsche post employees .
deutsche post pays its mail carriers a basic 10.14 euros -lrb- $ 13.87 -rrb- per hour , while the competition pays around 5.90 euros in the east and 7 euros per hour in the west of the country .
on top of that , more and more postal services only pay their mail carriers for mail delivered .
this means that in periods of low demand , the welfare office steps in to fill the gaps .
fear of job losses " it can not be the case that steady jobs with social benefits are lost because of the pressure from this kind of competition , " zumwinkel said , adding that some 32,000 jobs are endangered at deutsche post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some new carriers pay per piece of mail delivered zumwinkel has said the postal service should be covered by the temporary personnel assignment act , passed in 1996 to prevent foreign companies from importing labor to germany at below-market wages .
he said a minimum wage should be set for the sector .
deutsche post is also seeking a permanent exemption from paying value-added tax .
it currently does not pay the tax because of its universal service obligation .
on that point , the competition says the exemption gives the former monopolist its own bit of an unfair advantage .
but zumwinkel insisted that given the disadvantages he says deutsche post faces , political action needs to take place soon .

after five years and more than 50 matches of italian cooking , a german is taking over in the kitchen . though soccer players for the german national team have threatened to quit if they ca n't wear the shoes they want , they are n't that picky when it comes to what 's on their plates .
" they all like italian food the best , " team cook saverio pugliese told the the stuttgarter zeitung .
fish , meat and pasta - easy on the sauce - were among the team 's favorite foods , he said .
pugliese , who was responsible for making sure german coach joachim löw 's players got the 3,000 to 3,500 calories they needed for peak performance for two months straight during last summer 's world cup , said he had decided to hang up his black , red and gold spaghetti spoon after five years with the team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another victory , now it 's chow time " that was the highpoint of my life , " pugliese said of the world cup .
" i could n't have dreamed of anything better . "
originally from calabria , at the bottom of the italian boot , pugliese immigrated to germany when he was 17 and by chance opened his own restaurant near the headquarters of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
obviously pleased with a meal he enjoyed at pugliese 's alten haferkasten eatery , then-team coach rudi völler asked the lifelong soccer fan if he 'd whip something up for the national team before its next match .
over the ensuing years , ravenous german players came to love pugliese 's cooking .
" there were some players who , days ahead of time , would look forward to joining the national team just for the food , " he said .
starting with the germany-england friendly on aug .
22 , it will be up to bavaria 's holger stromberg to fill pugliese 's shoes and the national team players ' stomachs .
pugliese has said he intends to use the time freed up by not having to cook for a team of top-notch athletes concentrating on his own restaurant and taking more vacations . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after five years and more than 50 matches of italian cooking , a german is taking over in the kitchen . though soccer players for the german national team have threatened to quit if they ca n't wear the shoes they want , they are n't that picky when it comes to what 's on their plates .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de competition -pipe- 09.08.2007 deutsche post in uproar over planned market changes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post carriers worry they will end up unemployed out in the rain , snow , sleet and hail at the end of this year , the remains of germany 's postal monopoly are slated to be fully dismantled .
but deutsche post says it faces a less-than-level playing field and unfair competition on the open market . the eu said germany and four other countries have to fully open up their markets to national and international competition on jan .
1 , 2008 , even though the eu 's 22 other countries wo n't be required to do the same until 2011 .
this means that starting in 2008 , finland 's postal system , for example , can expand into germany , where the finnish companies can concentrate on lucrative big-city markets .
while facing competition from abroad in the cities , deutsche post will also be left to deliver mail to german rural regions - a costlier and more difficult service to provide .
if deutsche post wants to deliver mail in finland , however , it will be obliged to fork over 20 percent of its turnover to the finnish state .
it is that kind of scenario , what deutsche post calls a very uneven playing field , that is causing an uproar at the former mail monopoly .
the german mail carrier has a legal obligation to provide universal service , covering routes that are money making as well as those that are not .
liberalization woes even more troublesome are competing mail services within germany , which pay their mail carriers lower wages than deutsche post , that company 's ceo klaus zumwinkel said as he lashed out at eu rules to liberalize postal services , which he called " a true mess . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post ceo klaus zumwinkel says he will fight alongside his employees the european postal sector was opened to competition a decade ago for the delivery of packages weighing more than 350 grams -lrb- 12 ounces -rrb- .
in 2003 , the measure was extended to items of more than 100 grams and in 2006 , to letters weighing more than 50 grams .
the latest plan allows competition for letters weighing less than 50 grams .
in july , european lawmakers voted in favor of deregulating the eu market for letter delivery from 2011 , two years later than a proposal from the european commission .
britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden have already opened their postal markets to competition .
lawmakers see bonus for consumers the eu has predicted that customers will notice few of the changes .
however , lawmakers believe new competitors are likely to try to distinguish themselves from existing state-controlled post offices with lower costs and special services .
since the partial break up of the german postal monopoly in 1998 , germany 's governing post and telecommunications body has granted some 1,000 business licenses for delivering mail . unlike employees at deutsche post , the mail carriers for these start-ups are often part-time or temporary workers , who do n't enjoy the job security or compensation rates of deutsche post employees .
deutsche post pays its mail carriers a basic 10.14 euros -lrb- $ 13.87 -rrb- per hour , while the competition pays around 5.90 euros in the east and 7 euros per hour in the west of the country .
on top of that , more and more postal services only pay their mail carriers for mail delivered .
this means that in periods of low demand , the welfare office steps in to fill the gaps .
fear of job losses " it can not be the case that steady jobs with social benefits are lost because of the pressure from this kind of competition , " zumwinkel said , adding that some 32,000 jobs are endangered at deutsche post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some new carriers pay per piece of mail delivered zumwinkel has said the postal service should be covered by the temporary personnel assignment act , passed in 1996 to prevent foreign companies from importing labor to germany at below-market wages .
he said a minimum wage should be set for the sector .
deutsche post is also seeking a permanent exemption from paying value-added tax .
it currently does not pay the tax because of its universal service obligation .
on that point , the competition says the exemption gives the former monopolist its own bit of an unfair advantage .
but zumwinkel insisted that given the disadvantages he says deutsche post faces , political action needs to take place soon .
" you can imagine that my employees are at the barricades , " zumwinkel said .
" and i 'm with them on the front lines ... -lsb- the situation -rsb- is almost obscene .

several writers have said they 'll boycott the world 's largest book fair . last year , the frankfurt book fair highlighted the literature and culture of india .
this year , it took the unusual step of turning to a region rather than a country , in this case catalonia in northeast spain .
originally , catalonia chose writers for the october book fair who write in catalan .
the decision caused outrage in spain 's insular literary world .
catalonia backtracked , inviting top spanish-language writers to come as well .
many have refused , the associated press reported .
they see the gesture as an insult prompted by political maneuvering .
language controversy erupts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india was the star at last year 's book fair language is a touchy subject in the spanish literary world .
during francisco franco 's 36-year dictatorship all other languages except spanish were considered officially illegal .
after franco 's death in 1975 , regional languages , including catalan , basque and galician , started reasserting their place in spanish culture .
spain 's myriad of languages leads to frequent cultural clashes .
take barcelona-born writer carlos ruiz-zafron .
while he was born in catalonia 's largest city , he writes in spanish .
ruiz-zafron , who wrote the international bestseller " the shadow of the wind , " has said he 'll boycott the frankfurt book fair .
he blamed the " sideshow " over the language issue on politicians who he said wanted to project a certain image of catalonia to please their supporters .
book fair organizers insist that , in the end , a wide range of catalan culture will be represented in frankfurt .
approximately 130 authors from the region have been invited . the book fair will run from oct .

13 . the judge in the case referred to the state administrative court ruling in january about the planned autobahn route though a protected nature reserve in the eastern german city of halle an der saale , which set stricter standards on the protection of natural resources . this ultimately reversed the 2005 decision to build a bridge through the natural area . now conservationists need to see to what extent the tiny bat known as the lesser horseshoe bat , or rhinolophus hipposideros , would be affected by the bridge construction , and how it can be protected .
the bat is considered an endangered species . world heritage status at a meeting in new zealand in june , the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organization , unesco , had threatened to withdraw the world heritage site status held by the valley on the elbe as it passes through the city .
unesco placed the 20 kilometer long stretch of valley on a " red list " of endangered sites , angering local politicians .
the un body has never withdrawn world heritage site status .
georg milbradt , premier the state of saxony criticized the unesco threat as " lacking respect for democracy . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de investment -pipe- 09.08.2007 germans wary of stock market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are n't rushing to buy equities at the frankfurt stock exchange despite recent german market highs and the possibility to earn greater returns on their savings , germans continue to see stocks as high-risk investments and avoid them in favor of other options with guaranteed returns . the risk of stock investing and not having a guarantee of how much of a return an investment will yield is a central reason why germans tend to avoid stocks , according to franz-josef leven of the deutsches aktieninstitut -lrb- german equities institute , dai -rrb- .
" only 6.7 percent of germans invest in stocks , " leven said .
" that is absolutely too low . " it 's too low because the aversion to equities could mean smaller profits for germans when they trade their investments in for cash .
regarded over the long-term , stocks have proven to bring in higher returns than any other type of investment , according to dai statistics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax reached all-time highs in mid-july and is currently up about 14 percent for the year " though it does not apply to every stock or every year , broad investments yield higher returns , " leven said , adding that the stock market averages annual returns of between 8 percent and 10 percent in the long term .
that 's about 2 percent higher than other investment options .
on average , 12 percent of europeans and 22 percent of americans put some of their savings into stocks .
at the same time , bonds and other investment options with guaranteed returns remain considerably more popular in germany , surveys by the nuremburg-based society for consumer research -lrb- gfk -rrb- have shown . about 44 percent of germans put at least some of their savings in bonds and accounts with guaranteed returns , and 42 percent of germans are not investing their money at all , according to a july gfk survey .
traditional interest since savings accounts and other forms of low-risk investment are most familiar to people in germany , many do not consider investing in equities or even know about all their options , according to matthias von arnim , an economics journalist and author of the book " erfolgreich mit aktien " -lrb- " successful with stocks " -rrb- .
" the money is basically there , but the knowledge is not , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do germans still see this as their best savings option ?
germans also tend to overestimate the amount of money they need to begin investing in stocks , leven said . the dai recommends investors have about 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 55,250 -rrb- in savings to invest directly in stocks .
investors with less are safer with other forms of investment , such as index funds , whose shares are broadly invested and can be purchased with smaller lump sums of money , leven said .
both von arnim and the dai 's leven emphasized that such returns only occur when money is invested for at least 10 years and that there is always some risk involved in buying stocks , though it is reduced by owning a wide variety of stock for a long period of time .

frommert said telekom was committed to helping the sport earn back trust after a very difficult time , adding that the company maintained the right to ends its contract " immediately " if members of the team run by bob stapleton are found guilty of doping .
" we want to help restore faith in cycling , which we see as having hit a low mark , " frommert said .
" we are convinced that the people who want to change something should not run away from it . "

sinkewitz later admitted to have used a testosterone gel to enhance his performance .
he faces a two-year ban from the sport and has been kicked off the t-mobile team .
under the current name t-mobile or its predecessor telekom , the german telecommunications company has been a major cycling sponsor for 16 years .
the team claimed two tour de france victories with bjarne riis in 1996 and jan ullrich in 1997 .
both of the tour winners , however , were later implicated in doping scandals that led to the team being almost completely revamped and the implementation of a strict anti-doping policy last year .
germany 's gerolsteiner beverage company has said it would also re-evaluate its cycling sponsorship after the numerous doping allegations that have overshadowed the tour de france for the last two years .
the company is expected to make its decision public at the end of august . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de investment -pipe- 09.08.2007 germans wary of stock market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are n't rushing to buy equities at the frankfurt stock exchange despite recent german market highs and the possibility to earn greater returns on their savings , germans continue to see stocks as high-risk investments and avoid them in favor of other options with guaranteed returns . the risk of stock investing and not having a guarantee of how much of a return an investment will yield is a central reason why germans tend to avoid stocks , according to franz-josef leven of the deutsches aktieninstitut -lrb- german equities institute , dai -rrb- .
" only 6.7 percent of germans invest in stocks , " leven said .
" that is absolutely too low . " it 's too low because the aversion to equities could mean smaller profits for germans when they trade their investments in for cash .
regarded over the long-term , stocks have proven to bring in higher returns than any other type of investment , according to dai statistics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax reached all-time highs in mid-july and is currently up about 14 percent for the year " though it does not apply to every stock or every year , broad investments yield higher returns , " leven said , adding that the stock market averages annual returns of between 8 percent and 10 percent in the long term .
that 's about 2 percent higher than other investment options .
on average , 12 percent of europeans and 22 percent of americans put some of their savings into stocks .
at the same time , bonds and other investment options with guaranteed returns remain considerably more popular in germany , surveys by the nuremburg-based society for consumer research -lrb- gfk -rrb- have shown . about 44 percent of germans put at least some of their savings in bonds and accounts with guaranteed returns , and 42 percent of germans are not investing their money at all , according to a july gfk survey .
traditional interest since savings accounts and other forms of low-risk investment are most familiar to people in germany , many do not consider investing in equities or even know about all their options , according to matthias von arnim , an economics journalist and author of the book " erfolgreich mit aktien " -lrb- " successful with stocks " -rrb- .
" the money is basically there , but the knowledge is not , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do germans still see this as their best savings option ?
germans also tend to overestimate the amount of money they need to begin investing in stocks , leven said . the dai recommends investors have about 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 55,250 -rrb- in savings to invest directly in stocks .
investors with less are safer with other forms of investment , such as index funds , whose shares are broadly invested and can be purchased with smaller lump sums of money , leven said .
both von arnim and the dai 's leven emphasized that such returns only occur when money is invested for at least 10 years and that there is always some risk involved in buying stocks , though it is reduced by owning a wide variety of stock for a long period of time .
once bitten " over the short-term the stock market can change quickly , " von arnim said .
" it 's not the right place to try and make money quickly . "
viewing the stock market as a place to make a quick buck has left a bad taste in the mouths of many german investors , especially after the value of highly promoted stocks in deutsche telekom plummeted and the dot-com crash in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom shares closed at 13.07 euros on wednesday as a result , germans moved their money out of equities .
assets held in stocks dropped to about 8 percent in 2006 , down from 13.5 percent in 1999 , according to dai figures .
" some people definitely stopped enjoying stocks after the telekom crash , " von arnim said .
" i met people who sold their businesses and decided to make a living selling stocks .
they were ruined . "
crash as confirmation after going public in 1996 , deutsche telekom promoted itself to small , private investors , calling its shares " volksaktien , " or " people 's stocks . "
the campaign was a success , with 3 million people purchasing a part of the former monopoly .
they watched their shares ' value grow to over 100 euros each - and then fall to less than 10 euros in just over two years .
the losses were so serious that then-telekom ceo ron sommer was pushed out of his job for the shares ' poor performance .
in addition to annihilating shareholders ' savings , the telekom and dot-com crashes also affected germans who had not invested in stocks , leven said .

several writers have said they 'll boycott the world 's largest book fair . last year , the frankfurt book fair highlighted the literature and culture of india .
this year , it took the unusual step of turning to a region rather than a country , in this case catalonia in northeast spain .
originally , catalonia chose writers for the october book fair who write in catalan .
the decision caused outrage in spain 's insular literary world .
catalonia backtracked , inviting top spanish-language writers to come as well .
many have refused , the associated press reported .
they see the gesture as an insult prompted by political maneuvering .
language controversy erupts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india was the star at last year 's book fair language is a touchy subject in the spanish literary world .
during francisco franco 's 36-year dictatorship all other languages except spanish were considered officially illegal .
after franco 's death in 1975 , regional languages , including catalan , basque and galician , started reasserting their place in spanish culture .
spain 's myriad of languages leads to frequent cultural clashes .
take barcelona-born writer carlos ruiz-zafron .
while he was born in catalonia 's largest city , he writes in spanish .
ruiz-zafron , who wrote the international bestseller " the shadow of the wind , " has said he 'll boycott the frankfurt book fair .
he blamed the " sideshow " over the language issue on politicians who he said wanted to project a certain image of catalonia to please their supporters .
book fair organizers insist that , in the end , a wide range of catalan culture will be represented in frankfurt .
approximately 130 authors from the region have been invited . the book fair will run from oct .

frommert said telekom was committed to helping the sport earn back trust after a very difficult time , adding that the company maintained the right to ends its contract " immediately " if members of the team run by bob stapleton are found guilty of doping .
" we want to help restore faith in cycling , which we see as having hit a low mark , " frommert said .

several writers have said they 'll boycott the world 's largest book fair . last year , the frankfurt book fair highlighted the literature and culture of india .
this year , it took the unusual step of turning to a region rather than a country , in this case catalonia in northeast spain .
originally , catalonia chose writers for the october book fair who write in catalan .
the decision caused outrage in spain 's insular literary world .
catalonia backtracked , inviting top spanish-language writers to come as well .
many have refused , the associated press reported .
they see the gesture as an insult prompted by political maneuvering .
language controversy erupts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india was the star at last year 's book fair language is a touchy subject in the spanish literary world .
during francisco franco 's 36-year dictatorship all other languages except spanish were considered officially illegal .
after franco 's death in 1975 , regional languages , including catalan , basque and galician , started reasserting their place in spanish culture .
spain 's myriad of languages leads to frequent cultural clashes .
take barcelona-born writer carlos ruiz-zafron .
while he was born in catalonia 's largest city , he writes in spanish .
ruiz-zafron , who wrote the international bestseller " the shadow of the wind , " has said he 'll boycott the frankfurt book fair .
he blamed the " sideshow " over the language issue on politicians who he said wanted to project a certain image of catalonia to please their supporters .
book fair organizers insist that , in the end , a wide range of catalan culture will be represented in frankfurt .
approximately 130 authors from the region have been invited . the book fair will run from oct .

13 . the judge in the case referred to the state administrative court ruling in january about the planned autobahn route though a protected nature reserve in the eastern german city of halle an der saale , which set stricter standards on the protection of natural resources . this ultimately reversed the 2005 decision to build a bridge through the natural area . now conservationists need to see to what extent the tiny bat known as the lesser horseshoe bat , or rhinolophus hipposideros , would be affected by the bridge construction , and how it can be protected .
the bat is considered an endangered species . world heritage status at a meeting in new zealand in june , the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organization , unesco , had threatened to withdraw the world heritage site status held by the valley on the elbe as it passes through the city .
unesco placed the 20 kilometer long stretch of valley on a " red list " of endangered sites , angering local politicians .
the un body has never withdrawn world heritage site status .
georg milbradt , premier the state of saxony criticized the unesco threat as " lacking respect for democracy . "
residents of dresden , the capital of saxony , voted for the bridge to relieve road congestion in a 2005 referendum . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

frommert said telekom was committed to helping the sport earn back trust after a very difficult time , adding that the company maintained the right to ends its contract " immediately " if members of the team run by bob stapleton are found guilty of doping .
" we want to help restore faith in cycling , which we see as having hit a low mark , " frommert said .
" we are convinced that the people who want to change something should not run away from it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sinkewitz was just one of the high-profile riders involved in the 2007 doping scandals t-mobile 's continued sponsorship was thrown into question during this summer 's tour de france when t-mobile rider patrik sinkewitz 's blood sample tested positive for elevated levels of testosterone .
sinkewitz later admitted to have used a testosterone gel to enhance his performance .
he faces a two-year ban from the sport and has been kicked off the t-mobile team .
under the current name t-mobile or its predecessor telekom , the german telecommunications company has been a major cycling sponsor for 16 years .
the team claimed two tour de france victories with bjarne riis in 1996 and jan ullrich in 1997 .
both of the tour winners , however , were later implicated in doping scandals that led to the team being almost completely revamped and the implementation of a strict anti-doping policy last year .
germany 's gerolsteiner beverage company has said it would also re-evaluate its cycling sponsorship after the numerous doping allegations that have overshadowed the tour de france for the last two years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de investment -pipe- 09.08.2007 germans wary of stock market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are n't rushing to buy equities at the frankfurt stock exchange despite recent german market highs and the possibility to earn greater returns on their savings , germans continue to see stocks as high-risk investments and avoid them in favor of other options with guaranteed returns . the risk of stock investing and not having a guarantee of how much of a return an investment will yield is a central reason why germans tend to avoid stocks , according to franz-josef leven of the deutsches aktieninstitut -lrb- german equities institute , dai -rrb- .
" only 6.7 percent of germans invest in stocks , " leven said .
" that is absolutely too low . " it 's too low because the aversion to equities could mean smaller profits for germans when they trade their investments in for cash .
regarded over the long-term , stocks have proven to bring in higher returns than any other type of investment , according to dai statistics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax reached all-time highs in mid-july and is currently up about 14 percent for the year " though it does not apply to every stock or every year , broad investments yield higher returns , " leven said , adding that the stock market averages annual returns of between 8 percent and 10 percent in the long term .
that 's about 2 percent higher than other investment options .
on average , 12 percent of europeans and 22 percent of americans put some of their savings into stocks .
at the same time , bonds and other investment options with guaranteed returns remain considerably more popular in germany , surveys by the nuremburg-based society for consumer research -lrb- gfk -rrb- have shown . about 44 percent of germans put at least some of their savings in bonds and accounts with guaranteed returns , and 42 percent of germans are not investing their money at all , according to a july gfk survey .
traditional interest since savings accounts and other forms of low-risk investment are most familiar to people in germany , many do not consider investing in equities or even know about all their options , according to matthias von arnim , an economics journalist and author of the book " erfolgreich mit aktien " -lrb- " successful with stocks " -rrb- .
" the money is basically there , but the knowledge is not , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do germans still see this as their best savings option ?
germans also tend to overestimate the amount of money they need to begin investing in stocks , leven said . the dai recommends investors have about 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 55,250 -rrb- in savings to invest directly in stocks .
investors with less are safer with other forms of investment , such as index funds , whose shares are broadly invested and can be purchased with smaller lump sums of money , leven said .
both von arnim and the dai 's leven emphasized that such returns only occur when money is invested for at least 10 years and that there is always some risk involved in buying stocks , though it is reduced by owning a wide variety of stock for a long period of time .
once bitten " over the short-term the stock market can change quickly , " von arnim said .
" it 's not the right place to try and make money quickly . "
viewing the stock market as a place to make a quick buck has left a bad taste in the mouths of many german investors , especially after the value of highly promoted stocks in deutsche telekom plummeted and the dot-com crash in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom shares closed at 13.07 euros on wednesday as a result , germans moved their money out of equities .
assets held in stocks dropped to about 8 percent in 2006 , down from 13.5 percent in 1999 , according to dai figures .
" some people definitely stopped enjoying stocks after the telekom crash , " von arnim said .
" i met people who sold their businesses and decided to make a living selling stocks .
they were ruined . "
crash as confirmation after going public in 1996 , deutsche telekom promoted itself to small , private investors , calling its shares " volksaktien , " or " people 's stocks . "
the campaign was a success , with 3 million people purchasing a part of the former monopoly .
they watched their shares ' value grow to over 100 euros each - and then fall to less than 10 euros in just over two years .
the losses were so serious that then-telekom ceo ron sommer was pushed out of his job for the shares ' poor performance .
in addition to annihilating shareholders ' savings , the telekom and dot-com crashes also affected germans who had not invested in stocks , leven said .
" the people who lost money were naturally put off stocks , " he said .

" only 6.7 percent of germans invest in stocks , " leven said .
" that is absolutely too low . " it 's too low because the aversion to equities could mean smaller profits for germans when they trade their investments in for cash .
regarded over the long-term , stocks have proven to bring in higher returns than any other type of investment , according to dai statistics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax reached all-time highs in mid-july and is currently up about 14 percent for the year " though it does not apply to every stock or every year , broad investments yield higher returns , " leven said , adding that the stock market averages annual returns of between 8 percent and 10 percent in the long term .
that 's about 2 percent higher than other investment options .
on average , 12 percent of europeans and 22 percent of americans put some of their savings into stocks .
at the same time , bonds and other investment options with guaranteed returns remain considerably more popular in germany , surveys by the nuremburg-based society for consumer research -lrb- gfk -rrb- have shown . about 44 percent of germans put at least some of their savings in bonds and accounts with guaranteed returns , and 42 percent of germans are not investing their money at all , according to a july gfk survey .
traditional interest since savings accounts and other forms of low-risk investment are most familiar to people in germany , many do not consider investing in equities or even know about all their options , according to matthias von arnim , an economics journalist and author of the book " erfolgreich mit aktien " -lrb- " successful with stocks " -rrb- .
" the money is basically there , but the knowledge is not , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do germans still see this as their best savings option ?
germans also tend to overestimate the amount of money they need to begin investing in stocks , leven said . the dai recommends investors have about 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 55,250 -rrb- in savings to invest directly in stocks .
investors with less are safer with other forms of investment , such as index funds , whose shares are broadly invested and can be purchased with smaller lump sums of money , leven said .
both von arnim and the dai 's leven emphasized that such returns only occur when money is invested for at least 10 years and that there is always some risk involved in buying stocks , though it is reduced by owning a wide variety of stock for a long period of time .
once bitten " over the short-term the stock market can change quickly , " von arnim said .
" it 's not the right place to try and make money quickly . "
viewing the stock market as a place to make a quick buck has left a bad taste in the mouths of many german investors , especially after the value of highly promoted stocks in deutsche telekom plummeted and the dot-com crash in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom shares closed at 13.07 euros on wednesday as a result , germans moved their money out of equities .
assets held in stocks dropped to about 8 percent in 2006 , down from 13.5 percent in 1999 , according to dai figures .
" some people definitely stopped enjoying stocks after the telekom crash , " von arnim said .
" i met people who sold their businesses and decided to make a living selling stocks .
they were ruined . "
crash as confirmation after going public in 1996 , deutsche telekom promoted itself to small , private investors , calling its shares " volksaktien , " or " people 's stocks . "
the campaign was a success , with 3 million people purchasing a part of the former monopoly .
they watched their shares ' value grow to over 100 euros each - and then fall to less than 10 euros in just over two years .
the losses were so serious that then-telekom ceo ron sommer was pushed out of his job for the shares ' poor performance .
in addition to annihilating shareholders ' savings , the telekom and dot-com crashes also affected germans who had not invested in stocks , leven said .

" only 6.7 percent of germans invest in stocks , " leven said .
" that is absolutely too low . " it 's too low because the aversion to equities could mean smaller profits for germans when they trade their investments in for cash .
regarded over the long-term , stocks have proven to bring in higher returns than any other type of investment , according to dai statistics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax reached all-time highs in mid-july and is currently up about 14 percent for the year " though it does not apply to every stock or every year , broad investments yield higher returns , " leven said , adding that the stock market averages annual returns of between 8 percent and 10 percent in the long term .
that 's about 2 percent higher than other investment options .
on average , 12 percent of europeans and 22 percent of americans put some of their savings into stocks .
at the same time , bonds and other investment options with guaranteed returns remain considerably more popular in germany , surveys by the nuremburg-based society for consumer research -lrb- gfk -rrb- have shown . about 44 percent of germans put at least some of their savings in bonds and accounts with guaranteed returns , and 42 percent of germans are not investing their money at all , according to a july gfk survey .
traditional interest since savings accounts and other forms of low-risk investment are most familiar to people in germany , many do not consider investing in equities or even know about all their options , according to matthias von arnim , an economics journalist and author of the book " erfolgreich mit aktien " -lrb- " successful with stocks " -rrb- .

germans also tend to overestimate the amount of money they need to begin investing in stocks , leven said . the dai recommends investors have about 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 55,250 -rrb- in savings to invest directly in stocks .
investors with less are safer with other forms of investment , such as index funds , whose shares are broadly invested and can be purchased with smaller lump sums of money , leven said .
both von arnim and the dai 's leven emphasized that such returns only occur when money is invested for at least 10 years and that there is always some risk involved in buying stocks , though it is reduced by owning a wide variety of stock for a long period of time .

" it 's not the right place to try and make money quickly . "
viewing the stock market as a place to make a quick buck has left a bad taste in the mouths of many german investors , especially after the value of highly promoted stocks in deutsche telekom plummeted and the dot-com crash in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom shares closed at 13.07 euros on wednesday as a result , germans moved their money out of equities .
assets held in stocks dropped to about 8 percent in 2006 , down from 13.5 percent in 1999 , according to dai figures .
" some people definitely stopped enjoying stocks after the telekom crash , " von arnim said .
" i met people who sold their businesses and decided to make a living selling stocks .
they were ruined . "

the losses were so serious that then-telekom ceo ron sommer was pushed out of his job for the shares ' poor performance .
in addition to annihilating shareholders ' savings , the telekom and dot-com crashes also affected germans who had not invested in stocks , leven said .

13 . the judge in the case referred to the state administrative court ruling in january about the planned autobahn route though a protected nature reserve in the eastern german city of halle an der saale , which set stricter standards on the protection of natural resources . this ultimately reversed the 2005 decision to build a bridge through the natural area . now conservationists need to see to what extent the tiny bat known as the lesser horseshoe bat , or rhinolophus hipposideros , would be affected by the bridge construction , and how it can be protected .
the bat is considered an endangered species . world heritage status at a meeting in new zealand in june , the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organization , unesco , had threatened to withdraw the world heritage site status held by the valley on the elbe as it passes through the city .
unesco placed the 20 kilometer long stretch of valley on a " red list " of endangered sites , angering local politicians .
the un body has never withdrawn world heritage site status .
georg milbradt , premier the state of saxony criticized the unesco threat as " lacking respect for democracy . "
residents of dresden , the capital of saxony , voted for the bridge to relieve road congestion in a 2005 referendum . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after five years and more than 50 matches of italian cooking , a german is taking over in the kitchen . though soccer players for the german national team have threatened to quit if they ca n't wear the shoes they want , they are n't that picky when it comes to what 's on their plates .
" they all like italian food the best , " team cook saverio pugliese told the the stuttgarter zeitung .
fish , meat and pasta - easy on the sauce - were among the team 's favorite foods , he said .
pugliese , who was responsible for making sure german coach joachim löw 's players got the 3,000 to 3,500 calories they needed for peak performance for two months straight during last summer 's world cup , said he had decided to hang up his black , red and gold spaghetti spoon after five years with the team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another victory , now it 's chow time " that was the highpoint of my life , " pugliese said of the world cup .
" i could n't have dreamed of anything better . "
originally from calabria , at the bottom of the italian boot , pugliese immigrated to germany when he was 17 and by chance opened his own restaurant near the headquarters of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
obviously pleased with a meal he enjoyed at pugliese 's alten haferkasten eatery , then-team coach rudi völler asked the lifelong soccer fan if he 'd whip something up for the national team before its next match .
over the ensuing years , ravenous german players came to love pugliese 's cooking .
" there were some players who , days ahead of time , would look forward to joining the national team just for the food , " he said .
starting with the germany-england friendly on aug .
22 , it will be up to bavaria 's holger stromberg to fill pugliese 's shoes and the national team players ' stomachs .
pugliese has said he intends to use the time freed up by not having to cook for a team of top-notch athletes concentrating on his own restaurant and taking more vacations . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after five years and more than 50 matches of italian cooking , a german is taking over in the kitchen . though soccer players for the german national team have threatened to quit if they ca n't wear the shoes they want , they are n't that picky when it comes to what 's on their plates .
" they all like italian food the best , " team cook saverio pugliese told the the stuttgarter zeitung .
fish , meat and pasta - easy on the sauce - were among the team 's favorite foods , he said .
pugliese , who was responsible for making sure german coach joachim löw 's players got the 3,000 to 3,500 calories they needed for peak performance for two months straight during last summer 's world cup , said he had decided to hang up his black , red and gold spaghetti spoon after five years with the team .

but deutsche post says it faces a less-than-level playing field and unfair competition on the open market . the eu said germany and four other countries have to fully open up their markets to national and international competition on jan .
1 , 2008 , even though the eu 's 22 other countries wo n't be required to do the same until 2011 .
this means that starting in 2008 , finland 's postal system , for example , can expand into germany , where the finnish companies can concentrate on lucrative big-city markets .
while facing competition from abroad in the cities , deutsche post will also be left to deliver mail to german rural regions - a costlier and more difficult service to provide .
if deutsche post wants to deliver mail in finland , however , it will be obliged to fork over 20 percent of its turnover to the finnish state .
it is that kind of scenario , what deutsche post calls a very uneven playing field , that is causing an uproar at the former mail monopoly .
the german mail carrier has a legal obligation to provide universal service , covering routes that are money making as well as those that are not .
liberalization woes even more troublesome are competing mail services within germany , which pay their mail carriers lower wages than deutsche post , that company 's ceo klaus zumwinkel said as he lashed out at eu rules to liberalize postal services , which he called " a true mess . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post ceo klaus zumwinkel says he will fight alongside his employees the european postal sector was opened to competition a decade ago for the delivery of packages weighing more than 350 grams -lrb- 12 ounces -rrb- .
in 2003 , the measure was extended to items of more than 100 grams and in 2006 , to letters weighing more than 50 grams .
the latest plan allows competition for letters weighing less than 50 grams .
in july , european lawmakers voted in favor of deregulating the eu market for letter delivery from 2011 , two years later than a proposal from the european commission .
britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden have already opened their postal markets to competition .
lawmakers see bonus for consumers the eu has predicted that customers will notice few of the changes .
however , lawmakers believe new competitors are likely to try to distinguish themselves from existing state-controlled post offices with lower costs and special services .
since the partial break up of the german postal monopoly in 1998 , germany 's governing post and telecommunications body has granted some 1,000 business licenses for delivering mail . unlike employees at deutsche post , the mail carriers for these start-ups are often part-time or temporary workers , who do n't enjoy the job security or compensation rates of deutsche post employees .
deutsche post pays its mail carriers a basic 10.14 euros -lrb- $ 13.87 -rrb- per hour , while the competition pays around 5.90 euros in the east and 7 euros per hour in the west of the country .
on top of that , more and more postal services only pay their mail carriers for mail delivered .
this means that in periods of low demand , the welfare office steps in to fill the gaps .
fear of job losses " it can not be the case that steady jobs with social benefits are lost because of the pressure from this kind of competition , " zumwinkel said , adding that some 32,000 jobs are endangered at deutsche post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some new carriers pay per piece of mail delivered zumwinkel has said the postal service should be covered by the temporary personnel assignment act , passed in 1996 to prevent foreign companies from importing labor to germany at below-market wages .
he said a minimum wage should be set for the sector .
deutsche post is also seeking a permanent exemption from paying value-added tax .
it currently does not pay the tax because of its universal service obligation .
on that point , the competition says the exemption gives the former monopolist its own bit of an unfair advantage .
but zumwinkel insisted that given the disadvantages he says deutsche post faces , political action needs to take place soon .
" you can imagine that my employees are at the barricades , " zumwinkel said .

britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden have already opened their postal markets to competition .
lawmakers see bonus for consumers the eu has predicted that customers will notice few of the changes .
however , lawmakers believe new competitors are likely to try to distinguish themselves from existing state-controlled post offices with lower costs and special services .
since the partial break up of the german postal monopoly in 1998 , germany 's governing post and telecommunications body has granted some 1,000 business licenses for delivering mail . unlike employees at deutsche post , the mail carriers for these start-ups are often part-time or temporary workers , who do n't enjoy the job security or compensation rates of deutsche post employees .
deutsche post pays its mail carriers a basic 10.14 euros -lrb- $ 13.87 -rrb- per hour , while the competition pays around 5.90 euros in the east and 7 euros per hour in the west of the country .
on top of that , more and more postal services only pay their mail carriers for mail delivered .
this means that in periods of low demand , the welfare office steps in to fill the gaps .
fear of job losses " it can not be the case that steady jobs with social benefits are lost because of the pressure from this kind of competition , " zumwinkel said , adding that some 32,000 jobs are endangered at deutsche post .

deutsche post is also seeking a permanent exemption from paying value-added tax .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de competition -pipe- 09.08.2007 deutsche post in uproar over planned market changes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post carriers worry they will end up unemployed out in the rain , snow , sleet and hail at the end of this year , the remains of germany 's postal monopoly are slated to be fully dismantled .
but deutsche post says it faces a less-than-level playing field and unfair competition on the open market . the eu said germany and four other countries have to fully open up their markets to national and international competition on jan .
1 , 2008 , even though the eu 's 22 other countries wo n't be required to do the same until 2011 .
this means that starting in 2008 , finland 's postal system , for example , can expand into germany , where the finnish companies can concentrate on lucrative big-city markets .
while facing competition from abroad in the cities , deutsche post will also be left to deliver mail to german rural regions - a costlier and more difficult service to provide .
if deutsche post wants to deliver mail in finland , however , it will be obliged to fork over 20 percent of its turnover to the finnish state .
it is that kind of scenario , what deutsche post calls a very uneven playing field , that is causing an uproar at the former mail monopoly .
the german mail carrier has a legal obligation to provide universal service , covering routes that are money making as well as those that are not .
liberalization woes even more troublesome are competing mail services within germany , which pay their mail carriers lower wages than deutsche post , that company 's ceo klaus zumwinkel said as he lashed out at eu rules to liberalize postal services , which he called " a true mess . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post ceo klaus zumwinkel says he will fight alongside his employees the european postal sector was opened to competition a decade ago for the delivery of packages weighing more than 350 grams -lrb- 12 ounces -rrb- .
in 2003 , the measure was extended to items of more than 100 grams and in 2006 , to letters weighing more than 50 grams .
the latest plan allows competition for letters weighing less than 50 grams .
in july , european lawmakers voted in favor of deregulating the eu market for letter delivery from 2011 , two years later than a proposal from the european commission .
britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden have already opened their postal markets to competition .
lawmakers see bonus for consumers the eu has predicted that customers will notice few of the changes .
however , lawmakers believe new competitors are likely to try to distinguish themselves from existing state-controlled post offices with lower costs and special services .
since the partial break up of the german postal monopoly in 1998 , germany 's governing post and telecommunications body has granted some 1,000 business licenses for delivering mail . unlike employees at deutsche post , the mail carriers for these start-ups are often part-time or temporary workers , who do n't enjoy the job security or compensation rates of deutsche post employees .
deutsche post pays its mail carriers a basic 10.14 euros -lrb- $ 13.87 -rrb- per hour , while the competition pays around 5.90 euros in the east and 7 euros per hour in the west of the country .
on top of that , more and more postal services only pay their mail carriers for mail delivered .
this means that in periods of low demand , the welfare office steps in to fill the gaps .
fear of job losses " it can not be the case that steady jobs with social benefits are lost because of the pressure from this kind of competition , " zumwinkel said , adding that some 32,000 jobs are endangered at deutsche post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some new carriers pay per piece of mail delivered zumwinkel has said the postal service should be covered by the temporary personnel assignment act , passed in 1996 to prevent foreign companies from importing labor to germany at below-market wages .
he said a minimum wage should be set for the sector .
deutsche post is also seeking a permanent exemption from paying value-added tax .
it currently does not pay the tax because of its universal service obligation .
on that point , the competition says the exemption gives the former monopolist its own bit of an unfair advantage .
but zumwinkel insisted that given the disadvantages he says deutsche post faces , political action needs to take place soon .
" you can imagine that my employees are at the barricades , " zumwinkel said .
" and i 'm with them on the front lines ... -lsb- the situation -rsb- is almost obscene .

but deutsche post says it faces a less-than-level playing field and unfair competition on the open market . the eu said germany and four other countries have to fully open up their markets to national and international competition on jan .
1 , 2008 , even though the eu 's 22 other countries wo n't be required to do the same until 2011 .
this means that starting in 2008 , finland 's postal system , for example , can expand into germany , where the finnish companies can concentrate on lucrative big-city markets .
while facing competition from abroad in the cities , deutsche post will also be left to deliver mail to german rural regions - a costlier and more difficult service to provide .
if deutsche post wants to deliver mail in finland , however , it will be obliged to fork over 20 percent of its turnover to the finnish state .
it is that kind of scenario , what deutsche post calls a very uneven playing field , that is causing an uproar at the former mail monopoly .
the german mail carrier has a legal obligation to provide universal service , covering routes that are money making as well as those that are not .
liberalization woes even more troublesome are competing mail services within germany , which pay their mail carriers lower wages than deutsche post , that company 's ceo klaus zumwinkel said as he lashed out at eu rules to liberalize postal services , which he called " a true mess . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post ceo klaus zumwinkel says he will fight alongside his employees the european postal sector was opened to competition a decade ago for the delivery of packages weighing more than 350 grams -lrb- 12 ounces -rrb- .
in 2003 , the measure was extended to items of more than 100 grams and in 2006 , to letters weighing more than 50 grams .
the latest plan allows competition for letters weighing less than 50 grams .
in july , european lawmakers voted in favor of deregulating the eu market for letter delivery from 2011 , two years later than a proposal from the european commission .
britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden have already opened their postal markets to competition .
lawmakers see bonus for consumers the eu has predicted that customers will notice few of the changes .
however , lawmakers believe new competitors are likely to try to distinguish themselves from existing state-controlled post offices with lower costs and special services .
since the partial break up of the german postal monopoly in 1998 , germany 's governing post and telecommunications body has granted some 1,000 business licenses for delivering mail . unlike employees at deutsche post , the mail carriers for these start-ups are often part-time or temporary workers , who do n't enjoy the job security or compensation rates of deutsche post employees .
deutsche post pays its mail carriers a basic 10.14 euros -lrb- $ 13.87 -rrb- per hour , while the competition pays around 5.90 euros in the east and 7 euros per hour in the west of the country .
on top of that , more and more postal services only pay their mail carriers for mail delivered .
this means that in periods of low demand , the welfare office steps in to fill the gaps .
fear of job losses " it can not be the case that steady jobs with social benefits are lost because of the pressure from this kind of competition , " zumwinkel said , adding that some 32,000 jobs are endangered at deutsche post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some new carriers pay per piece of mail delivered zumwinkel has said the postal service should be covered by the temporary personnel assignment act , passed in 1996 to prevent foreign companies from importing labor to germany at below-market wages .
he said a minimum wage should be set for the sector .
deutsche post is also seeking a permanent exemption from paying value-added tax .
it currently does not pay the tax because of its universal service obligation .
on that point , the competition says the exemption gives the former monopolist its own bit of an unfair advantage .
but zumwinkel insisted that given the disadvantages he says deutsche post faces , political action needs to take place soon .

" they all like italian food the best , " team cook saverio pugliese told the the stuttgarter zeitung .
fish , meat and pasta - easy on the sauce - were among the team 's favorite foods , he said .
pugliese , who was responsible for making sure german coach joachim löw 's players got the 3,000 to 3,500 calories they needed for peak performance for two months straight during last summer 's world cup , said he had decided to hang up his black , red and gold spaghetti spoon after five years with the team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another victory , now it 's chow time " that was the highpoint of my life , " pugliese said of the world cup .
" i could n't have dreamed of anything better . "
originally from calabria , at the bottom of the italian boot , pugliese immigrated to germany when he was 17 and by chance opened his own restaurant near the headquarters of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
obviously pleased with a meal he enjoyed at pugliese 's alten haferkasten eatery , then-team coach rudi völler asked the lifelong soccer fan if he 'd whip something up for the national team before its next match .
over the ensuing years , ravenous german players came to love pugliese 's cooking .
" there were some players who , days ahead of time , would look forward to joining the national team just for the food , " he said .
starting with the germany-england friendly on aug .
22 , it will be up to bavaria 's holger stromberg to fill pugliese 's shoes and the national team players ' stomachs .
pugliese has said he intends to use the time freed up by not having to cook for a team of top-notch athletes concentrating on his own restaurant and taking more vacations . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

several writers have said they 'll boycott the world 's largest book fair . last year , the frankfurt book fair highlighted the literature and culture of india .
this year , it took the unusual step of turning to a region rather than a country , in this case catalonia in northeast spain .
originally , catalonia chose writers for the october book fair who write in catalan .
the decision caused outrage in spain 's insular literary world .
catalonia backtracked , inviting top spanish-language writers to come as well .
many have refused , the associated press reported .
they see the gesture as an insult prompted by political maneuvering .
language controversy erupts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india was the star at last year 's book fair language is a touchy subject in the spanish literary world .
during francisco franco 's 36-year dictatorship all other languages except spanish were considered officially illegal .
after franco 's death in 1975 , regional languages , including catalan , basque and galician , started reasserting their place in spanish culture .
spain 's myriad of languages leads to frequent cultural clashes .
take barcelona-born writer carlos ruiz-zafron .
while he was born in catalonia 's largest city , he writes in spanish .
ruiz-zafron , who wrote the international bestseller " the shadow of the wind , " has said he 'll boycott the frankfurt book fair .
he blamed the " sideshow " over the language issue on politicians who he said wanted to project a certain image of catalonia to please their supporters .
book fair organizers insist that , in the end , a wide range of catalan culture will be represented in frankfurt .

" only 6.7 percent of germans invest in stocks , " leven said .
" that is absolutely too low . " it 's too low because the aversion to equities could mean smaller profits for germans when they trade their investments in for cash .
regarded over the long-term , stocks have proven to bring in higher returns than any other type of investment , according to dai statistics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax reached all-time highs in mid-july and is currently up about 14 percent for the year " though it does not apply to every stock or every year , broad investments yield higher returns , " leven said , adding that the stock market averages annual returns of between 8 percent and 10 percent in the long term .
that 's about 2 percent higher than other investment options .
on average , 12 percent of europeans and 22 percent of americans put some of their savings into stocks .
at the same time , bonds and other investment options with guaranteed returns remain considerably more popular in germany , surveys by the nuremburg-based society for consumer research -lrb- gfk -rrb- have shown . about 44 percent of germans put at least some of their savings in bonds and accounts with guaranteed returns , and 42 percent of germans are not investing their money at all , according to a july gfk survey .
traditional interest since savings accounts and other forms of low-risk investment are most familiar to people in germany , many do not consider investing in equities or even know about all their options , according to matthias von arnim , an economics journalist and author of the book " erfolgreich mit aktien " -lrb- " successful with stocks " -rrb- .
" the money is basically there , but the knowledge is not , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do germans still see this as their best savings option ?
germans also tend to overestimate the amount of money they need to begin investing in stocks , leven said . the dai recommends investors have about 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 55,250 -rrb- in savings to invest directly in stocks .
investors with less are safer with other forms of investment , such as index funds , whose shares are broadly invested and can be purchased with smaller lump sums of money , leven said .
both von arnim and the dai 's leven emphasized that such returns only occur when money is invested for at least 10 years and that there is always some risk involved in buying stocks , though it is reduced by owning a wide variety of stock for a long period of time .
once bitten " over the short-term the stock market can change quickly , " von arnim said .
" it 's not the right place to try and make money quickly . "
viewing the stock market as a place to make a quick buck has left a bad taste in the mouths of many german investors , especially after the value of highly promoted stocks in deutsche telekom plummeted and the dot-com crash in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom shares closed at 13.07 euros on wednesday as a result , germans moved their money out of equities .
assets held in stocks dropped to about 8 percent in 2006 , down from 13.5 percent in 1999 , according to dai figures .
" some people definitely stopped enjoying stocks after the telekom crash , " von arnim said .
" i met people who sold their businesses and decided to make a living selling stocks .
they were ruined . "
crash as confirmation after going public in 1996 , deutsche telekom promoted itself to small , private investors , calling its shares " volksaktien , " or " people 's stocks . "
the campaign was a success , with 3 million people purchasing a part of the former monopoly .
they watched their shares ' value grow to over 100 euros each - and then fall to less than 10 euros in just over two years .
the losses were so serious that then-telekom ceo ron sommer was pushed out of his job for the shares ' poor performance .
in addition to annihilating shareholders ' savings , the telekom and dot-com crashes also affected germans who had not invested in stocks , leven said .
" the people who lost money were naturally put off stocks , " he said .
" and the people who did not lose anything felt confirmed that investing in stocks is very risky . " sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

frommert said telekom was committed to helping the sport earn back trust after a very difficult time , adding that the company maintained the right to ends its contract " immediately " if members of the team run by bob stapleton are found guilty of doping .
" we want to help restore faith in cycling , which we see as having hit a low mark , " frommert said .
" we are convinced that the people who want to change something should not run away from it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sinkewitz was just one of the high-profile riders involved in the 2007 doping scandals t-mobile 's continued sponsorship was thrown into question during this summer 's tour de france when t-mobile rider patrik sinkewitz 's blood sample tested positive for elevated levels of testosterone .
sinkewitz later admitted to have used a testosterone gel to enhance his performance .
he faces a two-year ban from the sport and has been kicked off the t-mobile team .
under the current name t-mobile or its predecessor telekom , the german telecommunications company has been a major cycling sponsor for 16 years .
the team claimed two tour de france victories with bjarne riis in 1996 and jan ullrich in 1997 .
both of the tour winners , however , were later implicated in doping scandals that led to the team being almost completely revamped and the implementation of a strict anti-doping policy last year .
germany 's gerolsteiner beverage company has said it would also re-evaluate its cycling sponsorship after the numerous doping allegations that have overshadowed the tour de france for the last two years .
the company is expected to make its decision public at the end of august . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

several writers have said they 'll boycott the world 's largest book fair . last year , the frankfurt book fair highlighted the literature and culture of india .
this year , it took the unusual step of turning to a region rather than a country , in this case catalonia in northeast spain .
originally , catalonia chose writers for the october book fair who write in catalan .
the decision caused outrage in spain 's insular literary world .
catalonia backtracked , inviting top spanish-language writers to come as well .
many have refused , the associated press reported .
they see the gesture as an insult prompted by political maneuvering .
language controversy erupts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india was the star at last year 's book fair language is a touchy subject in the spanish literary world .
during francisco franco 's 36-year dictatorship all other languages except spanish were considered officially illegal .
after franco 's death in 1975 , regional languages , including catalan , basque and galician , started reasserting their place in spanish culture .
spain 's myriad of languages leads to frequent cultural clashes .
take barcelona-born writer carlos ruiz-zafron .
while he was born in catalonia 's largest city , he writes in spanish .
ruiz-zafron , who wrote the international bestseller " the shadow of the wind , " has said he 'll boycott the frankfurt book fair .
he blamed the " sideshow " over the language issue on politicians who he said wanted to project a certain image of catalonia to please their supporters .
book fair organizers insist that , in the end , a wide range of catalan culture will be represented in frankfurt .
approximately 130 authors from the region have been invited . the book fair will run from oct .

"
as commissioner for scientology issues for hamburg , caberta is considered an expert on the subject . she has been observing the movement since 1992 and just presented her new book " schwarzbuch scientology " -lrb- the black book of scientology -rrb- this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula caberta along with udo nagel , hamburg state interior minister , caberta is also demanding a ban on the organization . " militant-aggressive " representatives of germany 's two main political parties - the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - have opposed a german ban of scientology , which was founded in the 1950s by science fiction author l. ron hubbard . politicians in berlin have said there is " no realistic chance " and that " there is not enough evidence " for such a prohibition . volker beck of the green party said a ban could only be pushed through if it could be proved that the scientology organization is trying to implement anti-constitutional aims through militant or aggressive means . conquering countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " brainwashing - no thanks , " reads the sign caberta , for her part , said she has no doubts that is the case , and pointed to scientology 's militaristic terminology . " according to scientologists , germany , france and belgium are oppressive countries which should be conquered , " she said . hollywood star and self-confessed scientologist tom cruise , she pointed out , received a medal for bravery . " those are normally only awarded for war activities , " she said . " scientology is dangerous because the methods sold by way of the brand name ' scientology ' are dangerous to customers ' health , " said ingo heinemann , spokesman for the federal association for information on sects .
" people can become psychologically dependent and their personal and family relationships can be destroyed as a result . " non-scientologists are denied human rights , he added . under observation whether these arguments should serve to have the organization prohibited , however , is controversial . germany 's domestic intelligence agency , at any rate , is keeping an eye on the organization in five of germany 's 16 states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise is currently in germany for a movie about the man who plotted to kill hitler in france , a legal suit to prohibit the organization has been underway for a year .
but , caberta said that has not deterred scientologists from trying to conduct missionary work in europe . since 2003 , scientology 's well-situated brussels office - located between the european commission and the european parliament buildings - has been pursuing one central goal : to get the organization recognized as an official religion across the european bloc . " during an internal event of the organization in 2006 , activists were required to pledge an oath to work towards a positive image of scientology within the media , " caberta said . marcus bösch -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 . the judge in the case referred to the state administrative court ruling in january about the planned autobahn route though a protected nature reserve in the eastern german city of halle an der saale , which set stricter standards on the protection of natural resources . this ultimately reversed the 2005 decision to build a bridge through the natural area . now conservationists need to see to what extent the tiny bat known as the lesser horseshoe bat , or rhinolophus hipposideros , would be affected by the bridge construction , and how it can be protected .
the bat is considered an endangered species . world heritage status at a meeting in new zealand in june , the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organization , unesco , had threatened to withdraw the world heritage site status held by the valley on the elbe as it passes through the city .
unesco placed the 20 kilometer long stretch of valley on a " red list " of endangered sites , angering local politicians .
the un body has never withdrawn world heritage site status .
georg milbradt , premier the state of saxony criticized the unesco threat as " lacking respect for democracy . "

the question today is how to integrate ancient traditions into contemporary society .
the people of papua new guinea are also trying to bridge the gap . the traditional dance of papua new guinea 's so-called " bonesmen " is only danced at very large festivals or if tourists pay for it .
the bright painted bodies , the spectacular feathers , the masks and the intricate bamboo skirts have long been replaced by a fashion known as " seconhandclos " in the local language .
tribes ’ people wear a combination of old clothes from the west .
but despite some changes , a pig is still a pig and a bigman is still a bigman , so long as he owns enough pigs .
if somebody wants to be a bigman , a chief or a village head , he has to produce at least five pigs .
" if a man has a pig , he is rich and people respect him , " one tribe member named daniel explained .
" if you have lots of pigs , you can also have lots of women .
even today , if you ca n't pay for the children 's school fees , you sell a pig .
pigs are very valuable and they define the status of a man . "
strict hierarchy the tribal hierarchy in papua new guinea is very strict - the tribe means everything and the individual nothing .
if a problem arises with one tribe member , then the whole tribe becomes implicated .
the system is called wantok - a pidginised version of the english words " one talk " .
the idea is that people communicate in the same language and defend themselves and the tribe against outside influences .
with thousands of different tribes and over eight hundred indigenous languages , there are often disputes and feuds in papua new guinea .
daniel described the pros and cons of wantok : " we 're used to relying on each other .
in emergencies or when you ca n't get enough money for the bride price before a marriage , there 's always someone to help .
but the wantok system has made us lazy because we can always rely on our tribe .
nobody works for his own well-being .
we 're dependent on each other .
however , things are changing - the churches are teaching people to change their way of life . "
christianity often combined with traditional beliefs and practices , christianity is the main religion of papua new guinea , where freedom of speech , thought and belief is protected by the constitution .
over 90 percent of people belong to a christian church and religious songs blare out from car radios .
the cross is omnipresent .
whether adventist , methodist , baptist , nazarene or quaker , free churches are firmly established on the island .
rudolf hertle , a missionary in papua new guinea , said that " religion determines everything " in the country : " new guineans are spiritual people .
when they go through the forest , they have all their spirits and their water - it 's all animate .
everything has a sense and its worth - nothing happens by chance .
so people are therefore highly religious - in everyday situations too .
because to be religious here means to be modern . "

the question today is how to integrate ancient traditions into contemporary society .
the people of papua new guinea are also trying to bridge the gap . the traditional dance of papua new guinea 's so-called " bonesmen " is only danced at very large festivals or if tourists pay for it .
the bright painted bodies , the spectacular feathers , the masks and the intricate bamboo skirts have long been replaced by a fashion known as " seconhandclos " in the local language .
tribes ’ people wear a combination of old clothes from the west .
but despite some changes , a pig is still a pig and a bigman is still a bigman , so long as he owns enough pigs .
if somebody wants to be a bigman , a chief or a village head , he has to produce at least five pigs .
" if a man has a pig , he is rich and people respect him , " one tribe member named daniel explained .
" if you have lots of pigs , you can also have lots of women .
even today , if you ca n't pay for the children 's school fees , you sell a pig .
pigs are very valuable and they define the status of a man . "
strict hierarchy the tribal hierarchy in papua new guinea is very strict - the tribe means everything and the individual nothing .
if a problem arises with one tribe member , then the whole tribe becomes implicated .
the system is called wantok - a pidginised version of the english words " one talk " .
the idea is that people communicate in the same language and defend themselves and the tribe against outside influences .
with thousands of different tribes and over eight hundred indigenous languages , there are often disputes and feuds in papua new guinea .
daniel described the pros and cons of wantok : " we 're used to relying on each other .
in emergencies or when you ca n't get enough money for the bride price before a marriage , there 's always someone to help .
but the wantok system has made us lazy because we can always rely on our tribe .
nobody works for his own well-being .
we 're dependent on each other .
however , things are changing - the churches are teaching people to change their way of life . "

"
as commissioner for scientology issues for hamburg , caberta is considered an expert on the subject . she has been observing the movement since 1992 and just presented her new book " schwarzbuch scientology " -lrb- the black book of scientology -rrb- this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula caberta along with udo nagel , hamburg state interior minister , caberta is also demanding a ban on the organization . " militant-aggressive " representatives of germany 's two main political parties - the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - have opposed a german ban of scientology , which was founded in the 1950s by science fiction author l. ron hubbard . politicians in berlin have said there is " no realistic chance " and that " there is not enough evidence " for such a prohibition . volker beck of the green party said a ban could only be pushed through if it could be proved that the scientology organization is trying to implement anti-constitutional aims through militant or aggressive means . conquering countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " brainwashing - no thanks , " reads the sign caberta , for her part , said she has no doubts that is the case , and pointed to scientology 's militaristic terminology . " according to scientologists , germany , france and belgium are oppressive countries which should be conquered , " she said . hollywood star and self-confessed scientologist tom cruise , she pointed out , received a medal for bravery . " those are normally only awarded for war activities , " she said . " scientology is dangerous because the methods sold by way of the brand name ' scientology ' are dangerous to customers ' health , " said ingo heinemann , spokesman for the federal association for information on sects .
" people can become psychologically dependent and their personal and family relationships can be destroyed as a result . " non-scientologists are denied human rights , he added . under observation whether these arguments should serve to have the organization prohibited , however , is controversial . germany 's domestic intelligence agency , at any rate , is keeping an eye on the organization in five of germany 's 16 states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise is currently in germany for a movie about the man who plotted to kill hitler in france , a legal suit to prohibit the organization has been underway for a year .
but , caberta said that has not deterred scientologists from trying to conduct missionary work in europe . since 2003 , scientology 's well-situated brussels office - located between the european commission and the european parliament buildings - has been pursuing one central goal : to get the organization recognized as an official religion across the european bloc . " during an internal event of the organization in 2006 , activists were required to pledge an oath to work towards a positive image of scientology within the media , " caberta said . marcus bösch -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" only 6.7 percent of germans invest in stocks , " leven said .

several writers have said they 'll boycott the world 's largest book fair . last year , the frankfurt book fair highlighted the literature and culture of india .
this year , it took the unusual step of turning to a region rather than a country , in this case catalonia in northeast spain .
originally , catalonia chose writers for the october book fair who write in catalan .
the decision caused outrage in spain 's insular literary world .
catalonia backtracked , inviting top spanish-language writers to come as well .
many have refused , the associated press reported .
they see the gesture as an insult prompted by political maneuvering .
language controversy erupts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india was the star at last year 's book fair language is a touchy subject in the spanish literary world .
during francisco franco 's 36-year dictatorship all other languages except spanish were considered officially illegal .
after franco 's death in 1975 , regional languages , including catalan , basque and galician , started reasserting their place in spanish culture .
spain 's myriad of languages leads to frequent cultural clashes .
take barcelona-born writer carlos ruiz-zafron .
while he was born in catalonia 's largest city , he writes in spanish .
ruiz-zafron , who wrote the international bestseller " the shadow of the wind , " has said he 'll boycott the frankfurt book fair .
he blamed the " sideshow " over the language issue on politicians who he said wanted to project a certain image of catalonia to please their supporters .
book fair organizers insist that , in the end , a wide range of catalan culture will be represented in frankfurt .
approximately 130 authors from the region have been invited . the book fair will run from oct .

"
as commissioner for scientology issues for hamburg , caberta is considered an expert on the subject . she has been observing the movement since 1992 and just presented her new book " schwarzbuch scientology " -lrb- the black book of scientology -rrb- this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula caberta along with udo nagel , hamburg state interior minister , caberta is also demanding a ban on the organization . " militant-aggressive " representatives of germany 's two main political parties - the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - have opposed a german ban of scientology , which was founded in the 1950s by science fiction author l. ron hubbard . politicians in berlin have said there is " no realistic chance " and that " there is not enough evidence " for such a prohibition . volker beck of the green party said a ban could only be pushed through if it could be proved that the scientology organization is trying to implement anti-constitutional aims through militant or aggressive means . conquering countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " brainwashing - no thanks , " reads the sign caberta , for her part , said she has no doubts that is the case , and pointed to scientology 's militaristic terminology . " according to scientologists , germany , france and belgium are oppressive countries which should be conquered , " she said . hollywood star and self-confessed scientologist tom cruise , she pointed out , received a medal for bravery . " those are normally only awarded for war activities , " she said . " scientology is dangerous because the methods sold by way of the brand name ' scientology ' are dangerous to customers ' health , " said ingo heinemann , spokesman for the federal association for information on sects .
" people can become psychologically dependent and their personal and family relationships can be destroyed as a result . " non-scientologists are denied human rights , he added . under observation whether these arguments should serve to have the organization prohibited , however , is controversial . germany 's domestic intelligence agency , at any rate , is keeping an eye on the organization in five of germany 's 16 states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise is currently in germany for a movie about the man who plotted to kill hitler in france , a legal suit to prohibit the organization has been underway for a year .
but , caberta said that has not deterred scientologists from trying to conduct missionary work in europe . since 2003 , scientology 's well-situated brussels office - located between the european commission and the european parliament buildings - has been pursuing one central goal : to get the organization recognized as an official religion across the european bloc . " during an internal event of the organization in 2006 , activists were required to pledge an oath to work towards a positive image of scientology within the media , " caberta said . marcus bösch -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

frommert said telekom was committed to helping the sport earn back trust after a very difficult time , adding that the company maintained the right to ends its contract " immediately " if members of the team run by bob stapleton are found guilty of doping .

sinkewitz later admitted to have used a testosterone gel to enhance his performance .
he faces a two-year ban from the sport and has been kicked off the t-mobile team .
under the current name t-mobile or its predecessor telekom , the german telecommunications company has been a major cycling sponsor for 16 years .
the team claimed two tour de france victories with bjarne riis in 1996 and jan ullrich in 1997 .
both of the tour winners , however , were later implicated in doping scandals that led to the team being almost completely revamped and the implementation of a strict anti-doping policy last year .
germany 's gerolsteiner beverage company has said it would also re-evaluate its cycling sponsorship after the numerous doping allegations that have overshadowed the tour de france for the last two years .

" initiating proceedings against the media merely in retaliation for their publishing , with the aim of deterring them from similar editorial decisions , is inadmissible in a society proud of its press freedoms , " osce media watchdog chief miklos haraszti said in a statement sent to the german justice ministry . " i call on the german authorities to stop prosecuting the journalists and ensure that media professionals can continue informing the public of important matters without intimidation . " ' more holes than swiss cheese ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : committee members could read more classified reports in the press than their official files the investigation was launched by siegfried kauder , a parliamentary leader in chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , who said the chancellery had threatened to deny information to a parliamentary committee charged with overseeing the bnd intelligence agency after journalists quoted from classified files . " all the sudden the investigatory committee had more holes than swiss cheese , " he told german public broadcaster ard last week .
" you could read more from the classified files in the press than we had in the committee . " the decision to conduct an investigation of the press sources met with approval from other cdu members , including jürgen gehb . " journalists should not be deemed sacrosanct , " he told the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger on thursday , adding that investigators were right to use all the powers at their disposal to expose leaks of the classified reports . opposition : press deserve protection german opposition parties as well as some members of merkel 's grand coalition have , however , complained that the investigation violates press freedom by targeting journalists instead of the people giving files to the press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bill proposed for the autumn would protect journalists from leak investigations wolfgang thierse , vice-president of the german bundestag and a member of the social democratic party , called thursday for increased legal protection for the press to be enacted in germany to " slow down hasty investigations and brash prosecutors , " he told the daily berliner zeitung . max stadler , member of the free-market liberal fdp , said thursday that his party planned to introduce a bill in parliament after the summer break that would exclude the press from investigations into government security leaks . " it is not right to start criminal investigations into journalists who have a duty to provide information to the public and are not subject to security clearance regulations , " he told reporters in berlin . in a similar case decided in february , germany 's constitutional court ruled against prosecutors who confiscated information from the monthly magazine cicero in an attempt to track down who leaked the classified data that was printed in the magazine . the court said raids against the press to investigate government leaks were unconstitutional . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after five years and more than 50 matches of italian cooking , a german is taking over in the kitchen . though soccer players for the german national team have threatened to quit if they ca n't wear the shoes they want , they are n't that picky when it comes to what 's on their plates .
" they all like italian food the best , " team cook saverio pugliese told the the stuttgarter zeitung .
fish , meat and pasta - easy on the sauce - were among the team 's favorite foods , he said .
pugliese , who was responsible for making sure german coach joachim löw 's players got the 3,000 to 3,500 calories they needed for peak performance for two months straight during last summer 's world cup , said he had decided to hang up his black , red and gold spaghetti spoon after five years with the team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another victory , now it 's chow time " that was the highpoint of my life , " pugliese said of the world cup .
" i could n't have dreamed of anything better . "
originally from calabria , at the bottom of the italian boot , pugliese immigrated to germany when he was 17 and by chance opened his own restaurant near the headquarters of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
obviously pleased with a meal he enjoyed at pugliese 's alten haferkasten eatery , then-team coach rudi völler asked the lifelong soccer fan if he 'd whip something up for the national team before its next match .
over the ensuing years , ravenous german players came to love pugliese 's cooking .
" there were some players who , days ahead of time , would look forward to joining the national team just for the food , " he said .
starting with the germany-england friendly on aug .
22 , it will be up to bavaria 's holger stromberg to fill pugliese 's shoes and the national team players ' stomachs .
pugliese has said he intends to use the time freed up by not having to cook for a team of top-notch athletes concentrating on his own restaurant and taking more vacations . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , 2008 , even though the eu 's 22 other countries wo n't be required to do the same until 2011 .
this means that starting in 2008 , finland 's postal system , for example , can expand into germany , where the finnish companies can concentrate on lucrative big-city markets .
while facing competition from abroad in the cities , deutsche post will also be left to deliver mail to german rural regions - a costlier and more difficult service to provide .
if deutsche post wants to deliver mail in finland , however , it will be obliged to fork over 20 percent of its turnover to the finnish state .
it is that kind of scenario , what deutsche post calls a very uneven playing field , that is causing an uproar at the former mail monopoly .
the german mail carrier has a legal obligation to provide universal service , covering routes that are money making as well as those that are not .
liberalization woes even more troublesome are competing mail services within germany , which pay their mail carriers lower wages than deutsche post , that company 's ceo klaus zumwinkel said as he lashed out at eu rules to liberalize postal services , which he called " a true mess . "

the latest plan allows competition for letters weighing less than 50 grams .

britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden have already opened their postal markets to competition .
lawmakers see bonus for consumers the eu has predicted that customers will notice few of the changes .
however , lawmakers believe new competitors are likely to try to distinguish themselves from existing state-controlled post offices with lower costs and special services .
since the partial break up of the german postal monopoly in 1998 , germany 's governing post and telecommunications body has granted some 1,000 business licenses for delivering mail . unlike employees at deutsche post , the mail carriers for these start-ups are often part-time or temporary workers , who do n't enjoy the job security or compensation rates of deutsche post employees .
deutsche post pays its mail carriers a basic 10.14 euros -lrb- $ 13.87 -rrb- per hour , while the competition pays around 5.90 euros in the east and 7 euros per hour in the west of the country .
on top of that , more and more postal services only pay their mail carriers for mail delivered .
this means that in periods of low demand , the welfare office steps in to fill the gaps .
fear of job losses " it can not be the case that steady jobs with social benefits are lost because of the pressure from this kind of competition , " zumwinkel said , adding that some 32,000 jobs are endangered at deutsche post .

he faces a two-year ban from the sport and has been kicked off the t-mobile team .
under the current name t-mobile or its predecessor telekom , the german telecommunications company has been a major cycling sponsor for 16 years .
the team claimed two tour de france victories with bjarne riis in 1996 and jan ullrich in 1997 .
both of the tour winners , however , were later implicated in doping scandals that led to the team being almost completely revamped and the implementation of a strict anti-doping policy last year .

frommert said telekom was committed to helping the sport earn back trust after a very difficult time , adding that the company maintained the right to ends its contract " immediately " if members of the team run by bob stapleton are found guilty of doping .
" we want to help restore faith in cycling , which we see as having hit a low mark , " frommert said .

sinkewitz later admitted to have used a testosterone gel to enhance his performance .
he faces a two-year ban from the sport and has been kicked off the t-mobile team .
under the current name t-mobile or its predecessor telekom , the german telecommunications company has been a major cycling sponsor for 16 years .
the team claimed two tour de france victories with bjarne riis in 1996 and jan ullrich in 1997 .
both of the tour winners , however , were later implicated in doping scandals that led to the team being almost completely revamped and the implementation of a strict anti-doping policy last year .
germany 's gerolsteiner beverage company has said it would also re-evaluate its cycling sponsorship after the numerous doping allegations that have overshadowed the tour de france for the last two years .
the company is expected to make its decision public at the end of august . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
as commissioner for scientology issues for hamburg , caberta is considered an expert on the subject . she has been observing the movement since 1992 and just presented her new book " schwarzbuch scientology " -lrb- the black book of scientology -rrb- this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula caberta along with udo nagel , hamburg state interior minister , caberta is also demanding a ban on the organization . " militant-aggressive " representatives of germany 's two main political parties - the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - have opposed a german ban of scientology , which was founded in the 1950s by science fiction author l. ron hubbard . politicians in berlin have said there is " no realistic chance " and that " there is not enough evidence " for such a prohibition . volker beck of the green party said a ban could only be pushed through if it could be proved that the scientology organization is trying to implement anti-constitutional aims through militant or aggressive means . conquering countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " brainwashing - no thanks , " reads the sign caberta , for her part , said she has no doubts that is the case , and pointed to scientology 's militaristic terminology . " according to scientologists , germany , france and belgium are oppressive countries which should be conquered , " she said . hollywood star and self-confessed scientologist tom cruise , she pointed out , received a medal for bravery . " those are normally only awarded for war activities , " she said . " scientology is dangerous because the methods sold by way of the brand name ' scientology ' are dangerous to customers ' health , " said ingo heinemann , spokesman for the federal association for information on sects .
" people can become psychologically dependent and their personal and family relationships can be destroyed as a result . " non-scientologists are denied human rights , he added . under observation whether these arguments should serve to have the organization prohibited , however , is controversial . germany 's domestic intelligence agency , at any rate , is keeping an eye on the organization in five of germany 's 16 states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise is currently in germany for a movie about the man who plotted to kill hitler in france , a legal suit to prohibit the organization has been underway for a year .
but , caberta said that has not deterred scientologists from trying to conduct missionary work in europe . since 2003 , scientology 's well-situated brussels office - located between the european commission and the european parliament buildings - has been pursuing one central goal : to get the organization recognized as an official religion across the european bloc . " during an internal event of the organization in 2006 , activists were required to pledge an oath to work towards a positive image of scientology within the media , " caberta said . marcus bösch -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" militant-aggressive " representatives of germany 's two main political parties - the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - have opposed a german ban of scientology , which was founded in the 1950s by science fiction author l. ron hubbard . politicians in berlin have said there is " no realistic chance " and that " there is not enough evidence " for such a prohibition . volker beck of the green party said a ban could only be pushed through if it could be proved that the scientology organization is trying to implement anti-constitutional aims through militant or aggressive means . conquering countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " brainwashing - no thanks , " reads the sign caberta , for her part , said she has no doubts that is the case , and pointed to scientology 's militaristic terminology . " according to scientologists , germany , france and belgium are oppressive countries which should be conquered , " she said . hollywood star and self-confessed scientologist tom cruise , she pointed out , received a medal for bravery . " those are normally only awarded for war activities , " she said . " scientology is dangerous because the methods sold by way of the brand name ' scientology ' are dangerous to customers ' health , " said ingo heinemann , spokesman for the federal association for information on sects .
" people can become psychologically dependent and their personal and family relationships can be destroyed as a result . " non-scientologists are denied human rights , he added . under observation whether these arguments should serve to have the organization prohibited , however , is controversial . germany 's domestic intelligence agency , at any rate , is keeping an eye on the organization in five of germany 's 16 states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise is currently in germany for a movie about the man who plotted to kill hitler in france , a legal suit to prohibit the organization has been underway for a year .
but , caberta said that has not deterred scientologists from trying to conduct missionary work in europe . since 2003 , scientology 's well-situated brussels office - located between the european commission and the european parliament buildings - has been pursuing one central goal : to get the organization recognized as an official religion across the european bloc . " during an internal event of the organization in 2006 , activists were required to pledge an oath to work towards a positive image of scientology within the media , " caberta said . marcus bösch -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but deutsche post says it faces a less-than-level playing field and unfair competition on the open market . the eu said germany and four other countries have to fully open up their markets to national and international competition on jan .
1 , 2008 , even though the eu 's 22 other countries wo n't be required to do the same until 2011 .
this means that starting in 2008 , finland 's postal system , for example , can expand into germany , where the finnish companies can concentrate on lucrative big-city markets .
while facing competition from abroad in the cities , deutsche post will also be left to deliver mail to german rural regions - a costlier and more difficult service to provide .
if deutsche post wants to deliver mail in finland , however , it will be obliged to fork over 20 percent of its turnover to the finnish state .
it is that kind of scenario , what deutsche post calls a very uneven playing field , that is causing an uproar at the former mail monopoly .
the german mail carrier has a legal obligation to provide universal service , covering routes that are money making as well as those that are not .
liberalization woes even more troublesome are competing mail services within germany , which pay their mail carriers lower wages than deutsche post , that company 's ceo klaus zumwinkel said as he lashed out at eu rules to liberalize postal services , which he called " a true mess . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post ceo klaus zumwinkel says he will fight alongside his employees the european postal sector was opened to competition a decade ago for the delivery of packages weighing more than 350 grams -lrb- 12 ounces -rrb- .
in 2003 , the measure was extended to items of more than 100 grams and in 2006 , to letters weighing more than 50 grams .
the latest plan allows competition for letters weighing less than 50 grams .
in july , european lawmakers voted in favor of deregulating the eu market for letter delivery from 2011 , two years later than a proposal from the european commission .
britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden have already opened their postal markets to competition .
lawmakers see bonus for consumers the eu has predicted that customers will notice few of the changes .
however , lawmakers believe new competitors are likely to try to distinguish themselves from existing state-controlled post offices with lower costs and special services .
since the partial break up of the german postal monopoly in 1998 , germany 's governing post and telecommunications body has granted some 1,000 business licenses for delivering mail . unlike employees at deutsche post , the mail carriers for these start-ups are often part-time or temporary workers , who do n't enjoy the job security or compensation rates of deutsche post employees .
deutsche post pays its mail carriers a basic 10.14 euros -lrb- $ 13.87 -rrb- per hour , while the competition pays around 5.90 euros in the east and 7 euros per hour in the west of the country .
on top of that , more and more postal services only pay their mail carriers for mail delivered .
this means that in periods of low demand , the welfare office steps in to fill the gaps .
fear of job losses " it can not be the case that steady jobs with social benefits are lost because of the pressure from this kind of competition , " zumwinkel said , adding that some 32,000 jobs are endangered at deutsche post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some new carriers pay per piece of mail delivered zumwinkel has said the postal service should be covered by the temporary personnel assignment act , passed in 1996 to prevent foreign companies from importing labor to germany at below-market wages .
he said a minimum wage should be set for the sector .
deutsche post is also seeking a permanent exemption from paying value-added tax .
it currently does not pay the tax because of its universal service obligation .
on that point , the competition says the exemption gives the former monopolist its own bit of an unfair advantage .
but zumwinkel insisted that given the disadvantages he says deutsche post faces , political action needs to take place soon .

but deutsche post says it faces a less-than-level playing field and unfair competition on the open market . the eu said germany and four other countries have to fully open up their markets to national and international competition on jan .
1 , 2008 , even though the eu 's 22 other countries wo n't be required to do the same until 2011 .
this means that starting in 2008 , finland 's postal system , for example , can expand into germany , where the finnish companies can concentrate on lucrative big-city markets .
while facing competition from abroad in the cities , deutsche post will also be left to deliver mail to german rural regions - a costlier and more difficult service to provide .
if deutsche post wants to deliver mail in finland , however , it will be obliged to fork over 20 percent of its turnover to the finnish state .
it is that kind of scenario , what deutsche post calls a very uneven playing field , that is causing an uproar at the former mail monopoly .
the german mail carrier has a legal obligation to provide universal service , covering routes that are money making as well as those that are not .
liberalization woes even more troublesome are competing mail services within germany , which pay their mail carriers lower wages than deutsche post , that company 's ceo klaus zumwinkel said as he lashed out at eu rules to liberalize postal services , which he called " a true mess . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post ceo klaus zumwinkel says he will fight alongside his employees the european postal sector was opened to competition a decade ago for the delivery of packages weighing more than 350 grams -lrb- 12 ounces -rrb- .
in 2003 , the measure was extended to items of more than 100 grams and in 2006 , to letters weighing more than 50 grams .
the latest plan allows competition for letters weighing less than 50 grams .
in july , european lawmakers voted in favor of deregulating the eu market for letter delivery from 2011 , two years later than a proposal from the european commission .
britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden have already opened their postal markets to competition .
lawmakers see bonus for consumers the eu has predicted that customers will notice few of the changes .
however , lawmakers believe new competitors are likely to try to distinguish themselves from existing state-controlled post offices with lower costs and special services .
since the partial break up of the german postal monopoly in 1998 , germany 's governing post and telecommunications body has granted some 1,000 business licenses for delivering mail . unlike employees at deutsche post , the mail carriers for these start-ups are often part-time or temporary workers , who do n't enjoy the job security or compensation rates of deutsche post employees .
deutsche post pays its mail carriers a basic 10.14 euros -lrb- $ 13.87 -rrb- per hour , while the competition pays around 5.90 euros in the east and 7 euros per hour in the west of the country .
on top of that , more and more postal services only pay their mail carriers for mail delivered .
this means that in periods of low demand , the welfare office steps in to fill the gaps .
fear of job losses " it can not be the case that steady jobs with social benefits are lost because of the pressure from this kind of competition , " zumwinkel said , adding that some 32,000 jobs are endangered at deutsche post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some new carriers pay per piece of mail delivered zumwinkel has said the postal service should be covered by the temporary personnel assignment act , passed in 1996 to prevent foreign companies from importing labor to germany at below-market wages .
he said a minimum wage should be set for the sector .
deutsche post is also seeking a permanent exemption from paying value-added tax .
it currently does not pay the tax because of its universal service obligation .
on that point , the competition says the exemption gives the former monopolist its own bit of an unfair advantage .
but zumwinkel insisted that given the disadvantages he says deutsche post faces , political action needs to take place soon .
" you can imagine that my employees are at the barricades , " zumwinkel said .

after five years and more than 50 matches of italian cooking , a german is taking over in the kitchen . though soccer players for the german national team have threatened to quit if they ca n't wear the shoes they want , they are n't that picky when it comes to what 's on their plates .

fish , meat and pasta - easy on the sauce - were among the team 's favorite foods , he said .
pugliese , who was responsible for making sure german coach joachim löw 's players got the 3,000 to 3,500 calories they needed for peak performance for two months straight during last summer 's world cup , said he had decided to hang up his black , red and gold spaghetti spoon after five years with the team .

over the ensuing years , ravenous german players came to love pugliese 's cooking .
" there were some players who , days ahead of time , would look forward to joining the national team just for the food , " he said .
starting with the germany-england friendly on aug .
22 , it will be up to bavaria 's holger stromberg to fill pugliese 's shoes and the national team players ' stomachs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de investment -pipe- 09.08.2007 germans wary of stock market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are n't rushing to buy equities at the frankfurt stock exchange despite recent german market highs and the possibility to earn greater returns on their savings , germans continue to see stocks as high-risk investments and avoid them in favor of other options with guaranteed returns . the risk of stock investing and not having a guarantee of how much of a return an investment will yield is a central reason why germans tend to avoid stocks , according to franz-josef leven of the deutsches aktieninstitut -lrb- german equities institute , dai -rrb- .
" only 6.7 percent of germans invest in stocks , " leven said .
" that is absolutely too low . " it 's too low because the aversion to equities could mean smaller profits for germans when they trade their investments in for cash .
regarded over the long-term , stocks have proven to bring in higher returns than any other type of investment , according to dai statistics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax reached all-time highs in mid-july and is currently up about 14 percent for the year " though it does not apply to every stock or every year , broad investments yield higher returns , " leven said , adding that the stock market averages annual returns of between 8 percent and 10 percent in the long term .
that 's about 2 percent higher than other investment options .
on average , 12 percent of europeans and 22 percent of americans put some of their savings into stocks .
at the same time , bonds and other investment options with guaranteed returns remain considerably more popular in germany , surveys by the nuremburg-based society for consumer research -lrb- gfk -rrb- have shown . about 44 percent of germans put at least some of their savings in bonds and accounts with guaranteed returns , and 42 percent of germans are not investing their money at all , according to a july gfk survey .
traditional interest since savings accounts and other forms of low-risk investment are most familiar to people in germany , many do not consider investing in equities or even know about all their options , according to matthias von arnim , an economics journalist and author of the book " erfolgreich mit aktien " -lrb- " successful with stocks " -rrb- .
" the money is basically there , but the knowledge is not , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do germans still see this as their best savings option ?
germans also tend to overestimate the amount of money they need to begin investing in stocks , leven said . the dai recommends investors have about 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 55,250 -rrb- in savings to invest directly in stocks .
investors with less are safer with other forms of investment , such as index funds , whose shares are broadly invested and can be purchased with smaller lump sums of money , leven said .
both von arnim and the dai 's leven emphasized that such returns only occur when money is invested for at least 10 years and that there is always some risk involved in buying stocks , though it is reduced by owning a wide variety of stock for a long period of time .
once bitten " over the short-term the stock market can change quickly , " von arnim said .
" it 's not the right place to try and make money quickly . "
viewing the stock market as a place to make a quick buck has left a bad taste in the mouths of many german investors , especially after the value of highly promoted stocks in deutsche telekom plummeted and the dot-com crash in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom shares closed at 13.07 euros on wednesday as a result , germans moved their money out of equities .
assets held in stocks dropped to about 8 percent in 2006 , down from 13.5 percent in 1999 , according to dai figures .
" some people definitely stopped enjoying stocks after the telekom crash , " von arnim said .
" i met people who sold their businesses and decided to make a living selling stocks .
they were ruined . "
crash as confirmation after going public in 1996 , deutsche telekom promoted itself to small , private investors , calling its shares " volksaktien , " or " people 's stocks . "
the campaign was a success , with 3 million people purchasing a part of the former monopoly .
they watched their shares ' value grow to over 100 euros each - and then fall to less than 10 euros in just over two years .
the losses were so serious that then-telekom ceo ron sommer was pushed out of his job for the shares ' poor performance .
in addition to annihilating shareholders ' savings , the telekom and dot-com crashes also affected germans who had not invested in stocks , leven said .
" the people who lost money were naturally put off stocks , " he said .
" and the people who did not lose anything felt confirmed that investing in stocks is very risky . " sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de investment -pipe- 09.08.2007 germans wary of stock market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are n't rushing to buy equities at the frankfurt stock exchange despite recent german market highs and the possibility to earn greater returns on their savings , germans continue to see stocks as high-risk investments and avoid them in favor of other options with guaranteed returns . the risk of stock investing and not having a guarantee of how much of a return an investment will yield is a central reason why germans tend to avoid stocks , according to franz-josef leven of the deutsches aktieninstitut -lrb- german equities institute , dai -rrb- .
" only 6.7 percent of germans invest in stocks , " leven said .
" that is absolutely too low . " it 's too low because the aversion to equities could mean smaller profits for germans when they trade their investments in for cash .
regarded over the long-term , stocks have proven to bring in higher returns than any other type of investment , according to dai statistics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax reached all-time highs in mid-july and is currently up about 14 percent for the year " though it does not apply to every stock or every year , broad investments yield higher returns , " leven said , adding that the stock market averages annual returns of between 8 percent and 10 percent in the long term .
that 's about 2 percent higher than other investment options .
on average , 12 percent of europeans and 22 percent of americans put some of their savings into stocks .
at the same time , bonds and other investment options with guaranteed returns remain considerably more popular in germany , surveys by the nuremburg-based society for consumer research -lrb- gfk -rrb- have shown . about 44 percent of germans put at least some of their savings in bonds and accounts with guaranteed returns , and 42 percent of germans are not investing their money at all , according to a july gfk survey .
traditional interest since savings accounts and other forms of low-risk investment are most familiar to people in germany , many do not consider investing in equities or even know about all their options , according to matthias von arnim , an economics journalist and author of the book " erfolgreich mit aktien " -lrb- " successful with stocks " -rrb- .
" the money is basically there , but the knowledge is not , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do germans still see this as their best savings option ?
germans also tend to overestimate the amount of money they need to begin investing in stocks , leven said . the dai recommends investors have about 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 55,250 -rrb- in savings to invest directly in stocks .
investors with less are safer with other forms of investment , such as index funds , whose shares are broadly invested and can be purchased with smaller lump sums of money , leven said .
both von arnim and the dai 's leven emphasized that such returns only occur when money is invested for at least 10 years and that there is always some risk involved in buying stocks , though it is reduced by owning a wide variety of stock for a long period of time .
once bitten " over the short-term the stock market can change quickly , " von arnim said .
" it 's not the right place to try and make money quickly . "
viewing the stock market as a place to make a quick buck has left a bad taste in the mouths of many german investors , especially after the value of highly promoted stocks in deutsche telekom plummeted and the dot-com crash in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom shares closed at 13.07 euros on wednesday as a result , germans moved their money out of equities .
assets held in stocks dropped to about 8 percent in 2006 , down from 13.5 percent in 1999 , according to dai figures .
" some people definitely stopped enjoying stocks after the telekom crash , " von arnim said .
" i met people who sold their businesses and decided to make a living selling stocks .
they were ruined . "
crash as confirmation after going public in 1996 , deutsche telekom promoted itself to small , private investors , calling its shares " volksaktien , " or " people 's stocks . "
the campaign was a success , with 3 million people purchasing a part of the former monopoly .
they watched their shares ' value grow to over 100 euros each - and then fall to less than 10 euros in just over two years .
the losses were so serious that then-telekom ceo ron sommer was pushed out of his job for the shares ' poor performance .
in addition to annihilating shareholders ' savings , the telekom and dot-com crashes also affected germans who had not invested in stocks , leven said .
" the people who lost money were naturally put off stocks , " he said .
" and the people who did not lose anything felt confirmed that investing in stocks is very risky . " sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" only 6.7 percent of germans invest in stocks , " leven said .
" that is absolutely too low . " it 's too low because the aversion to equities could mean smaller profits for germans when they trade their investments in for cash .
regarded over the long-term , stocks have proven to bring in higher returns than any other type of investment , according to dai statistics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax reached all-time highs in mid-july and is currently up about 14 percent for the year " though it does not apply to every stock or every year , broad investments yield higher returns , " leven said , adding that the stock market averages annual returns of between 8 percent and 10 percent in the long term .
that 's about 2 percent higher than other investment options .
on average , 12 percent of europeans and 22 percent of americans put some of their savings into stocks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 09.08.2007 being modern in papua new guinea großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papua new guinea is almost 100 % christian and there are missionaries from all over the world 9 august marks the un international day of the world ’ s indigenous people .
the question today is how to integrate ancient traditions into contemporary society .
the people of papua new guinea are also trying to bridge the gap . the traditional dance of papua new guinea 's so-called " bonesmen " is only danced at very large festivals or if tourists pay for it .
the bright painted bodies , the spectacular feathers , the masks and the intricate bamboo skirts have long been replaced by a fashion known as " seconhandclos " in the local language .
tribes ’ people wear a combination of old clothes from the west .
but despite some changes , a pig is still a pig and a bigman is still a bigman , so long as he owns enough pigs .
if somebody wants to be a bigman , a chief or a village head , he has to produce at least five pigs .
" if a man has a pig , he is rich and people respect him , " one tribe member named daniel explained .
" if you have lots of pigs , you can also have lots of women .
even today , if you ca n't pay for the children 's school fees , you sell a pig .
pigs are very valuable and they define the status of a man . "
strict hierarchy the tribal hierarchy in papua new guinea is very strict - the tribe means everything and the individual nothing .
if a problem arises with one tribe member , then the whole tribe becomes implicated .
the system is called wantok - a pidginised version of the english words " one talk " .
the idea is that people communicate in the same language and defend themselves and the tribe against outside influences .
with thousands of different tribes and over eight hundred indigenous languages , there are often disputes and feuds in papua new guinea .
daniel described the pros and cons of wantok : " we 're used to relying on each other .
in emergencies or when you ca n't get enough money for the bride price before a marriage , there 's always someone to help .
but the wantok system has made us lazy because we can always rely on our tribe .
nobody works for his own well-being .
we 're dependent on each other .
however , things are changing - the churches are teaching people to change their way of life . "
christianity often combined with traditional beliefs and practices , christianity is the main religion of papua new guinea , where freedom of speech , thought and belief is protected by the constitution .
over 90 percent of people belong to a christian church and religious songs blare out from car radios .
the cross is omnipresent .
whether adventist , methodist , baptist , nazarene or quaker , free churches are firmly established on the island .
rudolf hertle , a missionary in papua new guinea , said that " religion determines everything " in the country : " new guineans are spiritual people .
when they go through the forest , they have all their spirits and their water - it 's all animate .
everything has a sense and its worth - nothing happens by chance .
so people are therefore highly religious - in everyday situations too .
because to be religious here means to be modern . "

"
as commissioner for scientology issues for hamburg , caberta is considered an expert on the subject . she has been observing the movement since 1992 and just presented her new book " schwarzbuch scientology " -lrb- the black book of scientology -rrb- this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula caberta along with udo nagel , hamburg state interior minister , caberta is also demanding a ban on the organization . " militant-aggressive " representatives of germany 's two main political parties - the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - have opposed a german ban of scientology , which was founded in the 1950s by science fiction author l. ron hubbard . politicians in berlin have said there is " no realistic chance " and that " there is not enough evidence " for such a prohibition . volker beck of the green party said a ban could only be pushed through if it could be proved that the scientology organization is trying to implement anti-constitutional aims through militant or aggressive means . conquering countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " brainwashing - no thanks , " reads the sign caberta , for her part , said she has no doubts that is the case , and pointed to scientology 's militaristic terminology .

" those are normally only awarded for war activities , " she said . " scientology is dangerous because the methods sold by way of the brand name ' scientology ' are dangerous to customers ' health , " said ingo heinemann , spokesman for the federal association for information on sects .
" people can become psychologically dependent and their personal and family relationships can be destroyed as a result . " non-scientologists are denied human rights , he added . under observation whether these arguments should serve to have the organization prohibited , however , is controversial . germany 's domestic intelligence agency , at any rate , is keeping an eye on the organization in five of germany 's 16 states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise is currently in germany for a movie about the man who plotted to kill hitler in france , a legal suit to prohibit the organization has been underway for a year .
but , caberta said that has not deterred scientologists from trying to conduct missionary work in europe . since 2003 , scientology 's well-situated brussels office - located between the european commission and the european parliament buildings - has been pursuing one central goal : to get the organization recognized as an official religion across the european bloc .

" militant-aggressive " representatives of germany 's two main political parties - the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - have opposed a german ban of scientology , which was founded in the 1950s by science fiction author l. ron hubbard . politicians in berlin have said there is " no realistic chance " and that " there is not enough evidence " for such a prohibition . volker beck of the green party said a ban could only be pushed through if it could be proved that the scientology organization is trying to implement anti-constitutional aims through militant or aggressive means . conquering countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " brainwashing - no thanks , " reads the sign caberta , for her part , said she has no doubts that is the case , and pointed to scientology 's militaristic terminology . " according to scientologists , germany , france and belgium are oppressive countries which should be conquered , " she said . hollywood star and self-confessed scientologist tom cruise , she pointed out , received a medal for bravery . " those are normally only awarded for war activities , " she said . " scientology is dangerous because the methods sold by way of the brand name ' scientology ' are dangerous to customers ' health , " said ingo heinemann , spokesman for the federal association for information on sects .
" people can become psychologically dependent and their personal and family relationships can be destroyed as a result . " non-scientologists are denied human rights , he added . under observation whether these arguments should serve to have the organization prohibited , however , is controversial . germany 's domestic intelligence agency , at any rate , is keeping an eye on the organization in five of germany 's 16 states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise is currently in germany for a movie about the man who plotted to kill hitler in france , a legal suit to prohibit the organization has been underway for a year .
but , caberta said that has not deterred scientologists from trying to conduct missionary work in europe . since 2003 , scientology 's well-situated brussels office - located between the european commission and the european parliament buildings - has been pursuing one central goal : to get the organization recognized as an official religion across the european bloc . " during an internal event of the organization in 2006 , activists were required to pledge an oath to work towards a positive image of scientology within the media , " caberta said . marcus bösch -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
as commissioner for scientology issues for hamburg , caberta is considered an expert on the subject . she has been observing the movement since 1992 and just presented her new book " schwarzbuch scientology " -lrb- the black book of scientology -rrb- this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula caberta along with udo nagel , hamburg state interior minister , caberta is also demanding a ban on the organization . " militant-aggressive " representatives of germany 's two main political parties - the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - have opposed a german ban of scientology , which was founded in the 1950s by science fiction author l. ron hubbard . politicians in berlin have said there is " no realistic chance " and that " there is not enough evidence " for such a prohibition . volker beck of the green party said a ban could only be pushed through if it could be proved that the scientology organization is trying to implement anti-constitutional aims through militant or aggressive means . conquering countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " brainwashing - no thanks , " reads the sign caberta , for her part , said she has no doubts that is the case , and pointed to scientology 's militaristic terminology .

" those are normally only awarded for war activities , " she said . " scientology is dangerous because the methods sold by way of the brand name ' scientology ' are dangerous to customers ' health , " said ingo heinemann , spokesman for the federal association for information on sects .
" people can become psychologically dependent and their personal and family relationships can be destroyed as a result . " non-scientologists are denied human rights , he added . under observation whether these arguments should serve to have the organization prohibited , however , is controversial . germany 's domestic intelligence agency , at any rate , is keeping an eye on the organization in five of germany 's 16 states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise is currently in germany for a movie about the man who plotted to kill hitler in france , a legal suit to prohibit the organization has been underway for a year .
but , caberta said that has not deterred scientologists from trying to conduct missionary work in europe . since 2003 , scientology 's well-situated brussels office - located between the european commission and the european parliament buildings - has been pursuing one central goal : to get the organization recognized as an official religion across the european bloc . " during an internal event of the organization in 2006 , activists were required to pledge an oath to work towards a positive image of scientology within the media , " caberta said . marcus bösch -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 . the judge in the case referred to the state administrative court ruling in january about the planned autobahn route though a protected nature reserve in the eastern german city of halle an der saale , which set stricter standards on the protection of natural resources . this ultimately reversed the 2005 decision to build a bridge through the natural area . now conservationists need to see to what extent the tiny bat known as the lesser horseshoe bat , or rhinolophus hipposideros , would be affected by the bridge construction , and how it can be protected .
the bat is considered an endangered species . world heritage status at a meeting in new zealand in june , the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organization , unesco , had threatened to withdraw the world heritage site status held by the valley on the elbe as it passes through the city .
unesco placed the 20 kilometer long stretch of valley on a " red list " of endangered sites , angering local politicians .
the un body has never withdrawn world heritage site status .
georg milbradt , premier the state of saxony criticized the unesco threat as " lacking respect for democracy . "
residents of dresden , the capital of saxony , voted for the bridge to relieve road congestion in a 2005 referendum . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

several writers have said they 'll boycott the world 's largest book fair . last year , the frankfurt book fair highlighted the literature and culture of india .
this year , it took the unusual step of turning to a region rather than a country , in this case catalonia in northeast spain .
originally , catalonia chose writers for the october book fair who write in catalan .
the decision caused outrage in spain 's insular literary world .
catalonia backtracked , inviting top spanish-language writers to come as well .
many have refused , the associated press reported .
they see the gesture as an insult prompted by political maneuvering .
language controversy erupts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india was the star at last year 's book fair language is a touchy subject in the spanish literary world .
during francisco franco 's 36-year dictatorship all other languages except spanish were considered officially illegal .
after franco 's death in 1975 , regional languages , including catalan , basque and galician , started reasserting their place in spanish culture .
spain 's myriad of languages leads to frequent cultural clashes .

" initiating proceedings against the media merely in retaliation for their publishing , with the aim of deterring them from similar editorial decisions , is inadmissible in a society proud of its press freedoms , " osce media watchdog chief miklos haraszti said in a statement sent to the german justice ministry . " i call on the german authorities to stop prosecuting the journalists and ensure that media professionals can continue informing the public of important matters without intimidation . " ' more holes than swiss cheese ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : committee members could read more classified reports in the press than their official files the investigation was launched by siegfried kauder , a parliamentary leader in chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , who said the chancellery had threatened to deny information to a parliamentary committee charged with overseeing the bnd intelligence agency after journalists quoted from classified files . " all the sudden the investigatory committee had more holes than swiss cheese , " he told german public broadcaster ard last week .
" you could read more from the classified files in the press than we had in the committee . " the decision to conduct an investigation of the press sources met with approval from other cdu members , including jürgen gehb . " journalists should not be deemed sacrosanct , " he told the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger on thursday , adding that investigators were right to use all the powers at their disposal to expose leaks of the classified reports . opposition : press deserve protection german opposition parties as well as some members of merkel 's grand coalition have , however , complained that the investigation violates press freedom by targeting journalists instead of the people giving files to the press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bill proposed for the autumn would protect journalists from leak investigations wolfgang thierse , vice-president of the german bundestag and a member of the social democratic party , called thursday for increased legal protection for the press to be enacted in germany to " slow down hasty investigations and brash prosecutors , " he told the daily berliner zeitung . max stadler , member of the free-market liberal fdp , said thursday that his party planned to introduce a bill in parliament after the summer break that would exclude the press from investigations into government security leaks . " it is not right to start criminal investigations into journalists who have a duty to provide information to the public and are not subject to security clearance regulations , " he told reporters in berlin . in a similar case decided in february , germany 's constitutional court ruled against prosecutors who confiscated information from the monthly magazine cicero in an attempt to track down who leaked the classified data that was printed in the magazine . the court said raids against the press to investigate government leaks were unconstitutional . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but deutsche post says it faces a less-than-level playing field and unfair competition on the open market . the eu said germany and four other countries have to fully open up their markets to national and international competition on jan .
1 , 2008 , even though the eu 's 22 other countries wo n't be required to do the same until 2011 .
this means that starting in 2008 , finland 's postal system , for example , can expand into germany , where the finnish companies can concentrate on lucrative big-city markets .
while facing competition from abroad in the cities , deutsche post will also be left to deliver mail to german rural regions - a costlier and more difficult service to provide .
if deutsche post wants to deliver mail in finland , however , it will be obliged to fork over 20 percent of its turnover to the finnish state .
it is that kind of scenario , what deutsche post calls a very uneven playing field , that is causing an uproar at the former mail monopoly .
the german mail carrier has a legal obligation to provide universal service , covering routes that are money making as well as those that are not .
liberalization woes even more troublesome are competing mail services within germany , which pay their mail carriers lower wages than deutsche post , that company 's ceo klaus zumwinkel said as he lashed out at eu rules to liberalize postal services , which he called " a true mess . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post ceo klaus zumwinkel says he will fight alongside his employees the european postal sector was opened to competition a decade ago for the delivery of packages weighing more than 350 grams -lrb- 12 ounces -rrb- .
in 2003 , the measure was extended to items of more than 100 grams and in 2006 , to letters weighing more than 50 grams .
the latest plan allows competition for letters weighing less than 50 grams .
in july , european lawmakers voted in favor of deregulating the eu market for letter delivery from 2011 , two years later than a proposal from the european commission .
britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden have already opened their postal markets to competition .
lawmakers see bonus for consumers the eu has predicted that customers will notice few of the changes .
however , lawmakers believe new competitors are likely to try to distinguish themselves from existing state-controlled post offices with lower costs and special services .
since the partial break up of the german postal monopoly in 1998 , germany 's governing post and telecommunications body has granted some 1,000 business licenses for delivering mail . unlike employees at deutsche post , the mail carriers for these start-ups are often part-time or temporary workers , who do n't enjoy the job security or compensation rates of deutsche post employees .
deutsche post pays its mail carriers a basic 10.14 euros -lrb- $ 13.87 -rrb- per hour , while the competition pays around 5.90 euros in the east and 7 euros per hour in the west of the country .
on top of that , more and more postal services only pay their mail carriers for mail delivered .
this means that in periods of low demand , the welfare office steps in to fill the gaps .
fear of job losses " it can not be the case that steady jobs with social benefits are lost because of the pressure from this kind of competition , " zumwinkel said , adding that some 32,000 jobs are endangered at deutsche post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some new carriers pay per piece of mail delivered zumwinkel has said the postal service should be covered by the temporary personnel assignment act , passed in 1996 to prevent foreign companies from importing labor to germany at below-market wages .
he said a minimum wage should be set for the sector .
deutsche post is also seeking a permanent exemption from paying value-added tax .
it currently does not pay the tax because of its universal service obligation .
on that point , the competition says the exemption gives the former monopolist its own bit of an unfair advantage .
but zumwinkel insisted that given the disadvantages he says deutsche post faces , political action needs to take place soon .

1 , 2008 , even though the eu 's 22 other countries wo n't be required to do the same until 2011 .
this means that starting in 2008 , finland 's postal system , for example , can expand into germany , where the finnish companies can concentrate on lucrative big-city markets .
while facing competition from abroad in the cities , deutsche post will also be left to deliver mail to german rural regions - a costlier and more difficult service to provide .
if deutsche post wants to deliver mail in finland , however , it will be obliged to fork over 20 percent of its turnover to the finnish state .
it is that kind of scenario , what deutsche post calls a very uneven playing field , that is causing an uproar at the former mail monopoly .
the german mail carrier has a legal obligation to provide universal service , covering routes that are money making as well as those that are not .
liberalization woes even more troublesome are competing mail services within germany , which pay their mail carriers lower wages than deutsche post , that company 's ceo klaus zumwinkel said as he lashed out at eu rules to liberalize postal services , which he called " a true mess . "

in 2003 , the measure was extended to items of more than 100 grams and in 2006 , to letters weighing more than 50 grams .
the latest plan allows competition for letters weighing less than 50 grams .
in july , european lawmakers voted in favor of deregulating the eu market for letter delivery from 2011 , two years later than a proposal from the european commission .
britain , finland , the netherlands and sweden have already opened their postal markets to competition .
lawmakers see bonus for consumers the eu has predicted that customers will notice few of the changes .
however , lawmakers believe new competitors are likely to try to distinguish themselves from existing state-controlled post offices with lower costs and special services .
since the partial break up of the german postal monopoly in 1998 , germany 's governing post and telecommunications body has granted some 1,000 business licenses for delivering mail . unlike employees at deutsche post , the mail carriers for these start-ups are often part-time or temporary workers , who do n't enjoy the job security or compensation rates of deutsche post employees .
deutsche post pays its mail carriers a basic 10.14 euros -lrb- $ 13.87 -rrb- per hour , while the competition pays around 5.90 euros in the east and 7 euros per hour in the west of the country .
on top of that , more and more postal services only pay their mail carriers for mail delivered .
this means that in periods of low demand , the welfare office steps in to fill the gaps .
fear of job losses " it can not be the case that steady jobs with social benefits are lost because of the pressure from this kind of competition , " zumwinkel said , adding that some 32,000 jobs are endangered at deutsche post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some new carriers pay per piece of mail delivered zumwinkel has said the postal service should be covered by the temporary personnel assignment act , passed in 1996 to prevent foreign companies from importing labor to germany at below-market wages .
he said a minimum wage should be set for the sector .
deutsche post is also seeking a permanent exemption from paying value-added tax .
it currently does not pay the tax because of its universal service obligation .
on that point , the competition says the exemption gives the former monopolist its own bit of an unfair advantage .
but zumwinkel insisted that given the disadvantages he says deutsche post faces , political action needs to take place soon .

after five years and more than 50 matches of italian cooking , a german is taking over in the kitchen . though soccer players for the german national team have threatened to quit if they ca n't wear the shoes they want , they are n't that picky when it comes to what 's on their plates .
" they all like italian food the best , " team cook saverio pugliese told the the stuttgarter zeitung .
fish , meat and pasta - easy on the sauce - were among the team 's favorite foods , he said .
pugliese , who was responsible for making sure german coach joachim löw 's players got the 3,000 to 3,500 calories they needed for peak performance for two months straight during last summer 's world cup , said he had decided to hang up his black , red and gold spaghetti spoon after five years with the team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another victory , now it 's chow time " that was the highpoint of my life , " pugliese said of the world cup .
" i could n't have dreamed of anything better . "
originally from calabria , at the bottom of the italian boot , pugliese immigrated to germany when he was 17 and by chance opened his own restaurant near the headquarters of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
obviously pleased with a meal he enjoyed at pugliese 's alten haferkasten eatery , then-team coach rudi völler asked the lifelong soccer fan if he 'd whip something up for the national team before its next match .
over the ensuing years , ravenous german players came to love pugliese 's cooking .
" there were some players who , days ahead of time , would look forward to joining the national team just for the food , " he said .
starting with the germany-england friendly on aug .
22 , it will be up to bavaria 's holger stromberg to fill pugliese 's shoes and the national team players ' stomachs .
pugliese has said he intends to use the time freed up by not having to cook for a team of top-notch athletes concentrating on his own restaurant and taking more vacations . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 . the judge in the case referred to the state administrative court ruling in january about the planned autobahn route though a protected nature reserve in the eastern german city of halle an der saale , which set stricter standards on the protection of natural resources . this ultimately reversed the 2005 decision to build a bridge through the natural area . now conservationists need to see to what extent the tiny bat known as the lesser horseshoe bat , or rhinolophus hipposideros , would be affected by the bridge construction , and how it can be protected .
the bat is considered an endangered species . world heritage status at a meeting in new zealand in june , the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organization , unesco , had threatened to withdraw the world heritage site status held by the valley on the elbe as it passes through the city .
unesco placed the 20 kilometer long stretch of valley on a " red list " of endangered sites , angering local politicians .
the un body has never withdrawn world heritage site status .
georg milbradt , premier the state of saxony criticized the unesco threat as " lacking respect for democracy . "

several writers have said they 'll boycott the world 's largest book fair . last year , the frankfurt book fair highlighted the literature and culture of india .
this year , it took the unusual step of turning to a region rather than a country , in this case catalonia in northeast spain .
originally , catalonia chose writers for the october book fair who write in catalan .
the decision caused outrage in spain 's insular literary world .
catalonia backtracked , inviting top spanish-language writers to come as well .
many have refused , the associated press reported .
they see the gesture as an insult prompted by political maneuvering .
language controversy erupts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india was the star at last year 's book fair language is a touchy subject in the spanish literary world .
during francisco franco 's 36-year dictatorship all other languages except spanish were considered officially illegal .
after franco 's death in 1975 , regional languages , including catalan , basque and galician , started reasserting their place in spanish culture .
spain 's myriad of languages leads to frequent cultural clashes .
take barcelona-born writer carlos ruiz-zafron .
while he was born in catalonia 's largest city , he writes in spanish .
ruiz-zafron , who wrote the international bestseller " the shadow of the wind , " has said he 'll boycott the frankfurt book fair .
he blamed the " sideshow " over the language issue on politicians who he said wanted to project a certain image of catalonia to please their supporters .
book fair organizers insist that , in the end , a wide range of catalan culture will be represented in frankfurt .
approximately 130 authors from the region have been invited . the book fair will run from oct .

the new law also stipulates that anyone found guilty of promoting or being an apologist for slavery could face two years in jail .
a mauritanian anti-slavery group , sos slavery , welcomed the law as a victory for the people of mauritania .
slavery persists in parts of mauritania even though it was banned in 1981 .
a presidential decree abolished the practice , which has existed for centuries in mauritania , but no criminal laws were passed to enforce the ban .
human rights groups say despite official denials the practice continues and is widespread .
' important change ' boubacar ould messaoud , leader of sos slavery , said the law was very important for the country . "
we did all the hard work for our master and all we received in return was beatings " mohamed escaped mauritanian slave " we have been demanding this law for a very long time and we are very happy that the national assembly has passed this law .
" we now have legislation which not only defends slaves , but punishes the practice of slavery .
it is an important change . "
sos slavery says there could be up to 600,000 slaves - many of them used as bonded labour - in mauritania .
that would add up to 20 % of the population although the bbc 's ed horton says those figures are difficult to verify .
before the new law was passed , the anti-slavery international group welcomed the mauritanian government 's initiative but said the proposed law was too weak .
the group urged the government to include contemporary aspects of slavery - such as forced marriage , indentured labour or debt bondage .
and the organisation said the maximum jail term should be 30 years and new laws should allow for reparation payments to the victims .

a breakdown of the regeneration costs has been produced along with a warning about the consequences of not funding the improvement work .
the level of investment needed is outlined in a report to the council 's planning and environment committee .
the bulk of the money - just over £ 8m - is earmarked to enhance the high street and whitesands areas .
the public realm scheme is designed to create the right environment to stimulate new private sector investment and boost the town 's retail sector .
main areas of spending £ 4.6m high street £ 3.5m whitesands £ 1.4m dock park £ 1.1m shakespeare street £ 805,000 friars vennel £ 650,000 queensberry street £ 600,000 english street / queen street £ 555,000 great king street £ 545,000 bank street councillors are being recommended to agree to submit a bid to the local authority 's capital development block to support the improvement programme .

prosecutors are seeking $ 440m -lrb- £ 219m -rrb- they say disappeared from a scholarship fund , and a further $ 1.1bn in damages .
they have been under pressure to file a civil case since the courts blocked a criminal case last year on the grounds of mr suharto 's ill health .
the 86-year-old former dictator ruled indonesia for 32 years .
he was ousted in 1998 amid nationwide protests .
legal loopholes ?
the ailing former president was not in court for thursday 's proceedings .
in a session lasting just 20 minutes , judges gave the prosecution team and lawyers defending mr suharto a month to try to reach a settlement .
the attorney-general 's director of civil suits described the month-long postponement as a delaying tactic , and accused the defence lawyer of using legal loopholes to hold up the trial .
the lawyer had argued that the current attorney-general did not have the jurisdiction to bring the case against mr suharto , as that power had been handed to his predecessor .
if no agreement is reached in the course of the next month , the case will return to court .
mr suharto faced numerous allegations of corruption during his rule , but in may 2006 prosecutors closed the criminal case for corruption against him , citing health grounds .
the octogenarian has had a number of strokes and last year underwent stomach surgery .

prosecutors are seeking $ 440m -lrb- £ 219m -rrb- they say disappeared from a scholarship fund , and a further $ 1.1bn in damages .
they have been under pressure to file a civil case since the courts blocked a criminal case last year on the grounds of mr suharto 's ill health .
the 86-year-old former dictator ruled indonesia for 32 years .
he was ousted in 1998 amid nationwide protests .
legal loopholes ?
the ailing former president was not in court for thursday 's proceedings .
in a session lasting just 20 minutes , judges gave the prosecution team and lawyers defending mr suharto a month to try to reach a settlement .
the attorney-general 's director of civil suits described the month-long postponement as a delaying tactic , and accused the defence lawyer of using legal loopholes to hold up the trial .
the lawyer had argued that the current attorney-general did not have the jurisdiction to bring the case against mr suharto , as that power had been handed to his predecessor .
if no agreement is reached in the course of the next month , the case will return to court .
mr suharto faced numerous allegations of corruption during his rule , but in may 2006 prosecutors closed the criminal case for corruption against him , citing health grounds .
the octogenarian has had a number of strokes and last year underwent stomach surgery .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- what exactly is a next generation game ?

by darren waters technology editor , bbc news website the term next-generation is used a lot in the video games industry but what does it actually mean ?
how are developers taking advantage of new gaming hardware and what are the challenges and next steps for the industry ?
with each new iteration of games console hardware comes the promise of revolutionary game experiences .
when the xbox 360 launched in november 2005 , the then boss peter moore said : " xbox 360 will deliver mind-blowing experiences . "
ahead of the launch of the playstation 3 -lrb- ps3 -rrb- sony gushed : " gamers will literally be able to dive into the realistic world seen in large screen movies and experience the excitement in real-time . "
the reality of course is quite different .
" each time we have a step forward in games , it feels phenomenal .
but when we look back we realise it was just another step , " says david braben , the veteran developer who co-created elite in the 1980s , and whose studio is now working on a so-called next-gen title , the outsider .
he says video games are entering their fifth generation of hardware -lrb- starting with home computers in the early 1980s -rrb- and that developers need to be more ambitious and aim higher with the kinds of stories they want to tell . "
in this one sequence at the start of the level we are drawing well over one million polygons . "
steven ter heide , guerrilla " the tools we need are still under development , but the technique of story-telling also needs to be mastered .
" we need the alfred hitchcock and the orson welles of gaming to step forward and lead the industry into a new era .
at the moment we have plenty of buster keatons and harold lloyds . "
braben believes that the industry needs artistic figures who can employ the next-generation of tools to tell stories in new ways and cross the uncanny valley .
the uncanny valley is a term coined in 1970 by japanese roboticist masahiro mori .
he pointed out that as robots , and computer animations of people , get closer to replicating the movements and expressions of humans , the bigger the gulf between them and us seems to be .
human challenge frontier has been working on tools to help cross the uncanny valley for more than five years and the outsider is still more than two years away from completion .
" it will be a game where you genuinely can do different things ; you can come at a problem in different ways because you thought of a way . "
" there is no silver bullet that will solve our problems of tools and storytelling " david braben the outsider 's ambitions are to put thousands of characters inside a game , each one unique and displaying " subtle human behaviour " .
the company has also been working on an animation system which gives a greater feeling of realism and is more adaptive and less scripted .
these challenges are among the biggest issues all developers are grappling with , along with non-linear story-telling , artificial intelligence , photo-realism , connected experiences and user-generated content .
a new wave of titles for the pc , playstation 3 and xbox 360 hoping to confront these issues are due for release in the coming months , among them bioshock , crysis , assassin 's creed , mass effect , fable 2 , metal gear solid 4 , halo 3 and killzone 2 .
nintendo has stepped away from this debate somewhat , focusing on games which highlight participation .
power pack halo 3 , for the xbox 360 , is hoping to be the very definition of next generation when it launches next month . "
we want to let our fans do great things " brian jarrard , bungie " we 're expanding our ability to empower our fans to really take the game and make it their own , " says brian jarrard , director of franchise and community affairs at the game 's developers bungie .
halo 3 will include tools to let gamers edit their own game movies and share them among friends , swap photographs from games , as well as re-build many of the maps the makers have provided , through a feature called forge .
jarrard adds : " we want to let our fans do great things .
these fans are making really great halo movies and we 're giving them really powerful tools and we 're excited to see where they go with that . "
the increasing amount of raw power available to developers has made the job of creating immersive , detailed worlds more achievable .
david braben estimates that today 's machines are 20 million times more powerful than the first mass-market games machines of the early 1980s .
game ambition one title aiming for " hollywood realism " is killzone 2 , for the playstation 3 .
a recent demo of the game at e3 in los angeles impressed many observers .
steven ter heide , one of the producers on the project at guerilla , says : " the ps3 allows us to deal with a tremendous amount of data on screen , the amount of polygons on screens , animation , the hit responses . "
one level of the game equates to about two gigabytes of data , he says .
he adds : " in this one sequence at the start of the level we are drawing well over one million polygons .
there 's a lot of processing power needed to pull off these effects , such as motion blur , full-screen anti-aliasing , volumetric smoke . "
but throwing more polygons and higher definition textures on to a screen are not going to be enough on their own to create truly interactive experiences , argues braben .
in 1982 he and ian bell created a whole galaxy for elite on the humble bbc micro , and all inside just 22k of ram .
" we have textures on a single rivet in the outsider that are bigger than 22k , " he says .
braben says the firm is also working on tools that allow for more realistic conversations between the player-controlled character and ai characters in the game world .
and that world will be huge .
the ambition for the outsider is to render a 49 sq km city but braben is pragmatic about what can be achieved this generation .
" there is no silver bullet that will solve our problems of tools and storytelling .
" i do n't think any of the games we have made have ever matched the ambition we had for them .
but that 's true of the whole industry .
" the important thing is to have the ambition . "

a new wave of titles for the pc , playstation 3 and xbox 360 hoping to confront these issues are due for release in the coming months , among them bioshock , crysis , assassin 's creed , mass effect , fable 2 , metal gear solid 4 , halo 3 and killzone 2 .
nintendo has stepped away from this debate somewhat , focusing on games which highlight participation .
power pack halo 3 , for the xbox 360 , is hoping to be the very definition of next generation when it launches next month .
we want to let our fans do great things brian jarrard , bungie the hopes and hype for halo 3 " we 're expanding our ability to empower our fans to really take the game and make it their own , " says brian jarrard , director of franchise and community affairs at the game 's developers bungie .
halo 3 will include tools to let gamers edit their own game movies and share them among friends , swap photographs from games , as well as re-build many of the maps the makers have provided , through a feature called forge .
jarrard adds : " we want to let our fans do great things .
these fans are making really great halo movies and we 're giving them really powerful tools and we 're excited to see where they go with that . "
the increasing amount of raw power available to developers has made the job of creating immersive , detailed worlds more achievable .
david braben estimates that today 's machines are 20 million times more powerful than the first mass-market games machines of the early 1980s .
game ambition one title aiming for " hollywood realism " is killzone 2 , for the playstation 3 .
a recent demo of the game at e3 in los angeles impressed many observers .
steven ter heide , one of the producers on the project at guerilla , says : " the ps3 allows us to deal with a tremendous amount of data on screen , the amount of polygons on screens , animation , the hit responses . "
one level of the game equates to about two gigabytes of data , he says .
bioshock is aiming to tell more mature stories he adds : " in this one sequence at the start of the level we are drawing well over one million polygons .
there 's a lot of processing power needed to pull off these effects , such as motion blur , full-screen anti-aliasing , volumetric smoke . "
but throwing more polygons and higher definition textures on to a screen are not going to be enough on their own to create truly interactive experiences , argues braben .
in 1982 he and ian bell created a whole galaxy for elite on the humble bbc micro , and all inside just 22k of ram .
" we have textures on a single rivet in the outsider that are bigger than 22k , " he says .
braben says the firm is also working on tools that allow for more realistic conversations between the player-controlled character and ai characters in the game world .
and that world will be huge .
the ambition for the outsider is to render a 49 sq km city but braben is pragmatic about what can be achieved this generation .
" there is no silver bullet that will solve our problems of tools and storytelling .
" i do n't think any of the games we have made have ever matched the ambition we had for them .
but that 's true of the whole industry .
" the important thing is to have the ambition . "

by darren waters technology editor , bbc news website the outsider is due for release at christmas 2009 the term next-generation is used a lot in the video games industry but what does it actually mean ?
how are developers taking advantage of new gaming hardware and what are the challenges and next steps for the industry ?
with each new iteration of games console hardware comes the promise of revolutionary game experiences .
when the xbox 360 launched in november 2005 , the then boss peter moore said : " xbox 360 will deliver mind-blowing experiences . "
ahead of the launch of the playstation 3 -lrb- ps3 -rrb- sony gushed : " gamers will literally be able to dive into the realistic world seen in large screen movies and experience the excitement in real-time . "
the reality of course is quite different .
" each time we have a step forward in games , it feels phenomenal .
but when we look back we realise it was just another step , " says david braben , the veteran developer who co-created elite in the 1980s , and whose studio is now working on a so-called next-gen title , the outsider .
he says video games are entering their fifth generation of hardware -lrb- starting with home computers in the early 1980s -rrb- and that developers need to be more ambitious and aim higher with the kinds of stories they want to tell .
in this one sequence at the start of the level we are drawing well over one million polygons .
steven ter heide , guerrilla the production ethos of killzone 2 " the tools we need are still under development , but the technique of story-telling also needs to be mastered .
" we need the alfred hitchcock and the orson welles of gaming to step forward and lead the industry into a new era .
at the moment we have plenty of buster keatons and harold lloyds . "
braben believes that the industry needs artistic figures who can employ the next-generation of tools to tell stories in new ways and cross the uncanny valley .
the uncanny valley is a term coined in 1970 by japanese roboticist masahiro mori .
he pointed out that as robots , and computer animations of people , get closer to replicating the movements and expressions of humans , the bigger the gulf between them and us seems to be .
human challenge frontier has been working on tools to help cross the uncanny valley for more than five years and the outsider is still more than two years away from completion .
" it will be a game where you genuinely can do different things ; you can come at a problem in different ways because you thought of a way . "
there is no silver bullet that will solve our problems of tools and storytelling david braben the outsider 's ambitions are to put thousands of characters inside a game , each one unique and displaying " subtle human behaviour " .
the company has also been working on an animation system which gives a greater feeling of realism and is more adaptive and less scripted .

a new wave of titles for the pc , playstation 3 and xbox 360 hoping to confront these issues are due for release in the coming months , among them bioshock , crysis , assassin 's creed , mass effect , fable 2 , metal gear solid 4 , halo 3 and killzone 2 .
nintendo has stepped away from this debate somewhat , focusing on games which highlight participation .
power pack halo 3 , for the xbox 360 , is hoping to be the very definition of next generation when it launches next month .
we want to let our fans do great things brian jarrard , bungie the hopes and hype for halo 3 " we 're expanding our ability to empower our fans to really take the game and make it their own , " says brian jarrard , director of franchise and community affairs at the game 's developers bungie .
halo 3 will include tools to let gamers edit their own game movies and share them among friends , swap photographs from games , as well as re-build many of the maps the makers have provided , through a feature called forge .
jarrard adds : " we want to let our fans do great things .
these fans are making really great halo movies and we 're giving them really powerful tools and we 're excited to see where they go with that . "
the increasing amount of raw power available to developers has made the job of creating immersive , detailed worlds more achievable .
david braben estimates that today 's machines are 20 million times more powerful than the first mass-market games machines of the early 1980s .
game ambition one title aiming for " hollywood realism " is killzone 2 , for the playstation 3 .
a recent demo of the game at e3 in los angeles impressed many observers .
steven ter heide , one of the producers on the project at guerilla , says : " the ps3 allows us to deal with a tremendous amount of data on screen , the amount of polygons on screens , animation , the hit responses . "
one level of the game equates to about two gigabytes of data , he says .
bioshock is aiming to tell more mature stories he adds : " in this one sequence at the start of the level we are drawing well over one million polygons .
there 's a lot of processing power needed to pull off these effects , such as motion blur , full-screen anti-aliasing , volumetric smoke . "
but throwing more polygons and higher definition textures on to a screen are not going to be enough on their own to create truly interactive experiences , argues braben .
in 1982 he and ian bell created a whole galaxy for elite on the humble bbc micro , and all inside just 22k of ram .
" we have textures on a single rivet in the outsider that are bigger than 22k , " he says .
braben says the firm is also working on tools that allow for more realistic conversations between the player-controlled character and ai characters in the game world .
and that world will be huge .
the ambition for the outsider is to render a 49 sq km city but braben is pragmatic about what can be achieved this generation .
" there is no silver bullet that will solve our problems of tools and storytelling .
" i do n't think any of the games we have made have ever matched the ambition we had for them .
but that 's true of the whole industry .
" the important thing is to have the ambition . "

by darren waters technology editor , bbc news website the outsider is due for release at christmas 2009 the term next-generation is used a lot in the video games industry but what does it actually mean ?
how are developers taking advantage of new gaming hardware and what are the challenges and next steps for the industry ?
with each new iteration of games console hardware comes the promise of revolutionary game experiences .
when the xbox 360 launched in november 2005 , the then boss peter moore said : " xbox 360 will deliver mind-blowing experiences . "
ahead of the launch of the playstation 3 -lrb- ps3 -rrb- sony gushed : " gamers will literally be able to dive into the realistic world seen in large screen movies and experience the excitement in real-time . "
the reality of course is quite different .
" each time we have a step forward in games , it feels phenomenal .
but when we look back we realise it was just another step , " says david braben , the veteran developer who co-created elite in the 1980s , and whose studio is now working on a so-called next-gen title , the outsider .
he says video games are entering their fifth generation of hardware -lrb- starting with home computers in the early 1980s -rrb- and that developers need to be more ambitious and aim higher with the kinds of stories they want to tell .
in this one sequence at the start of the level we are drawing well over one million polygons .
steven ter heide , guerrilla the production ethos of killzone 2 " the tools we need are still under development , but the technique of story-telling also needs to be mastered .
" we need the alfred hitchcock and the orson welles of gaming to step forward and lead the industry into a new era .
at the moment we have plenty of buster keatons and harold lloyds . "
braben believes that the industry needs artistic figures who can employ the next-generation of tools to tell stories in new ways and cross the uncanny valley .
the uncanny valley is a term coined in 1970 by japanese roboticist masahiro mori .
he pointed out that as robots , and computer animations of people , get closer to replicating the movements and expressions of humans , the bigger the gulf between them and us seems to be .
human challenge frontier has been working on tools to help cross the uncanny valley for more than five years and the outsider is still more than two years away from completion .
" it will be a game where you genuinely can do different things ; you can come at a problem in different ways because you thought of a way . "
there is no silver bullet that will solve our problems of tools and storytelling david braben the outsider 's ambitions are to put thousands of characters inside a game , each one unique and displaying " subtle human behaviour " .
the company has also been working on an animation system which gives a greater feeling of realism and is more adaptive and less scripted .

nintendo has stepped away from this debate somewhat , focusing on games which highlight participation .
power pack halo 3 , for the xbox 360 , is hoping to be the very definition of next generation when it launches next month .
we want to let our fans do great things brian jarrard , bungie the hopes and hype for halo 3 " we 're expanding our ability to empower our fans to really take the game and make it their own , " says brian jarrard , director of franchise and community affairs at the game 's developers bungie .
halo 3 will include tools to let gamers edit their own game movies and share them among friends , swap photographs from games , as well as re-build many of the maps the makers have provided , through a feature called forge .
jarrard adds : " we want to let our fans do great things .
these fans are making really great halo movies and we 're giving them really powerful tools and we 're excited to see where they go with that . "
the increasing amount of raw power available to developers has made the job of creating immersive , detailed worlds more achievable .
david braben estimates that today 's machines are 20 million times more powerful than the first mass-market games machines of the early 1980s .
game ambition one title aiming for " hollywood realism " is killzone 2 , for the playstation 3 .
a recent demo of the game at e3 in los angeles impressed many observers .
steven ter heide , one of the producers on the project at guerilla , says : " the ps3 allows us to deal with a tremendous amount of data on screen , the amount of polygons on screens , animation , the hit responses . "
one level of the game equates to about two gigabytes of data , he says .
bioshock is aiming to tell more mature stories he adds : " in this one sequence at the start of the level we are drawing well over one million polygons .
there 's a lot of processing power needed to pull off these effects , such as motion blur , full-screen anti-aliasing , volumetric smoke . "
but throwing more polygons and higher definition textures on to a screen are not going to be enough on their own to create truly interactive experiences , argues braben .
in 1982 he and ian bell created a whole galaxy for elite on the humble bbc micro , and all inside just 22k of ram .
" we have textures on a single rivet in the outsider that are bigger than 22k , " he says .
braben says the firm is also working on tools that allow for more realistic conversations between the player-controlled character and ai characters in the game world .
and that world will be huge .
the ambition for the outsider is to render a 49 sq km city but braben is pragmatic about what can be achieved this generation .
" there is no silver bullet that will solve our problems of tools and storytelling .
" i do n't think any of the games we have made have ever matched the ambition we had for them .
but that 's true of the whole industry .
" the important thing is to have the ambition . "

by darren waters technology editor , bbc news website the outsider is due for release at christmas 2009 the term next-generation is used a lot in the video games industry but what does it actually mean ?
how are developers taking advantage of new gaming hardware and what are the challenges and next steps for the industry ?
with each new iteration of games console hardware comes the promise of revolutionary game experiences .
when the xbox 360 launched in november 2005 , the then boss peter moore said : " xbox 360 will deliver mind-blowing experiences . "
ahead of the launch of the playstation 3 -lrb- ps3 -rrb- sony gushed : " gamers will literally be able to dive into the realistic world seen in large screen movies and experience the excitement in real-time . "
the reality of course is quite different .
" each time we have a step forward in games , it feels phenomenal .
but when we look back we realise it was just another step , " says david braben , the veteran developer who co-created elite in the 1980s , and whose studio is now working on a so-called next-gen title , the outsider .
he says video games are entering their fifth generation of hardware -lrb- starting with home computers in the early 1980s -rrb- and that developers need to be more ambitious and aim higher with the kinds of stories they want to tell .
in this one sequence at the start of the level we are drawing well over one million polygons .
steven ter heide , guerrilla the production ethos of killzone 2 " the tools we need are still under development , but the technique of story-telling also needs to be mastered .
" we need the alfred hitchcock and the orson welles of gaming to step forward and lead the industry into a new era .
at the moment we have plenty of buster keatons and harold lloyds . "
braben believes that the industry needs artistic figures who can employ the next-generation of tools to tell stories in new ways and cross the uncanny valley .
the uncanny valley is a term coined in 1970 by japanese roboticist masahiro mori .
he pointed out that as robots , and computer animations of people , get closer to replicating the movements and expressions of humans , the bigger the gulf between them and us seems to be .
human challenge frontier has been working on tools to help cross the uncanny valley for more than five years and the outsider is still more than two years away from completion .
" it will be a game where you genuinely can do different things ; you can come at a problem in different ways because you thought of a way . "
there is no silver bullet that will solve our problems of tools and storytelling david braben the outsider 's ambitions are to put thousands of characters inside a game , each one unique and displaying " subtle human behaviour " .
the company has also been working on an animation system which gives a greater feeling of realism and is more adaptive and less scripted .
these challenges are among the biggest issues all developers are grappling with , along with non-linear story-telling , artificial intelligence , photo-realism , connected experiences and user-generated content .
a new wave of titles for the pc , playstation 3 and xbox 360 hoping to confront these issues are due for release in the coming months , among them bioshock , crysis , assassin 's creed , mass effect , fable 2 , metal gear solid 4 , halo 3 and killzone 2 .
