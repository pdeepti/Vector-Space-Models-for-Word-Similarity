gabriel said the united nations climate conference being held in bali in december should provide the " starting signal " for comprehensive talks on a new climate agreement for the period after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol runs out .
this had to contain a long-term goal , ambitious and obligatory commitments from the industrialized world , and fair contributions from the larger developing countries , he said .
" under the gleneagles dialogue we are working at making investment in climate protection technologies more attractive , " gabriel said .
the gleneagles dialogue was set up at the g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland in 2005 .
apart from the g8 - the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , canada , italy and russia - large developing economies like china , brazil and australia are also participating .

on the other side of the argument , the industrialized nations point to new powerhouses like china and india , saying that pollution problems there are home-made .
attending the conference in berlin , gro harlem brundtland , the un special envoy on climate change , spoke of this " deep-rooted lack of trust between the industrialized and developing countries . "
" many industrialized countries believe that the developing countries are unwilling and that they are doing too little , " the former norwegian prime minister and world health organization head said .
" many developing countries believe that the industrialized world has defaulted on the promise of financial and technology assistance , " she added .
industrialized nations urged to cut emissions the global leadership for climate action , comprising former prominent leaders , called for industrialized countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent over the period 1990 to 2050 .
the united states should commit itself to this goal , said the organization 's presidents , former chilean president ricardo lagos and the president of the un foundation , former us senator timothy e wirth .
the organization also stated that major developing countries like china and india should cut their energy use by 30 per cent by 2020 as a first step .

german environment minister sigmar gabriel admitted that the negotiations will be far from easy .
" here in germany , you know how difficult it is to reach a consensus on sensitive issues among our 16 states , " he said .
" you can imagine what a hard task it is to find common ground among the over 200 nations involved in the climate protection process .
there ’ s not even agreement yet among the signatories to the kyoto protocol on reductions in co2 emissions that negotiations on a follow-up treaty are needed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.09.2007 german tv sacks talk show host for praising nazi family politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman , herself a professional , thinks women are better suited for staying at home germany 's public broadcaster ard fired its well-known talk show host and controversial book author eva herman after she praised nazi family politics .
herman said on monday her statements were taken out of context . " mrs. herman 's authorial activities are in our view no longer compatible with her role as a television news reader and talk show host , " said volker herres , program director for german public network ard 's northern division norddeutscher rundfunk -lrb- ndr -rrb- , in a statement on the network 's web site . he also said that some guests had canceled their appearances on herman 's talk show in response to her public statements on motherhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in nazi germany received monetary incentives and medals for child-bearing herman , 48 , who already ruffled feathers last year by arguing that women should raise children rather than pursue careers of their own , was quoted by the media as speaking in glowing terms about the family values that were nurtured in the nazi era . " it was a gruesome time with a totally crazy and highly dangerous leader who led the germans into ruin as we all know , " herman said . " but there was at the time also something good , and that is the values , that is the children , that is the families , that is a togetherness - it was all abolished , there was nothing left . " herman 's new book " the noah 's ark principle : why we must save the family " -lrb- available in german -rrb- is a follow-up to her 2006 bestseller " the eva principle : for a new femininity . " in both books , herman openly discredits the merits of emancipation and mourns the loss of traditional gender roles that assigned women to the safe and comforting spot by the kitchen stove . motherhood crusade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women juggle their careers with obligations at home herman told bild newspaper on monday that she did n't understand why there was so much commotion about her views . " i expressly distanced myself from the ' third reich ' at several points , " herman said .
" one has to put my statement into its overall context .
this is n't about hitler 's values , but about basic human values , which were abused in the ' third reich ' and later abolished . " by praising the third reich family values , however , herman managed to raise the scandal bar to unprecedented heights . while it is true that the nazis offered incentives to child-bearing women , their family policies were an integral part of their racist ideology whose goal was the creation of a master race . " frau herman should know that what characterized the third reich was n't how mothers were treated , because they were just meant to produce cannon fodder , " author and holocaust survivor ralph giordano told bild . " what characterized it was the gas chambers . " preaching , not practicing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for almost two decades , herman was one of germany 's most popular news presenters married for the fourth time , having one child and - until now - a stellar television career that included 18 years of hosting germany 's premiere tv news show tageschau - eva herman was an unlikely candidate for a champion of antiquated gender roles . she proved , however , that one does n't have to practice what one preaches and that a successful career woman can tell other women that what they really want is to keep quiet and cook . " in eva herman 's case , even those of us who are women 's rights activists want her to return home to her kitchen stove , " said renate künast , a prominent member of the opposition green party . it is unlikely , however , that herman , who was often voted in the past as germany 's favorite news presenter , will get a chance to become a stay-at-home mom that she never was .
as a proponent of an ultra-conservative , pre-feminist fantasy world in which marriage , obedience and motherhood are considered the ultimate forms of self-fulfillment , she seems busier than ever . " frau herman is free to carry on her ' motherhood crusade , ' but this is no longer compatible with her role as an ndr tv presenter , " herres said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while islam and buddhism are getting more popular , christianity is n't .
the controversial theologian spoke to dw-world.de about the reasons . born in 1928 , catholic theologian and church critic hans küng made his mark as a promoter of dialogue between religions and as president of the global ethic foundation .
in 1979 , the vatican withdrew his license to teach after the swiss native questioned the infallibility of the pope .
in the fall of 2005 , pope benedict xvi invited küng to a private meeting .
dw-world.de : professor küng , people - and not only in germany - are again enormously interested in religious issues .
can we speak of a return of religions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran in 1979 : ayatollah chomeini is back from exile hans küng : " return of religions " - that is an ambivalent term .
religion never disappeared .
just like music , religion is something that stays , even if it is suppressed for some time .
it is true , that since the new awakening of islam , since the creation of the islamic republic of iran in 1979 , europeans have realized that they do n't rule the world by themselves .
for a long time , secular europe had not realized that it was an exception , and that elsewhere , religions is a power .
" no peace among the nations , without peace between the religions !
no peace between the religions without dialog between the religions ! "
those are two central sentences of your world ethic principle .
in a time of globalization , there are many undreamed-of possibilities for communication on the internet .
the access to knowledge is easier than ever before .
can this development improve the dialog of religions ?
in principle , i would say yes , even though this brings many problems .
it 's a positive thing that today we can know a lot about other religions .
a different question , of course , is whether we do want to be in the know .
there are people who do n't - they already know everything , without studying the islam .
who does n't want to know ?
for one , the fundamental christians who take everything the bible says literally and say they do n't need any other religions .
then there are the very secular people , dogmatists of laicism .
they get worked up simply when the word religion is mentioned , and they think that we should not talk about it in schools .
they have issues with the fact that religion , again , is a powerful factor in world history .
according to a survey , not christianity but buddhism is the most likeable religion for germans .
how do you explain that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .
it is a religion that 's turned to the inside and that emphasizes meditation .
it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .
of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .
even though islam is seen skeptically throughout europe , it attracts many , especially young people , around the globe .
there are 1.3 billion muslims , with an upward trend .
from rabat to damascus there are islamic groups that are becoming increasingly important politically .
why is that so ?
are there religious or social reasons for this ?
both .
those are religious groups that help people .
many muslims in those countries feel that the ruling elites have a life of their own and do n't take care of the population at large .
the fundamental islamist groups - or whatever you want to call them - try very hard to do something for people .
they take care of schools and education , and they give people clothes and food .
why did hamas win the elections -lsb- in the palestinian territories -rsb- ?
because they worked for the people .
one of the biggest mistakes of western politics - germany included , by the way - was to not accept those elections .
instead , fingers were pointed , saying : " you have to accept israel ! "
tell that to people that have been terrorized by an occupying power for decades .
that is not the right way to solve those problems .
you have to realize that there are parties that do have islam as a basis , yet they campaign for the people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate young muslims make themselves available for terrorist attacks a better example is the party of prime minister erdogan in turkey .
why did they win ?
because they helped people .
they showed - with all weaknesses that they have - that they will bring their country forward and in no way did they develop an islamic theocracy , such as the one in iran .
they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .
how far would the willingness to negotiate with the radical powers have to go ?
would one have to negotiate with the taliban and al qaeda as well ?
you can not negotiate with al qaeda .
it is a secret terrorist group .
you can only dry them up .
but the west has watered them so much that they could sprout .
the american secret service recently admitted in secret documents that the iraq war only helped al qaeda .
before , there was no al qaeda in iraq .
you could certainly negotiate with the taliban .
they are n't just crazy people .
there are some extremists , and there are , on the other hand , those that warned the bush administration about sept .
11 .
but it was n't taken seriously .
there were chieftains in afghanistan that warned against marching in with an army .
a personal question : on sept .
12 you will introduce your autobiography " controversial truth . "
if you look back , are you still as optimistic as you were in 1990 when you wrote " global responsibility : in search of a new world ethic " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen after bush ?
when i wrote the book in 1990 , of course , one hoped that in the future , problems would not be solved with military means , with aggression and animosity and war , but instead - just like it worked in western and eastern europe - through mutual understanding , cooperation and integration .
unfortunately , this was disrupted by the mad policies that the second bush administration initiated with a clique of archconservative jewish intellectuals , so-called neocons and protestant fundamentalists .
i am not an enemy , but a friend of the americans .
i hope that , despite the backlash that the policies of bush jr. brought on , americans can remember their great democratic tradition and lead in terms of international understanding , moderation and world peace .
were you hurt that pope benedict xvi never accepted your idea of the world ethic ?
he accepted the idea as such .
he realizes that there have to be common ethical standards .
during our conversation he conceded that those standards need to be valid for believers and non-believers .
one could only have expected that he would personally advocate this .
but that might still happen . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

herman said on monday her statements were taken out of context . " mrs. herman 's authorial activities are in our view no longer compatible with her role as a television news reader and talk show host , " said volker herres , program director for german public network ard 's northern division norddeutscher rundfunk -lrb- ndr -rrb- , in a statement on the network 's web site . he also said that some guests had canceled their appearances on herman 's talk show in response to her public statements on motherhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in nazi germany received monetary incentives and medals for child-bearing herman , 48 , who already ruffled feathers last year by arguing that women should raise children rather than pursue careers of their own , was quoted by the media as speaking in glowing terms about the family values that were nurtured in the nazi era . " it was a gruesome time with a totally crazy and highly dangerous leader who led the germans into ruin as we all know , " herman said .

while islam and buddhism are getting more popular , christianity is n't .
the controversial theologian spoke to dw-world.de about the reasons . born in 1928 , catholic theologian and church critic hans küng made his mark as a promoter of dialogue between religions and as president of the global ethic foundation .
in 1979 , the vatican withdrew his license to teach after the swiss native questioned the infallibility of the pope .
in the fall of 2005 , pope benedict xvi invited küng to a private meeting .
dw-world.de : professor küng , people - and not only in germany - are again enormously interested in religious issues .
can we speak of a return of religions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran in 1979 : ayatollah chomeini is back from exile hans küng : " return of religions " - that is an ambivalent term .
religion never disappeared .
just like music , religion is something that stays , even if it is suppressed for some time .
it is true , that since the new awakening of islam , since the creation of the islamic republic of iran in 1979 , europeans have realized that they do n't rule the world by themselves .
for a long time , secular europe had not realized that it was an exception , and that elsewhere , religions is a power .
" no peace among the nations , without peace between the religions !
no peace between the religions without dialog between the religions ! "
those are two central sentences of your world ethic principle .
in a time of globalization , there are many undreamed-of possibilities for communication on the internet .
the access to knowledge is easier than ever before .
can this development improve the dialog of religions ?
in principle , i would say yes , even though this brings many problems .
it 's a positive thing that today we can know a lot about other religions .
a different question , of course , is whether we do want to be in the know .
there are people who do n't - they already know everything , without studying the islam .
who does n't want to know ?
for one , the fundamental christians who take everything the bible says literally and say they do n't need any other religions .
then there are the very secular people , dogmatists of laicism .
they get worked up simply when the word religion is mentioned , and they think that we should not talk about it in schools .
they have issues with the fact that religion , again , is a powerful factor in world history .
according to a survey , not christianity but buddhism is the most likeable religion for germans .
how do you explain that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .
it is a religion that 's turned to the inside and that emphasizes meditation .
it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .
of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .
even though islam is seen skeptically throughout europe , it attracts many , especially young people , around the globe .
there are 1.3 billion muslims , with an upward trend .
from rabat to damascus there are islamic groups that are becoming increasingly important politically .
why is that so ?
are there religious or social reasons for this ?
both .
those are religious groups that help people .
many muslims in those countries feel that the ruling elites have a life of their own and do n't take care of the population at large .
the fundamental islamist groups - or whatever you want to call them - try very hard to do something for people .
they take care of schools and education , and they give people clothes and food .
why did hamas win the elections -lsb- in the palestinian territories -rsb- ?
because they worked for the people .
one of the biggest mistakes of western politics - germany included , by the way - was to not accept those elections .
instead , fingers were pointed , saying : " you have to accept israel ! "
tell that to people that have been terrorized by an occupying power for decades .
that is not the right way to solve those problems .
you have to realize that there are parties that do have islam as a basis , yet they campaign for the people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate young muslims make themselves available for terrorist attacks a better example is the party of prime minister erdogan in turkey .
why did they win ?
because they helped people .
they showed - with all weaknesses that they have - that they will bring their country forward and in no way did they develop an islamic theocracy , such as the one in iran .
they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .
how far would the willingness to negotiate with the radical powers have to go ?
would one have to negotiate with the taliban and al qaeda as well ?
you can not negotiate with al qaeda .
it is a secret terrorist group .
you can only dry them up .
but the west has watered them so much that they could sprout .
the american secret service recently admitted in secret documents that the iraq war only helped al qaeda .
before , there was no al qaeda in iraq .
you could certainly negotiate with the taliban .
they are n't just crazy people .
there are some extremists , and there are , on the other hand , those that warned the bush administration about sept .
11 .
but it was n't taken seriously .
there were chieftains in afghanistan that warned against marching in with an army .
a personal question : on sept .
12 you will introduce your autobiography " controversial truth . "
if you look back , are you still as optimistic as you were in 1990 when you wrote " global responsibility : in search of a new world ethic " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen after bush ?
when i wrote the book in 1990 , of course , one hoped that in the future , problems would not be solved with military means , with aggression and animosity and war , but instead - just like it worked in western and eastern europe - through mutual understanding , cooperation and integration .
unfortunately , this was disrupted by the mad policies that the second bush administration initiated with a clique of archconservative jewish intellectuals , so-called neocons and protestant fundamentalists .
i am not an enemy , but a friend of the americans .
i hope that , despite the backlash that the policies of bush jr. brought on , americans can remember their great democratic tradition and lead in terms of international understanding , moderation and world peace .
were you hurt that pope benedict xvi never accepted your idea of the world ethic ?
he accepted the idea as such .
he realizes that there have to be common ethical standards .
during our conversation he conceded that those standards need to be valid for believers and non-believers .
one could only have expected that he would personally advocate this .
but that might still happen . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while islam and buddhism are getting more popular , christianity is n't .
the controversial theologian spoke to dw-world.de about the reasons . born in 1928 , catholic theologian and church critic hans küng made his mark as a promoter of dialogue between religions and as president of the global ethic foundation .
in 1979 , the vatican withdrew his license to teach after the swiss native questioned the infallibility of the pope .
in the fall of 2005 , pope benedict xvi invited küng to a private meeting .
dw-world.de : professor küng , people - and not only in germany - are again enormously interested in religious issues .
can we speak of a return of religions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran in 1979 : ayatollah chomeini is back from exile hans küng : " return of religions " - that is an ambivalent term .
religion never disappeared .
just like music , religion is something that stays , even if it is suppressed for some time .
it is true , that since the new awakening of islam , since the creation of the islamic republic of iran in 1979 , europeans have realized that they do n't rule the world by themselves .
for a long time , secular europe had not realized that it was an exception , and that elsewhere , religions is a power .
" no peace among the nations , without peace between the religions !
no peace between the religions without dialog between the religions ! "
those are two central sentences of your world ethic principle .
in a time of globalization , there are many undreamed-of possibilities for communication on the internet .
the access to knowledge is easier than ever before .
can this development improve the dialog of religions ?
in principle , i would say yes , even though this brings many problems .
it 's a positive thing that today we can know a lot about other religions .
a different question , of course , is whether we do want to be in the know .
there are people who do n't - they already know everything , without studying the islam .
who does n't want to know ?
for one , the fundamental christians who take everything the bible says literally and say they do n't need any other religions .
then there are the very secular people , dogmatists of laicism .
they get worked up simply when the word religion is mentioned , and they think that we should not talk about it in schools .
they have issues with the fact that religion , again , is a powerful factor in world history .
according to a survey , not christianity but buddhism is the most likeable religion for germans .
how do you explain that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .
it is a religion that 's turned to the inside and that emphasizes meditation .
it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .
of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .
even though islam is seen skeptically throughout europe , it attracts many , especially young people , around the globe .
there are 1.3 billion muslims , with an upward trend .
from rabat to damascus there are islamic groups that are becoming increasingly important politically .
why is that so ?
are there religious or social reasons for this ?
both .
those are religious groups that help people .
many muslims in those countries feel that the ruling elites have a life of their own and do n't take care of the population at large .
the fundamental islamist groups - or whatever you want to call them - try very hard to do something for people .
they take care of schools and education , and they give people clothes and food .
why did hamas win the elections -lsb- in the palestinian territories -rsb- ?
because they worked for the people .
one of the biggest mistakes of western politics - germany included , by the way - was to not accept those elections .
instead , fingers were pointed , saying : " you have to accept israel ! "
tell that to people that have been terrorized by an occupying power for decades .
that is not the right way to solve those problems .
you have to realize that there are parties that do have islam as a basis , yet they campaign for the people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate young muslims make themselves available for terrorist attacks a better example is the party of prime minister erdogan in turkey .
why did they win ?
because they helped people .
they showed - with all weaknesses that they have - that they will bring their country forward and in no way did they develop an islamic theocracy , such as the one in iran .
they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .
how far would the willingness to negotiate with the radical powers have to go ?
would one have to negotiate with the taliban and al qaeda as well ?
you can not negotiate with al qaeda .
it is a secret terrorist group .
you can only dry them up .
but the west has watered them so much that they could sprout .
the american secret service recently admitted in secret documents that the iraq war only helped al qaeda .
before , there was no al qaeda in iraq .
you could certainly negotiate with the taliban .
they are n't just crazy people .
there are some extremists , and there are , on the other hand , those that warned the bush administration about sept .
11 .
but it was n't taken seriously .
there were chieftains in afghanistan that warned against marching in with an army .
a personal question : on sept .
12 you will introduce your autobiography " controversial truth . "
if you look back , are you still as optimistic as you were in 1990 when you wrote " global responsibility : in search of a new world ethic " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen after bush ?
when i wrote the book in 1990 , of course , one hoped that in the future , problems would not be solved with military means , with aggression and animosity and war , but instead - just like it worked in western and eastern europe - through mutual understanding , cooperation and integration .
unfortunately , this was disrupted by the mad policies that the second bush administration initiated with a clique of archconservative jewish intellectuals , so-called neocons and protestant fundamentalists .
i am not an enemy , but a friend of the americans .
i hope that , despite the backlash that the policies of bush jr. brought on , americans can remember their great democratic tradition and lead in terms of international understanding , moderation and world peace .
were you hurt that pope benedict xvi never accepted your idea of the world ethic ?
he accepted the idea as such .
he realizes that there have to be common ethical standards .
during our conversation he conceded that those standards need to be valid for believers and non-believers .
one could only have expected that he would personally advocate this .
but that might still happen . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no peace between the religions without dialog between the religions ! "
those are two central sentences of your world ethic principle .
in a time of globalization , there are many undreamed-of possibilities for communication on the internet .
the access to knowledge is easier than ever before .
can this development improve the dialog of religions ?
in principle , i would say yes , even though this brings many problems .
it 's a positive thing that today we can know a lot about other religions .
a different question , of course , is whether we do want to be in the know .
there are people who do n't - they already know everything , without studying the islam .
who does n't want to know ?
for one , the fundamental christians who take everything the bible says literally and say they do n't need any other religions .
then there are the very secular people , dogmatists of laicism .
they get worked up simply when the word religion is mentioned , and they think that we should not talk about it in schools .
they have issues with the fact that religion , again , is a powerful factor in world history .
according to a survey , not christianity but buddhism is the most likeable religion for germans .
how do you explain that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .
it is a religion that 's turned to the inside and that emphasizes meditation .
it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .
of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .
even though islam is seen skeptically throughout europe , it attracts many , especially young people , around the globe .
there are 1.3 billion muslims , with an upward trend .
from rabat to damascus there are islamic groups that are becoming increasingly important politically .
why is that so ?
are there religious or social reasons for this ?
both .
those are religious groups that help people .
many muslims in those countries feel that the ruling elites have a life of their own and do n't take care of the population at large .
the fundamental islamist groups - or whatever you want to call them - try very hard to do something for people .
they take care of schools and education , and they give people clothes and food .
why did hamas win the elections -lsb- in the palestinian territories -rsb- ?
because they worked for the people .
one of the biggest mistakes of western politics - germany included , by the way - was to not accept those elections .
instead , fingers were pointed , saying : " you have to accept israel ! "
tell that to people that have been terrorized by an occupying power for decades .
that is not the right way to solve those problems .
you have to realize that there are parties that do have islam as a basis , yet they campaign for the people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate young muslims make themselves available for terrorist attacks a better example is the party of prime minister erdogan in turkey .
why did they win ?
because they helped people .
they showed - with all weaknesses that they have - that they will bring their country forward and in no way did they develop an islamic theocracy , such as the one in iran .
they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .
how far would the willingness to negotiate with the radical powers have to go ?
would one have to negotiate with the taliban and al qaeda as well ?
you can not negotiate with al qaeda .
it is a secret terrorist group .
you can only dry them up .
but the west has watered them so much that they could sprout .
the american secret service recently admitted in secret documents that the iraq war only helped al qaeda .
before , there was no al qaeda in iraq .
you could certainly negotiate with the taliban .
they are n't just crazy people .
there are some extremists , and there are , on the other hand , those that warned the bush administration about sept .
11 .
but it was n't taken seriously .
there were chieftains in afghanistan that warned against marching in with an army .
a personal question : on sept .
12 you will introduce your autobiography " controversial truth . "
if you look back , are you still as optimistic as you were in 1990 when you wrote " global responsibility : in search of a new world ethic " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen after bush ?
when i wrote the book in 1990 , of course , one hoped that in the future , problems would not be solved with military means , with aggression and animosity and war , but instead - just like it worked in western and eastern europe - through mutual understanding , cooperation and integration .
unfortunately , this was disrupted by the mad policies that the second bush administration initiated with a clique of archconservative jewish intellectuals , so-called neocons and protestant fundamentalists .
i am not an enemy , but a friend of the americans .
i hope that , despite the backlash that the policies of bush jr. brought on , americans can remember their great democratic tradition and lead in terms of international understanding , moderation and world peace .
were you hurt that pope benedict xvi never accepted your idea of the world ethic ?
he accepted the idea as such .
he realizes that there have to be common ethical standards .
during our conversation he conceded that those standards need to be valid for believers and non-believers .
one could only have expected that he would personally advocate this .
but that might still happen . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de : civil society is taking on the traditional responsibilities of political parties , which seem powerless in the face of global trends .
what future do political parties have in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detmar doering detmar doering : i do n't think parties are really powerless in the face of global trends .
it 's true that non-governmental organizations do dominate the international political agenda today while political parties only influence international political institutions in an indirect manner .
but i do n't think you can underestimate that influence .
since parties are anchored institutions in germany , they will continue to exist and play an important role in our country .
but if they want to continue to play an important role in citizens ' perceptions and justify their legitimacy through it , they need to change their work and make it more open .
what form could the changes take ?
for instance , through project-related , temporary party membership that corresponds to the desire for getting involved without being forced to make a permanent commitment .
or by intensifying their internet presence , which offers a dialog form of communication .
it 's equally important to credibly build up a party base - for instance through support networks .
a fundamental factor includes " external conditions " or , in other words , the electoral rules .
the american experiment in " term limits " deserves our attention at the very least .
in that way you can get rid of the outdated personnel structures that damage the image of politics .
parties are constantly losing members .
young people are said to be uninterested in politics .
for years , there 's been talk of voter apathy .
there 's no doubt that the number of political party organizations is slipping .
the public image of political parties has sharply dropped in the past years .
that may have to do with other political alternatives in civil society that increasingly and credibly compete with parties for committed citizens .
but that 's a sign of maturity in a pluralist society rather than a blemish .
competition revives business .
the consequence must be that parties make an effort to be more attractive to voters .
liberal positions in business are now represented by the conservatives , and even the social democrats increasingly appeal to the responsibility of each individual in their political messages .
do you think there 's room for a liberal party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle heads germany 's fdp it 's definitely good if you can find a certain basic liberal consensus in all parties , because otherwise democracy would be seriously threatened .
but that 's not enough .
we are n't currently seeing an open rejection of liberal principles , but there 's certainly a creeping erosion of freedoms .
economic liberalization - though it 's more important than ever - no longer exists .
the big brother state has begun to take on grotesque proportions , a paternalistic idea of the state that wants to steer lifestyles and behavior is taking shape .
internationally , liberal politics is on the retreat as shown by protectionist tendencies in the eu , the wrangling over the doha round of world trade -lsb- organization -rsb- talks and the ideological rollback in a few latin american countries .
in such a context , there 's no doubt that you need an overtly liberal party .
it 's no secret that there are political contacts between the christian conservatives , the green party and the fdp .
do you think germany could in the future get a governing coalition made up of the three ?
in the end it 's the voter who decides which constellation is feasible .
in theory , it should be possible to have coalitions between all democratic parties .
but there is a tendency that three-party coalitions can be plagued by infighting , more than two-party ones .
in light of the current reform chaos in germany , what 's needed is political action .
besides , being part of the government is not an end in itself .
you should only take part in a coalition if you can really achieve more freedom for all citizens .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.09.2007 as subsidies dry up , german miners watch a way of life ebb großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miners have demonstrated against ending the subsidies - to no avail chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet decided last month to stop subsidizing the country 's hard-coal mining industry in 2018 .
for miners , it means a beloved tradition and a way of life is coming to an end . on a recent wednesday morning , benno henschen 's alarm clock went off at 3:10 a.m.
he drove 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- to a non-descript complex of buildings near the leafy small town of voerde , changed into his work clothes , and promptly descended 820 meters -lrb- 2,690 feet -rrb- under the earth . it is the start of the early shift for henschen , 49 , who will spend the next seven hours overseeing the machines that extract the hard coal that turned this region in western germany , near the ruhr and rhine rivers , into germany 's industrial heartland and powered its comeback from the ashes of world war ii . " i have always loved being a miner , and i still do , " said henschen , who was just 14 when he went down into his first mining pit .
" but i 'm worried about the future . " henschen is a member of a profession whose days appear limited in germany .
while there were once over 100 pits at the hard-coal mining industry 's peak in the 1950s , today there are only eight such mines left in germany .
the ruhr region 's centuries-old mining history means it is necessary to go further and further underground to reach unexhausted coal seams .
stringent safety measures and high-labor costs have also added to the cost of german hard coal .
at around 180 euros -lrb- $ 248 -rrb- per ton , it costs more than three times the global market price . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun is setting on the german hard-coal mining industry but for decades , german lawmakers have propped up the industry with large-scale subsidies .
right now , federal and regional governments pump 2.5 billion euros a year into hard-coal mining . " the markets are international , our energy supplies are secure , and so there 's no reason to use public money to subsidize hard-coal mining , " said oliver wittke , minister for building and transport for the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the ruhr region , and henschen 's mine , are located .
" it is far too expensive . " but to henschen , the bottom line should not be the only consideration . " expensive is not always the most costly , " he said .
to him , what germany will be giving up when the mines close has a value that you ca n't put a euro-sign on . family tradition henschen is the third generation in his family to go into mining .
his grandfather , who he never knew , was a pitman .
his father was too , working in the late ' 50s during the industry 's heyday , when the ruhr area was a cauldron of smokestacks , steel factories and rumbling hard-coal conveyor belts which fed them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mine workers leave the elevator at the mine in voerde mining was in his blood , and really was all he ever knew , or saw .
miners lived mostly together in settlements often not far from the pits .
after the gritty shifts spent together far underground , miners would often spend their free time together and raise their families next door to one another . " the hard work underground welded us together , you could say , " said henschen .
" we respect one another , have to depend on one another .
it 's not like in other jobs . " miners , he said , are part of a tightly knit social fabric that is unraveling because of government decisions he thinks are wrong .
but that fabric has already been badly frayed by layoffs .
today there are 34,000 miners , down from 607,000 in 1970 . engine of integration ali sen , 39 , is in his 24th year as a miner , but is now spending time above ground in the public relations office of dsk , the company which manages germany 's remaining hard-coal mines , learning another side of the business , one that might have more of a future . his father was a miner in turkey before coming to germany as a so-called " guest worker , " bringing his family over when sen was two .
the strong sense of social cohesion among miners extended to relations between turks and germans , according to sen. while the integration of germany 's large turkish community into the large society is still seen as problematic , sen said with miners , ethnicity was never an issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long history : miners in 1880 " i do n't think these groups get along anywhere in german better than in the ruhr region , " he said .
" we live side by side , play together in soccer clubs , it 's exemplary . " both he and henschen said closing mines could further weaken the ruhr area 's economy - the mine in voerde , where they both work , is scheduled to close next year .
other businesses in the area , some of which depend on miners ' patronage , will suffer . " where mines have been closed , you notice the neighborhoods that bore the brunt of it have n't bounced back even after 20 or 30 years , " sen said .
" they might not quite be ghettos , but stores are closed and people do n't have money to buy . " structural change the ruhr region 's economy has been hard hit by the progressive shuttering of its heavy industry since the 1960s and successive waves of large-scale layoffs .
by the end of the 1990s , the once prosperous region had turned into a landscape of rusting industrial ruins , environmental degradation and dwindling hopes .
unemployment once reached 19 percent , although that number now stands at 14.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a light show at the repurposed mining tower , zollverein the region is now embarking on an economic redevelopment program that sees it moving away from heavy industry like steel and coal and toward the logistics , chemicals and service sectors .
the region will be one of europe 's cultural capitals for 2010 , and some of its industrial skeletons , like unused mining shaft towers , deserted factories , and silo-like gasometers , have already been turned into cultural spaces for exhibitions or performances . much ado about little ? some argue that miners ' complaints are exaggerated .
the agreement on ending the subsidies provides a " soft landing " for the workers and the federal and state governments will spend an estimated 21.6 billion euros over the next 11 years .
options for miners include retraining programs , job-search help , and start-up money for those wishing to become self-employed .
those who have 25 years underground can retire at 49 . " we are doing a lot for our miners , " said christof beike , a spokesman for dsk . but for those like henschen , used to the security mining once brought , that is cold comfort .
and even more then the end of an industry , it 's the end of a tradition and a life that might have been hard on the body , but was good for the soul . " now families are losing their bearings and the solidarity of our communities is being pulled apart , " he said .

he drove 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- to a non-descript complex of buildings near the leafy small town of voerde , changed into his work clothes , and promptly descended 820 meters -lrb- 2,690 feet -rrb- under the earth . it is the start of the early shift for henschen , 49 , who will spend the next seven hours overseeing the machines that extract the hard coal that turned this region in western germany , near the ruhr and rhine rivers , into germany 's industrial heartland and powered its comeback from the ashes of world war ii . " i have always loved being a miner , and i still do , " said henschen , who was just 14 when he went down into his first mining pit .
" but i 'm worried about the future . " henschen is a member of a profession whose days appear limited in germany .
while there were once over 100 pits at the hard-coal mining industry 's peak in the 1950s , today there are only eight such mines left in germany .
the ruhr region 's centuries-old mining history means it is necessary to go further and further underground to reach unexhausted coal seams .
stringent safety measures and high-labor costs have also added to the cost of german hard coal .
at around 180 euros -lrb- $ 248 -rrb- per ton , it costs more than three times the global market price . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun is setting on the german hard-coal mining industry but for decades , german lawmakers have propped up the industry with large-scale subsidies .
right now , federal and regional governments pump 2.5 billion euros a year into hard-coal mining . " the markets are international , our energy supplies are secure , and so there 's no reason to use public money to subsidize hard-coal mining , " said oliver wittke , minister for building and transport for the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the ruhr region , and henschen 's mine , are located .
" it is far too expensive . " but to henschen , the bottom line should not be the only consideration . " expensive is not always the most costly , " he said .
to him , what germany will be giving up when the mines close has a value that you ca n't put a euro-sign on . family tradition henschen is the third generation in his family to go into mining .
his grandfather , who he never knew , was a pitman .
his father was too , working in the late ' 50s during the industry 's heyday , when the ruhr area was a cauldron of smokestacks , steel factories and rumbling hard-coal conveyor belts which fed them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mine workers leave the elevator at the mine in voerde mining was in his blood , and really was all he ever knew , or saw .
miners lived mostly together in settlements often not far from the pits .
after the gritty shifts spent together far underground , miners would often spend their free time together and raise their families next door to one another . " the hard work underground welded us together , you could say , " said henschen .
" we respect one another , have to depend on one another .
it 's not like in other jobs . " miners , he said , are part of a tightly knit social fabric that is unraveling because of government decisions he thinks are wrong .
but that fabric has already been badly frayed by layoffs .
today there are 34,000 miners , down from 607,000 in 1970 . engine of integration ali sen , 39 , is in his 24th year as a miner , but is now spending time above ground in the public relations office of dsk , the company which manages germany 's remaining hard-coal mines , learning another side of the business , one that might have more of a future . his father was a miner in turkey before coming to germany as a so-called " guest worker , " bringing his family over when sen was two .
the strong sense of social cohesion among miners extended to relations between turks and germans , according to sen. while the integration of germany 's large turkish community into the large society is still seen as problematic , sen said with miners , ethnicity was never an issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long history : miners in 1880 " i do n't think these groups get along anywhere in german better than in the ruhr region , " he said .
" we live side by side , play together in soccer clubs , it 's exemplary . " both he and henschen said closing mines could further weaken the ruhr area 's economy - the mine in voerde , where they both work , is scheduled to close next year .
other businesses in the area , some of which depend on miners ' patronage , will suffer . " where mines have been closed , you notice the neighborhoods that bore the brunt of it have n't bounced back even after 20 or 30 years , " sen said .
" they might not quite be ghettos , but stores are closed and people do n't have money to buy . " structural change the ruhr region 's economy has been hard hit by the progressive shuttering of its heavy industry since the 1960s and successive waves of large-scale layoffs .
by the end of the 1990s , the once prosperous region had turned into a landscape of rusting industrial ruins , environmental degradation and dwindling hopes .
unemployment once reached 19 percent , although that number now stands at 14.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a light show at the repurposed mining tower , zollverein the region is now embarking on an economic redevelopment program that sees it moving away from heavy industry like steel and coal and toward the logistics , chemicals and service sectors .
the region will be one of europe 's cultural capitals for 2010 , and some of its industrial skeletons , like unused mining shaft towers , deserted factories , and silo-like gasometers , have already been turned into cultural spaces for exhibitions or performances . much ado about little ? some argue that miners ' complaints are exaggerated .
the agreement on ending the subsidies provides a " soft landing " for the workers and the federal and state governments will spend an estimated 21.6 billion euros over the next 11 years .
options for miners include retraining programs , job-search help , and start-up money for those wishing to become self-employed .
those who have 25 years underground can retire at 49 . " we are doing a lot for our miners , " said christof beike , a spokesman for dsk . but for those like henschen , used to the security mining once brought , that is cold comfort .
and even more then the end of an industry , it 's the end of a tradition and a life that might have been hard on the body , but was good for the soul . " now families are losing their bearings and the solidarity of our communities is being pulled apart , " he said .

at around 180 euros -lrb- $ 248 -rrb- per ton , it costs more than three times the global market price . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun is setting on the german hard-coal mining industry but for decades , german lawmakers have propped up the industry with large-scale subsidies .
right now , federal and regional governments pump 2.5 billion euros a year into hard-coal mining . " the markets are international , our energy supplies are secure , and so there 's no reason to use public money to subsidize hard-coal mining , " said oliver wittke , minister for building and transport for the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the ruhr region , and henschen 's mine , are located .
" it is far too expensive . " but to henschen , the bottom line should not be the only consideration . " expensive is not always the most costly , " he said .
to him , what germany will be giving up when the mines close has a value that you ca n't put a euro-sign on . family tradition henschen is the third generation in his family to go into mining .
his grandfather , who he never knew , was a pitman .
his father was too , working in the late ' 50s during the industry 's heyday , when the ruhr area was a cauldron of smokestacks , steel factories and rumbling hard-coal conveyor belts which fed them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mine workers leave the elevator at the mine in voerde mining was in his blood , and really was all he ever knew , or saw .
miners lived mostly together in settlements often not far from the pits .
after the gritty shifts spent together far underground , miners would often spend their free time together and raise their families next door to one another . " the hard work underground welded us together , you could say , " said henschen .
" we respect one another , have to depend on one another .
it 's not like in other jobs . " miners , he said , are part of a tightly knit social fabric that is unraveling because of government decisions he thinks are wrong .
but that fabric has already been badly frayed by layoffs .
today there are 34,000 miners , down from 607,000 in 1970 . engine of integration ali sen , 39 , is in his 24th year as a miner , but is now spending time above ground in the public relations office of dsk , the company which manages germany 's remaining hard-coal mines , learning another side of the business , one that might have more of a future . his father was a miner in turkey before coming to germany as a so-called " guest worker , " bringing his family over when sen was two .
the strong sense of social cohesion among miners extended to relations between turks and germans , according to sen. while the integration of germany 's large turkish community into the large society is still seen as problematic , sen said with miners , ethnicity was never an issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long history : miners in 1880 " i do n't think these groups get along anywhere in german better than in the ruhr region , " he said .
" we live side by side , play together in soccer clubs , it 's exemplary . " both he and henschen said closing mines could further weaken the ruhr area 's economy - the mine in voerde , where they both work , is scheduled to close next year .
other businesses in the area , some of which depend on miners ' patronage , will suffer . " where mines have been closed , you notice the neighborhoods that bore the brunt of it have n't bounced back even after 20 or 30 years , " sen said .
" they might not quite be ghettos , but stores are closed and people do n't have money to buy . " structural change the ruhr region 's economy has been hard hit by the progressive shuttering of its heavy industry since the 1960s and successive waves of large-scale layoffs .

for miners , it means a beloved tradition and a way of life is coming to an end . on a recent wednesday morning , benno henschen 's alarm clock went off at 3:10 a.m.
he drove 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- to a non-descript complex of buildings near the leafy small town of voerde , changed into his work clothes , and promptly descended 820 meters -lrb- 2,690 feet -rrb- under the earth . it is the start of the early shift for henschen , 49 , who will spend the next seven hours overseeing the machines that extract the hard coal that turned this region in western germany , near the ruhr and rhine rivers , into germany 's industrial heartland and powered its comeback from the ashes of world war ii . " i have always loved being a miner , and i still do , " said henschen , who was just 14 when he went down into his first mining pit .
" but i 'm worried about the future . " henschen is a member of a profession whose days appear limited in germany .
while there were once over 100 pits at the hard-coal mining industry 's peak in the 1950s , today there are only eight such mines left in germany .
the ruhr region 's centuries-old mining history means it is necessary to go further and further underground to reach unexhausted coal seams .
stringent safety measures and high-labor costs have also added to the cost of german hard coal .
at around 180 euros -lrb- $ 248 -rrb- per ton , it costs more than three times the global market price . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun is setting on the german hard-coal mining industry but for decades , german lawmakers have propped up the industry with large-scale subsidies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.09.2007 german tv sacks talk show host for praising nazi family politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman , herself a professional , thinks women are better suited for staying at home germany 's public broadcaster ard fired its well-known talk show host and controversial book author eva herman after she praised nazi family politics .
herman said on monday her statements were taken out of context . " mrs. herman 's authorial activities are in our view no longer compatible with her role as a television news reader and talk show host , " said volker herres , program director for german public network ard 's northern division norddeutscher rundfunk -lrb- ndr -rrb- , in a statement on the network 's web site . he also said that some guests had canceled their appearances on herman 's talk show in response to her public statements on motherhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in nazi germany received monetary incentives and medals for child-bearing herman , 48 , who already ruffled feathers last year by arguing that women should raise children rather than pursue careers of their own , was quoted by the media as speaking in glowing terms about the family values that were nurtured in the nazi era . " it was a gruesome time with a totally crazy and highly dangerous leader who led the germans into ruin as we all know , " herman said . " but there was at the time also something good , and that is the values , that is the children , that is the families , that is a togetherness - it was all abolished , there was nothing left . " herman 's new book " the noah 's ark principle : why we must save the family " -lrb- available in german -rrb- is a follow-up to her 2006 bestseller " the eva principle : for a new femininity . " in both books , herman openly discredits the merits of emancipation and mourns the loss of traditional gender roles that assigned women to the safe and comforting spot by the kitchen stove . motherhood crusade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women juggle their careers with obligations at home herman told bild newspaper on monday that she did n't understand why there was so much commotion about her views . " i expressly distanced myself from the ' third reich ' at several points , " herman said .
" one has to put my statement into its overall context .
this is n't about hitler 's values , but about basic human values , which were abused in the ' third reich ' and later abolished . " by praising the third reich family values , however , herman managed to raise the scandal bar to unprecedented heights . while it is true that the nazis offered incentives to child-bearing women , their family policies were an integral part of their racist ideology whose goal was the creation of a master race . " frau herman should know that what characterized the third reich was n't how mothers were treated , because they were just meant to produce cannon fodder , " author and holocaust survivor ralph giordano told bild . " what characterized it was the gas chambers . " preaching , not practicing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for almost two decades , herman was one of germany 's most popular news presenters married for the fourth time , having one child and - until now - a stellar television career that included 18 years of hosting germany 's premiere tv news show tageschau - eva herman was an unlikely candidate for a champion of antiquated gender roles . she proved , however , that one does n't have to practice what one preaches and that a successful career woman can tell other women that what they really want is to keep quiet and cook . " in eva herman 's case , even those of us who are women 's rights activists want her to return home to her kitchen stove , " said renate künast , a prominent member of the opposition green party . it is unlikely , however , that herman , who was often voted in the past as germany 's favorite news presenter , will get a chance to become a stay-at-home mom that she never was .
as a proponent of an ultra-conservative , pre-feminist fantasy world in which marriage , obedience and motherhood are considered the ultimate forms of self-fulfillment , she seems busier than ever . " frau herman is free to carry on her ' motherhood crusade , ' but this is no longer compatible with her role as an ndr tv presenter , " herres said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is our common wish ... that we get more transparency in financial markets , " chancellor angela merkel said after a regular informal meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy at a government guest house north of berlin .
she said that , along with fair trade and fair competition , that " must be a common european concern . "
the two leaders issued a joint statement in which they stressed that " open markets are the guarantor of europe 's prosperity and development . "
merkel noted that germany had made market transparency a key theme both during its european union presidency in the first six months of the year and during its year-long presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
" we have always had backing from the french side on this , " she added .
the chancellor called for a coordinated european approach .
" we must have as coherent an approach as possible , " she said , and added that the issue was not " arbitrary regulation but how europe can create conditions that others have . "

europe could not allow itself to be the venue " where the rest of the world comes to help itself , " sarkozy continued , stressing that his aim was " not protectionism , but reciprocity " with countries like the united states and china .
referring to the failure of international rating agencies to spot the looming us sub-prime mortgage crisis , merkel said the german government had been unable to explain to the population how nobody knew beforehand and why ordinary people were now facing the consequences .
other issues discussed by the two leaders included the energy sector in europe and a proposed " council of wise men " which would debate the future of the eu in the medium term .
merkel said it had not yet been decided who would sit on the council , and sarkozy said its aims were to sketch out how europe should evolve over the next 30 years .

" i would like france and germany to have similar ambitions , " sarkozy said atomic power meets about 40 percent of france 's energy needs , whereas germany plans to phase out nuclear energy gradually and mothball the last of its 17 reactors by about 2020 .
merkel responded by saying that she supported the continuation of the nuclear power joint venture between german industrial group siemens and french nuclear group areva np .
" i am of course interested in a deeper german-french cooperation , " she said .
sarkozy said , " we will strengthen our cooperation further , " adding that " nuclear energy is the power of the future ...

" it is our common wish ... that we get more transparency in financial markets , " chancellor angela merkel said after a regular informal meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy at a government guest house north of berlin .
she said that , along with fair trade and fair competition , that " must be a common european concern . "
the two leaders issued a joint statement in which they stressed that " open markets are the guarantor of europe 's prosperity and development . "
merkel noted that germany had made market transparency a key theme both during its european union presidency in the first six months of the year and during its year-long presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
" we have always had backing from the french side on this , " she added .
the chancellor called for a coordinated european approach .
" we must have as coherent an approach as possible , " she said , and added that the issue was not " arbitrary regulation but how europe can create conditions that others have . "
leaders target transparency and speculators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel kiss as they meet at schloss meseberg taking the fight to the speculators , sarkozy stated that he was " not against competition , but against speculation . " the french president added , " i am for the market economy , i am for globalization , but i am not for speculation . "
europe could not allow itself to be the venue " where the rest of the world comes to help itself , " sarkozy continued , stressing that his aim was " not protectionism , but reciprocity " with countries like the united states and china .
referring to the failure of international rating agencies to spot the looming us sub-prime mortgage crisis , merkel said the german government had been unable to explain to the population how nobody knew beforehand and why ordinary people were now facing the consequences .
other issues discussed by the two leaders included the energy sector in europe and a proposed " council of wise men " which would debate the future of the eu in the medium term .
merkel said it had not yet been decided who would sit on the council , and sarkozy said its aims were to sketch out how europe should evolve over the next 30 years .
nuclear power partnership apparently on course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france wants germany to follow its nuclear example on energy , sarkozy urged germany to follow france 's example of relying strongly on nuclear power for its energy needs .
" i would like france and germany to have similar ambitions , " sarkozy said atomic power meets about 40 percent of france 's energy needs , whereas germany plans to phase out nuclear energy gradually and mothball the last of its 17 reactors by about 2020 .
merkel responded by saying that she supported the continuation of the nuclear power joint venture between german industrial group siemens and french nuclear group areva np .
" i am of course interested in a deeper german-french cooperation , " she said .
sarkozy said , " we will strengthen our cooperation further , " adding that " nuclear energy is the power of the future ...
france is willing to work in concert with companies and siemens is already present . "
no mention of french plans for siemens it was reported in july that sarkozy planned to use an option to buy out siemens 's 34 percent stake in the nuclear power joint venture with state-controlled areva and forge a major national energy company .

" it is our common wish ... that we get more transparency in financial markets , " chancellor angela merkel said after a regular informal meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy at a government guest house north of berlin .
she said that , along with fair trade and fair competition , that " must be a common european concern . "
the two leaders issued a joint statement in which they stressed that " open markets are the guarantor of europe 's prosperity and development . "
merkel noted that germany had made market transparency a key theme both during its european union presidency in the first six months of the year and during its year-long presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
" we have always had backing from the french side on this , " she added .
the chancellor called for a coordinated european approach .
" we must have as coherent an approach as possible , " she said , and added that the issue was not " arbitrary regulation but how europe can create conditions that others have . "
leaders target transparency and speculators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel kiss as they meet at schloss meseberg taking the fight to the speculators , sarkozy stated that he was " not against competition , but against speculation . " the french president added , " i am for the market economy , i am for globalization , but i am not for speculation . "
europe could not allow itself to be the venue " where the rest of the world comes to help itself , " sarkozy continued , stressing that his aim was " not protectionism , but reciprocity " with countries like the united states and china .
referring to the failure of international rating agencies to spot the looming us sub-prime mortgage crisis , merkel said the german government had been unable to explain to the population how nobody knew beforehand and why ordinary people were now facing the consequences .
other issues discussed by the two leaders included the energy sector in europe and a proposed " council of wise men " which would debate the future of the eu in the medium term .
merkel said it had not yet been decided who would sit on the council , and sarkozy said its aims were to sketch out how europe should evolve over the next 30 years .
nuclear power partnership apparently on course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france wants germany to follow its nuclear example on energy , sarkozy urged germany to follow france 's example of relying strongly on nuclear power for its energy needs .
" i would like france and germany to have similar ambitions , " sarkozy said atomic power meets about 40 percent of france 's energy needs , whereas germany plans to phase out nuclear energy gradually and mothball the last of its 17 reactors by about 2020 .
merkel responded by saying that she supported the continuation of the nuclear power joint venture between german industrial group siemens and french nuclear group areva np .
" i am of course interested in a deeper german-french cooperation , " she said .
sarkozy said , " we will strengthen our cooperation further , " adding that " nuclear energy is the power of the future ...
france is willing to work in concert with companies and siemens is already present . "
no mention of french plans for siemens it was reported in july that sarkozy planned to use an option to buy out siemens 's 34 percent stake in the nuclear power joint venture with state-controlled areva and forge a major national energy company .

gabriel said the united nations climate conference being held in bali in december should provide the " starting signal " for comprehensive talks on a new climate agreement for the period after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol runs out .
this had to contain a long-term goal , ambitious and obligatory commitments from the industrialized world , and fair contributions from the larger developing countries , he said .
" under the gleneagles dialogue we are working at making investment in climate protection technologies more attractive , " gabriel said .
the gleneagles dialogue was set up at the g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland in 2005 .
apart from the g8 - the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , canada , italy and russia - large developing economies like china , brazil and australia are also participating .

on the other side of the argument , the industrialized nations point to new powerhouses like china and india , saying that pollution problems there are home-made .

" many industrialized countries believe that the developing countries are unwilling and that they are doing too little , " the former norwegian prime minister and world health organization head said .
" many developing countries believe that the industrialized world has defaulted on the promise of financial and technology assistance , " she added .
industrialized nations urged to cut emissions the global leadership for climate action , comprising former prominent leaders , called for industrialized countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent over the period 1990 to 2050 .
the united states should commit itself to this goal , said the organization 's presidents , former chilean president ricardo lagos and the president of the un foundation , former us senator timothy e wirth .
the organization also stated that major developing countries like china and india should cut their energy use by 30 per cent by 2020 as a first step .

" here in germany , you know how difficult it is to reach a consensus on sensitive issues among our 16 states , " he said .
" you can imagine what a hard task it is to find common ground among the over 200 nations involved in the climate protection process .
there ’ s not even agreement yet among the signatories to the kyoto protocol on reductions in co2 emissions that negotiations on a follow-up treaty are needed .

gabriel said the united nations climate conference being held in bali in december should provide the " starting signal " for comprehensive talks on a new climate agreement for the period after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol runs out .
this had to contain a long-term goal , ambitious and obligatory commitments from the industrialized world , and fair contributions from the larger developing countries , he said .
" under the gleneagles dialogue we are working at making investment in climate protection technologies more attractive , " gabriel said .
the gleneagles dialogue was set up at the g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland in 2005 .
apart from the g8 - the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , canada , italy and russia - large developing economies like china , brazil and australia are also participating .
the first day of the conference ended with many delegates making positive noises about the possible outcome of the two-day meeting .
polluters reaping what they sow , say poorer nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries blame the industrialized nations however , behind-the-scenes , the finger-pointing was still far from over with developing countries saying that climate protection should be an issue for the industrialized nations which caused all the large-scale pollution in the first place and which are leaving the poorer countries to deal with the consequences .
on the other side of the argument , the industrialized nations point to new powerhouses like china and india , saying that pollution problems there are home-made .
attending the conference in berlin , gro harlem brundtland , the un special envoy on climate change , spoke of this " deep-rooted lack of trust between the industrialized and developing countries . "
" many industrialized countries believe that the developing countries are unwilling and that they are doing too little , " the former norwegian prime minister and world health organization head said .
" many developing countries believe that the industrialized world has defaulted on the promise of financial and technology assistance , " she added .
industrialized nations urged to cut emissions the global leadership for climate action , comprising former prominent leaders , called for industrialized countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent over the period 1990 to 2050 .
the united states should commit itself to this goal , said the organization 's presidents , former chilean president ricardo lagos and the president of the un foundation , former us senator timothy e wirth .
the organization also stated that major developing countries like china and india should cut their energy use by 30 per cent by 2020 as a first step .
from 2021 these countries should commit themselves to binding emission targets .

" here in germany , you know how difficult it is to reach a consensus on sensitive issues among our 16 states , " he said .
" you can imagine what a hard task it is to find common ground among the over 200 nations involved in the climate protection process .
there ’ s not even agreement yet among the signatories to the kyoto protocol on reductions in co2 emissions that negotiations on a follow-up treaty are needed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the return of religion in search of germany 's religious identity ex-muslims demand right to renounce islamic faith promises of miracles attract millions to nigeria 's churches most european nations keep god out of constitution religion -pipe- 10.09.2007 theologian küng : christianity gets on many people 's nerves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : küng : religion can co-exist with democracy for catholic theologian hans küng , religion has again become a power factor .
while islam and buddhism are getting more popular , christianity is n't .
the controversial theologian spoke to dw-world.de about the reasons . born in 1928 , catholic theologian and church critic hans küng made his mark as a promoter of dialogue between religions and as president of the global ethic foundation .
in 1979 , the vatican withdrew his license to teach after the swiss native questioned the infallibility of the pope .
in the fall of 2005 , pope benedict xvi invited küng to a private meeting .
dw-world.de : professor küng , people - and not only in germany - are again enormously interested in religious issues .
can we speak of a return of religions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran in 1979 : ayatollah chomeini is back from exile hans küng : " return of religions " - that is an ambivalent term .
religion never disappeared .
just like music , religion is something that stays , even if it is suppressed for some time .
it is true , that since the new awakening of islam , since the creation of the islamic republic of iran in 1979 , europeans have realized that they do n't rule the world by themselves .
for a long time , secular europe had not realized that it was an exception , and that elsewhere , religions is a power .
" no peace among the nations , without peace between the religions !
no peace between the religions without dialog between the religions ! "
those are two central sentences of your world ethic principle .
in a time of globalization , there are many undreamed-of possibilities for communication on the internet .
the access to knowledge is easier than ever before .
can this development improve the dialog of religions ?
in principle , i would say yes , even though this brings many problems .
it 's a positive thing that today we can know a lot about other religions .
a different question , of course , is whether we do want to be in the know .
there are people who do n't - they already know everything , without studying the islam .
who does n't want to know ?
for one , the fundamental christians who take everything the bible says literally and say they do n't need any other religions .
then there are the very secular people , dogmatists of laicism .
they get worked up simply when the word religion is mentioned , and they think that we should not talk about it in schools .
they have issues with the fact that religion , again , is a powerful factor in world history .
according to a survey , not christianity but buddhism is the most likeable religion for germans .
how do you explain that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .
it is a religion that 's turned to the inside and that emphasizes meditation .
it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .
of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .
even though islam is seen skeptically throughout europe , it attracts many , especially young people , around the globe .
there are 1.3 billion muslims , with an upward trend .
from rabat to damascus there are islamic groups that are becoming increasingly important politically .
why is that so ?
are there religious or social reasons for this ?
both .
those are religious groups that help people .
many muslims in those countries feel that the ruling elites have a life of their own and do n't take care of the population at large .
the fundamental islamist groups - or whatever you want to call them - try very hard to do something for people .
they take care of schools and education , and they give people clothes and food .
why did hamas win the elections -lsb- in the palestinian territories -rsb- ?
because they worked for the people .
one of the biggest mistakes of western politics - germany included , by the way - was to not accept those elections .
instead , fingers were pointed , saying : " you have to accept israel ! "
tell that to people that have been terrorized by an occupying power for decades .
that is not the right way to solve those problems .
you have to realize that there are parties that do have islam as a basis , yet they campaign for the people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate young muslims make themselves available for terrorist attacks a better example is the party of prime minister erdogan in turkey .
why did they win ?
because they helped people .
they showed - with all weaknesses that they have - that they will bring their country forward and in no way did they develop an islamic theocracy , such as the one in iran .
they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .
how far would the willingness to negotiate with the radical powers have to go ?
would one have to negotiate with the taliban and al qaeda as well ?
you can not negotiate with al qaeda .
it is a secret terrorist group .
you can only dry them up .
but the west has watered them so much that they could sprout .
the american secret service recently admitted in secret documents that the iraq war only helped al qaeda .
before , there was no al qaeda in iraq .
you could certainly negotiate with the taliban .
they are n't just crazy people .
there are some extremists , and there are , on the other hand , those that warned the bush administration about sept .
11 .
but it was n't taken seriously .
there were chieftains in afghanistan that warned against marching in with an army .
a personal question : on sept .
12 you will introduce your autobiography " controversial truth . "
if you look back , are you still as optimistic as you were in 1990 when you wrote " global responsibility : in search of a new world ethic " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen after bush ?
when i wrote the book in 1990 , of course , one hoped that in the future , problems would not be solved with military means , with aggression and animosity and war , but instead - just like it worked in western and eastern europe - through mutual understanding , cooperation and integration .
unfortunately , this was disrupted by the mad policies that the second bush administration initiated with a clique of archconservative jewish intellectuals , so-called neocons and protestant fundamentalists .
i am not an enemy , but a friend of the americans .
i hope that , despite the backlash that the policies of bush jr. brought on , americans can remember their great democratic tradition and lead in terms of international understanding , moderation and world peace .
were you hurt that pope benedict xvi never accepted your idea of the world ethic ?
he accepted the idea as such .
he realizes that there have to be common ethical standards .
during our conversation he conceded that those standards need to be valid for believers and non-believers .
one could only have expected that he would personally advocate this .
but that might still happen . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the return of religion in search of germany 's religious identity ex-muslims demand right to renounce islamic faith promises of miracles attract millions to nigeria 's churches most european nations keep god out of constitution religion -pipe- 10.09.2007 theologian küng : christianity gets on many people 's nerves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : küng : religion can co-exist with democracy for catholic theologian hans küng , religion has again become a power factor .
while islam and buddhism are getting more popular , christianity is n't .
the controversial theologian spoke to dw-world.de about the reasons . born in 1928 , catholic theologian and church critic hans küng made his mark as a promoter of dialogue between religions and as president of the global ethic foundation .
in 1979 , the vatican withdrew his license to teach after the swiss native questioned the infallibility of the pope .
in the fall of 2005 , pope benedict xvi invited küng to a private meeting .
dw-world.de : professor küng , people - and not only in germany - are again enormously interested in religious issues .
can we speak of a return of religions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran in 1979 : ayatollah chomeini is back from exile hans küng : " return of religions " - that is an ambivalent term .
religion never disappeared .
just like music , religion is something that stays , even if it is suppressed for some time .
it is true , that since the new awakening of islam , since the creation of the islamic republic of iran in 1979 , europeans have realized that they do n't rule the world by themselves .
for a long time , secular europe had not realized that it was an exception , and that elsewhere , religions is a power .
" no peace among the nations , without peace between the religions !
no peace between the religions without dialog between the religions ! "
those are two central sentences of your world ethic principle .
in a time of globalization , there are many undreamed-of possibilities for communication on the internet .
the access to knowledge is easier than ever before .
can this development improve the dialog of religions ?
in principle , i would say yes , even though this brings many problems .
it 's a positive thing that today we can know a lot about other religions .
a different question , of course , is whether we do want to be in the know .
there are people who do n't - they already know everything , without studying the islam .
who does n't want to know ?
for one , the fundamental christians who take everything the bible says literally and say they do n't need any other religions .
then there are the very secular people , dogmatists of laicism .
they get worked up simply when the word religion is mentioned , and they think that we should not talk about it in schools .
they have issues with the fact that religion , again , is a powerful factor in world history .
according to a survey , not christianity but buddhism is the most likeable religion for germans .
how do you explain that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .
it is a religion that 's turned to the inside and that emphasizes meditation .
it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .
of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .
even though islam is seen skeptically throughout europe , it attracts many , especially young people , around the globe .
there are 1.3 billion muslims , with an upward trend .
from rabat to damascus there are islamic groups that are becoming increasingly important politically .
why is that so ?
are there religious or social reasons for this ?
both .
those are religious groups that help people .
many muslims in those countries feel that the ruling elites have a life of their own and do n't take care of the population at large .
the fundamental islamist groups - or whatever you want to call them - try very hard to do something for people .
they take care of schools and education , and they give people clothes and food .
why did hamas win the elections -lsb- in the palestinian territories -rsb- ?
because they worked for the people .
one of the biggest mistakes of western politics - germany included , by the way - was to not accept those elections .
instead , fingers were pointed , saying : " you have to accept israel ! "
tell that to people that have been terrorized by an occupying power for decades .
that is not the right way to solve those problems .
you have to realize that there are parties that do have islam as a basis , yet they campaign for the people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate young muslims make themselves available for terrorist attacks a better example is the party of prime minister erdogan in turkey .
why did they win ?
because they helped people .
they showed - with all weaknesses that they have - that they will bring their country forward and in no way did they develop an islamic theocracy , such as the one in iran .
they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .
how far would the willingness to negotiate with the radical powers have to go ?
would one have to negotiate with the taliban and al qaeda as well ?
you can not negotiate with al qaeda .
it is a secret terrorist group .
you can only dry them up .
but the west has watered them so much that they could sprout .
the american secret service recently admitted in secret documents that the iraq war only helped al qaeda .
before , there was no al qaeda in iraq .
you could certainly negotiate with the taliban .
they are n't just crazy people .
there are some extremists , and there are , on the other hand , those that warned the bush administration about sept .
11 .
but it was n't taken seriously .
there were chieftains in afghanistan that warned against marching in with an army .
a personal question : on sept .
12 you will introduce your autobiography " controversial truth . "
if you look back , are you still as optimistic as you were in 1990 when you wrote " global responsibility : in search of a new world ethic " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen after bush ?
when i wrote the book in 1990 , of course , one hoped that in the future , problems would not be solved with military means , with aggression and animosity and war , but instead - just like it worked in western and eastern europe - through mutual understanding , cooperation and integration .
unfortunately , this was disrupted by the mad policies that the second bush administration initiated with a clique of archconservative jewish intellectuals , so-called neocons and protestant fundamentalists .
i am not an enemy , but a friend of the americans .
i hope that , despite the backlash that the policies of bush jr. brought on , americans can remember their great democratic tradition and lead in terms of international understanding , moderation and world peace .
were you hurt that pope benedict xvi never accepted your idea of the world ethic ?
he accepted the idea as such .
he realizes that there have to be common ethical standards .
during our conversation he conceded that those standards need to be valid for believers and non-believers .
one could only have expected that he would personally advocate this .
but that might still happen . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gabriel said the united nations climate conference being held in bali in december should provide the " starting signal " for comprehensive talks on a new climate agreement for the period after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol runs out .
this had to contain a long-term goal , ambitious and obligatory commitments from the industrialized world , and fair contributions from the larger developing countries , he said .
" under the gleneagles dialogue we are working at making investment in climate protection technologies more attractive , " gabriel said .
the gleneagles dialogue was set up at the g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland in 2005 .

" many developing countries believe that the industrialized world has defaulted on the promise of financial and technology assistance , " she added .
industrialized nations urged to cut emissions the global leadership for climate action , comprising former prominent leaders , called for industrialized countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent over the period 1990 to 2050 .

herman said on monday her statements were taken out of context . " mrs. herman 's authorial activities are in our view no longer compatible with her role as a television news reader and talk show host , " said volker herres , program director for german public network ard 's northern division norddeutscher rundfunk -lrb- ndr -rrb- , in a statement on the network 's web site . he also said that some guests had canceled their appearances on herman 's talk show in response to her public statements on motherhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in nazi germany received monetary incentives and medals for child-bearing herman , 48 , who already ruffled feathers last year by arguing that women should raise children rather than pursue careers of their own , was quoted by the media as speaking in glowing terms about the family values that were nurtured in the nazi era . " it was a gruesome time with a totally crazy and highly dangerous leader who led the germans into ruin as we all know , " herman said .

" one has to put my statement into its overall context .
this is n't about hitler 's values , but about basic human values , which were abused in the ' third reich ' and later abolished . " by praising the third reich family values , however , herman managed to raise the scandal bar to unprecedented heights . while it is true that the nazis offered incentives to child-bearing women , their family policies were an integral part of their racist ideology whose goal was the creation of a master race .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany 's political parties in crisis germany 's political parties in crisis cdu puts new twist on conservative politics german parties begin early search for future partners germany 's social democratic party struggles to redefine its role politics -pipe- 10.09.2007 expert says germany 's parties must reinvent themselves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parties need to go beyond eye-catching slogans to attract voters dw-world.de spoke with a political expert about the future of political parties in germany in an era of globalization and the relevance of liberal principles in the political sphere . detmar doering heads the liberal institute of the friedrich naumann foundation for freedom , a think tank of germany 's free-market liberal fdp party .
dw-world.de : civil society is taking on the traditional responsibilities of political parties , which seem powerless in the face of global trends .
what future do political parties have in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detmar doering detmar doering : i do n't think parties are really powerless in the face of global trends .
it 's true that non-governmental organizations do dominate the international political agenda today while political parties only influence international political institutions in an indirect manner .
but i do n't think you can underestimate that influence .
since parties are anchored institutions in germany , they will continue to exist and play an important role in our country .
but if they want to continue to play an important role in citizens ' perceptions and justify their legitimacy through it , they need to change their work and make it more open .
what form could the changes take ?
for instance , through project-related , temporary party membership that corresponds to the desire for getting involved without being forced to make a permanent commitment .
or by intensifying their internet presence , which offers a dialog form of communication .
it 's equally important to credibly build up a party base - for instance through support networks .
a fundamental factor includes " external conditions " or , in other words , the electoral rules .
the american experiment in " term limits " deserves our attention at the very least .
in that way you can get rid of the outdated personnel structures that damage the image of politics .
parties are constantly losing members .
young people are said to be uninterested in politics .
for years , there 's been talk of voter apathy .
there 's no doubt that the number of political party organizations is slipping .
the public image of political parties has sharply dropped in the past years .
that may have to do with other political alternatives in civil society that increasingly and credibly compete with parties for committed citizens .
but that 's a sign of maturity in a pluralist society rather than a blemish .
competition revives business .
the consequence must be that parties make an effort to be more attractive to voters .
liberal positions in business are now represented by the conservatives , and even the social democrats increasingly appeal to the responsibility of each individual in their political messages .
do you think there 's room for a liberal party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle heads germany 's fdp it 's definitely good if you can find a certain basic liberal consensus in all parties , because otherwise democracy would be seriously threatened .
but that 's not enough .
we are n't currently seeing an open rejection of liberal principles , but there 's certainly a creeping erosion of freedoms .
economic liberalization - though it 's more important than ever - no longer exists .
the big brother state has begun to take on grotesque proportions , a paternalistic idea of the state that wants to steer lifestyles and behavior is taking shape .
internationally , liberal politics is on the retreat as shown by protectionist tendencies in the eu , the wrangling over the doha round of world trade -lsb- organization -rsb- talks and the ideological rollback in a few latin american countries .
in such a context , there 's no doubt that you need an overtly liberal party .
it 's no secret that there are political contacts between the christian conservatives , the green party and the fdp .
do you think germany could in the future get a governing coalition made up of the three ?
in the end it 's the voter who decides which constellation is feasible .
in theory , it should be possible to have coalitions between all democratic parties .
but there is a tendency that three-party coalitions can be plagued by infighting , more than two-party ones .
in light of the current reform chaos in germany , what 's needed is political action .
besides , being part of the government is not an end in itself .
you should only take part in a coalition if you can really achieve more freedom for all citizens .

dw-world.de : civil society is taking on the traditional responsibilities of political parties , which seem powerless in the face of global trends .
what future do political parties have in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detmar doering detmar doering : i do n't think parties are really powerless in the face of global trends .
it 's true that non-governmental organizations do dominate the international political agenda today while political parties only influence international political institutions in an indirect manner .
but i do n't think you can underestimate that influence .
since parties are anchored institutions in germany , they will continue to exist and play an important role in our country .
but if they want to continue to play an important role in citizens ' perceptions and justify their legitimacy through it , they need to change their work and make it more open .
what form could the changes take ?
for instance , through project-related , temporary party membership that corresponds to the desire for getting involved without being forced to make a permanent commitment .
or by intensifying their internet presence , which offers a dialog form of communication .
it 's equally important to credibly build up a party base - for instance through support networks .
a fundamental factor includes " external conditions " or , in other words , the electoral rules .
the american experiment in " term limits " deserves our attention at the very least .
in that way you can get rid of the outdated personnel structures that damage the image of politics .
parties are constantly losing members .
young people are said to be uninterested in politics .
for years , there 's been talk of voter apathy .
there 's no doubt that the number of political party organizations is slipping .
the public image of political parties has sharply dropped in the past years .
that may have to do with other political alternatives in civil society that increasingly and credibly compete with parties for committed citizens .
but that 's a sign of maturity in a pluralist society rather than a blemish .
competition revives business .
the consequence must be that parties make an effort to be more attractive to voters .
liberal positions in business are now represented by the conservatives , and even the social democrats increasingly appeal to the responsibility of each individual in their political messages .
do you think there 's room for a liberal party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle heads germany 's fdp it 's definitely good if you can find a certain basic liberal consensus in all parties , because otherwise democracy would be seriously threatened .
but that 's not enough .
we are n't currently seeing an open rejection of liberal principles , but there 's certainly a creeping erosion of freedoms .
economic liberalization - though it 's more important than ever - no longer exists .
the big brother state has begun to take on grotesque proportions , a paternalistic idea of the state that wants to steer lifestyles and behavior is taking shape .
internationally , liberal politics is on the retreat as shown by protectionist tendencies in the eu , the wrangling over the doha round of world trade -lsb- organization -rsb- talks and the ideological rollback in a few latin american countries .
in such a context , there 's no doubt that you need an overtly liberal party .
it 's no secret that there are political contacts between the christian conservatives , the green party and the fdp .

dw-world.de : civil society is taking on the traditional responsibilities of political parties , which seem powerless in the face of global trends .
what future do political parties have in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detmar doering detmar doering : i do n't think parties are really powerless in the face of global trends .
it 's true that non-governmental organizations do dominate the international political agenda today while political parties only influence international political institutions in an indirect manner .
but i do n't think you can underestimate that influence .
since parties are anchored institutions in germany , they will continue to exist and play an important role in our country .
but if they want to continue to play an important role in citizens ' perceptions and justify their legitimacy through it , they need to change their work and make it more open .
what form could the changes take ?
for instance , through project-related , temporary party membership that corresponds to the desire for getting involved without being forced to make a permanent commitment .
or by intensifying their internet presence , which offers a dialog form of communication .
it 's equally important to credibly build up a party base - for instance through support networks .
a fundamental factor includes " external conditions " or , in other words , the electoral rules .
the american experiment in " term limits " deserves our attention at the very least .
in that way you can get rid of the outdated personnel structures that damage the image of politics .
parties are constantly losing members .
young people are said to be uninterested in politics .
for years , there 's been talk of voter apathy .
there 's no doubt that the number of political party organizations is slipping .
the public image of political parties has sharply dropped in the past years .
that may have to do with other political alternatives in civil society that increasingly and credibly compete with parties for committed citizens .
but that 's a sign of maturity in a pluralist society rather than a blemish .
competition revives business .
the consequence must be that parties make an effort to be more attractive to voters .
liberal positions in business are now represented by the conservatives , and even the social democrats increasingly appeal to the responsibility of each individual in their political messages .
do you think there 's room for a liberal party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle heads germany 's fdp it 's definitely good if you can find a certain basic liberal consensus in all parties , because otherwise democracy would be seriously threatened .
but that 's not enough .
we are n't currently seeing an open rejection of liberal principles , but there 's certainly a creeping erosion of freedoms .
economic liberalization - though it 's more important than ever - no longer exists .
the big brother state has begun to take on grotesque proportions , a paternalistic idea of the state that wants to steer lifestyles and behavior is taking shape .
internationally , liberal politics is on the retreat as shown by protectionist tendencies in the eu , the wrangling over the doha round of world trade -lsb- organization -rsb- talks and the ideological rollback in a few latin american countries .
in such a context , there 's no doubt that you need an overtly liberal party .
it 's no secret that there are political contacts between the christian conservatives , the green party and the fdp .
do you think germany could in the future get a governing coalition made up of the three ?
in the end it 's the voter who decides which constellation is feasible .
in theory , it should be possible to have coalitions between all democratic parties .
but there is a tendency that three-party coalitions can be plagued by infighting , more than two-party ones .
in light of the current reform chaos in germany , what 's needed is political action .
besides , being part of the government is not an end in itself .
you should only take part in a coalition if you can really achieve more freedom for all citizens .

" it is our common wish ... that we get more transparency in financial markets , " chancellor angela merkel said after a regular informal meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy at a government guest house north of berlin .
she said that , along with fair trade and fair competition , that " must be a common european concern . "
the two leaders issued a joint statement in which they stressed that " open markets are the guarantor of europe 's prosperity and development . "
merkel noted that germany had made market transparency a key theme both during its european union presidency in the first six months of the year and during its year-long presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
" we have always had backing from the french side on this , " she added .
the chancellor called for a coordinated european approach .
" we must have as coherent an approach as possible , " she said , and added that the issue was not " arbitrary regulation but how europe can create conditions that others have . "
leaders target transparency and speculators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel kiss as they meet at schloss meseberg taking the fight to the speculators , sarkozy stated that he was " not against competition , but against speculation . " the french president added , " i am for the market economy , i am for globalization , but i am not for speculation . "
europe could not allow itself to be the venue " where the rest of the world comes to help itself , " sarkozy continued , stressing that his aim was " not protectionism , but reciprocity " with countries like the united states and china .
referring to the failure of international rating agencies to spot the looming us sub-prime mortgage crisis , merkel said the german government had been unable to explain to the population how nobody knew beforehand and why ordinary people were now facing the consequences .
other issues discussed by the two leaders included the energy sector in europe and a proposed " council of wise men " which would debate the future of the eu in the medium term .
merkel said it had not yet been decided who would sit on the council , and sarkozy said its aims were to sketch out how europe should evolve over the next 30 years .
nuclear power partnership apparently on course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france wants germany to follow its nuclear example on energy , sarkozy urged germany to follow france 's example of relying strongly on nuclear power for its energy needs .
" i would like france and germany to have similar ambitions , " sarkozy said atomic power meets about 40 percent of france 's energy needs , whereas germany plans to phase out nuclear energy gradually and mothball the last of its 17 reactors by about 2020 .
merkel responded by saying that she supported the continuation of the nuclear power joint venture between german industrial group siemens and french nuclear group areva np .
" i am of course interested in a deeper german-french cooperation , " she said .
sarkozy said , " we will strengthen our cooperation further , " adding that " nuclear energy is the power of the future ...
france is willing to work in concert with companies and siemens is already present . "
no mention of french plans for siemens it was reported in july that sarkozy planned to use an option to buy out siemens 's 34 percent stake in the nuclear power joint venture with state-controlled areva and forge a major national energy company .

" it is our common wish ... that we get more transparency in financial markets , " chancellor angela merkel said after a regular informal meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy at a government guest house north of berlin .
she said that , along with fair trade and fair competition , that " must be a common european concern . "
the two leaders issued a joint statement in which they stressed that " open markets are the guarantor of europe 's prosperity and development . "
merkel noted that germany had made market transparency a key theme both during its european union presidency in the first six months of the year and during its year-long presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
" we have always had backing from the french side on this , " she added .
the chancellor called for a coordinated european approach .
" we must have as coherent an approach as possible , " she said , and added that the issue was not " arbitrary regulation but how europe can create conditions that others have . "
leaders target transparency and speculators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel kiss as they meet at schloss meseberg taking the fight to the speculators , sarkozy stated that he was " not against competition , but against speculation . " the french president added , " i am for the market economy , i am for globalization , but i am not for speculation . "
europe could not allow itself to be the venue " where the rest of the world comes to help itself , " sarkozy continued , stressing that his aim was " not protectionism , but reciprocity " with countries like the united states and china .
referring to the failure of international rating agencies to spot the looming us sub-prime mortgage crisis , merkel said the german government had been unable to explain to the population how nobody knew beforehand and why ordinary people were now facing the consequences .
other issues discussed by the two leaders included the energy sector in europe and a proposed " council of wise men " which would debate the future of the eu in the medium term .
merkel said it had not yet been decided who would sit on the council , and sarkozy said its aims were to sketch out how europe should evolve over the next 30 years .
nuclear power partnership apparently on course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france wants germany to follow its nuclear example on energy , sarkozy urged germany to follow france 's example of relying strongly on nuclear power for its energy needs .
" i would like france and germany to have similar ambitions , " sarkozy said atomic power meets about 40 percent of france 's energy needs , whereas germany plans to phase out nuclear energy gradually and mothball the last of its 17 reactors by about 2020 .
merkel responded by saying that she supported the continuation of the nuclear power joint venture between german industrial group siemens and french nuclear group areva np .
" i am of course interested in a deeper german-french cooperation , " she said .
sarkozy said , " we will strengthen our cooperation further , " adding that " nuclear energy is the power of the future ...
france is willing to work in concert with companies and siemens is already present . "
no mention of french plans for siemens it was reported in july that sarkozy planned to use an option to buy out siemens 's 34 percent stake in the nuclear power joint venture with state-controlled areva and forge a major national energy company .

referring to the failure of international rating agencies to spot the looming us sub-prime mortgage crisis , merkel said the german government had been unable to explain to the population how nobody knew beforehand and why ordinary people were now facing the consequences .
other issues discussed by the two leaders included the energy sector in europe and a proposed " council of wise men " which would debate the future of the eu in the medium term .
merkel said it had not yet been decided who would sit on the council , and sarkozy said its aims were to sketch out how europe should evolve over the next 30 years .
nuclear power partnership apparently on course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france wants germany to follow its nuclear example on energy , sarkozy urged germany to follow france 's example of relying strongly on nuclear power for its energy needs .
" i would like france and germany to have similar ambitions , " sarkozy said atomic power meets about 40 percent of france 's energy needs , whereas germany plans to phase out nuclear energy gradually and mothball the last of its 17 reactors by about 2020 .
merkel responded by saying that she supported the continuation of the nuclear power joint venture between german industrial group siemens and french nuclear group areva np .
" i am of course interested in a deeper german-french cooperation , " she said .
sarkozy said , " we will strengthen our cooperation further , " adding that " nuclear energy is the power of the future ...
france is willing to work in concert with companies and siemens is already present . "
no mention of french plans for siemens it was reported in july that sarkozy planned to use an option to buy out siemens 's 34 percent stake in the nuclear power joint venture with state-controlled areva and forge a major national energy company .

gabriel said the united nations climate conference being held in bali in december should provide the " starting signal " for comprehensive talks on a new climate agreement for the period after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol runs out .
this had to contain a long-term goal , ambitious and obligatory commitments from the industrialized world , and fair contributions from the larger developing countries , he said .
" under the gleneagles dialogue we are working at making investment in climate protection technologies more attractive , " gabriel said .
the gleneagles dialogue was set up at the g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland in 2005 .
apart from the g8 - the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , canada , italy and russia - large developing economies like china , brazil and australia are also participating .
the first day of the conference ended with many delegates making positive noises about the possible outcome of the two-day meeting .
polluters reaping what they sow , say poorer nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries blame the industrialized nations however , behind-the-scenes , the finger-pointing was still far from over with developing countries saying that climate protection should be an issue for the industrialized nations which caused all the large-scale pollution in the first place and which are leaving the poorer countries to deal with the consequences .
on the other side of the argument , the industrialized nations point to new powerhouses like china and india , saying that pollution problems there are home-made .
attending the conference in berlin , gro harlem brundtland , the un special envoy on climate change , spoke of this " deep-rooted lack of trust between the industrialized and developing countries . "
" many industrialized countries believe that the developing countries are unwilling and that they are doing too little , " the former norwegian prime minister and world health organization head said .
" many developing countries believe that the industrialized world has defaulted on the promise of financial and technology assistance , " she added .
industrialized nations urged to cut emissions the global leadership for climate action , comprising former prominent leaders , called for industrialized countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent over the period 1990 to 2050 .
the united states should commit itself to this goal , said the organization 's presidents , former chilean president ricardo lagos and the president of the un foundation , former us senator timothy e wirth .
the organization also stated that major developing countries like china and india should cut their energy use by 30 per cent by 2020 as a first step .
from 2021 these countries should commit themselves to binding emission targets .
post-kyoto negotiations complex and problematic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiating a new protocol to replace kyoto will be difficult in december this year , signatories to the kyoto protocol will meet in bali to debate possible negotiations on climate protection after 2012 when the kyoto agreement expires .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel admitted that the negotiations will be far from easy .
" here in germany , you know how difficult it is to reach a consensus on sensitive issues among our 16 states , " he said .
" you can imagine what a hard task it is to find common ground among the over 200 nations involved in the climate protection process .
there ’ s not even agreement yet among the signatories to the kyoto protocol on reductions in co2 emissions that negotiations on a follow-up treaty are needed .
" we 're talking about a climate protection deal that not only entails responsibilities and targets for industrialized nations to meet , " gabriel added , " but we also expect developing countries to set their own binding agenda . "
per-capita quota a potential silver lining but a silver lining has appeared in recent talks on climate protection with german chancellor angela merkel and others suggesting that a per-capita emissions quota be considered when it comes to fair burden sharing in the future .
on tuesday , the participants in the gleneagles dialogue in berlin are expected to tell the media how far they 've come in bringing the industrialized and developing worlds closer together .

gabriel said the united nations climate conference being held in bali in december should provide the " starting signal " for comprehensive talks on a new climate agreement for the period after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol runs out .
this had to contain a long-term goal , ambitious and obligatory commitments from the industrialized world , and fair contributions from the larger developing countries , he said .
" under the gleneagles dialogue we are working at making investment in climate protection technologies more attractive , " gabriel said .
the gleneagles dialogue was set up at the g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland in 2005 .
apart from the g8 - the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , canada , italy and russia - large developing economies like china , brazil and australia are also participating .

polluters reaping what they sow , say poorer nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries blame the industrialized nations however , behind-the-scenes , the finger-pointing was still far from over with developing countries saying that climate protection should be an issue for the industrialized nations which caused all the large-scale pollution in the first place and which are leaving the poorer countries to deal with the consequences .
on the other side of the argument , the industrialized nations point to new powerhouses like china and india , saying that pollution problems there are home-made .
attending the conference in berlin , gro harlem brundtland , the un special envoy on climate change , spoke of this " deep-rooted lack of trust between the industrialized and developing countries . "
" many industrialized countries believe that the developing countries are unwilling and that they are doing too little , " the former norwegian prime minister and world health organization head said .
" many developing countries believe that the industrialized world has defaulted on the promise of financial and technology assistance , " she added .
industrialized nations urged to cut emissions the global leadership for climate action , comprising former prominent leaders , called for industrialized countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent over the period 1990 to 2050 .
the united states should commit itself to this goal , said the organization 's presidents , former chilean president ricardo lagos and the president of the un foundation , former us senator timothy e wirth .
the organization also stated that major developing countries like china and india should cut their energy use by 30 per cent by 2020 as a first step .

german environment minister sigmar gabriel admitted that the negotiations will be far from easy .
" here in germany , you know how difficult it is to reach a consensus on sensitive issues among our 16 states , " he said .
" you can imagine what a hard task it is to find common ground among the over 200 nations involved in the climate protection process .
there ’ s not even agreement yet among the signatories to the kyoto protocol on reductions in co2 emissions that negotiations on a follow-up treaty are needed .

for miners , it means a beloved tradition and a way of life is coming to an end . on a recent wednesday morning , benno henschen 's alarm clock went off at 3:10 a.m.
he drove 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- to a non-descript complex of buildings near the leafy small town of voerde , changed into his work clothes , and promptly descended 820 meters -lrb- 2,690 feet -rrb- under the earth . it is the start of the early shift for henschen , 49 , who will spend the next seven hours overseeing the machines that extract the hard coal that turned this region in western germany , near the ruhr and rhine rivers , into germany 's industrial heartland and powered its comeback from the ashes of world war ii . " i have always loved being a miner , and i still do , " said henschen , who was just 14 when he went down into his first mining pit .
" but i 'm worried about the future . " henschen is a member of a profession whose days appear limited in germany .
while there were once over 100 pits at the hard-coal mining industry 's peak in the 1950s , today there are only eight such mines left in germany .
the ruhr region 's centuries-old mining history means it is necessary to go further and further underground to reach unexhausted coal seams .
stringent safety measures and high-labor costs have also added to the cost of german hard coal .
at around 180 euros -lrb- $ 248 -rrb- per ton , it costs more than three times the global market price . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun is setting on the german hard-coal mining industry but for decades , german lawmakers have propped up the industry with large-scale subsidies .
right now , federal and regional governments pump 2.5 billion euros a year into hard-coal mining . " the markets are international , our energy supplies are secure , and so there 's no reason to use public money to subsidize hard-coal mining , " said oliver wittke , minister for building and transport for the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the ruhr region , and henschen 's mine , are located .
" it is far too expensive . " but to henschen , the bottom line should not be the only consideration . " expensive is not always the most costly , " he said .
to him , what germany will be giving up when the mines close has a value that you ca n't put a euro-sign on . family tradition henschen is the third generation in his family to go into mining .
his grandfather , who he never knew , was a pitman .
his father was too , working in the late ' 50s during the industry 's heyday , when the ruhr area was a cauldron of smokestacks , steel factories and rumbling hard-coal conveyor belts which fed them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mine workers leave the elevator at the mine in voerde mining was in his blood , and really was all he ever knew , or saw .
miners lived mostly together in settlements often not far from the pits .
after the gritty shifts spent together far underground , miners would often spend their free time together and raise their families next door to one another . " the hard work underground welded us together , you could say , " said henschen .
" we respect one another , have to depend on one another .
it 's not like in other jobs . " miners , he said , are part of a tightly knit social fabric that is unraveling because of government decisions he thinks are wrong .
but that fabric has already been badly frayed by layoffs .
today there are 34,000 miners , down from 607,000 in 1970 . engine of integration ali sen , 39 , is in his 24th year as a miner , but is now spending time above ground in the public relations office of dsk , the company which manages germany 's remaining hard-coal mines , learning another side of the business , one that might have more of a future . his father was a miner in turkey before coming to germany as a so-called " guest worker , " bringing his family over when sen was two .
the strong sense of social cohesion among miners extended to relations between turks and germans , according to sen. while the integration of germany 's large turkish community into the large society is still seen as problematic , sen said with miners , ethnicity was never an issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long history : miners in 1880 " i do n't think these groups get along anywhere in german better than in the ruhr region , " he said .
" we live side by side , play together in soccer clubs , it 's exemplary . " both he and henschen said closing mines could further weaken the ruhr area 's economy - the mine in voerde , where they both work , is scheduled to close next year .
other businesses in the area , some of which depend on miners ' patronage , will suffer . " where mines have been closed , you notice the neighborhoods that bore the brunt of it have n't bounced back even after 20 or 30 years , " sen said .
" they might not quite be ghettos , but stores are closed and people do n't have money to buy . " structural change the ruhr region 's economy has been hard hit by the progressive shuttering of its heavy industry since the 1960s and successive waves of large-scale layoffs .
by the end of the 1990s , the once prosperous region had turned into a landscape of rusting industrial ruins , environmental degradation and dwindling hopes .
unemployment once reached 19 percent , although that number now stands at 14.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a light show at the repurposed mining tower , zollverein the region is now embarking on an economic redevelopment program that sees it moving away from heavy industry like steel and coal and toward the logistics , chemicals and service sectors .
the region will be one of europe 's cultural capitals for 2010 , and some of its industrial skeletons , like unused mining shaft towers , deserted factories , and silo-like gasometers , have already been turned into cultural spaces for exhibitions or performances . much ado about little ? some argue that miners ' complaints are exaggerated .
the agreement on ending the subsidies provides a " soft landing " for the workers and the federal and state governments will spend an estimated 21.6 billion euros over the next 11 years .
options for miners include retraining programs , job-search help , and start-up money for those wishing to become self-employed .
those who have 25 years underground can retire at 49 . " we are doing a lot for our miners , " said christof beike , a spokesman for dsk . but for those like henschen , used to the security mining once brought , that is cold comfort .
and even more then the end of an industry , it 's the end of a tradition and a life that might have been hard on the body , but was good for the soul . " now families are losing their bearings and the solidarity of our communities is being pulled apart , " he said .

other businesses in the area , some of which depend on miners ' patronage , will suffer . " where mines have been closed , you notice the neighborhoods that bore the brunt of it have n't bounced back even after 20 or 30 years , " sen said .
" they might not quite be ghettos , but stores are closed and people do n't have money to buy . " structural change the ruhr region 's economy has been hard hit by the progressive shuttering of its heavy industry since the 1960s and successive waves of large-scale layoffs .
by the end of the 1990s , the once prosperous region had turned into a landscape of rusting industrial ruins , environmental degradation and dwindling hopes .
unemployment once reached 19 percent , although that number now stands at 14.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a light show at the repurposed mining tower , zollverein the region is now embarking on an economic redevelopment program that sees it moving away from heavy industry like steel and coal and toward the logistics , chemicals and service sectors .
the region will be one of europe 's cultural capitals for 2010 , and some of its industrial skeletons , like unused mining shaft towers , deserted factories , and silo-like gasometers , have already been turned into cultural spaces for exhibitions or performances . much ado about little ? some argue that miners ' complaints are exaggerated .
the agreement on ending the subsidies provides a " soft landing " for the workers and the federal and state governments will spend an estimated 21.6 billion euros over the next 11 years .
options for miners include retraining programs , job-search help , and start-up money for those wishing to become self-employed .
those who have 25 years underground can retire at 49 . " we are doing a lot for our miners , " said christof beike , a spokesman for dsk . but for those like henschen , used to the security mining once brought , that is cold comfort .
and even more then the end of an industry , it 's the end of a tradition and a life that might have been hard on the body , but was good for the soul . " now families are losing their bearings and the solidarity of our communities is being pulled apart , " he said .
" i think that 's a shame . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de : civil society is taking on the traditional responsibilities of political parties , which seem powerless in the face of global trends .
what future do political parties have in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detmar doering detmar doering : i do n't think parties are really powerless in the face of global trends .
it 's true that non-governmental organizations do dominate the international political agenda today while political parties only influence international political institutions in an indirect manner .
but i do n't think you can underestimate that influence .
since parties are anchored institutions in germany , they will continue to exist and play an important role in our country .
but if they want to continue to play an important role in citizens ' perceptions and justify their legitimacy through it , they need to change their work and make it more open .
what form could the changes take ?
for instance , through project-related , temporary party membership that corresponds to the desire for getting involved without being forced to make a permanent commitment .
or by intensifying their internet presence , which offers a dialog form of communication .
it 's equally important to credibly build up a party base - for instance through support networks .
a fundamental factor includes " external conditions " or , in other words , the electoral rules .
the american experiment in " term limits " deserves our attention at the very least .
in that way you can get rid of the outdated personnel structures that damage the image of politics .
parties are constantly losing members .
young people are said to be uninterested in politics .
for years , there 's been talk of voter apathy .
there 's no doubt that the number of political party organizations is slipping .
the public image of political parties has sharply dropped in the past years .
that may have to do with other political alternatives in civil society that increasingly and credibly compete with parties for committed citizens .
but that 's a sign of maturity in a pluralist society rather than a blemish .
competition revives business .
the consequence must be that parties make an effort to be more attractive to voters .
liberal positions in business are now represented by the conservatives , and even the social democrats increasingly appeal to the responsibility of each individual in their political messages .
do you think there 's room for a liberal party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle heads germany 's fdp it 's definitely good if you can find a certain basic liberal consensus in all parties , because otherwise democracy would be seriously threatened .
but that 's not enough .
we are n't currently seeing an open rejection of liberal principles , but there 's certainly a creeping erosion of freedoms .
economic liberalization - though it 's more important than ever - no longer exists .
the big brother state has begun to take on grotesque proportions , a paternalistic idea of the state that wants to steer lifestyles and behavior is taking shape .
internationally , liberal politics is on the retreat as shown by protectionist tendencies in the eu , the wrangling over the doha round of world trade -lsb- organization -rsb- talks and the ideological rollback in a few latin american countries .
in such a context , there 's no doubt that you need an overtly liberal party .
it 's no secret that there are political contacts between the christian conservatives , the green party and the fdp .
do you think germany could in the future get a governing coalition made up of the three ?
in the end it 's the voter who decides which constellation is feasible .
in theory , it should be possible to have coalitions between all democratic parties .
but there is a tendency that three-party coalitions can be plagued by infighting , more than two-party ones .
in light of the current reform chaos in germany , what 's needed is political action .
besides , being part of the government is not an end in itself .
you should only take part in a coalition if you can really achieve more freedom for all citizens .

dw-world.de : civil society is taking on the traditional responsibilities of political parties , which seem powerless in the face of global trends .
what future do political parties have in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detmar doering detmar doering : i do n't think parties are really powerless in the face of global trends .
it 's true that non-governmental organizations do dominate the international political agenda today while political parties only influence international political institutions in an indirect manner .
but i do n't think you can underestimate that influence .
since parties are anchored institutions in germany , they will continue to exist and play an important role in our country .
but if they want to continue to play an important role in citizens ' perceptions and justify their legitimacy through it , they need to change their work and make it more open .
what form could the changes take ?
for instance , through project-related , temporary party membership that corresponds to the desire for getting involved without being forced to make a permanent commitment .
or by intensifying their internet presence , which offers a dialog form of communication .
it 's equally important to credibly build up a party base - for instance through support networks .
a fundamental factor includes " external conditions " or , in other words , the electoral rules .
the american experiment in " term limits " deserves our attention at the very least .
in that way you can get rid of the outdated personnel structures that damage the image of politics .
parties are constantly losing members .
young people are said to be uninterested in politics .
for years , there 's been talk of voter apathy .
there 's no doubt that the number of political party organizations is slipping .
the public image of political parties has sharply dropped in the past years .
that may have to do with other political alternatives in civil society that increasingly and credibly compete with parties for committed citizens .
but that 's a sign of maturity in a pluralist society rather than a blemish .
competition revives business .
the consequence must be that parties make an effort to be more attractive to voters .
liberal positions in business are now represented by the conservatives , and even the social democrats increasingly appeal to the responsibility of each individual in their political messages .
do you think there 's room for a liberal party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle heads germany 's fdp it 's definitely good if you can find a certain basic liberal consensus in all parties , because otherwise democracy would be seriously threatened .
but that 's not enough .
we are n't currently seeing an open rejection of liberal principles , but there 's certainly a creeping erosion of freedoms .
economic liberalization - though it 's more important than ever - no longer exists .
the big brother state has begun to take on grotesque proportions , a paternalistic idea of the state that wants to steer lifestyles and behavior is taking shape .
internationally , liberal politics is on the retreat as shown by protectionist tendencies in the eu , the wrangling over the doha round of world trade -lsb- organization -rsb- talks and the ideological rollback in a few latin american countries .
in such a context , there 's no doubt that you need an overtly liberal party .
it 's no secret that there are political contacts between the christian conservatives , the green party and the fdp .
do you think germany could in the future get a governing coalition made up of the three ?
in the end it 's the voter who decides which constellation is feasible .
in theory , it should be possible to have coalitions between all democratic parties .
but there is a tendency that three-party coalitions can be plagued by infighting , more than two-party ones .
in light of the current reform chaos in germany , what 's needed is political action .
besides , being part of the government is not an end in itself .
you should only take part in a coalition if you can really achieve more freedom for all citizens .

" it is our common wish ... that we get more transparency in financial markets , " chancellor angela merkel said after a regular informal meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy at a government guest house north of berlin .
she said that , along with fair trade and fair competition , that " must be a common european concern . "
the two leaders issued a joint statement in which they stressed that " open markets are the guarantor of europe 's prosperity and development . "
merkel noted that germany had made market transparency a key theme both during its european union presidency in the first six months of the year and during its year-long presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
" we have always had backing from the french side on this , " she added .
the chancellor called for a coordinated european approach .
" we must have as coherent an approach as possible , " she said , and added that the issue was not " arbitrary regulation but how europe can create conditions that others have . "
leaders target transparency and speculators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel kiss as they meet at schloss meseberg taking the fight to the speculators , sarkozy stated that he was " not against competition , but against speculation . " the french president added , " i am for the market economy , i am for globalization , but i am not for speculation . "
europe could not allow itself to be the venue " where the rest of the world comes to help itself , " sarkozy continued , stressing that his aim was " not protectionism , but reciprocity " with countries like the united states and china .
referring to the failure of international rating agencies to spot the looming us sub-prime mortgage crisis , merkel said the german government had been unable to explain to the population how nobody knew beforehand and why ordinary people were now facing the consequences .
other issues discussed by the two leaders included the energy sector in europe and a proposed " council of wise men " which would debate the future of the eu in the medium term .
merkel said it had not yet been decided who would sit on the council , and sarkozy said its aims were to sketch out how europe should evolve over the next 30 years .
nuclear power partnership apparently on course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france wants germany to follow its nuclear example on energy , sarkozy urged germany to follow france 's example of relying strongly on nuclear power for its energy needs .
" i would like france and germany to have similar ambitions , " sarkozy said atomic power meets about 40 percent of france 's energy needs , whereas germany plans to phase out nuclear energy gradually and mothball the last of its 17 reactors by about 2020 .
merkel responded by saying that she supported the continuation of the nuclear power joint venture between german industrial group siemens and french nuclear group areva np .
" i am of course interested in a deeper german-french cooperation , " she said .
sarkozy said , " we will strengthen our cooperation further , " adding that " nuclear energy is the power of the future ...
france is willing to work in concert with companies and siemens is already present . "
no mention of french plans for siemens it was reported in july that sarkozy planned to use an option to buy out siemens 's 34 percent stake in the nuclear power joint venture with state-controlled areva and forge a major national energy company .

" it is our common wish ... that we get more transparency in financial markets , " chancellor angela merkel said after a regular informal meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy at a government guest house north of berlin .
she said that , along with fair trade and fair competition , that " must be a common european concern . "
the two leaders issued a joint statement in which they stressed that " open markets are the guarantor of europe 's prosperity and development . "
merkel noted that germany had made market transparency a key theme both during its european union presidency in the first six months of the year and during its year-long presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
" we have always had backing from the french side on this , " she added .
the chancellor called for a coordinated european approach .
" we must have as coherent an approach as possible , " she said , and added that the issue was not " arbitrary regulation but how europe can create conditions that others have . "
leaders target transparency and speculators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel kiss as they meet at schloss meseberg taking the fight to the speculators , sarkozy stated that he was " not against competition , but against speculation . " the french president added , " i am for the market economy , i am for globalization , but i am not for speculation . "
europe could not allow itself to be the venue " where the rest of the world comes to help itself , " sarkozy continued , stressing that his aim was " not protectionism , but reciprocity " with countries like the united states and china .
referring to the failure of international rating agencies to spot the looming us sub-prime mortgage crisis , merkel said the german government had been unable to explain to the population how nobody knew beforehand and why ordinary people were now facing the consequences .
other issues discussed by the two leaders included the energy sector in europe and a proposed " council of wise men " which would debate the future of the eu in the medium term .
merkel said it had not yet been decided who would sit on the council , and sarkozy said its aims were to sketch out how europe should evolve over the next 30 years .
nuclear power partnership apparently on course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france wants germany to follow its nuclear example on energy , sarkozy urged germany to follow france 's example of relying strongly on nuclear power for its energy needs .
" i would like france and germany to have similar ambitions , " sarkozy said atomic power meets about 40 percent of france 's energy needs , whereas germany plans to phase out nuclear energy gradually and mothball the last of its 17 reactors by about 2020 .
merkel responded by saying that she supported the continuation of the nuclear power joint venture between german industrial group siemens and french nuclear group areva np .
" i am of course interested in a deeper german-french cooperation , " she said .
sarkozy said , " we will strengthen our cooperation further , " adding that " nuclear energy is the power of the future ...
france is willing to work in concert with companies and siemens is already present . "
no mention of french plans for siemens it was reported in july that sarkozy planned to use an option to buy out siemens 's 34 percent stake in the nuclear power joint venture with state-controlled areva and forge a major national energy company .

herman said on monday her statements were taken out of context . " mrs. herman 's authorial activities are in our view no longer compatible with her role as a television news reader and talk show host , " said volker herres , program director for german public network ard 's northern division norddeutscher rundfunk -lrb- ndr -rrb- , in a statement on the network 's web site . he also said that some guests had canceled their appearances on herman 's talk show in response to her public statements on motherhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in nazi germany received monetary incentives and medals for child-bearing herman , 48 , who already ruffled feathers last year by arguing that women should raise children rather than pursue careers of their own , was quoted by the media as speaking in glowing terms about the family values that were nurtured in the nazi era . " it was a gruesome time with a totally crazy and highly dangerous leader who led the germans into ruin as we all know , " herman said . " but there was at the time also something good , and that is the values , that is the children , that is the families , that is a togetherness - it was all abolished , there was nothing left . " herman 's new book " the noah 's ark principle : why we must save the family " -lrb- available in german -rrb- is a follow-up to her 2006 bestseller " the eva principle : for a new femininity . " in both books , herman openly discredits the merits of emancipation and mourns the loss of traditional gender roles that assigned women to the safe and comforting spot by the kitchen stove . motherhood crusade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women juggle their careers with obligations at home herman told bild newspaper on monday that she did n't understand why there was so much commotion about her views . " i expressly distanced myself from the ' third reich ' at several points , " herman said .
" one has to put my statement into its overall context .
this is n't about hitler 's values , but about basic human values , which were abused in the ' third reich ' and later abolished . " by praising the third reich family values , however , herman managed to raise the scandal bar to unprecedented heights . while it is true that the nazis offered incentives to child-bearing women , their family policies were an integral part of their racist ideology whose goal was the creation of a master race . " frau herman should know that what characterized the third reich was n't how mothers were treated , because they were just meant to produce cannon fodder , " author and holocaust survivor ralph giordano told bild . " what characterized it was the gas chambers . " preaching , not practicing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for almost two decades , herman was one of germany 's most popular news presenters married for the fourth time , having one child and - until now - a stellar television career that included 18 years of hosting germany 's premiere tv news show tageschau - eva herman was an unlikely candidate for a champion of antiquated gender roles . she proved , however , that one does n't have to practice what one preaches and that a successful career woman can tell other women that what they really want is to keep quiet and cook . " in eva herman 's case , even those of us who are women 's rights activists want her to return home to her kitchen stove , " said renate künast , a prominent member of the opposition green party . it is unlikely , however , that herman , who was often voted in the past as germany 's favorite news presenter , will get a chance to become a stay-at-home mom that she never was .
as a proponent of an ultra-conservative , pre-feminist fantasy world in which marriage , obedience and motherhood are considered the ultimate forms of self-fulfillment , she seems busier than ever .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.09.2007 as subsidies dry up , german miners watch a way of life ebb großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miners have demonstrated against ending the subsidies - to no avail chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet decided last month to stop subsidizing the country 's hard-coal mining industry in 2018 .
for miners , it means a beloved tradition and a way of life is coming to an end . on a recent wednesday morning , benno henschen 's alarm clock went off at 3:10 a.m.
he drove 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- to a non-descript complex of buildings near the leafy small town of voerde , changed into his work clothes , and promptly descended 820 meters -lrb- 2,690 feet -rrb- under the earth . it is the start of the early shift for henschen , 49 , who will spend the next seven hours overseeing the machines that extract the hard coal that turned this region in western germany , near the ruhr and rhine rivers , into germany 's industrial heartland and powered its comeback from the ashes of world war ii . " i have always loved being a miner , and i still do , " said henschen , who was just 14 when he went down into his first mining pit .
" but i 'm worried about the future . " henschen is a member of a profession whose days appear limited in germany .
while there were once over 100 pits at the hard-coal mining industry 's peak in the 1950s , today there are only eight such mines left in germany .
the ruhr region 's centuries-old mining history means it is necessary to go further and further underground to reach unexhausted coal seams .
stringent safety measures and high-labor costs have also added to the cost of german hard coal .
at around 180 euros -lrb- $ 248 -rrb- per ton , it costs more than three times the global market price . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun is setting on the german hard-coal mining industry but for decades , german lawmakers have propped up the industry with large-scale subsidies .
right now , federal and regional governments pump 2.5 billion euros a year into hard-coal mining . " the markets are international , our energy supplies are secure , and so there 's no reason to use public money to subsidize hard-coal mining , " said oliver wittke , minister for building and transport for the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the ruhr region , and henschen 's mine , are located .
" it is far too expensive . " but to henschen , the bottom line should not be the only consideration . " expensive is not always the most costly , " he said .
to him , what germany will be giving up when the mines close has a value that you ca n't put a euro-sign on . family tradition henschen is the third generation in his family to go into mining .
his grandfather , who he never knew , was a pitman .
his father was too , working in the late ' 50s during the industry 's heyday , when the ruhr area was a cauldron of smokestacks , steel factories and rumbling hard-coal conveyor belts which fed them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mine workers leave the elevator at the mine in voerde mining was in his blood , and really was all he ever knew , or saw .
miners lived mostly together in settlements often not far from the pits .
after the gritty shifts spent together far underground , miners would often spend their free time together and raise their families next door to one another . " the hard work underground welded us together , you could say , " said henschen .
" we respect one another , have to depend on one another .
it 's not like in other jobs . " miners , he said , are part of a tightly knit social fabric that is unraveling because of government decisions he thinks are wrong .
but that fabric has already been badly frayed by layoffs .
today there are 34,000 miners , down from 607,000 in 1970 . engine of integration ali sen , 39 , is in his 24th year as a miner , but is now spending time above ground in the public relations office of dsk , the company which manages germany 's remaining hard-coal mines , learning another side of the business , one that might have more of a future . his father was a miner in turkey before coming to germany as a so-called " guest worker , " bringing his family over when sen was two .
the strong sense of social cohesion among miners extended to relations between turks and germans , according to sen. while the integration of germany 's large turkish community into the large society is still seen as problematic , sen said with miners , ethnicity was never an issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long history : miners in 1880 " i do n't think these groups get along anywhere in german better than in the ruhr region , " he said .
" we live side by side , play together in soccer clubs , it 's exemplary . " both he and henschen said closing mines could further weaken the ruhr area 's economy - the mine in voerde , where they both work , is scheduled to close next year .
other businesses in the area , some of which depend on miners ' patronage , will suffer . " where mines have been closed , you notice the neighborhoods that bore the brunt of it have n't bounced back even after 20 or 30 years , " sen said .
" they might not quite be ghettos , but stores are closed and people do n't have money to buy . " structural change the ruhr region 's economy has been hard hit by the progressive shuttering of its heavy industry since the 1960s and successive waves of large-scale layoffs .
by the end of the 1990s , the once prosperous region had turned into a landscape of rusting industrial ruins , environmental degradation and dwindling hopes .
unemployment once reached 19 percent , although that number now stands at 14.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a light show at the repurposed mining tower , zollverein the region is now embarking on an economic redevelopment program that sees it moving away from heavy industry like steel and coal and toward the logistics , chemicals and service sectors .
the region will be one of europe 's cultural capitals for 2010 , and some of its industrial skeletons , like unused mining shaft towers , deserted factories , and silo-like gasometers , have already been turned into cultural spaces for exhibitions or performances . much ado about little ? some argue that miners ' complaints are exaggerated .
the agreement on ending the subsidies provides a " soft landing " for the workers and the federal and state governments will spend an estimated 21.6 billion euros over the next 11 years .
options for miners include retraining programs , job-search help , and start-up money for those wishing to become self-employed .
those who have 25 years underground can retire at 49 . " we are doing a lot for our miners , " said christof beike , a spokesman for dsk . but for those like henschen , used to the security mining once brought , that is cold comfort .
and even more then the end of an industry , it 's the end of a tradition and a life that might have been hard on the body , but was good for the soul . " now families are losing their bearings and the solidarity of our communities is being pulled apart , " he said .
" i think that 's a shame . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany decides to abandon coal mining germany will gradually phase out its coal mining , after declaring that it makes no economic sense .

gabriel said the united nations climate conference being held in bali in december should provide the " starting signal " for comprehensive talks on a new climate agreement for the period after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol runs out .
this had to contain a long-term goal , ambitious and obligatory commitments from the industrialized world , and fair contributions from the larger developing countries , he said .
" under the gleneagles dialogue we are working at making investment in climate protection technologies more attractive , " gabriel said .
the gleneagles dialogue was set up at the g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland in 2005 .
apart from the g8 - the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , canada , italy and russia - large developing economies like china , brazil and australia are also participating .

on the other side of the argument , the industrialized nations point to new powerhouses like china and india , saying that pollution problems there are home-made .
attending the conference in berlin , gro harlem brundtland , the un special envoy on climate change , spoke of this " deep-rooted lack of trust between the industrialized and developing countries . "
" many industrialized countries believe that the developing countries are unwilling and that they are doing too little , " the former norwegian prime minister and world health organization head said .
" many developing countries believe that the industrialized world has defaulted on the promise of financial and technology assistance , " she added .
industrialized nations urged to cut emissions the global leadership for climate action , comprising former prominent leaders , called for industrialized countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent over the period 1990 to 2050 .
the united states should commit itself to this goal , said the organization 's presidents , former chilean president ricardo lagos and the president of the un foundation , former us senator timothy e wirth .
the organization also stated that major developing countries like china and india should cut their energy use by 30 per cent by 2020 as a first step .

german environment minister sigmar gabriel admitted that the negotiations will be far from easy .
" here in germany , you know how difficult it is to reach a consensus on sensitive issues among our 16 states , " he said .
" you can imagine what a hard task it is to find common ground among the over 200 nations involved in the climate protection process .
there ’ s not even agreement yet among the signatories to the kyoto protocol on reductions in co2 emissions that negotiations on a follow-up treaty are needed .
" we 're talking about a climate protection deal that not only entails responsibilities and targets for industrialized nations to meet , " gabriel added , " but we also expect developing countries to set their own binding agenda . "

gabriel said the united nations climate conference being held in bali in december should provide the " starting signal " for comprehensive talks on a new climate agreement for the period after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol runs out .
this had to contain a long-term goal , ambitious and obligatory commitments from the industrialized world , and fair contributions from the larger developing countries , he said .
" under the gleneagles dialogue we are working at making investment in climate protection technologies more attractive , " gabriel said .
the gleneagles dialogue was set up at the g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland in 2005 .
apart from the g8 - the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , canada , italy and russia - large developing economies like china , brazil and australia are also participating .

on the other side of the argument , the industrialized nations point to new powerhouses like china and india , saying that pollution problems there are home-made .
attending the conference in berlin , gro harlem brundtland , the un special envoy on climate change , spoke of this " deep-rooted lack of trust between the industrialized and developing countries . "
" many industrialized countries believe that the developing countries are unwilling and that they are doing too little , " the former norwegian prime minister and world health organization head said .
" many developing countries believe that the industrialized world has defaulted on the promise of financial and technology assistance , " she added .
industrialized nations urged to cut emissions the global leadership for climate action , comprising former prominent leaders , called for industrialized countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent over the period 1990 to 2050 .
the united states should commit itself to this goal , said the organization 's presidents , former chilean president ricardo lagos and the president of the un foundation , former us senator timothy e wirth .
the organization also stated that major developing countries like china and india should cut their energy use by 30 per cent by 2020 as a first step .

" here in germany , you know how difficult it is to reach a consensus on sensitive issues among our 16 states , " he said .
" you can imagine what a hard task it is to find common ground among the over 200 nations involved in the climate protection process .
there ’ s not even agreement yet among the signatories to the kyoto protocol on reductions in co2 emissions that negotiations on a follow-up treaty are needed .

for miners , it means a beloved tradition and a way of life is coming to an end . on a recent wednesday morning , benno henschen 's alarm clock went off at 3:10 a.m.
he drove 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- to a non-descript complex of buildings near the leafy small town of voerde , changed into his work clothes , and promptly descended 820 meters -lrb- 2,690 feet -rrb- under the earth . it is the start of the early shift for henschen , 49 , who will spend the next seven hours overseeing the machines that extract the hard coal that turned this region in western germany , near the ruhr and rhine rivers , into germany 's industrial heartland and powered its comeback from the ashes of world war ii . " i have always loved being a miner , and i still do , " said henschen , who was just 14 when he went down into his first mining pit .
" but i 'm worried about the future . " henschen is a member of a profession whose days appear limited in germany .
while there were once over 100 pits at the hard-coal mining industry 's peak in the 1950s , today there are only eight such mines left in germany .
the ruhr region 's centuries-old mining history means it is necessary to go further and further underground to reach unexhausted coal seams .
stringent safety measures and high-labor costs have also added to the cost of german hard coal .
at around 180 euros -lrb- $ 248 -rrb- per ton , it costs more than three times the global market price . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun is setting on the german hard-coal mining industry but for decades , german lawmakers have propped up the industry with large-scale subsidies .
right now , federal and regional governments pump 2.5 billion euros a year into hard-coal mining . " the markets are international , our energy supplies are secure , and so there 's no reason to use public money to subsidize hard-coal mining , " said oliver wittke , minister for building and transport for the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the ruhr region , and henschen 's mine , are located .
" it is far too expensive . " but to henschen , the bottom line should not be the only consideration . " expensive is not always the most costly , " he said .
to him , what germany will be giving up when the mines close has a value that you ca n't put a euro-sign on . family tradition henschen is the third generation in his family to go into mining .
his grandfather , who he never knew , was a pitman .
his father was too , working in the late ' 50s during the industry 's heyday , when the ruhr area was a cauldron of smokestacks , steel factories and rumbling hard-coal conveyor belts which fed them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mine workers leave the elevator at the mine in voerde mining was in his blood , and really was all he ever knew , or saw .
miners lived mostly together in settlements often not far from the pits .
after the gritty shifts spent together far underground , miners would often spend their free time together and raise their families next door to one another . " the hard work underground welded us together , you could say , " said henschen .
" we respect one another , have to depend on one another .
it 's not like in other jobs . " miners , he said , are part of a tightly knit social fabric that is unraveling because of government decisions he thinks are wrong .
but that fabric has already been badly frayed by layoffs .
today there are 34,000 miners , down from 607,000 in 1970 . engine of integration ali sen , 39 , is in his 24th year as a miner , but is now spending time above ground in the public relations office of dsk , the company which manages germany 's remaining hard-coal mines , learning another side of the business , one that might have more of a future . his father was a miner in turkey before coming to germany as a so-called " guest worker , " bringing his family over when sen was two .
the strong sense of social cohesion among miners extended to relations between turks and germans , according to sen. while the integration of germany 's large turkish community into the large society is still seen as problematic , sen said with miners , ethnicity was never an issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long history : miners in 1880 " i do n't think these groups get along anywhere in german better than in the ruhr region , " he said .
" we live side by side , play together in soccer clubs , it 's exemplary . " both he and henschen said closing mines could further weaken the ruhr area 's economy - the mine in voerde , where they both work , is scheduled to close next year .
other businesses in the area , some of which depend on miners ' patronage , will suffer . " where mines have been closed , you notice the neighborhoods that bore the brunt of it have n't bounced back even after 20 or 30 years , " sen said .
" they might not quite be ghettos , but stores are closed and people do n't have money to buy . " structural change the ruhr region 's economy has been hard hit by the progressive shuttering of its heavy industry since the 1960s and successive waves of large-scale layoffs .
by the end of the 1990s , the once prosperous region had turned into a landscape of rusting industrial ruins , environmental degradation and dwindling hopes .
unemployment once reached 19 percent , although that number now stands at 14.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a light show at the repurposed mining tower , zollverein the region is now embarking on an economic redevelopment program that sees it moving away from heavy industry like steel and coal and toward the logistics , chemicals and service sectors .
the region will be one of europe 's cultural capitals for 2010 , and some of its industrial skeletons , like unused mining shaft towers , deserted factories , and silo-like gasometers , have already been turned into cultural spaces for exhibitions or performances . much ado about little ? some argue that miners ' complaints are exaggerated .
the agreement on ending the subsidies provides a " soft landing " for the workers and the federal and state governments will spend an estimated 21.6 billion euros over the next 11 years .
options for miners include retraining programs , job-search help , and start-up money for those wishing to become self-employed .
those who have 25 years underground can retire at 49 . " we are doing a lot for our miners , " said christof beike , a spokesman for dsk . but for those like henschen , used to the security mining once brought , that is cold comfort .
and even more then the end of an industry , it 's the end of a tradition and a life that might have been hard on the body , but was good for the soul . " now families are losing their bearings and the solidarity of our communities is being pulled apart , " he said .

the strong sense of social cohesion among miners extended to relations between turks and germans , according to sen. while the integration of germany 's large turkish community into the large society is still seen as problematic , sen said with miners , ethnicity was never an issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long history : miners in 1880 " i do n't think these groups get along anywhere in german better than in the ruhr region , " he said .
" we live side by side , play together in soccer clubs , it 's exemplary . " both he and henschen said closing mines could further weaken the ruhr area 's economy - the mine in voerde , where they both work , is scheduled to close next year .
other businesses in the area , some of which depend on miners ' patronage , will suffer . " where mines have been closed , you notice the neighborhoods that bore the brunt of it have n't bounced back even after 20 or 30 years , " sen said .
" they might not quite be ghettos , but stores are closed and people do n't have money to buy . " structural change the ruhr region 's economy has been hard hit by the progressive shuttering of its heavy industry since the 1960s and successive waves of large-scale layoffs .

the agreement on ending the subsidies provides a " soft landing " for the workers and the federal and state governments will spend an estimated 21.6 billion euros over the next 11 years .
options for miners include retraining programs , job-search help , and start-up money for those wishing to become self-employed .
those who have 25 years underground can retire at 49 . " we are doing a lot for our miners , " said christof beike , a spokesman for dsk . but for those like henschen , used to the security mining once brought , that is cold comfort .
and even more then the end of an industry , it 's the end of a tradition and a life that might have been hard on the body , but was good for the soul . " now families are losing their bearings and the solidarity of our communities is being pulled apart , " he said .

polluters reaping what they sow , say poorer nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries blame the industrialized nations however , behind-the-scenes , the finger-pointing was still far from over with developing countries saying that climate protection should be an issue for the industrialized nations which caused all the large-scale pollution in the first place and which are leaving the poorer countries to deal with the consequences .
on the other side of the argument , the industrialized nations point to new powerhouses like china and india , saying that pollution problems there are home-made .
attending the conference in berlin , gro harlem brundtland , the un special envoy on climate change , spoke of this " deep-rooted lack of trust between the industrialized and developing countries . "
" many industrialized countries believe that the developing countries are unwilling and that they are doing too little , " the former norwegian prime minister and world health organization head said .
" many developing countries believe that the industrialized world has defaulted on the promise of financial and technology assistance , " she added .
industrialized nations urged to cut emissions the global leadership for climate action , comprising former prominent leaders , called for industrialized countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent over the period 1990 to 2050 .
the united states should commit itself to this goal , said the organization 's presidents , former chilean president ricardo lagos and the president of the un foundation , former us senator timothy e wirth .
the organization also stated that major developing countries like china and india should cut their energy use by 30 per cent by 2020 as a first step .
from 2021 these countries should commit themselves to binding emission targets .
post-kyoto negotiations complex and problematic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiating a new protocol to replace kyoto will be difficult in december this year , signatories to the kyoto protocol will meet in bali to debate possible negotiations on climate protection after 2012 when the kyoto agreement expires .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel admitted that the negotiations will be far from easy .
" here in germany , you know how difficult it is to reach a consensus on sensitive issues among our 16 states , " he said .
" you can imagine what a hard task it is to find common ground among the over 200 nations involved in the climate protection process .
there ’ s not even agreement yet among the signatories to the kyoto protocol on reductions in co2 emissions that negotiations on a follow-up treaty are needed .
" we 're talking about a climate protection deal that not only entails responsibilities and targets for industrialized nations to meet , " gabriel added , " but we also expect developing countries to set their own binding agenda . "
per-capita quota a potential silver lining but a silver lining has appeared in recent talks on climate protection with german chancellor angela merkel and others suggesting that a per-capita emissions quota be considered when it comes to fair burden sharing in the future .
on tuesday , the participants in the gleneagles dialogue in berlin are expected to tell the media how far they 've come in bringing the industrialized and developing worlds closer together .
so far , they 've only agreed on a number of recommendations for climate protection , not saying how much anyone is supposed to contribute to the common goal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de : civil society is taking on the traditional responsibilities of political parties , which seem powerless in the face of global trends .
what future do political parties have in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detmar doering detmar doering : i do n't think parties are really powerless in the face of global trends .
it 's true that non-governmental organizations do dominate the international political agenda today while political parties only influence international political institutions in an indirect manner .
but i do n't think you can underestimate that influence .
since parties are anchored institutions in germany , they will continue to exist and play an important role in our country .
but if they want to continue to play an important role in citizens ' perceptions and justify their legitimacy through it , they need to change their work and make it more open .
what form could the changes take ?
for instance , through project-related , temporary party membership that corresponds to the desire for getting involved without being forced to make a permanent commitment .
or by intensifying their internet presence , which offers a dialog form of communication .
it 's equally important to credibly build up a party base - for instance through support networks .
a fundamental factor includes " external conditions " or , in other words , the electoral rules .
the american experiment in " term limits " deserves our attention at the very least .
in that way you can get rid of the outdated personnel structures that damage the image of politics .
parties are constantly losing members .
young people are said to be uninterested in politics .
for years , there 's been talk of voter apathy .
there 's no doubt that the number of political party organizations is slipping .
the public image of political parties has sharply dropped in the past years .
that may have to do with other political alternatives in civil society that increasingly and credibly compete with parties for committed citizens .
but that 's a sign of maturity in a pluralist society rather than a blemish .
competition revives business .
the consequence must be that parties make an effort to be more attractive to voters .
liberal positions in business are now represented by the conservatives , and even the social democrats increasingly appeal to the responsibility of each individual in their political messages .
do you think there 's room for a liberal party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle heads germany 's fdp it 's definitely good if you can find a certain basic liberal consensus in all parties , because otherwise democracy would be seriously threatened .
but that 's not enough .
we are n't currently seeing an open rejection of liberal principles , but there 's certainly a creeping erosion of freedoms .
economic liberalization - though it 's more important than ever - no longer exists .
the big brother state has begun to take on grotesque proportions , a paternalistic idea of the state that wants to steer lifestyles and behavior is taking shape .
internationally , liberal politics is on the retreat as shown by protectionist tendencies in the eu , the wrangling over the doha round of world trade -lsb- organization -rsb- talks and the ideological rollback in a few latin american countries .
in such a context , there 's no doubt that you need an overtly liberal party .
it 's no secret that there are political contacts between the christian conservatives , the green party and the fdp .
do you think germany could in the future get a governing coalition made up of the three ?
in the end it 's the voter who decides which constellation is feasible .
in theory , it should be possible to have coalitions between all democratic parties .
but there is a tendency that three-party coalitions can be plagued by infighting , more than two-party ones .
in light of the current reform chaos in germany , what 's needed is political action .
besides , being part of the government is not an end in itself .
you should only take part in a coalition if you can really achieve more freedom for all citizens .

dw-world.de : civil society is taking on the traditional responsibilities of political parties , which seem powerless in the face of global trends .
what future do political parties have in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detmar doering detmar doering : i do n't think parties are really powerless in the face of global trends .
it 's true that non-governmental organizations do dominate the international political agenda today while political parties only influence international political institutions in an indirect manner .
but i do n't think you can underestimate that influence .
since parties are anchored institutions in germany , they will continue to exist and play an important role in our country .
but if they want to continue to play an important role in citizens ' perceptions and justify their legitimacy through it , they need to change their work and make it more open .
what form could the changes take ?
for instance , through project-related , temporary party membership that corresponds to the desire for getting involved without being forced to make a permanent commitment .
or by intensifying their internet presence , which offers a dialog form of communication .
it 's equally important to credibly build up a party base - for instance through support networks .
a fundamental factor includes " external conditions " or , in other words , the electoral rules .
the american experiment in " term limits " deserves our attention at the very least .
in that way you can get rid of the outdated personnel structures that damage the image of politics .
parties are constantly losing members .
young people are said to be uninterested in politics .
for years , there 's been talk of voter apathy .
there 's no doubt that the number of political party organizations is slipping .
the public image of political parties has sharply dropped in the past years .
that may have to do with other political alternatives in civil society that increasingly and credibly compete with parties for committed citizens .
but that 's a sign of maturity in a pluralist society rather than a blemish .
competition revives business .
the consequence must be that parties make an effort to be more attractive to voters .
liberal positions in business are now represented by the conservatives , and even the social democrats increasingly appeal to the responsibility of each individual in their political messages .
do you think there 's room for a liberal party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle heads germany 's fdp it 's definitely good if you can find a certain basic liberal consensus in all parties , because otherwise democracy would be seriously threatened .
but that 's not enough .
we are n't currently seeing an open rejection of liberal principles , but there 's certainly a creeping erosion of freedoms .
economic liberalization - though it 's more important than ever - no longer exists .
the big brother state has begun to take on grotesque proportions , a paternalistic idea of the state that wants to steer lifestyles and behavior is taking shape .
internationally , liberal politics is on the retreat as shown by protectionist tendencies in the eu , the wrangling over the doha round of world trade -lsb- organization -rsb- talks and the ideological rollback in a few latin american countries .
in such a context , there 's no doubt that you need an overtly liberal party .
it 's no secret that there are political contacts between the christian conservatives , the green party and the fdp .
do you think germany could in the future get a governing coalition made up of the three ?
in the end it 's the voter who decides which constellation is feasible .
in theory , it should be possible to have coalitions between all democratic parties .
but there is a tendency that three-party coalitions can be plagued by infighting , more than two-party ones .
in light of the current reform chaos in germany , what 's needed is political action .
besides , being part of the government is not an end in itself .
you should only take part in a coalition if you can really achieve more freedom for all citizens .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.09.2007 as subsidies dry up , german miners watch a way of life ebb großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miners have demonstrated against ending the subsidies - to no avail chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet decided last month to stop subsidizing the country 's hard-coal mining industry in 2018 .
for miners , it means a beloved tradition and a way of life is coming to an end . on a recent wednesday morning , benno henschen 's alarm clock went off at 3:10 a.m.
he drove 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- to a non-descript complex of buildings near the leafy small town of voerde , changed into his work clothes , and promptly descended 820 meters -lrb- 2,690 feet -rrb- under the earth . it is the start of the early shift for henschen , 49 , who will spend the next seven hours overseeing the machines that extract the hard coal that turned this region in western germany , near the ruhr and rhine rivers , into germany 's industrial heartland and powered its comeback from the ashes of world war ii . " i have always loved being a miner , and i still do , " said henschen , who was just 14 when he went down into his first mining pit .
" but i 'm worried about the future . " henschen is a member of a profession whose days appear limited in germany .
while there were once over 100 pits at the hard-coal mining industry 's peak in the 1950s , today there are only eight such mines left in germany .
the ruhr region 's centuries-old mining history means it is necessary to go further and further underground to reach unexhausted coal seams .
stringent safety measures and high-labor costs have also added to the cost of german hard coal .
at around 180 euros -lrb- $ 248 -rrb- per ton , it costs more than three times the global market price . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun is setting on the german hard-coal mining industry but for decades , german lawmakers have propped up the industry with large-scale subsidies .
right now , federal and regional governments pump 2.5 billion euros a year into hard-coal mining . " the markets are international , our energy supplies are secure , and so there 's no reason to use public money to subsidize hard-coal mining , " said oliver wittke , minister for building and transport for the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the ruhr region , and henschen 's mine , are located .
" it is far too expensive . " but to henschen , the bottom line should not be the only consideration . " expensive is not always the most costly , " he said .
to him , what germany will be giving up when the mines close has a value that you ca n't put a euro-sign on . family tradition henschen is the third generation in his family to go into mining .
his grandfather , who he never knew , was a pitman .
his father was too , working in the late ' 50s during the industry 's heyday , when the ruhr area was a cauldron of smokestacks , steel factories and rumbling hard-coal conveyor belts which fed them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mine workers leave the elevator at the mine in voerde mining was in his blood , and really was all he ever knew , or saw .
miners lived mostly together in settlements often not far from the pits .
after the gritty shifts spent together far underground , miners would often spend their free time together and raise their families next door to one another . " the hard work underground welded us together , you could say , " said henschen .
" we respect one another , have to depend on one another .
it 's not like in other jobs . " miners , he said , are part of a tightly knit social fabric that is unraveling because of government decisions he thinks are wrong .
but that fabric has already been badly frayed by layoffs .
today there are 34,000 miners , down from 607,000 in 1970 . engine of integration ali sen , 39 , is in his 24th year as a miner , but is now spending time above ground in the public relations office of dsk , the company which manages germany 's remaining hard-coal mines , learning another side of the business , one that might have more of a future . his father was a miner in turkey before coming to germany as a so-called " guest worker , " bringing his family over when sen was two .
the strong sense of social cohesion among miners extended to relations between turks and germans , according to sen. while the integration of germany 's large turkish community into the large society is still seen as problematic , sen said with miners , ethnicity was never an issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long history : miners in 1880 " i do n't think these groups get along anywhere in german better than in the ruhr region , " he said .
" we live side by side , play together in soccer clubs , it 's exemplary . " both he and henschen said closing mines could further weaken the ruhr area 's economy - the mine in voerde , where they both work , is scheduled to close next year .
other businesses in the area , some of which depend on miners ' patronage , will suffer . " where mines have been closed , you notice the neighborhoods that bore the brunt of it have n't bounced back even after 20 or 30 years , " sen said .
" they might not quite be ghettos , but stores are closed and people do n't have money to buy . " structural change the ruhr region 's economy has been hard hit by the progressive shuttering of its heavy industry since the 1960s and successive waves of large-scale layoffs .
by the end of the 1990s , the once prosperous region had turned into a landscape of rusting industrial ruins , environmental degradation and dwindling hopes .
unemployment once reached 19 percent , although that number now stands at 14.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a light show at the repurposed mining tower , zollverein the region is now embarking on an economic redevelopment program that sees it moving away from heavy industry like steel and coal and toward the logistics , chemicals and service sectors .
the region will be one of europe 's cultural capitals for 2010 , and some of its industrial skeletons , like unused mining shaft towers , deserted factories , and silo-like gasometers , have already been turned into cultural spaces for exhibitions or performances . much ado about little ? some argue that miners ' complaints are exaggerated .
the agreement on ending the subsidies provides a " soft landing " for the workers and the federal and state governments will spend an estimated 21.6 billion euros over the next 11 years .
options for miners include retraining programs , job-search help , and start-up money for those wishing to become self-employed .
those who have 25 years underground can retire at 49 . " we are doing a lot for our miners , " said christof beike , a spokesman for dsk . but for those like henschen , used to the security mining once brought , that is cold comfort .
and even more then the end of an industry , it 's the end of a tradition and a life that might have been hard on the body , but was good for the soul . " now families are losing their bearings and the solidarity of our communities is being pulled apart , " he said .
" i think that 's a shame . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany decides to abandon coal mining germany will gradually phase out its coal mining , after declaring that it makes no economic sense .
subsidies to phase out the mining over the next decade will cost 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion . -rrb- -lrb- 08.08.2007 -rrb- the rise and fall of germany 's coal mining industry coal might be germany 's most abundant indigenous energy source , but the death knell finally sounded for the country 's unprofitable coal industry when the government decided to end mining subsidies by 2018 .

for miners , it means a beloved tradition and a way of life is coming to an end . on a recent wednesday morning , benno henschen 's alarm clock went off at 3:10 a.m.
he drove 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- to a non-descript complex of buildings near the leafy small town of voerde , changed into his work clothes , and promptly descended 820 meters -lrb- 2,690 feet -rrb- under the earth . it is the start of the early shift for henschen , 49 , who will spend the next seven hours overseeing the machines that extract the hard coal that turned this region in western germany , near the ruhr and rhine rivers , into germany 's industrial heartland and powered its comeback from the ashes of world war ii . " i have always loved being a miner , and i still do , " said henschen , who was just 14 when he went down into his first mining pit .
" but i 'm worried about the future . " henschen is a member of a profession whose days appear limited in germany .
while there were once over 100 pits at the hard-coal mining industry 's peak in the 1950s , today there are only eight such mines left in germany .
the ruhr region 's centuries-old mining history means it is necessary to go further and further underground to reach unexhausted coal seams .
stringent safety measures and high-labor costs have also added to the cost of german hard coal .
at around 180 euros -lrb- $ 248 -rrb- per ton , it costs more than three times the global market price . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun is setting on the german hard-coal mining industry but for decades , german lawmakers have propped up the industry with large-scale subsidies .
right now , federal and regional governments pump 2.5 billion euros a year into hard-coal mining . " the markets are international , our energy supplies are secure , and so there 's no reason to use public money to subsidize hard-coal mining , " said oliver wittke , minister for building and transport for the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the ruhr region , and henschen 's mine , are located .
" it is far too expensive . " but to henschen , the bottom line should not be the only consideration . " expensive is not always the most costly , " he said .
to him , what germany will be giving up when the mines close has a value that you ca n't put a euro-sign on . family tradition henschen is the third generation in his family to go into mining .
his grandfather , who he never knew , was a pitman .
his father was too , working in the late ' 50s during the industry 's heyday , when the ruhr area was a cauldron of smokestacks , steel factories and rumbling hard-coal conveyor belts which fed them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mine workers leave the elevator at the mine in voerde mining was in his blood , and really was all he ever knew , or saw .
miners lived mostly together in settlements often not far from the pits .
after the gritty shifts spent together far underground , miners would often spend their free time together and raise their families next door to one another . " the hard work underground welded us together , you could say , " said henschen .
" we respect one another , have to depend on one another .
it 's not like in other jobs . " miners , he said , are part of a tightly knit social fabric that is unraveling because of government decisions he thinks are wrong .
but that fabric has already been badly frayed by layoffs .
today there are 34,000 miners , down from 607,000 in 1970 . engine of integration ali sen , 39 , is in his 24th year as a miner , but is now spending time above ground in the public relations office of dsk , the company which manages germany 's remaining hard-coal mines , learning another side of the business , one that might have more of a future . his father was a miner in turkey before coming to germany as a so-called " guest worker , " bringing his family over when sen was two .
the strong sense of social cohesion among miners extended to relations between turks and germans , according to sen. while the integration of germany 's large turkish community into the large society is still seen as problematic , sen said with miners , ethnicity was never an issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long history : miners in 1880 " i do n't think these groups get along anywhere in german better than in the ruhr region , " he said .
" we live side by side , play together in soccer clubs , it 's exemplary . " both he and henschen said closing mines could further weaken the ruhr area 's economy - the mine in voerde , where they both work , is scheduled to close next year .
other businesses in the area , some of which depend on miners ' patronage , will suffer . " where mines have been closed , you notice the neighborhoods that bore the brunt of it have n't bounced back even after 20 or 30 years , " sen said .
" they might not quite be ghettos , but stores are closed and people do n't have money to buy . " structural change the ruhr region 's economy has been hard hit by the progressive shuttering of its heavy industry since the 1960s and successive waves of large-scale layoffs .
by the end of the 1990s , the once prosperous region had turned into a landscape of rusting industrial ruins , environmental degradation and dwindling hopes .
unemployment once reached 19 percent , although that number now stands at 14.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a light show at the repurposed mining tower , zollverein the region is now embarking on an economic redevelopment program that sees it moving away from heavy industry like steel and coal and toward the logistics , chemicals and service sectors .
the region will be one of europe 's cultural capitals for 2010 , and some of its industrial skeletons , like unused mining shaft towers , deserted factories , and silo-like gasometers , have already been turned into cultural spaces for exhibitions or performances . much ado about little ? some argue that miners ' complaints are exaggerated .
the agreement on ending the subsidies provides a " soft landing " for the workers and the federal and state governments will spend an estimated 21.6 billion euros over the next 11 years .
options for miners include retraining programs , job-search help , and start-up money for those wishing to become self-employed .
those who have 25 years underground can retire at 49 . " we are doing a lot for our miners , " said christof beike , a spokesman for dsk . but for those like henschen , used to the security mining once brought , that is cold comfort .
and even more then the end of an industry , it 's the end of a tradition and a life that might have been hard on the body , but was good for the soul . " now families are losing their bearings and the solidarity of our communities is being pulled apart , " he said .

he drove 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- to a non-descript complex of buildings near the leafy small town of voerde , changed into his work clothes , and promptly descended 820 meters -lrb- 2,690 feet -rrb- under the earth . it is the start of the early shift for henschen , 49 , who will spend the next seven hours overseeing the machines that extract the hard coal that turned this region in western germany , near the ruhr and rhine rivers , into germany 's industrial heartland and powered its comeback from the ashes of world war ii . " i have always loved being a miner , and i still do , " said henschen , who was just 14 when he went down into his first mining pit .
" but i 'm worried about the future . " henschen is a member of a profession whose days appear limited in germany .
while there were once over 100 pits at the hard-coal mining industry 's peak in the 1950s , today there are only eight such mines left in germany .
the ruhr region 's centuries-old mining history means it is necessary to go further and further underground to reach unexhausted coal seams .
stringent safety measures and high-labor costs have also added to the cost of german hard coal .
at around 180 euros -lrb- $ 248 -rrb- per ton , it costs more than three times the global market price . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun is setting on the german hard-coal mining industry but for decades , german lawmakers have propped up the industry with large-scale subsidies .
right now , federal and regional governments pump 2.5 billion euros a year into hard-coal mining . " the markets are international , our energy supplies are secure , and so there 's no reason to use public money to subsidize hard-coal mining , " said oliver wittke , minister for building and transport for the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the ruhr region , and henschen 's mine , are located .
" it is far too expensive . " but to henschen , the bottom line should not be the only consideration . " expensive is not always the most costly , " he said .
to him , what germany will be giving up when the mines close has a value that you ca n't put a euro-sign on . family tradition henschen is the third generation in his family to go into mining .
his grandfather , who he never knew , was a pitman .
his father was too , working in the late ' 50s during the industry 's heyday , when the ruhr area was a cauldron of smokestacks , steel factories and rumbling hard-coal conveyor belts which fed them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mine workers leave the elevator at the mine in voerde mining was in his blood , and really was all he ever knew , or saw .
miners lived mostly together in settlements often not far from the pits .
after the gritty shifts spent together far underground , miners would often spend their free time together and raise their families next door to one another . " the hard work underground welded us together , you could say , " said henschen .
" we respect one another , have to depend on one another .
it 's not like in other jobs . " miners , he said , are part of a tightly knit social fabric that is unraveling because of government decisions he thinks are wrong .
but that fabric has already been badly frayed by layoffs .
today there are 34,000 miners , down from 607,000 in 1970 . engine of integration ali sen , 39 , is in his 24th year as a miner , but is now spending time above ground in the public relations office of dsk , the company which manages germany 's remaining hard-coal mines , learning another side of the business , one that might have more of a future . his father was a miner in turkey before coming to germany as a so-called " guest worker , " bringing his family over when sen was two .
the strong sense of social cohesion among miners extended to relations between turks and germans , according to sen. while the integration of germany 's large turkish community into the large society is still seen as problematic , sen said with miners , ethnicity was never an issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long history : miners in 1880 " i do n't think these groups get along anywhere in german better than in the ruhr region , " he said .
" we live side by side , play together in soccer clubs , it 's exemplary . " both he and henschen said closing mines could further weaken the ruhr area 's economy - the mine in voerde , where they both work , is scheduled to close next year .
other businesses in the area , some of which depend on miners ' patronage , will suffer . " where mines have been closed , you notice the neighborhoods that bore the brunt of it have n't bounced back even after 20 or 30 years , " sen said .
" they might not quite be ghettos , but stores are closed and people do n't have money to buy . " structural change the ruhr region 's economy has been hard hit by the progressive shuttering of its heavy industry since the 1960s and successive waves of large-scale layoffs .
by the end of the 1990s , the once prosperous region had turned into a landscape of rusting industrial ruins , environmental degradation and dwindling hopes .
unemployment once reached 19 percent , although that number now stands at 14.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a light show at the repurposed mining tower , zollverein the region is now embarking on an economic redevelopment program that sees it moving away from heavy industry like steel and coal and toward the logistics , chemicals and service sectors .
the region will be one of europe 's cultural capitals for 2010 , and some of its industrial skeletons , like unused mining shaft towers , deserted factories , and silo-like gasometers , have already been turned into cultural spaces for exhibitions or performances . much ado about little ? some argue that miners ' complaints are exaggerated .
the agreement on ending the subsidies provides a " soft landing " for the workers and the federal and state governments will spend an estimated 21.6 billion euros over the next 11 years .
options for miners include retraining programs , job-search help , and start-up money for those wishing to become self-employed .
those who have 25 years underground can retire at 49 . " we are doing a lot for our miners , " said christof beike , a spokesman for dsk . but for those like henschen , used to the security mining once brought , that is cold comfort .
and even more then the end of an industry , it 's the end of a tradition and a life that might have been hard on the body , but was good for the soul . " now families are losing their bearings and the solidarity of our communities is being pulled apart , " he said .
" i think that 's a shame . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is our common wish ... that we get more transparency in financial markets , " chancellor angela merkel said after a regular informal meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy at a government guest house north of berlin .
she said that , along with fair trade and fair competition , that " must be a common european concern . "
the two leaders issued a joint statement in which they stressed that " open markets are the guarantor of europe 's prosperity and development . "
merkel noted that germany had made market transparency a key theme both during its european union presidency in the first six months of the year and during its year-long presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
" we have always had backing from the french side on this , " she added .
the chancellor called for a coordinated european approach .
" we must have as coherent an approach as possible , " she said , and added that the issue was not " arbitrary regulation but how europe can create conditions that others have . "
leaders target transparency and speculators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel kiss as they meet at schloss meseberg taking the fight to the speculators , sarkozy stated that he was " not against competition , but against speculation . " the french president added , " i am for the market economy , i am for globalization , but i am not for speculation . "
europe could not allow itself to be the venue " where the rest of the world comes to help itself , " sarkozy continued , stressing that his aim was " not protectionism , but reciprocity " with countries like the united states and china .
referring to the failure of international rating agencies to spot the looming us sub-prime mortgage crisis , merkel said the german government had been unable to explain to the population how nobody knew beforehand and why ordinary people were now facing the consequences .
other issues discussed by the two leaders included the energy sector in europe and a proposed " council of wise men " which would debate the future of the eu in the medium term .
merkel said it had not yet been decided who would sit on the council , and sarkozy said its aims were to sketch out how europe should evolve over the next 30 years .
nuclear power partnership apparently on course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france wants germany to follow its nuclear example on energy , sarkozy urged germany to follow france 's example of relying strongly on nuclear power for its energy needs .
" i would like france and germany to have similar ambitions , " sarkozy said atomic power meets about 40 percent of france 's energy needs , whereas germany plans to phase out nuclear energy gradually and mothball the last of its 17 reactors by about 2020 .
merkel responded by saying that she supported the continuation of the nuclear power joint venture between german industrial group siemens and french nuclear group areva np .
" i am of course interested in a deeper german-french cooperation , " she said .
sarkozy said , " we will strengthen our cooperation further , " adding that " nuclear energy is the power of the future ...
france is willing to work in concert with companies and siemens is already present . "
no mention of french plans for siemens it was reported in july that sarkozy planned to use an option to buy out siemens 's 34 percent stake in the nuclear power joint venture with state-controlled areva and forge a major national energy company .
the french government declined to comment at the time . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.09.2007 german tv sacks talk show host for praising nazi family politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman , herself a professional , thinks women are better suited for staying at home germany 's public broadcaster ard fired its well-known talk show host and controversial book author eva herman after she praised nazi family politics .
herman said on monday her statements were taken out of context . " mrs. herman 's authorial activities are in our view no longer compatible with her role as a television news reader and talk show host , " said volker herres , program director for german public network ard 's northern division norddeutscher rundfunk -lrb- ndr -rrb- , in a statement on the network 's web site . he also said that some guests had canceled their appearances on herman 's talk show in response to her public statements on motherhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in nazi germany received monetary incentives and medals for child-bearing herman , 48 , who already ruffled feathers last year by arguing that women should raise children rather than pursue careers of their own , was quoted by the media as speaking in glowing terms about the family values that were nurtured in the nazi era . " it was a gruesome time with a totally crazy and highly dangerous leader who led the germans into ruin as we all know , " herman said . " but there was at the time also something good , and that is the values , that is the children , that is the families , that is a togetherness - it was all abolished , there was nothing left . " herman 's new book " the noah 's ark principle : why we must save the family " -lrb- available in german -rrb- is a follow-up to her 2006 bestseller " the eva principle : for a new femininity . " in both books , herman openly discredits the merits of emancipation and mourns the loss of traditional gender roles that assigned women to the safe and comforting spot by the kitchen stove . motherhood crusade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women juggle their careers with obligations at home herman told bild newspaper on monday that she did n't understand why there was so much commotion about her views . " i expressly distanced myself from the ' third reich ' at several points , " herman said .
" one has to put my statement into its overall context .
this is n't about hitler 's values , but about basic human values , which were abused in the ' third reich ' and later abolished . " by praising the third reich family values , however , herman managed to raise the scandal bar to unprecedented heights . while it is true that the nazis offered incentives to child-bearing women , their family policies were an integral part of their racist ideology whose goal was the creation of a master race . " frau herman should know that what characterized the third reich was n't how mothers were treated , because they were just meant to produce cannon fodder , " author and holocaust survivor ralph giordano told bild . " what characterized it was the gas chambers . " preaching , not practicing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for almost two decades , herman was one of germany 's most popular news presenters married for the fourth time , having one child and - until now - a stellar television career that included 18 years of hosting germany 's premiere tv news show tageschau - eva herman was an unlikely candidate for a champion of antiquated gender roles . she proved , however , that one does n't have to practice what one preaches and that a successful career woman can tell other women that what they really want is to keep quiet and cook . " in eva herman 's case , even those of us who are women 's rights activists want her to return home to her kitchen stove , " said renate künast , a prominent member of the opposition green party . it is unlikely , however , that herman , who was often voted in the past as germany 's favorite news presenter , will get a chance to become a stay-at-home mom that she never was .
as a proponent of an ultra-conservative , pre-feminist fantasy world in which marriage , obedience and motherhood are considered the ultimate forms of self-fulfillment , she seems busier than ever . " frau herman is free to carry on her ' motherhood crusade , ' but this is no longer compatible with her role as an ndr tv presenter , " herres said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was a gruesome time with a totally crazy and highly dangerous leader who led the germans into ruin as we all know , " herman said .

" i expressly distanced myself from the ' third reich ' at several points , " herman said .
" one has to put my statement into its overall context .
this is n't about hitler 's values , but about basic human values , which were abused in the ' third reich ' and later abolished . " by praising the third reich family values , however , herman managed to raise the scandal bar to unprecedented heights . while it is true that the nazis offered incentives to child-bearing women , their family policies were an integral part of their racist ideology whose goal was the creation of a master race . " frau herman should know that what characterized the third reich was n't how mothers were treated , because they were just meant to produce cannon fodder , " author and holocaust survivor ralph giordano told bild .

" preaching , not practicing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for almost two decades , herman was one of germany 's most popular news presenters married for the fourth time , having one child and - until now - a stellar television career that included 18 years of hosting germany 's premiere tv news show tageschau - eva herman was an unlikely candidate for a champion of antiquated gender roles . she proved , however , that one does n't have to practice what one preaches and that a successful career woman can tell other women that what they really want is to keep quiet and cook .

herman said on monday her statements were taken out of context . " mrs. herman 's authorial activities are in our view no longer compatible with her role as a television news reader and talk show host , " said volker herres , program director for german public network ard 's northern division norddeutscher rundfunk -lrb- ndr -rrb- , in a statement on the network 's web site . he also said that some guests had canceled their appearances on herman 's talk show in response to her public statements on motherhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in nazi germany received monetary incentives and medals for child-bearing herman , 48 , who already ruffled feathers last year by arguing that women should raise children rather than pursue careers of their own , was quoted by the media as speaking in glowing terms about the family values that were nurtured in the nazi era . " it was a gruesome time with a totally crazy and highly dangerous leader who led the germans into ruin as we all know , " herman said . " but there was at the time also something good , and that is the values , that is the children , that is the families , that is a togetherness - it was all abolished , there was nothing left . " herman 's new book " the noah 's ark principle : why we must save the family " -lrb- available in german -rrb- is a follow-up to her 2006 bestseller " the eva principle : for a new femininity . " in both books , herman openly discredits the merits of emancipation and mourns the loss of traditional gender roles that assigned women to the safe and comforting spot by the kitchen stove . motherhood crusade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women juggle their careers with obligations at home herman told bild newspaper on monday that she did n't understand why there was so much commotion about her views . " i expressly distanced myself from the ' third reich ' at several points , " herman said .
" one has to put my statement into its overall context .
this is n't about hitler 's values , but about basic human values , which were abused in the ' third reich ' and later abolished . " by praising the third reich family values , however , herman managed to raise the scandal bar to unprecedented heights . while it is true that the nazis offered incentives to child-bearing women , their family policies were an integral part of their racist ideology whose goal was the creation of a master race . " frau herman should know that what characterized the third reich was n't how mothers were treated , because they were just meant to produce cannon fodder , " author and holocaust survivor ralph giordano told bild . " what characterized it was the gas chambers . " preaching , not practicing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for almost two decades , herman was one of germany 's most popular news presenters married for the fourth time , having one child and - until now - a stellar television career that included 18 years of hosting germany 's premiere tv news show tageschau - eva herman was an unlikely candidate for a champion of antiquated gender roles . she proved , however , that one does n't have to practice what one preaches and that a successful career woman can tell other women that what they really want is to keep quiet and cook . " in eva herman 's case , even those of us who are women 's rights activists want her to return home to her kitchen stove , " said renate künast , a prominent member of the opposition green party . it is unlikely , however , that herman , who was often voted in the past as germany 's favorite news presenter , will get a chance to become a stay-at-home mom that she never was .
as a proponent of an ultra-conservative , pre-feminist fantasy world in which marriage , obedience and motherhood are considered the ultimate forms of self-fulfillment , she seems busier than ever .

" in the event that a company does not obey the requirements , there will be corresponding sanctions . " german carmakers are expected to be hit especially hard by the new regulation : producers of luxury vehicles , such as porsche , daimler , bmw and audi , far exceed the emissions target and lag behind when it comes to hybrid technology that 's been pushed by companies such as toyota and honda . carmakers : size does matter in response to stavros ' comments , german carmakers are calling for varying emission targets according to the size of the car .
this would mean that producers of smaller vehicles , which already have lower emissions , would have to cut them even further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiedeking considers the targets a threat for luxury cars otherwise , " producers of small cars can be gleeful because the premium segment will disappear from the market , " porsche ceo wendelin wiedeking told handelsblatt newspaper , adding that it was n't luxury cars , but the mass-produced smaller vehicles that were responsible for most of the co2 emissions . while dimas said that his bill would take car size into consideration , he added that luxury car producers would still have to do their part .

gabriel said the united nations climate conference being held in bali in december should provide the " starting signal " for comprehensive talks on a new climate agreement for the period after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol runs out .
this had to contain a long-term goal , ambitious and obligatory commitments from the industrialized world , and fair contributions from the larger developing countries , he said .
" under the gleneagles dialogue we are working at making investment in climate protection technologies more attractive , " gabriel said .
the gleneagles dialogue was set up at the g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland in 2005 .

" many industrialized countries believe that the developing countries are unwilling and that they are doing too little , " the former norwegian prime minister and world health organization head said .
" many developing countries believe that the industrialized world has defaulted on the promise of financial and technology assistance , " she added .
industrialized nations urged to cut emissions the global leadership for climate action , comprising former prominent leaders , called for industrialized countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent over the period 1990 to 2050 .
the united states should commit itself to this goal , said the organization 's presidents , former chilean president ricardo lagos and the president of the un foundation , former us senator timothy e wirth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the return of religion in search of germany 's religious identity ex-muslims demand right to renounce islamic faith promises of miracles attract millions to nigeria 's churches most european nations keep god out of constitution religion -pipe- 10.09.2007 theologian küng : christianity gets on many people 's nerves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : küng : religion can co-exist with democracy for catholic theologian hans küng , religion has again become a power factor .
while islam and buddhism are getting more popular , christianity is n't .
the controversial theologian spoke to dw-world.de about the reasons . born in 1928 , catholic theologian and church critic hans küng made his mark as a promoter of dialogue between religions and as president of the global ethic foundation .
in 1979 , the vatican withdrew his license to teach after the swiss native questioned the infallibility of the pope .
in the fall of 2005 , pope benedict xvi invited küng to a private meeting .
dw-world.de : professor küng , people - and not only in germany - are again enormously interested in religious issues .
can we speak of a return of religions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran in 1979 : ayatollah chomeini is back from exile hans küng : " return of religions " - that is an ambivalent term .
religion never disappeared .
just like music , religion is something that stays , even if it is suppressed for some time .
it is true , that since the new awakening of islam , since the creation of the islamic republic of iran in 1979 , europeans have realized that they do n't rule the world by themselves .
for a long time , secular europe had not realized that it was an exception , and that elsewhere , religions is a power .
" no peace among the nations , without peace between the religions !
no peace between the religions without dialog between the religions ! "
those are two central sentences of your world ethic principle .
in a time of globalization , there are many undreamed-of possibilities for communication on the internet .
the access to knowledge is easier than ever before .
can this development improve the dialog of religions ?
in principle , i would say yes , even though this brings many problems .
it 's a positive thing that today we can know a lot about other religions .
a different question , of course , is whether we do want to be in the know .
there are people who do n't - they already know everything , without studying the islam .
who does n't want to know ?
for one , the fundamental christians who take everything the bible says literally and say they do n't need any other religions .
then there are the very secular people , dogmatists of laicism .
they get worked up simply when the word religion is mentioned , and they think that we should not talk about it in schools .
they have issues with the fact that religion , again , is a powerful factor in world history .
according to a survey , not christianity but buddhism is the most likeable religion for germans .
how do you explain that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .
it is a religion that 's turned to the inside and that emphasizes meditation .
it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .
of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .
even though islam is seen skeptically throughout europe , it attracts many , especially young people , around the globe .
there are 1.3 billion muslims , with an upward trend .
from rabat to damascus there are islamic groups that are becoming increasingly important politically .
why is that so ?
are there religious or social reasons for this ?
both .
those are religious groups that help people .
many muslims in those countries feel that the ruling elites have a life of their own and do n't take care of the population at large .
the fundamental islamist groups - or whatever you want to call them - try very hard to do something for people .
they take care of schools and education , and they give people clothes and food .
why did hamas win the elections -lsb- in the palestinian territories -rsb- ?
because they worked for the people .
one of the biggest mistakes of western politics - germany included , by the way - was to not accept those elections .
instead , fingers were pointed , saying : " you have to accept israel ! "
tell that to people that have been terrorized by an occupying power for decades .
that is not the right way to solve those problems .
you have to realize that there are parties that do have islam as a basis , yet they campaign for the people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate young muslims make themselves available for terrorist attacks a better example is the party of prime minister erdogan in turkey .
why did they win ?
because they helped people .
they showed - with all weaknesses that they have - that they will bring their country forward and in no way did they develop an islamic theocracy , such as the one in iran .
they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .

when i wrote the book in 1990 , of course , one hoped that in the future , problems would not be solved with military means , with aggression and animosity and war , but instead - just like it worked in western and eastern europe - through mutual understanding , cooperation and integration .
unfortunately , this was disrupted by the mad policies that the second bush administration initiated with a clique of archconservative jewish intellectuals , so-called neocons and protestant fundamentalists .
i am not an enemy , but a friend of the americans .

while islam and buddhism are getting more popular , christianity is n't .
the controversial theologian spoke to dw-world.de about the reasons . born in 1928 , catholic theologian and church critic hans küng made his mark as a promoter of dialogue between religions and as president of the global ethic foundation .
in 1979 , the vatican withdrew his license to teach after the swiss native questioned the infallibility of the pope .
in the fall of 2005 , pope benedict xvi invited küng to a private meeting .
dw-world.de : professor küng , people - and not only in germany - are again enormously interested in religious issues .
can we speak of a return of religions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran in 1979 : ayatollah chomeini is back from exile hans küng : " return of religions " - that is an ambivalent term .
religion never disappeared .
just like music , religion is something that stays , even if it is suppressed for some time .
it is true , that since the new awakening of islam , since the creation of the islamic republic of iran in 1979 , europeans have realized that they do n't rule the world by themselves .
for a long time , secular europe had not realized that it was an exception , and that elsewhere , religions is a power .
" no peace among the nations , without peace between the religions !
no peace between the religions without dialog between the religions ! "
those are two central sentences of your world ethic principle .
in a time of globalization , there are many undreamed-of possibilities for communication on the internet .
the access to knowledge is easier than ever before .
can this development improve the dialog of religions ?
in principle , i would say yes , even though this brings many problems .
it 's a positive thing that today we can know a lot about other religions .
a different question , of course , is whether we do want to be in the know .
there are people who do n't - they already know everything , without studying the islam .
who does n't want to know ?
for one , the fundamental christians who take everything the bible says literally and say they do n't need any other religions .
then there are the very secular people , dogmatists of laicism .
they get worked up simply when the word religion is mentioned , and they think that we should not talk about it in schools .
they have issues with the fact that religion , again , is a powerful factor in world history .
according to a survey , not christianity but buddhism is the most likeable religion for germans .
how do you explain that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .
it is a religion that 's turned to the inside and that emphasizes meditation .
it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .
of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .
even though islam is seen skeptically throughout europe , it attracts many , especially young people , around the globe .
there are 1.3 billion muslims , with an upward trend .
from rabat to damascus there are islamic groups that are becoming increasingly important politically .
why is that so ?
are there religious or social reasons for this ?
both .
those are religious groups that help people .
many muslims in those countries feel that the ruling elites have a life of their own and do n't take care of the population at large .
the fundamental islamist groups - or whatever you want to call them - try very hard to do something for people .
they take care of schools and education , and they give people clothes and food .
why did hamas win the elections -lsb- in the palestinian territories -rsb- ?
because they worked for the people .
one of the biggest mistakes of western politics - germany included , by the way - was to not accept those elections .
instead , fingers were pointed , saying : " you have to accept israel ! "
tell that to people that have been terrorized by an occupying power for decades .
that is not the right way to solve those problems .
you have to realize that there are parties that do have islam as a basis , yet they campaign for the people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate young muslims make themselves available for terrorist attacks a better example is the party of prime minister erdogan in turkey .
why did they win ?
because they helped people .
they showed - with all weaknesses that they have - that they will bring their country forward and in no way did they develop an islamic theocracy , such as the one in iran .
they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .
how far would the willingness to negotiate with the radical powers have to go ?

while islam and buddhism are getting more popular , christianity is n't .
the controversial theologian spoke to dw-world.de about the reasons . born in 1928 , catholic theologian and church critic hans küng made his mark as a promoter of dialogue between religions and as president of the global ethic foundation .
in 1979 , the vatican withdrew his license to teach after the swiss native questioned the infallibility of the pope .
in the fall of 2005 , pope benedict xvi invited küng to a private meeting .
dw-world.de : professor küng , people - and not only in germany - are again enormously interested in religious issues .
can we speak of a return of religions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran in 1979 : ayatollah chomeini is back from exile hans küng : " return of religions " - that is an ambivalent term .
religion never disappeared .
just like music , religion is something that stays , even if it is suppressed for some time .
it is true , that since the new awakening of islam , since the creation of the islamic republic of iran in 1979 , europeans have realized that they do n't rule the world by themselves .
for a long time , secular europe had not realized that it was an exception , and that elsewhere , religions is a power .
" no peace among the nations , without peace between the religions !
no peace between the religions without dialog between the religions ! "
those are two central sentences of your world ethic principle .
in a time of globalization , there are many undreamed-of possibilities for communication on the internet .
the access to knowledge is easier than ever before .
can this development improve the dialog of religions ?
in principle , i would say yes , even though this brings many problems .
it 's a positive thing that today we can know a lot about other religions .
a different question , of course , is whether we do want to be in the know .
there are people who do n't - they already know everything , without studying the islam .
who does n't want to know ?
for one , the fundamental christians who take everything the bible says literally and say they do n't need any other religions .
then there are the very secular people , dogmatists of laicism .
they get worked up simply when the word religion is mentioned , and they think that we should not talk about it in schools .
they have issues with the fact that religion , again , is a powerful factor in world history .
according to a survey , not christianity but buddhism is the most likeable religion for germans .
how do you explain that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .
it is a religion that 's turned to the inside and that emphasizes meditation .
it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .
of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .
even though islam is seen skeptically throughout europe , it attracts many , especially young people , around the globe .
there are 1.3 billion muslims , with an upward trend .
from rabat to damascus there are islamic groups that are becoming increasingly important politically .
why is that so ?
are there religious or social reasons for this ?
both .
those are religious groups that help people .
many muslims in those countries feel that the ruling elites have a life of their own and do n't take care of the population at large .
the fundamental islamist groups - or whatever you want to call them - try very hard to do something for people .
they take care of schools and education , and they give people clothes and food .
why did hamas win the elections -lsb- in the palestinian territories -rsb- ?
because they worked for the people .
one of the biggest mistakes of western politics - germany included , by the way - was to not accept those elections .
instead , fingers were pointed , saying : " you have to accept israel ! "
tell that to people that have been terrorized by an occupying power for decades .
that is not the right way to solve those problems .
you have to realize that there are parties that do have islam as a basis , yet they campaign for the people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate young muslims make themselves available for terrorist attacks a better example is the party of prime minister erdogan in turkey .
why did they win ?
because they helped people .
they showed - with all weaknesses that they have - that they will bring their country forward and in no way did they develop an islamic theocracy , such as the one in iran .
they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .
how far would the willingness to negotiate with the radical powers have to go ?
would one have to negotiate with the taliban and al qaeda as well ?
you can not negotiate with al qaeda .
it is a secret terrorist group .
you can only dry them up .
but the west has watered them so much that they could sprout .
the american secret service recently admitted in secret documents that the iraq war only helped al qaeda .
before , there was no al qaeda in iraq .
you could certainly negotiate with the taliban .
they are n't just crazy people .
there are some extremists , and there are , on the other hand , those that warned the bush administration about sept .
11 .
but it was n't taken seriously .
there were chieftains in afghanistan that warned against marching in with an army .
a personal question : on sept .
12 you will introduce your autobiography " controversial truth . "
if you look back , are you still as optimistic as you were in 1990 when you wrote " global responsibility : in search of a new world ethic " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen after bush ?
when i wrote the book in 1990 , of course , one hoped that in the future , problems would not be solved with military means , with aggression and animosity and war , but instead - just like it worked in western and eastern europe - through mutual understanding , cooperation and integration .
unfortunately , this was disrupted by the mad policies that the second bush administration initiated with a clique of archconservative jewish intellectuals , so-called neocons and protestant fundamentalists .
i am not an enemy , but a friend of the americans .
i hope that , despite the backlash that the policies of bush jr. brought on , americans can remember their great democratic tradition and lead in terms of international understanding , moderation and world peace .
were you hurt that pope benedict xvi never accepted your idea of the world ethic ?
he accepted the idea as such .
he realizes that there have to be common ethical standards .
during our conversation he conceded that those standards need to be valid for believers and non-believers .
one could only have expected that he would personally advocate this .
but that might still happen . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while islam and buddhism are getting more popular , christianity is n't .
the controversial theologian spoke to dw-world.de about the reasons . born in 1928 , catholic theologian and church critic hans küng made his mark as a promoter of dialogue between religions and as president of the global ethic foundation .
in 1979 , the vatican withdrew his license to teach after the swiss native questioned the infallibility of the pope .
in the fall of 2005 , pope benedict xvi invited küng to a private meeting .
dw-world.de : professor küng , people - and not only in germany - are again enormously interested in religious issues .
can we speak of a return of religions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran in 1979 : ayatollah chomeini is back from exile hans küng : " return of religions " - that is an ambivalent term .
religion never disappeared .
just like music , religion is something that stays , even if it is suppressed for some time .
it is true , that since the new awakening of islam , since the creation of the islamic republic of iran in 1979 , europeans have realized that they do n't rule the world by themselves .
for a long time , secular europe had not realized that it was an exception , and that elsewhere , religions is a power .
" no peace among the nations , without peace between the religions !
no peace between the religions without dialog between the religions ! "
those are two central sentences of your world ethic principle .
in a time of globalization , there are many undreamed-of possibilities for communication on the internet .
the access to knowledge is easier than ever before .
can this development improve the dialog of religions ?
in principle , i would say yes , even though this brings many problems .
it 's a positive thing that today we can know a lot about other religions .
a different question , of course , is whether we do want to be in the know .
there are people who do n't - they already know everything , without studying the islam .
who does n't want to know ?
for one , the fundamental christians who take everything the bible says literally and say they do n't need any other religions .
then there are the very secular people , dogmatists of laicism .
they get worked up simply when the word religion is mentioned , and they think that we should not talk about it in schools .
they have issues with the fact that religion , again , is a powerful factor in world history .
according to a survey , not christianity but buddhism is the most likeable religion for germans .
how do you explain that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .
it is a religion that 's turned to the inside and that emphasizes meditation .
it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .
of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .
even though islam is seen skeptically throughout europe , it attracts many , especially young people , around the globe .
there are 1.3 billion muslims , with an upward trend .
from rabat to damascus there are islamic groups that are becoming increasingly important politically .
why is that so ?
are there religious or social reasons for this ?
both .
those are religious groups that help people .
many muslims in those countries feel that the ruling elites have a life of their own and do n't take care of the population at large .
the fundamental islamist groups - or whatever you want to call them - try very hard to do something for people .
they take care of schools and education , and they give people clothes and food .
why did hamas win the elections -lsb- in the palestinian territories -rsb- ?
because they worked for the people .
one of the biggest mistakes of western politics - germany included , by the way - was to not accept those elections .
instead , fingers were pointed , saying : " you have to accept israel ! "
tell that to people that have been terrorized by an occupying power for decades .
that is not the right way to solve those problems .
you have to realize that there are parties that do have islam as a basis , yet they campaign for the people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate young muslims make themselves available for terrorist attacks a better example is the party of prime minister erdogan in turkey .
why did they win ?
because they helped people .
they showed - with all weaknesses that they have - that they will bring their country forward and in no way did they develop an islamic theocracy , such as the one in iran .
they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .
how far would the willingness to negotiate with the radical powers have to go ?
would one have to negotiate with the taliban and al qaeda as well ?
you can not negotiate with al qaeda .
it is a secret terrorist group .
you can only dry them up .
but the west has watered them so much that they could sprout .
the american secret service recently admitted in secret documents that the iraq war only helped al qaeda .
before , there was no al qaeda in iraq .
you could certainly negotiate with the taliban .
they are n't just crazy people .
there are some extremists , and there are , on the other hand , those that warned the bush administration about sept .
11 .
but it was n't taken seriously .
there were chieftains in afghanistan that warned against marching in with an army .
a personal question : on sept .
12 you will introduce your autobiography " controversial truth . "
if you look back , are you still as optimistic as you were in 1990 when you wrote " global responsibility : in search of a new world ethic " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen after bush ?
when i wrote the book in 1990 , of course , one hoped that in the future , problems would not be solved with military means , with aggression and animosity and war , but instead - just like it worked in western and eastern europe - through mutual understanding , cooperation and integration .
unfortunately , this was disrupted by the mad policies that the second bush administration initiated with a clique of archconservative jewish intellectuals , so-called neocons and protestant fundamentalists .
i am not an enemy , but a friend of the americans .
i hope that , despite the backlash that the policies of bush jr. brought on , americans can remember their great democratic tradition and lead in terms of international understanding , moderation and world peace .
were you hurt that pope benedict xvi never accepted your idea of the world ethic ?
he accepted the idea as such .
he realizes that there have to be common ethical standards .
during our conversation he conceded that those standards need to be valid for believers and non-believers .
one could only have expected that he would personally advocate this .
but that might still happen . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is our common wish ... that we get more transparency in financial markets , " chancellor angela merkel said after a regular informal meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy at a government guest house north of berlin .
she said that , along with fair trade and fair competition , that " must be a common european concern . "
the two leaders issued a joint statement in which they stressed that " open markets are the guarantor of europe 's prosperity and development . "
merkel noted that germany had made market transparency a key theme both during its european union presidency in the first six months of the year and during its year-long presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
" we have always had backing from the french side on this , " she added .
the chancellor called for a coordinated european approach .
" we must have as coherent an approach as possible , " she said , and added that the issue was not " arbitrary regulation but how europe can create conditions that others have . "
leaders target transparency and speculators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel kiss as they meet at schloss meseberg taking the fight to the speculators , sarkozy stated that he was " not against competition , but against speculation . " the french president added , " i am for the market economy , i am for globalization , but i am not for speculation . "
europe could not allow itself to be the venue " where the rest of the world comes to help itself , " sarkozy continued , stressing that his aim was " not protectionism , but reciprocity " with countries like the united states and china .
referring to the failure of international rating agencies to spot the looming us sub-prime mortgage crisis , merkel said the german government had been unable to explain to the population how nobody knew beforehand and why ordinary people were now facing the consequences .
other issues discussed by the two leaders included the energy sector in europe and a proposed " council of wise men " which would debate the future of the eu in the medium term .
merkel said it had not yet been decided who would sit on the council , and sarkozy said its aims were to sketch out how europe should evolve over the next 30 years .
nuclear power partnership apparently on course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france wants germany to follow its nuclear example on energy , sarkozy urged germany to follow france 's example of relying strongly on nuclear power for its energy needs .
" i would like france and germany to have similar ambitions , " sarkozy said atomic power meets about 40 percent of france 's energy needs , whereas germany plans to phase out nuclear energy gradually and mothball the last of its 17 reactors by about 2020 .
merkel responded by saying that she supported the continuation of the nuclear power joint venture between german industrial group siemens and french nuclear group areva np .
" i am of course interested in a deeper german-french cooperation , " she said .
sarkozy said , " we will strengthen our cooperation further , " adding that " nuclear energy is the power of the future ...
france is willing to work in concert with companies and siemens is already present . "
no mention of french plans for siemens it was reported in july that sarkozy planned to use an option to buy out siemens 's 34 percent stake in the nuclear power joint venture with state-controlled areva and forge a major national energy company .

they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .
how far would the willingness to negotiate with the radical powers have to go ?
would one have to negotiate with the taliban and al qaeda as well ?
you can not negotiate with al qaeda .
it is a secret terrorist group .
you can only dry them up .
but the west has watered them so much that they could sprout .
the american secret service recently admitted in secret documents that the iraq war only helped al qaeda .
before , there was no al qaeda in iraq .
you could certainly negotiate with the taliban .
they are n't just crazy people .
there are some extremists , and there are , on the other hand , those that warned the bush administration about sept .
11 .
but it was n't taken seriously .
there were chieftains in afghanistan that warned against marching in with an army .
a personal question : on sept .
12 you will introduce your autobiography " controversial truth . "
if you look back , are you still as optimistic as you were in 1990 when you wrote " global responsibility : in search of a new world ethic " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen after bush ?
when i wrote the book in 1990 , of course , one hoped that in the future , problems would not be solved with military means , with aggression and animosity and war , but instead - just like it worked in western and eastern europe - through mutual understanding , cooperation and integration .
unfortunately , this was disrupted by the mad policies that the second bush administration initiated with a clique of archconservative jewish intellectuals , so-called neocons and protestant fundamentalists .
i am not an enemy , but a friend of the americans .
i hope that , despite the backlash that the policies of bush jr. brought on , americans can remember their great democratic tradition and lead in terms of international understanding , moderation and world peace .
were you hurt that pope benedict xvi never accepted your idea of the world ethic ?
he accepted the idea as such .
he realizes that there have to be common ethical standards .
during our conversation he conceded that those standards need to be valid for believers and non-believers .
one could only have expected that he would personally advocate this .
but that might still happen . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.09.2007 german tv sacks talk show host for praising nazi family politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman , herself a professional , thinks women are better suited for staying at home germany 's public broadcaster ard fired its well-known talk show host and controversial book author eva herman after she praised nazi family politics .
herman said on monday her statements were taken out of context . " mrs. herman 's authorial activities are in our view no longer compatible with her role as a television news reader and talk show host , " said volker herres , program director for german public network ard 's northern division norddeutscher rundfunk -lrb- ndr -rrb- , in a statement on the network 's web site . he also said that some guests had canceled their appearances on herman 's talk show in response to her public statements on motherhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in nazi germany received monetary incentives and medals for child-bearing herman , 48 , who already ruffled feathers last year by arguing that women should raise children rather than pursue careers of their own , was quoted by the media as speaking in glowing terms about the family values that were nurtured in the nazi era . " it was a gruesome time with a totally crazy and highly dangerous leader who led the germans into ruin as we all know , " herman said . " but there was at the time also something good , and that is the values , that is the children , that is the families , that is a togetherness - it was all abolished , there was nothing left . " herman 's new book " the noah 's ark principle : why we must save the family " -lrb- available in german -rrb- is a follow-up to her 2006 bestseller " the eva principle : for a new femininity . " in both books , herman openly discredits the merits of emancipation and mourns the loss of traditional gender roles that assigned women to the safe and comforting spot by the kitchen stove . motherhood crusade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women juggle their careers with obligations at home herman told bild newspaper on monday that she did n't understand why there was so much commotion about her views . " i expressly distanced myself from the ' third reich ' at several points , " herman said .
" one has to put my statement into its overall context .
this is n't about hitler 's values , but about basic human values , which were abused in the ' third reich ' and later abolished . " by praising the third reich family values , however , herman managed to raise the scandal bar to unprecedented heights . while it is true that the nazis offered incentives to child-bearing women , their family policies were an integral part of their racist ideology whose goal was the creation of a master race . " frau herman should know that what characterized the third reich was n't how mothers were treated , because they were just meant to produce cannon fodder , " author and holocaust survivor ralph giordano told bild . " what characterized it was the gas chambers . " preaching , not practicing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for almost two decades , herman was one of germany 's most popular news presenters married for the fourth time , having one child and - until now - a stellar television career that included 18 years of hosting germany 's premiere tv news show tageschau - eva herman was an unlikely candidate for a champion of antiquated gender roles . she proved , however , that one does n't have to practice what one preaches and that a successful career woman can tell other women that what they really want is to keep quiet and cook . " in eva herman 's case , even those of us who are women 's rights activists want her to return home to her kitchen stove , " said renate künast , a prominent member of the opposition green party . it is unlikely , however , that herman , who was often voted in the past as germany 's favorite news presenter , will get a chance to become a stay-at-home mom that she never was .
as a proponent of an ultra-conservative , pre-feminist fantasy world in which marriage , obedience and motherhood are considered the ultimate forms of self-fulfillment , she seems busier than ever . " frau herman is free to carry on her ' motherhood crusade , ' but this is no longer compatible with her role as an ndr tv presenter , " herres said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the return of religion in search of germany 's religious identity ex-muslims demand right to renounce islamic faith promises of miracles attract millions to nigeria 's churches most european nations keep god out of constitution religion -pipe- 10.09.2007 theologian küng : christianity gets on many people 's nerves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : küng : religion can co-exist with democracy for catholic theologian hans küng , religion has again become a power factor .
while islam and buddhism are getting more popular , christianity is n't .
the controversial theologian spoke to dw-world.de about the reasons . born in 1928 , catholic theologian and church critic hans küng made his mark as a promoter of dialogue between religions and as president of the global ethic foundation .
in 1979 , the vatican withdrew his license to teach after the swiss native questioned the infallibility of the pope .
in the fall of 2005 , pope benedict xvi invited küng to a private meeting .
dw-world.de : professor küng , people - and not only in germany - are again enormously interested in religious issues .
can we speak of a return of religions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran in 1979 : ayatollah chomeini is back from exile hans küng : " return of religions " - that is an ambivalent term .
religion never disappeared .
just like music , religion is something that stays , even if it is suppressed for some time .
it is true , that since the new awakening of islam , since the creation of the islamic republic of iran in 1979 , europeans have realized that they do n't rule the world by themselves .
for a long time , secular europe had not realized that it was an exception , and that elsewhere , religions is a power .
" no peace among the nations , without peace between the religions !
no peace between the religions without dialog between the religions ! "
those are two central sentences of your world ethic principle .
in a time of globalization , there are many undreamed-of possibilities for communication on the internet .
the access to knowledge is easier than ever before .
can this development improve the dialog of religions ?
in principle , i would say yes , even though this brings many problems .
it 's a positive thing that today we can know a lot about other religions .
a different question , of course , is whether we do want to be in the know .
there are people who do n't - they already know everything , without studying the islam .
who does n't want to know ?
for one , the fundamental christians who take everything the bible says literally and say they do n't need any other religions .
then there are the very secular people , dogmatists of laicism .
they get worked up simply when the word religion is mentioned , and they think that we should not talk about it in schools .
they have issues with the fact that religion , again , is a powerful factor in world history .
according to a survey , not christianity but buddhism is the most likeable religion for germans .
how do you explain that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .
it is a religion that 's turned to the inside and that emphasizes meditation .
it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .
of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .
even though islam is seen skeptically throughout europe , it attracts many , especially young people , around the globe .
there are 1.3 billion muslims , with an upward trend .
from rabat to damascus there are islamic groups that are becoming increasingly important politically .
why is that so ?
are there religious or social reasons for this ?
both .
those are religious groups that help people .
many muslims in those countries feel that the ruling elites have a life of their own and do n't take care of the population at large .
the fundamental islamist groups - or whatever you want to call them - try very hard to do something for people .
they take care of schools and education , and they give people clothes and food .
why did hamas win the elections -lsb- in the palestinian territories -rsb- ?
because they worked for the people .
one of the biggest mistakes of western politics - germany included , by the way - was to not accept those elections .
instead , fingers were pointed , saying : " you have to accept israel ! "
tell that to people that have been terrorized by an occupying power for decades .
that is not the right way to solve those problems .
you have to realize that there are parties that do have islam as a basis , yet they campaign for the people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate young muslims make themselves available for terrorist attacks a better example is the party of prime minister erdogan in turkey .
why did they win ?
because they helped people .
they showed - with all weaknesses that they have - that they will bring their country forward and in no way did they develop an islamic theocracy , such as the one in iran .
they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .
how far would the willingness to negotiate with the radical powers have to go ?
would one have to negotiate with the taliban and al qaeda as well ?
you can not negotiate with al qaeda .
it is a secret terrorist group .
you can only dry them up .
but the west has watered them so much that they could sprout .
the american secret service recently admitted in secret documents that the iraq war only helped al qaeda .
before , there was no al qaeda in iraq .
you could certainly negotiate with the taliban .
they are n't just crazy people .
there are some extremists , and there are , on the other hand , those that warned the bush administration about sept .
11 .
but it was n't taken seriously .
there were chieftains in afghanistan that warned against marching in with an army .
a personal question : on sept .
12 you will introduce your autobiography " controversial truth . "
if you look back , are you still as optimistic as you were in 1990 when you wrote " global responsibility : in search of a new world ethic " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen after bush ?
when i wrote the book in 1990 , of course , one hoped that in the future , problems would not be solved with military means , with aggression and animosity and war , but instead - just like it worked in western and eastern europe - through mutual understanding , cooperation and integration .
unfortunately , this was disrupted by the mad policies that the second bush administration initiated with a clique of archconservative jewish intellectuals , so-called neocons and protestant fundamentalists .
i am not an enemy , but a friend of the americans .
i hope that , despite the backlash that the policies of bush jr. brought on , americans can remember their great democratic tradition and lead in terms of international understanding , moderation and world peace .
were you hurt that pope benedict xvi never accepted your idea of the world ethic ?
he accepted the idea as such .
he realizes that there have to be common ethical standards .
during our conversation he conceded that those standards need to be valid for believers and non-believers .
one could only have expected that he would personally advocate this .
but that might still happen . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 10.09.2007 merkel , sarkozy call for more transparency on financial markets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel under an umbrella of reform german chancellor merkel and french president sarkozy on monday called for a european push for more transparency on financial markets following recent turbulence . " it is our common wish ... that we get more transparency in financial markets , " chancellor angela merkel said after a regular informal meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy at a government guest house north of berlin .
she said that , along with fair trade and fair competition , that " must be a common european concern . "
the two leaders issued a joint statement in which they stressed that " open markets are the guarantor of europe 's prosperity and development . "
merkel noted that germany had made market transparency a key theme both during its european union presidency in the first six months of the year and during its year-long presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
" we have always had backing from the french side on this , " she added .
the chancellor called for a coordinated european approach .
" we must have as coherent an approach as possible , " she said , and added that the issue was not " arbitrary regulation but how europe can create conditions that others have . "
leaders target transparency and speculators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel kiss as they meet at schloss meseberg taking the fight to the speculators , sarkozy stated that he was " not against competition , but against speculation . " the french president added , " i am for the market economy , i am for globalization , but i am not for speculation . "
europe could not allow itself to be the venue " where the rest of the world comes to help itself , " sarkozy continued , stressing that his aim was " not protectionism , but reciprocity " with countries like the united states and china .
referring to the failure of international rating agencies to spot the looming us sub-prime mortgage crisis , merkel said the german government had been unable to explain to the population how nobody knew beforehand and why ordinary people were now facing the consequences .
other issues discussed by the two leaders included the energy sector in europe and a proposed " council of wise men " which would debate the future of the eu in the medium term .
merkel said it had not yet been decided who would sit on the council , and sarkozy said its aims were to sketch out how europe should evolve over the next 30 years .

herman said on monday her statements were taken out of context .

" it was a gruesome time with a totally crazy and highly dangerous leader who led the germans into ruin as we all know , " herman said . " but there was at the time also something good , and that is the values , that is the children , that is the families , that is a togetherness - it was all abolished , there was nothing left .

" in both books , herman openly discredits the merits of emancipation and mourns the loss of traditional gender roles that assigned women to the safe and comforting spot by the kitchen stove . motherhood crusade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women juggle their careers with obligations at home herman told bild newspaper on monday that she did n't understand why there was so much commotion about her views . " i expressly distanced myself from the ' third reich ' at several points , " herman said .
" one has to put my statement into its overall context .
this is n't about hitler 's values , but about basic human values , which were abused in the ' third reich ' and later abolished . " by praising the third reich family values , however , herman managed to raise the scandal bar to unprecedented heights . while it is true that the nazis offered incentives to child-bearing women , their family policies were an integral part of their racist ideology whose goal was the creation of a master race . " frau herman should know that what characterized the third reich was n't how mothers were treated , because they were just meant to produce cannon fodder , " author and holocaust survivor ralph giordano told bild . " what characterized it was the gas chambers . " preaching , not practicing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for almost two decades , herman was one of germany 's most popular news presenters married for the fourth time , having one child and - until now - a stellar television career that included 18 years of hosting germany 's premiere tv news show tageschau - eva herman was an unlikely candidate for a champion of antiquated gender roles . she proved , however , that one does n't have to practice what one preaches and that a successful career woman can tell other women that what they really want is to keep quiet and cook . " in eva herman 's case , even those of us who are women 's rights activists want her to return home to her kitchen stove , " said renate künast , a prominent member of the opposition green party . it is unlikely , however , that herman , who was often voted in the past as germany 's favorite news presenter , will get a chance to become a stay-at-home mom that she never was .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.09.2007 german tv sacks talk show host for praising nazi family politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman , herself a professional , thinks women are better suited for staying at home germany 's public broadcaster ard fired its well-known talk show host and controversial book author eva herman after she praised nazi family politics .
herman said on monday her statements were taken out of context . " mrs. herman 's authorial activities are in our view no longer compatible with her role as a television news reader and talk show host , " said volker herres , program director for german public network ard 's northern division norddeutscher rundfunk -lrb- ndr -rrb- , in a statement on the network 's web site . he also said that some guests had canceled their appearances on herman 's talk show in response to her public statements on motherhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in nazi germany received monetary incentives and medals for child-bearing herman , 48 , who already ruffled feathers last year by arguing that women should raise children rather than pursue careers of their own , was quoted by the media as speaking in glowing terms about the family values that were nurtured in the nazi era . " it was a gruesome time with a totally crazy and highly dangerous leader who led the germans into ruin as we all know , " herman said . " but there was at the time also something good , and that is the values , that is the children , that is the families , that is a togetherness - it was all abolished , there was nothing left . " herman 's new book " the noah 's ark principle : why we must save the family " -lrb- available in german -rrb- is a follow-up to her 2006 bestseller " the eva principle : for a new femininity . " in both books , herman openly discredits the merits of emancipation and mourns the loss of traditional gender roles that assigned women to the safe and comforting spot by the kitchen stove . motherhood crusade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women juggle their careers with obligations at home herman told bild newspaper on monday that she did n't understand why there was so much commotion about her views . " i expressly distanced myself from the ' third reich ' at several points , " herman said .
" one has to put my statement into its overall context .
this is n't about hitler 's values , but about basic human values , which were abused in the ' third reich ' and later abolished . " by praising the third reich family values , however , herman managed to raise the scandal bar to unprecedented heights . while it is true that the nazis offered incentives to child-bearing women , their family policies were an integral part of their racist ideology whose goal was the creation of a master race . " frau herman should know that what characterized the third reich was n't how mothers were treated , because they were just meant to produce cannon fodder , " author and holocaust survivor ralph giordano told bild . " what characterized it was the gas chambers . " preaching , not practicing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for almost two decades , herman was one of germany 's most popular news presenters married for the fourth time , having one child and - until now - a stellar television career that included 18 years of hosting germany 's premiere tv news show tageschau - eva herman was an unlikely candidate for a champion of antiquated gender roles . she proved , however , that one does n't have to practice what one preaches and that a successful career woman can tell other women that what they really want is to keep quiet and cook . " in eva herman 's case , even those of us who are women 's rights activists want her to return home to her kitchen stove , " said renate künast , a prominent member of the opposition green party . it is unlikely , however , that herman , who was often voted in the past as germany 's favorite news presenter , will get a chance to become a stay-at-home mom that she never was .
as a proponent of an ultra-conservative , pre-feminist fantasy world in which marriage , obedience and motherhood are considered the ultimate forms of self-fulfillment , she seems busier than ever . " frau herman is free to carry on her ' motherhood crusade , ' but this is no longer compatible with her role as an ndr tv presenter , " herres said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de : civil society is taking on the traditional responsibilities of political parties , which seem powerless in the face of global trends .
what future do political parties have in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detmar doering detmar doering : i do n't think parties are really powerless in the face of global trends .
it 's true that non-governmental organizations do dominate the international political agenda today while political parties only influence international political institutions in an indirect manner .
but i do n't think you can underestimate that influence .
since parties are anchored institutions in germany , they will continue to exist and play an important role in our country .
but if they want to continue to play an important role in citizens ' perceptions and justify their legitimacy through it , they need to change their work and make it more open .
what form could the changes take ?
for instance , through project-related , temporary party membership that corresponds to the desire for getting involved without being forced to make a permanent commitment .
or by intensifying their internet presence , which offers a dialog form of communication .
it 's equally important to credibly build up a party base - for instance through support networks .
a fundamental factor includes " external conditions " or , in other words , the electoral rules .
the american experiment in " term limits " deserves our attention at the very least .
in that way you can get rid of the outdated personnel structures that damage the image of politics .
parties are constantly losing members .
young people are said to be uninterested in politics .
for years , there 's been talk of voter apathy .
there 's no doubt that the number of political party organizations is slipping .
the public image of political parties has sharply dropped in the past years .
that may have to do with other political alternatives in civil society that increasingly and credibly compete with parties for committed citizens .
but that 's a sign of maturity in a pluralist society rather than a blemish .
competition revives business .
the consequence must be that parties make an effort to be more attractive to voters .
liberal positions in business are now represented by the conservatives , and even the social democrats increasingly appeal to the responsibility of each individual in their political messages .
do you think there 's room for a liberal party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle heads germany 's fdp it 's definitely good if you can find a certain basic liberal consensus in all parties , because otherwise democracy would be seriously threatened .
but that 's not enough .
we are n't currently seeing an open rejection of liberal principles , but there 's certainly a creeping erosion of freedoms .
economic liberalization - though it 's more important than ever - no longer exists .
the big brother state has begun to take on grotesque proportions , a paternalistic idea of the state that wants to steer lifestyles and behavior is taking shape .
internationally , liberal politics is on the retreat as shown by protectionist tendencies in the eu , the wrangling over the doha round of world trade -lsb- organization -rsb- talks and the ideological rollback in a few latin american countries .
in such a context , there 's no doubt that you need an overtly liberal party .
it 's no secret that there are political contacts between the christian conservatives , the green party and the fdp .
do you think germany could in the future get a governing coalition made up of the three ?
in the end it 's the voter who decides which constellation is feasible .
in theory , it should be possible to have coalitions between all democratic parties .
but there is a tendency that three-party coalitions can be plagued by infighting , more than two-party ones .
in light of the current reform chaos in germany , what 's needed is political action .
besides , being part of the government is not an end in itself .
you should only take part in a coalition if you can really achieve more freedom for all citizens .

in 1979 , the vatican withdrew his license to teach after the swiss native questioned the infallibility of the pope .
in the fall of 2005 , pope benedict xvi invited küng to a private meeting .
dw-world.de : professor küng , people - and not only in germany - are again enormously interested in religious issues .
can we speak of a return of religions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran in 1979 : ayatollah chomeini is back from exile hans küng : " return of religions " - that is an ambivalent term .
religion never disappeared .
just like music , religion is something that stays , even if it is suppressed for some time .
it is true , that since the new awakening of islam , since the creation of the islamic republic of iran in 1979 , europeans have realized that they do n't rule the world by themselves .
for a long time , secular europe had not realized that it was an exception , and that elsewhere , religions is a power .
" no peace among the nations , without peace between the religions !
no peace between the religions without dialog between the religions ! "
those are two central sentences of your world ethic principle .
in a time of globalization , there are many undreamed-of possibilities for communication on the internet .
the access to knowledge is easier than ever before .
can this development improve the dialog of religions ?
in principle , i would say yes , even though this brings many problems .
it 's a positive thing that today we can know a lot about other religions .
a different question , of course , is whether we do want to be in the know .
there are people who do n't - they already know everything , without studying the islam .
who does n't want to know ?
for one , the fundamental christians who take everything the bible says literally and say they do n't need any other religions .
then there are the very secular people , dogmatists of laicism .
they get worked up simply when the word religion is mentioned , and they think that we should not talk about it in schools .
they have issues with the fact that religion , again , is a powerful factor in world history .
according to a survey , not christianity but buddhism is the most likeable religion for germans .
how do you explain that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .
it is a religion that 's turned to the inside and that emphasizes meditation .
it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .
of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .
even though islam is seen skeptically throughout europe , it attracts many , especially young people , around the globe .
there are 1.3 billion muslims , with an upward trend .
from rabat to damascus there are islamic groups that are becoming increasingly important politically .
why is that so ?
are there religious or social reasons for this ?
both .
those are religious groups that help people .
many muslims in those countries feel that the ruling elites have a life of their own and do n't take care of the population at large .
the fundamental islamist groups - or whatever you want to call them - try very hard to do something for people .
they take care of schools and education , and they give people clothes and food .
why did hamas win the elections -lsb- in the palestinian territories -rsb- ?
because they worked for the people .
one of the biggest mistakes of western politics - germany included , by the way - was to not accept those elections .
instead , fingers were pointed , saying : " you have to accept israel ! "
tell that to people that have been terrorized by an occupying power for decades .
that is not the right way to solve those problems .
you have to realize that there are parties that do have islam as a basis , yet they campaign for the people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate young muslims make themselves available for terrorist attacks a better example is the party of prime minister erdogan in turkey .
why did they win ?
because they helped people .
they showed - with all weaknesses that they have - that they will bring their country forward and in no way did they develop an islamic theocracy , such as the one in iran .
they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .
how far would the willingness to negotiate with the radical powers have to go ?
would one have to negotiate with the taliban and al qaeda as well ?
you can not negotiate with al qaeda .
it is a secret terrorist group .
you can only dry them up .
but the west has watered them so much that they could sprout .
the american secret service recently admitted in secret documents that the iraq war only helped al qaeda .
before , there was no al qaeda in iraq .
you could certainly negotiate with the taliban .
they are n't just crazy people .
there are some extremists , and there are , on the other hand , those that warned the bush administration about sept .
11 .
but it was n't taken seriously .
there were chieftains in afghanistan that warned against marching in with an army .
a personal question : on sept .
12 you will introduce your autobiography " controversial truth . "
if you look back , are you still as optimistic as you were in 1990 when you wrote " global responsibility : in search of a new world ethic " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen after bush ?
when i wrote the book in 1990 , of course , one hoped that in the future , problems would not be solved with military means , with aggression and animosity and war , but instead - just like it worked in western and eastern europe - through mutual understanding , cooperation and integration .
unfortunately , this was disrupted by the mad policies that the second bush administration initiated with a clique of archconservative jewish intellectuals , so-called neocons and protestant fundamentalists .
i am not an enemy , but a friend of the americans .
i hope that , despite the backlash that the policies of bush jr. brought on , americans can remember their great democratic tradition and lead in terms of international understanding , moderation and world peace .
were you hurt that pope benedict xvi never accepted your idea of the world ethic ?
he accepted the idea as such .
he realizes that there have to be common ethical standards .
during our conversation he conceded that those standards need to be valid for believers and non-believers .
one could only have expected that he would personally advocate this .
but that might still happen . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .
it is a religion that 's turned to the inside and that emphasizes meditation .
it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .
of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .
even though islam is seen skeptically throughout europe , it attracts many , especially young people , around the globe .
there are 1.3 billion muslims , with an upward trend .
from rabat to damascus there are islamic groups that are becoming increasingly important politically .
why is that so ?
are there religious or social reasons for this ?
both .
those are religious groups that help people .
many muslims in those countries feel that the ruling elites have a life of their own and do n't take care of the population at large .
the fundamental islamist groups - or whatever you want to call them - try very hard to do something for people .
they take care of schools and education , and they give people clothes and food .
why did hamas win the elections -lsb- in the palestinian territories -rsb- ?
because they worked for the people .
one of the biggest mistakes of western politics - germany included , by the way - was to not accept those elections .
instead , fingers were pointed , saying : " you have to accept israel ! "
tell that to people that have been terrorized by an occupying power for decades .
that is not the right way to solve those problems .
you have to realize that there are parties that do have islam as a basis , yet they campaign for the people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate young muslims make themselves available for terrorist attacks a better example is the party of prime minister erdogan in turkey .
why did they win ?
because they helped people .
they showed - with all weaknesses that they have - that they will bring their country forward and in no way did they develop an islamic theocracy , such as the one in iran .
they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .
how far would the willingness to negotiate with the radical powers have to go ?
would one have to negotiate with the taliban and al qaeda as well ?
you can not negotiate with al qaeda .
it is a secret terrorist group .
you can only dry them up .
but the west has watered them so much that they could sprout .
the american secret service recently admitted in secret documents that the iraq war only helped al qaeda .
before , there was no al qaeda in iraq .
you could certainly negotiate with the taliban .
they are n't just crazy people .
there are some extremists , and there are , on the other hand , those that warned the bush administration about sept .
11 .
but it was n't taken seriously .
there were chieftains in afghanistan that warned against marching in with an army .
a personal question : on sept .
12 you will introduce your autobiography " controversial truth . "
if you look back , are you still as optimistic as you were in 1990 when you wrote " global responsibility : in search of a new world ethic " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen after bush ?
when i wrote the book in 1990 , of course , one hoped that in the future , problems would not be solved with military means , with aggression and animosity and war , but instead - just like it worked in western and eastern europe - through mutual understanding , cooperation and integration .
unfortunately , this was disrupted by the mad policies that the second bush administration initiated with a clique of archconservative jewish intellectuals , so-called neocons and protestant fundamentalists .
i am not an enemy , but a friend of the americans .
i hope that , despite the backlash that the policies of bush jr. brought on , americans can remember their great democratic tradition and lead in terms of international understanding , moderation and world peace .
were you hurt that pope benedict xvi never accepted your idea of the world ethic ?
he accepted the idea as such .
he realizes that there have to be common ethical standards .
during our conversation he conceded that those standards need to be valid for believers and non-believers .
one could only have expected that he would personally advocate this .
but that might still happen . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gabriel said the united nations climate conference being held in bali in december should provide the " starting signal " for comprehensive talks on a new climate agreement for the period after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol runs out .
this had to contain a long-term goal , ambitious and obligatory commitments from the industrialized world , and fair contributions from the larger developing countries , he said .
" under the gleneagles dialogue we are working at making investment in climate protection technologies more attractive , " gabriel said .
the gleneagles dialogue was set up at the g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland in 2005 .
apart from the g8 - the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , canada , italy and russia - large developing economies like china , brazil and australia are also participating .
the first day of the conference ended with many delegates making positive noises about the possible outcome of the two-day meeting .
polluters reaping what they sow , say poorer nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries blame the industrialized nations however , behind-the-scenes , the finger-pointing was still far from over with developing countries saying that climate protection should be an issue for the industrialized nations which caused all the large-scale pollution in the first place and which are leaving the poorer countries to deal with the consequences .
on the other side of the argument , the industrialized nations point to new powerhouses like china and india , saying that pollution problems there are home-made .
attending the conference in berlin , gro harlem brundtland , the un special envoy on climate change , spoke of this " deep-rooted lack of trust between the industrialized and developing countries . "
" many industrialized countries believe that the developing countries are unwilling and that they are doing too little , " the former norwegian prime minister and world health organization head said .
" many developing countries believe that the industrialized world has defaulted on the promise of financial and technology assistance , " she added .
industrialized nations urged to cut emissions the global leadership for climate action , comprising former prominent leaders , called for industrialized countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent over the period 1990 to 2050 .
the united states should commit itself to this goal , said the organization 's presidents , former chilean president ricardo lagos and the president of the un foundation , former us senator timothy e wirth .
the organization also stated that major developing countries like china and india should cut their energy use by 30 per cent by 2020 as a first step .
from 2021 these countries should commit themselves to binding emission targets .
post-kyoto negotiations complex and problematic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiating a new protocol to replace kyoto will be difficult in december this year , signatories to the kyoto protocol will meet in bali to debate possible negotiations on climate protection after 2012 when the kyoto agreement expires .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel admitted that the negotiations will be far from easy .
" here in germany , you know how difficult it is to reach a consensus on sensitive issues among our 16 states , " he said .
" you can imagine what a hard task it is to find common ground among the over 200 nations involved in the climate protection process .
there ’ s not even agreement yet among the signatories to the kyoto protocol on reductions in co2 emissions that negotiations on a follow-up treaty are needed .
" we 're talking about a climate protection deal that not only entails responsibilities and targets for industrialized nations to meet , " gabriel added , " but we also expect developing countries to set their own binding agenda . "
per-capita quota a potential silver lining but a silver lining has appeared in recent talks on climate protection with german chancellor angela merkel and others suggesting that a per-capita emissions quota be considered when it comes to fair burden sharing in the future .
on tuesday , the participants in the gleneagles dialogue in berlin are expected to tell the media how far they 've come in bringing the industrialized and developing worlds closer together .
so far , they 've only agreed on a number of recommendations for climate protection , not saying how much anyone is supposed to contribute to the common goal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for miners , it means a beloved tradition and a way of life is coming to an end . on a recent wednesday morning , benno henschen 's alarm clock went off at 3:10 a.m.
he drove 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- to a non-descript complex of buildings near the leafy small town of voerde , changed into his work clothes , and promptly descended 820 meters -lrb- 2,690 feet -rrb- under the earth . it is the start of the early shift for henschen , 49 , who will spend the next seven hours overseeing the machines that extract the hard coal that turned this region in western germany , near the ruhr and rhine rivers , into germany 's industrial heartland and powered its comeback from the ashes of world war ii . " i have always loved being a miner , and i still do , " said henschen , who was just 14 when he went down into his first mining pit .
" but i 'm worried about the future . " henschen is a member of a profession whose days appear limited in germany .
while there were once over 100 pits at the hard-coal mining industry 's peak in the 1950s , today there are only eight such mines left in germany .
the ruhr region 's centuries-old mining history means it is necessary to go further and further underground to reach unexhausted coal seams .
stringent safety measures and high-labor costs have also added to the cost of german hard coal .
at around 180 euros -lrb- $ 248 -rrb- per ton , it costs more than three times the global market price . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun is setting on the german hard-coal mining industry but for decades , german lawmakers have propped up the industry with large-scale subsidies .
right now , federal and regional governments pump 2.5 billion euros a year into hard-coal mining . " the markets are international , our energy supplies are secure , and so there 's no reason to use public money to subsidize hard-coal mining , " said oliver wittke , minister for building and transport for the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the ruhr region , and henschen 's mine , are located .
" it is far too expensive . " but to henschen , the bottom line should not be the only consideration . " expensive is not always the most costly , " he said .
to him , what germany will be giving up when the mines close has a value that you ca n't put a euro-sign on . family tradition henschen is the third generation in his family to go into mining .
his grandfather , who he never knew , was a pitman .
his father was too , working in the late ' 50s during the industry 's heyday , when the ruhr area was a cauldron of smokestacks , steel factories and rumbling hard-coal conveyor belts which fed them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mine workers leave the elevator at the mine in voerde mining was in his blood , and really was all he ever knew , or saw .
miners lived mostly together in settlements often not far from the pits .
after the gritty shifts spent together far underground , miners would often spend their free time together and raise their families next door to one another . " the hard work underground welded us together , you could say , " said henschen .
" we respect one another , have to depend on one another .
it 's not like in other jobs . " miners , he said , are part of a tightly knit social fabric that is unraveling because of government decisions he thinks are wrong .
but that fabric has already been badly frayed by layoffs .
today there are 34,000 miners , down from 607,000 in 1970 . engine of integration ali sen , 39 , is in his 24th year as a miner , but is now spending time above ground in the public relations office of dsk , the company which manages germany 's remaining hard-coal mines , learning another side of the business , one that might have more of a future . his father was a miner in turkey before coming to germany as a so-called " guest worker , " bringing his family over when sen was two .
the strong sense of social cohesion among miners extended to relations between turks and germans , according to sen. while the integration of germany 's large turkish community into the large society is still seen as problematic , sen said with miners , ethnicity was never an issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long history : miners in 1880 " i do n't think these groups get along anywhere in german better than in the ruhr region , " he said .
" we live side by side , play together in soccer clubs , it 's exemplary . " both he and henschen said closing mines could further weaken the ruhr area 's economy - the mine in voerde , where they both work , is scheduled to close next year .
other businesses in the area , some of which depend on miners ' patronage , will suffer . " where mines have been closed , you notice the neighborhoods that bore the brunt of it have n't bounced back even after 20 or 30 years , " sen said .
" they might not quite be ghettos , but stores are closed and people do n't have money to buy . " structural change the ruhr region 's economy has been hard hit by the progressive shuttering of its heavy industry since the 1960s and successive waves of large-scale layoffs .
by the end of the 1990s , the once prosperous region had turned into a landscape of rusting industrial ruins , environmental degradation and dwindling hopes .
unemployment once reached 19 percent , although that number now stands at 14.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a light show at the repurposed mining tower , zollverein the region is now embarking on an economic redevelopment program that sees it moving away from heavy industry like steel and coal and toward the logistics , chemicals and service sectors .
the region will be one of europe 's cultural capitals for 2010 , and some of its industrial skeletons , like unused mining shaft towers , deserted factories , and silo-like gasometers , have already been turned into cultural spaces for exhibitions or performances . much ado about little ? some argue that miners ' complaints are exaggerated .
the agreement on ending the subsidies provides a " soft landing " for the workers and the federal and state governments will spend an estimated 21.6 billion euros over the next 11 years .
options for miners include retraining programs , job-search help , and start-up money for those wishing to become self-employed .
those who have 25 years underground can retire at 49 . " we are doing a lot for our miners , " said christof beike , a spokesman for dsk . but for those like henschen , used to the security mining once brought , that is cold comfort .
and even more then the end of an industry , it 's the end of a tradition and a life that might have been hard on the body , but was good for the soul . " now families are losing their bearings and the solidarity of our communities is being pulled apart , " he said .

" the markets are international , our energy supplies are secure , and so there 's no reason to use public money to subsidize hard-coal mining , " said oliver wittke , minister for building and transport for the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the ruhr region , and henschen 's mine , are located .
" it is far too expensive . " but to henschen , the bottom line should not be the only consideration . " expensive is not always the most costly , " he said .
to him , what germany will be giving up when the mines close has a value that you ca n't put a euro-sign on . family tradition henschen is the third generation in his family to go into mining .
his grandfather , who he never knew , was a pitman .
his father was too , working in the late ' 50s during the industry 's heyday , when the ruhr area was a cauldron of smokestacks , steel factories and rumbling hard-coal conveyor belts which fed them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mine workers leave the elevator at the mine in voerde mining was in his blood , and really was all he ever knew , or saw .
miners lived mostly together in settlements often not far from the pits .
after the gritty shifts spent together far underground , miners would often spend their free time together and raise their families next door to one another . " the hard work underground welded us together , you could say , " said henschen .
" we respect one another , have to depend on one another .
it 's not like in other jobs . " miners , he said , are part of a tightly knit social fabric that is unraveling because of government decisions he thinks are wrong .
but that fabric has already been badly frayed by layoffs .
today there are 34,000 miners , down from 607,000 in 1970 . engine of integration ali sen , 39 , is in his 24th year as a miner , but is now spending time above ground in the public relations office of dsk , the company which manages germany 's remaining hard-coal mines , learning another side of the business , one that might have more of a future . his father was a miner in turkey before coming to germany as a so-called " guest worker , " bringing his family over when sen was two .
the strong sense of social cohesion among miners extended to relations between turks and germans , according to sen. while the integration of germany 's large turkish community into the large society is still seen as problematic , sen said with miners , ethnicity was never an issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long history : miners in 1880 " i do n't think these groups get along anywhere in german better than in the ruhr region , " he said .
" we live side by side , play together in soccer clubs , it 's exemplary . " both he and henschen said closing mines could further weaken the ruhr area 's economy - the mine in voerde , where they both work , is scheduled to close next year .
other businesses in the area , some of which depend on miners ' patronage , will suffer . " where mines have been closed , you notice the neighborhoods that bore the brunt of it have n't bounced back even after 20 or 30 years , " sen said .
" they might not quite be ghettos , but stores are closed and people do n't have money to buy . " structural change the ruhr region 's economy has been hard hit by the progressive shuttering of its heavy industry since the 1960s and successive waves of large-scale layoffs .
by the end of the 1990s , the once prosperous region had turned into a landscape of rusting industrial ruins , environmental degradation and dwindling hopes .

the agreement on ending the subsidies provides a " soft landing " for the workers and the federal and state governments will spend an estimated 21.6 billion euros over the next 11 years .
options for miners include retraining programs , job-search help , and start-up money for those wishing to become self-employed .
those who have 25 years underground can retire at 49 . " we are doing a lot for our miners , " said christof beike , a spokesman for dsk . but for those like henschen , used to the security mining once brought , that is cold comfort .
and even more then the end of an industry , it 's the end of a tradition and a life that might have been hard on the body , but was good for the soul . " now families are losing their bearings and the solidarity of our communities is being pulled apart , " he said .

for miners , it means a beloved tradition and a way of life is coming to an end . on a recent wednesday morning , benno henschen 's alarm clock went off at 3:10 a.m.
he drove 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- to a non-descript complex of buildings near the leafy small town of voerde , changed into his work clothes , and promptly descended 820 meters -lrb- 2,690 feet -rrb- under the earth . it is the start of the early shift for henschen , 49 , who will spend the next seven hours overseeing the machines that extract the hard coal that turned this region in western germany , near the ruhr and rhine rivers , into germany 's industrial heartland and powered its comeback from the ashes of world war ii . " i have always loved being a miner , and i still do , " said henschen , who was just 14 when he went down into his first mining pit .
" but i 'm worried about the future . " henschen is a member of a profession whose days appear limited in germany .
while there were once over 100 pits at the hard-coal mining industry 's peak in the 1950s , today there are only eight such mines left in germany .
the ruhr region 's centuries-old mining history means it is necessary to go further and further underground to reach unexhausted coal seams .
stringent safety measures and high-labor costs have also added to the cost of german hard coal .
at around 180 euros -lrb- $ 248 -rrb- per ton , it costs more than three times the global market price . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun is setting on the german hard-coal mining industry but for decades , german lawmakers have propped up the industry with large-scale subsidies .

gabriel said the united nations climate conference being held in bali in december should provide the " starting signal " for comprehensive talks on a new climate agreement for the period after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol runs out .
this had to contain a long-term goal , ambitious and obligatory commitments from the industrialized world , and fair contributions from the larger developing countries , he said .
" under the gleneagles dialogue we are working at making investment in climate protection technologies more attractive , " gabriel said .
the gleneagles dialogue was set up at the g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland in 2005 .
apart from the g8 - the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , canada , italy and russia - large developing economies like china , brazil and australia are also participating .

on the other side of the argument , the industrialized nations point to new powerhouses like china and india , saying that pollution problems there are home-made .
attending the conference in berlin , gro harlem brundtland , the un special envoy on climate change , spoke of this " deep-rooted lack of trust between the industrialized and developing countries . "
" many industrialized countries believe that the developing countries are unwilling and that they are doing too little , " the former norwegian prime minister and world health organization head said .
" many developing countries believe that the industrialized world has defaulted on the promise of financial and technology assistance , " she added .
industrialized nations urged to cut emissions the global leadership for climate action , comprising former prominent leaders , called for industrialized countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent over the period 1990 to 2050 .
the united states should commit itself to this goal , said the organization 's presidents , former chilean president ricardo lagos and the president of the un foundation , former us senator timothy e wirth .
the organization also stated that major developing countries like china and india should cut their energy use by 30 per cent by 2020 as a first step .

" here in germany , you know how difficult it is to reach a consensus on sensitive issues among our 16 states , " he said .

" it is our common wish ... that we get more transparency in financial markets , " chancellor angela merkel said after a regular informal meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy at a government guest house north of berlin .
she said that , along with fair trade and fair competition , that " must be a common european concern . "
the two leaders issued a joint statement in which they stressed that " open markets are the guarantor of europe 's prosperity and development . "
merkel noted that germany had made market transparency a key theme both during its european union presidency in the first six months of the year and during its year-long presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
" we have always had backing from the french side on this , " she added .
the chancellor called for a coordinated european approach .
" we must have as coherent an approach as possible , " she said , and added that the issue was not " arbitrary regulation but how europe can create conditions that others have . "
leaders target transparency and speculators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel kiss as they meet at schloss meseberg taking the fight to the speculators , sarkozy stated that he was " not against competition , but against speculation . " the french president added , " i am for the market economy , i am for globalization , but i am not for speculation . "
europe could not allow itself to be the venue " where the rest of the world comes to help itself , " sarkozy continued , stressing that his aim was " not protectionism , but reciprocity " with countries like the united states and china .
referring to the failure of international rating agencies to spot the looming us sub-prime mortgage crisis , merkel said the german government had been unable to explain to the population how nobody knew beforehand and why ordinary people were now facing the consequences .
other issues discussed by the two leaders included the energy sector in europe and a proposed " council of wise men " which would debate the future of the eu in the medium term .
merkel said it had not yet been decided who would sit on the council , and sarkozy said its aims were to sketch out how europe should evolve over the next 30 years .
nuclear power partnership apparently on course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france wants germany to follow its nuclear example on energy , sarkozy urged germany to follow france 's example of relying strongly on nuclear power for its energy needs .
" i would like france and germany to have similar ambitions , " sarkozy said atomic power meets about 40 percent of france 's energy needs , whereas germany plans to phase out nuclear energy gradually and mothball the last of its 17 reactors by about 2020 .
merkel responded by saying that she supported the continuation of the nuclear power joint venture between german industrial group siemens and french nuclear group areva np .
" i am of course interested in a deeper german-french cooperation , " she said .
sarkozy said , " we will strengthen our cooperation further , " adding that " nuclear energy is the power of the future ...
france is willing to work in concert with companies and siemens is already present . "
no mention of french plans for siemens it was reported in july that sarkozy planned to use an option to buy out siemens 's 34 percent stake in the nuclear power joint venture with state-controlled areva and forge a major national energy company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.09.2007 german tv sacks talk show host for praising nazi family politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman , herself a professional , thinks women are better suited for staying at home germany 's public broadcaster ard fired its well-known talk show host and controversial book author eva herman after she praised nazi family politics .
herman said on monday her statements were taken out of context . " mrs. herman 's authorial activities are in our view no longer compatible with her role as a television news reader and talk show host , " said volker herres , program director for german public network ard 's northern division norddeutscher rundfunk -lrb- ndr -rrb- , in a statement on the network 's web site . he also said that some guests had canceled their appearances on herman 's talk show in response to her public statements on motherhood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in nazi germany received monetary incentives and medals for child-bearing herman , 48 , who already ruffled feathers last year by arguing that women should raise children rather than pursue careers of their own , was quoted by the media as speaking in glowing terms about the family values that were nurtured in the nazi era . " it was a gruesome time with a totally crazy and highly dangerous leader who led the germans into ruin as we all know , " herman said . " but there was at the time also something good , and that is the values , that is the children , that is the families , that is a togetherness - it was all abolished , there was nothing left . " herman 's new book " the noah 's ark principle : why we must save the family " -lrb- available in german -rrb- is a follow-up to her 2006 bestseller " the eva principle : for a new femininity . " in both books , herman openly discredits the merits of emancipation and mourns the loss of traditional gender roles that assigned women to the safe and comforting spot by the kitchen stove . motherhood crusade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women juggle their careers with obligations at home herman told bild newspaper on monday that she did n't understand why there was so much commotion about her views . " i expressly distanced myself from the ' third reich ' at several points , " herman said .
" one has to put my statement into its overall context .
this is n't about hitler 's values , but about basic human values , which were abused in the ' third reich ' and later abolished . " by praising the third reich family values , however , herman managed to raise the scandal bar to unprecedented heights . while it is true that the nazis offered incentives to child-bearing women , their family policies were an integral part of their racist ideology whose goal was the creation of a master race . " frau herman should know that what characterized the third reich was n't how mothers were treated , because they were just meant to produce cannon fodder , " author and holocaust survivor ralph giordano told bild . " what characterized it was the gas chambers . " preaching , not practicing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for almost two decades , herman was one of germany 's most popular news presenters married for the fourth time , having one child and - until now - a stellar television career that included 18 years of hosting germany 's premiere tv news show tageschau - eva herman was an unlikely candidate for a champion of antiquated gender roles . she proved , however , that one does n't have to practice what one preaches and that a successful career woman can tell other women that what they really want is to keep quiet and cook . " in eva herman 's case , even those of us who are women 's rights activists want her to return home to her kitchen stove , " said renate künast , a prominent member of the opposition green party . it is unlikely , however , that herman , who was often voted in the past as germany 's favorite news presenter , will get a chance to become a stay-at-home mom that she never was .
as a proponent of an ultra-conservative , pre-feminist fantasy world in which marriage , obedience and motherhood are considered the ultimate forms of self-fulfillment , she seems busier than ever . " frau herman is free to carry on her ' motherhood crusade , ' but this is no longer compatible with her role as an ndr tv presenter , " herres said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is our common wish ... that we get more transparency in financial markets , " chancellor angela merkel said after a regular informal meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy at a government guest house north of berlin .
she said that , along with fair trade and fair competition , that " must be a common european concern . "
the two leaders issued a joint statement in which they stressed that " open markets are the guarantor of europe 's prosperity and development . "
merkel noted that germany had made market transparency a key theme both during its european union presidency in the first six months of the year and during its year-long presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
" we have always had backing from the french side on this , " she added .
the chancellor called for a coordinated european approach .
" we must have as coherent an approach as possible , " she said , and added that the issue was not " arbitrary regulation but how europe can create conditions that others have . "
leaders target transparency and speculators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel kiss as they meet at schloss meseberg taking the fight to the speculators , sarkozy stated that he was " not against competition , but against speculation . " the french president added , " i am for the market economy , i am for globalization , but i am not for speculation . "
europe could not allow itself to be the venue " where the rest of the world comes to help itself , " sarkozy continued , stressing that his aim was " not protectionism , but reciprocity " with countries like the united states and china .
referring to the failure of international rating agencies to spot the looming us sub-prime mortgage crisis , merkel said the german government had been unable to explain to the population how nobody knew beforehand and why ordinary people were now facing the consequences .
other issues discussed by the two leaders included the energy sector in europe and a proposed " council of wise men " which would debate the future of the eu in the medium term .
merkel said it had not yet been decided who would sit on the council , and sarkozy said its aims were to sketch out how europe should evolve over the next 30 years .
nuclear power partnership apparently on course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france wants germany to follow its nuclear example on energy , sarkozy urged germany to follow france 's example of relying strongly on nuclear power for its energy needs .
" i would like france and germany to have similar ambitions , " sarkozy said atomic power meets about 40 percent of france 's energy needs , whereas germany plans to phase out nuclear energy gradually and mothball the last of its 17 reactors by about 2020 .
merkel responded by saying that she supported the continuation of the nuclear power joint venture between german industrial group siemens and french nuclear group areva np .
" i am of course interested in a deeper german-french cooperation , " she said .
sarkozy said , " we will strengthen our cooperation further , " adding that " nuclear energy is the power of the future ...
france is willing to work in concert with companies and siemens is already present . "
no mention of french plans for siemens it was reported in july that sarkozy planned to use an option to buy out siemens 's 34 percent stake in the nuclear power joint venture with state-controlled areva and forge a major national energy company .

" it is our common wish ... that we get more transparency in financial markets , " chancellor angela merkel said after a regular informal meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy at a government guest house north of berlin .
she said that , along with fair trade and fair competition , that " must be a common european concern . "
the two leaders issued a joint statement in which they stressed that " open markets are the guarantor of europe 's prosperity and development . "
merkel noted that germany had made market transparency a key theme both during its european union presidency in the first six months of the year and during its year-long presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
" we have always had backing from the french side on this , " she added .

" the french president added , " i am for the market economy , i am for globalization , but i am not for speculation . "
europe could not allow itself to be the venue " where the rest of the world comes to help itself , " sarkozy continued , stressing that his aim was " not protectionism , but reciprocity " with countries like the united states and china .
referring to the failure of international rating agencies to spot the looming us sub-prime mortgage crisis , merkel said the german government had been unable to explain to the population how nobody knew beforehand and why ordinary people were now facing the consequences .
other issues discussed by the two leaders included the energy sector in europe and a proposed " council of wise men " which would debate the future of the eu in the medium term .
merkel said it had not yet been decided who would sit on the council , and sarkozy said its aims were to sketch out how europe should evolve over the next 30 years .
nuclear power partnership apparently on course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france wants germany to follow its nuclear example on energy , sarkozy urged germany to follow france 's example of relying strongly on nuclear power for its energy needs .
" i would like france and germany to have similar ambitions , " sarkozy said atomic power meets about 40 percent of france 's energy needs , whereas germany plans to phase out nuclear energy gradually and mothball the last of its 17 reactors by about 2020 .
merkel responded by saying that she supported the continuation of the nuclear power joint venture between german industrial group siemens and french nuclear group areva np .
" i am of course interested in a deeper german-french cooperation , " she said .
sarkozy said , " we will strengthen our cooperation further , " adding that " nuclear energy is the power of the future ...
france is willing to work in concert with companies and siemens is already present . "
no mention of french plans for siemens it was reported in july that sarkozy planned to use an option to buy out siemens 's 34 percent stake in the nuclear power joint venture with state-controlled areva and forge a major national energy company .

europe could not allow itself to be the venue " where the rest of the world comes to help itself , " sarkozy continued , stressing that his aim was " not protectionism , but reciprocity " with countries like the united states and china .
referring to the failure of international rating agencies to spot the looming us sub-prime mortgage crisis , merkel said the german government had been unable to explain to the population how nobody knew beforehand and why ordinary people were now facing the consequences .
other issues discussed by the two leaders included the energy sector in europe and a proposed " council of wise men " which would debate the future of the eu in the medium term .
merkel said it had not yet been decided who would sit on the council , and sarkozy said its aims were to sketch out how europe should evolve over the next 30 years .
nuclear power partnership apparently on course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france wants germany to follow its nuclear example on energy , sarkozy urged germany to follow france 's example of relying strongly on nuclear power for its energy needs .
" i would like france and germany to have similar ambitions , " sarkozy said atomic power meets about 40 percent of france 's energy needs , whereas germany plans to phase out nuclear energy gradually and mothball the last of its 17 reactors by about 2020 .
merkel responded by saying that she supported the continuation of the nuclear power joint venture between german industrial group siemens and french nuclear group areva np .
" i am of course interested in a deeper german-french cooperation , " she said .
sarkozy said , " we will strengthen our cooperation further , " adding that " nuclear energy is the power of the future ...
france is willing to work in concert with companies and siemens is already present . "
no mention of french plans for siemens it was reported in july that sarkozy planned to use an option to buy out siemens 's 34 percent stake in the nuclear power joint venture with state-controlled areva and forge a major national energy company .
the french government declined to comment at the time . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 10.09.2007 global blame game continues at berlin climate conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized and developing nations blamed each other for global warming during the opening of a two-day international environment conference in berlin , developing and industrialized nations remained far apart on who should shoulder responsibility for cutting greenhouse gas emissions . hosting the conference , being held under the auspices of the gleneagles dialogue - a post-kyoto round of debate on climate protection , german environment minister sigmar gabriel emphasized the need to accelerate the marketing and spread of climate-friendly technologies .
gabriel said the united nations climate conference being held in bali in december should provide the " starting signal " for comprehensive talks on a new climate agreement for the period after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol runs out .
this had to contain a long-term goal , ambitious and obligatory commitments from the industrialized world , and fair contributions from the larger developing countries , he said .
" under the gleneagles dialogue we are working at making investment in climate protection technologies more attractive , " gabriel said .
the gleneagles dialogue was set up at the g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland in 2005 .
apart from the g8 - the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , canada , italy and russia - large developing economies like china , brazil and australia are also participating .
the first day of the conference ended with many delegates making positive noises about the possible outcome of the two-day meeting .
polluters reaping what they sow , say poorer nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries blame the industrialized nations however , behind-the-scenes , the finger-pointing was still far from over with developing countries saying that climate protection should be an issue for the industrialized nations which caused all the large-scale pollution in the first place and which are leaving the poorer countries to deal with the consequences .
on the other side of the argument , the industrialized nations point to new powerhouses like china and india , saying that pollution problems there are home-made .
attending the conference in berlin , gro harlem brundtland , the un special envoy on climate change , spoke of this " deep-rooted lack of trust between the industrialized and developing countries . "
" many industrialized countries believe that the developing countries are unwilling and that they are doing too little , " the former norwegian prime minister and world health organization head said .
" many developing countries believe that the industrialized world has defaulted on the promise of financial and technology assistance , " she added .
industrialized nations urged to cut emissions the global leadership for climate action , comprising former prominent leaders , called for industrialized countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent over the period 1990 to 2050 .
the united states should commit itself to this goal , said the organization 's presidents , former chilean president ricardo lagos and the president of the un foundation , former us senator timothy e wirth .
the organization also stated that major developing countries like china and india should cut their energy use by 30 per cent by 2020 as a first step .
from 2021 these countries should commit themselves to binding emission targets .
post-kyoto negotiations complex and problematic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiating a new protocol to replace kyoto will be difficult in december this year , signatories to the kyoto protocol will meet in bali to debate possible negotiations on climate protection after 2012 when the kyoto agreement expires .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel admitted that the negotiations will be far from easy .
" here in germany , you know how difficult it is to reach a consensus on sensitive issues among our 16 states , " he said .
" you can imagine what a hard task it is to find common ground among the over 200 nations involved in the climate protection process .
there ’ s not even agreement yet among the signatories to the kyoto protocol on reductions in co2 emissions that negotiations on a follow-up treaty are needed .
" we 're talking about a climate protection deal that not only entails responsibilities and targets for industrialized nations to meet , " gabriel added , " but we also expect developing countries to set their own binding agenda . "
per-capita quota a potential silver lining but a silver lining has appeared in recent talks on climate protection with german chancellor angela merkel and others suggesting that a per-capita emissions quota be considered when it comes to fair burden sharing in the future .
on tuesday , the participants in the gleneagles dialogue in berlin are expected to tell the media how far they 've come in bringing the industrialized and developing worlds closer together .
so far , they 've only agreed on a number of recommendations for climate protection , not saying how much anyone is supposed to contribute to the common goal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" just about every carmaker is now bringing out low-emission vehicles on the market - and that is true for every segment , " he said . merkel : do n't forget environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privately , merkel prefers small cars german chancellor angela merkel , who will open the iaa on thursday , meanwhile also called on german carmakers to live up to their responsibility to cut carbon emissions .

gabriel said the united nations climate conference being held in bali in december should provide the " starting signal " for comprehensive talks on a new climate agreement for the period after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol runs out .
this had to contain a long-term goal , ambitious and obligatory commitments from the industrialized world , and fair contributions from the larger developing countries , he said .
" under the gleneagles dialogue we are working at making investment in climate protection technologies more attractive , " gabriel said .
the gleneagles dialogue was set up at the g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland in 2005 .
apart from the g8 - the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , canada , italy and russia - large developing economies like china , brazil and australia are also participating .
the first day of the conference ended with many delegates making positive noises about the possible outcome of the two-day meeting .
polluters reaping what they sow , say poorer nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries blame the industrialized nations however , behind-the-scenes , the finger-pointing was still far from over with developing countries saying that climate protection should be an issue for the industrialized nations which caused all the large-scale pollution in the first place and which are leaving the poorer countries to deal with the consequences .
on the other side of the argument , the industrialized nations point to new powerhouses like china and india , saying that pollution problems there are home-made .
attending the conference in berlin , gro harlem brundtland , the un special envoy on climate change , spoke of this " deep-rooted lack of trust between the industrialized and developing countries . "
" many industrialized countries believe that the developing countries are unwilling and that they are doing too little , " the former norwegian prime minister and world health organization head said .
" many developing countries believe that the industrialized world has defaulted on the promise of financial and technology assistance , " she added .
industrialized nations urged to cut emissions the global leadership for climate action , comprising former prominent leaders , called for industrialized countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent over the period 1990 to 2050 .
the united states should commit itself to this goal , said the organization 's presidents , former chilean president ricardo lagos and the president of the un foundation , former us senator timothy e wirth .
the organization also stated that major developing countries like china and india should cut their energy use by 30 per cent by 2020 as a first step .
from 2021 these countries should commit themselves to binding emission targets .
post-kyoto negotiations complex and problematic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiating a new protocol to replace kyoto will be difficult in december this year , signatories to the kyoto protocol will meet in bali to debate possible negotiations on climate protection after 2012 when the kyoto agreement expires .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel admitted that the negotiations will be far from easy .
" here in germany , you know how difficult it is to reach a consensus on sensitive issues among our 16 states , " he said .
" you can imagine what a hard task it is to find common ground among the over 200 nations involved in the climate protection process .
there ’ s not even agreement yet among the signatories to the kyoto protocol on reductions in co2 emissions that negotiations on a follow-up treaty are needed .
" we 're talking about a climate protection deal that not only entails responsibilities and targets for industrialized nations to meet , " gabriel added , " but we also expect developing countries to set their own binding agenda . "

gabriel said the united nations climate conference being held in bali in december should provide the " starting signal " for comprehensive talks on a new climate agreement for the period after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol runs out .
this had to contain a long-term goal , ambitious and obligatory commitments from the industrialized world , and fair contributions from the larger developing countries , he said .
" under the gleneagles dialogue we are working at making investment in climate protection technologies more attractive , " gabriel said .
the gleneagles dialogue was set up at the g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland in 2005 .
apart from the g8 - the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , canada , italy and russia - large developing economies like china , brazil and australia are also participating .
the first day of the conference ended with many delegates making positive noises about the possible outcome of the two-day meeting .
polluters reaping what they sow , say poorer nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries blame the industrialized nations however , behind-the-scenes , the finger-pointing was still far from over with developing countries saying that climate protection should be an issue for the industrialized nations which caused all the large-scale pollution in the first place and which are leaving the poorer countries to deal with the consequences .
on the other side of the argument , the industrialized nations point to new powerhouses like china and india , saying that pollution problems there are home-made .
attending the conference in berlin , gro harlem brundtland , the un special envoy on climate change , spoke of this " deep-rooted lack of trust between the industrialized and developing countries . "
" many industrialized countries believe that the developing countries are unwilling and that they are doing too little , " the former norwegian prime minister and world health organization head said .
" many developing countries believe that the industrialized world has defaulted on the promise of financial and technology assistance , " she added .
industrialized nations urged to cut emissions the global leadership for climate action , comprising former prominent leaders , called for industrialized countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent over the period 1990 to 2050 .
the united states should commit itself to this goal , said the organization 's presidents , former chilean president ricardo lagos and the president of the un foundation , former us senator timothy e wirth .
the organization also stated that major developing countries like china and india should cut their energy use by 30 per cent by 2020 as a first step .
from 2021 these countries should commit themselves to binding emission targets .
post-kyoto negotiations complex and problematic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiating a new protocol to replace kyoto will be difficult in december this year , signatories to the kyoto protocol will meet in bali to debate possible negotiations on climate protection after 2012 when the kyoto agreement expires .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel admitted that the negotiations will be far from easy .
" here in germany , you know how difficult it is to reach a consensus on sensitive issues among our 16 states , " he said .
" you can imagine what a hard task it is to find common ground among the over 200 nations involved in the climate protection process .
there ’ s not even agreement yet among the signatories to the kyoto protocol on reductions in co2 emissions that negotiations on a follow-up treaty are needed .
" we 're talking about a climate protection deal that not only entails responsibilities and targets for industrialized nations to meet , " gabriel added , " but we also expect developing countries to set their own binding agenda . "
per-capita quota a potential silver lining but a silver lining has appeared in recent talks on climate protection with german chancellor angela merkel and others suggesting that a per-capita emissions quota be considered when it comes to fair burden sharing in the future .
on tuesday , the participants in the gleneagles dialogue in berlin are expected to tell the media how far they 've come in bringing the industrialized and developing worlds closer together .

" it is our common wish ... that we get more transparency in financial markets , " chancellor angela merkel said after a regular informal meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy at a government guest house north of berlin .
she said that , along with fair trade and fair competition , that " must be a common european concern . "
the two leaders issued a joint statement in which they stressed that " open markets are the guarantor of europe 's prosperity and development . "
merkel noted that germany had made market transparency a key theme both during its european union presidency in the first six months of the year and during its year-long presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- .
" we have always had backing from the french side on this , " she added .
the chancellor called for a coordinated european approach .
" we must have as coherent an approach as possible , " she said , and added that the issue was not " arbitrary regulation but how europe can create conditions that others have . "
leaders target transparency and speculators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel kiss as they meet at schloss meseberg taking the fight to the speculators , sarkozy stated that he was " not against competition , but against speculation . " the french president added , " i am for the market economy , i am for globalization , but i am not for speculation . "
europe could not allow itself to be the venue " where the rest of the world comes to help itself , " sarkozy continued , stressing that his aim was " not protectionism , but reciprocity " with countries like the united states and china .
referring to the failure of international rating agencies to spot the looming us sub-prime mortgage crisis , merkel said the german government had been unable to explain to the population how nobody knew beforehand and why ordinary people were now facing the consequences .
other issues discussed by the two leaders included the energy sector in europe and a proposed " council of wise men " which would debate the future of the eu in the medium term .
merkel said it had not yet been decided who would sit on the council , and sarkozy said its aims were to sketch out how europe should evolve over the next 30 years .
nuclear power partnership apparently on course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france wants germany to follow its nuclear example on energy , sarkozy urged germany to follow france 's example of relying strongly on nuclear power for its energy needs .
" i would like france and germany to have similar ambitions , " sarkozy said atomic power meets about 40 percent of france 's energy needs , whereas germany plans to phase out nuclear energy gradually and mothball the last of its 17 reactors by about 2020 .
merkel responded by saying that she supported the continuation of the nuclear power joint venture between german industrial group siemens and french nuclear group areva np .
" i am of course interested in a deeper german-french cooperation , " she said .
sarkozy said , " we will strengthen our cooperation further , " adding that " nuclear energy is the power of the future ...
france is willing to work in concert with companies and siemens is already present . "
no mention of french plans for siemens it was reported in july that sarkozy planned to use an option to buy out siemens 's 34 percent stake in the nuclear power joint venture with state-controlled areva and forge a major national energy company .

for miners , it means a beloved tradition and a way of life is coming to an end . on a recent wednesday morning , benno henschen 's alarm clock went off at 3:10 a.m.
he drove 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- to a non-descript complex of buildings near the leafy small town of voerde , changed into his work clothes , and promptly descended 820 meters -lrb- 2,690 feet -rrb- under the earth . it is the start of the early shift for henschen , 49 , who will spend the next seven hours overseeing the machines that extract the hard coal that turned this region in western germany , near the ruhr and rhine rivers , into germany 's industrial heartland and powered its comeback from the ashes of world war ii . " i have always loved being a miner , and i still do , " said henschen , who was just 14 when he went down into his first mining pit .
" but i 'm worried about the future . " henschen is a member of a profession whose days appear limited in germany .
while there were once over 100 pits at the hard-coal mining industry 's peak in the 1950s , today there are only eight such mines left in germany .
the ruhr region 's centuries-old mining history means it is necessary to go further and further underground to reach unexhausted coal seams .
stringent safety measures and high-labor costs have also added to the cost of german hard coal .
at around 180 euros -lrb- $ 248 -rrb- per ton , it costs more than three times the global market price . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun is setting on the german hard-coal mining industry but for decades , german lawmakers have propped up the industry with large-scale subsidies .
right now , federal and regional governments pump 2.5 billion euros a year into hard-coal mining . " the markets are international , our energy supplies are secure , and so there 's no reason to use public money to subsidize hard-coal mining , " said oliver wittke , minister for building and transport for the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the ruhr region , and henschen 's mine , are located .
" it is far too expensive . " but to henschen , the bottom line should not be the only consideration . " expensive is not always the most costly , " he said .
to him , what germany will be giving up when the mines close has a value that you ca n't put a euro-sign on . family tradition henschen is the third generation in his family to go into mining .
his grandfather , who he never knew , was a pitman .
his father was too , working in the late ' 50s during the industry 's heyday , when the ruhr area was a cauldron of smokestacks , steel factories and rumbling hard-coal conveyor belts which fed them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mine workers leave the elevator at the mine in voerde mining was in his blood , and really was all he ever knew , or saw .
miners lived mostly together in settlements often not far from the pits .
after the gritty shifts spent together far underground , miners would often spend their free time together and raise their families next door to one another . " the hard work underground welded us together , you could say , " said henschen .
" we respect one another , have to depend on one another .
it 's not like in other jobs . " miners , he said , are part of a tightly knit social fabric that is unraveling because of government decisions he thinks are wrong .
but that fabric has already been badly frayed by layoffs .
today there are 34,000 miners , down from 607,000 in 1970 . engine of integration ali sen , 39 , is in his 24th year as a miner , but is now spending time above ground in the public relations office of dsk , the company which manages germany 's remaining hard-coal mines , learning another side of the business , one that might have more of a future . his father was a miner in turkey before coming to germany as a so-called " guest worker , " bringing his family over when sen was two .
the strong sense of social cohesion among miners extended to relations between turks and germans , according to sen. while the integration of germany 's large turkish community into the large society is still seen as problematic , sen said with miners , ethnicity was never an issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long history : miners in 1880 " i do n't think these groups get along anywhere in german better than in the ruhr region , " he said .
" we live side by side , play together in soccer clubs , it 's exemplary . " both he and henschen said closing mines could further weaken the ruhr area 's economy - the mine in voerde , where they both work , is scheduled to close next year .
other businesses in the area , some of which depend on miners ' patronage , will suffer . " where mines have been closed , you notice the neighborhoods that bore the brunt of it have n't bounced back even after 20 or 30 years , " sen said .
" they might not quite be ghettos , but stores are closed and people do n't have money to buy . " structural change the ruhr region 's economy has been hard hit by the progressive shuttering of its heavy industry since the 1960s and successive waves of large-scale layoffs .
by the end of the 1990s , the once prosperous region had turned into a landscape of rusting industrial ruins , environmental degradation and dwindling hopes .
unemployment once reached 19 percent , although that number now stands at 14.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a light show at the repurposed mining tower , zollverein the region is now embarking on an economic redevelopment program that sees it moving away from heavy industry like steel and coal and toward the logistics , chemicals and service sectors .
the region will be one of europe 's cultural capitals for 2010 , and some of its industrial skeletons , like unused mining shaft towers , deserted factories , and silo-like gasometers , have already been turned into cultural spaces for exhibitions or performances . much ado about little ? some argue that miners ' complaints are exaggerated .
the agreement on ending the subsidies provides a " soft landing " for the workers and the federal and state governments will spend an estimated 21.6 billion euros over the next 11 years .
options for miners include retraining programs , job-search help , and start-up money for those wishing to become self-employed .
those who have 25 years underground can retire at 49 . " we are doing a lot for our miners , " said christof beike , a spokesman for dsk . but for those like henschen , used to the security mining once brought , that is cold comfort .
and even more then the end of an industry , it 's the end of a tradition and a life that might have been hard on the body , but was good for the soul . " now families are losing their bearings and the solidarity of our communities is being pulled apart , " he said .

dw-world.de : civil society is taking on the traditional responsibilities of political parties , which seem powerless in the face of global trends .
what future do political parties have in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detmar doering detmar doering : i do n't think parties are really powerless in the face of global trends .
it 's true that non-governmental organizations do dominate the international political agenda today while political parties only influence international political institutions in an indirect manner .
but i do n't think you can underestimate that influence .
since parties are anchored institutions in germany , they will continue to exist and play an important role in our country .
but if they want to continue to play an important role in citizens ' perceptions and justify their legitimacy through it , they need to change their work and make it more open .
what form could the changes take ?
for instance , through project-related , temporary party membership that corresponds to the desire for getting involved without being forced to make a permanent commitment .
or by intensifying their internet presence , which offers a dialog form of communication .
it 's equally important to credibly build up a party base - for instance through support networks .
a fundamental factor includes " external conditions " or , in other words , the electoral rules .
the american experiment in " term limits " deserves our attention at the very least .
in that way you can get rid of the outdated personnel structures that damage the image of politics .
parties are constantly losing members .
young people are said to be uninterested in politics .
for years , there 's been talk of voter apathy .
there 's no doubt that the number of political party organizations is slipping .
the public image of political parties has sharply dropped in the past years .
that may have to do with other political alternatives in civil society that increasingly and credibly compete with parties for committed citizens .
but that 's a sign of maturity in a pluralist society rather than a blemish .
competition revives business .
the consequence must be that parties make an effort to be more attractive to voters .
liberal positions in business are now represented by the conservatives , and even the social democrats increasingly appeal to the responsibility of each individual in their political messages .
do you think there 's room for a liberal party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle heads germany 's fdp it 's definitely good if you can find a certain basic liberal consensus in all parties , because otherwise democracy would be seriously threatened .
but that 's not enough .
we are n't currently seeing an open rejection of liberal principles , but there 's certainly a creeping erosion of freedoms .
economic liberalization - though it 's more important than ever - no longer exists .
the big brother state has begun to take on grotesque proportions , a paternalistic idea of the state that wants to steer lifestyles and behavior is taking shape .
internationally , liberal politics is on the retreat as shown by protectionist tendencies in the eu , the wrangling over the doha round of world trade -lsb- organization -rsb- talks and the ideological rollback in a few latin american countries .
in such a context , there 's no doubt that you need an overtly liberal party .
it 's no secret that there are political contacts between the christian conservatives , the green party and the fdp .
do you think germany could in the future get a governing coalition made up of the three ?
in the end it 's the voter who decides which constellation is feasible .
in theory , it should be possible to have coalitions between all democratic parties .
but there is a tendency that three-party coalitions can be plagued by infighting , more than two-party ones .
in light of the current reform chaos in germany , what 's needed is political action .
besides , being part of the government is not an end in itself .
you should only take part in a coalition if you can really achieve more freedom for all citizens .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detmar doering detmar doering : i do n't think parties are really powerless in the face of global trends .
it 's true that non-governmental organizations do dominate the international political agenda today while political parties only influence international political institutions in an indirect manner .
but i do n't think you can underestimate that influence .
since parties are anchored institutions in germany , they will continue to exist and play an important role in our country .
but if they want to continue to play an important role in citizens ' perceptions and justify their legitimacy through it , they need to change their work and make it more open .
what form could the changes take ?
for instance , through project-related , temporary party membership that corresponds to the desire for getting involved without being forced to make a permanent commitment .
or by intensifying their internet presence , which offers a dialog form of communication .
it 's equally important to credibly build up a party base - for instance through support networks .
a fundamental factor includes " external conditions " or , in other words , the electoral rules .
the american experiment in " term limits " deserves our attention at the very least .
in that way you can get rid of the outdated personnel structures that damage the image of politics .
parties are constantly losing members .
young people are said to be uninterested in politics .
for years , there 's been talk of voter apathy .
there 's no doubt that the number of political party organizations is slipping .
the public image of political parties has sharply dropped in the past years .
that may have to do with other political alternatives in civil society that increasingly and credibly compete with parties for committed citizens .
but that 's a sign of maturity in a pluralist society rather than a blemish .
competition revives business .
the consequence must be that parties make an effort to be more attractive to voters .
liberal positions in business are now represented by the conservatives , and even the social democrats increasingly appeal to the responsibility of each individual in their political messages .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the return of religion in search of germany 's religious identity ex-muslims demand right to renounce islamic faith promises of miracles attract millions to nigeria 's churches most european nations keep god out of constitution religion -pipe- 10.09.2007 theologian küng : christianity gets on many people 's nerves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : küng : religion can co-exist with democracy for catholic theologian hans küng , religion has again become a power factor .
while islam and buddhism are getting more popular , christianity is n't .
the controversial theologian spoke to dw-world.de about the reasons . born in 1928 , catholic theologian and church critic hans küng made his mark as a promoter of dialogue between religions and as president of the global ethic foundation .
in 1979 , the vatican withdrew his license to teach after the swiss native questioned the infallibility of the pope .
in the fall of 2005 , pope benedict xvi invited küng to a private meeting .
dw-world.de : professor küng , people - and not only in germany - are again enormously interested in religious issues .
can we speak of a return of religions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran in 1979 : ayatollah chomeini is back from exile hans küng : " return of religions " - that is an ambivalent term .
religion never disappeared .
just like music , religion is something that stays , even if it is suppressed for some time .
it is true , that since the new awakening of islam , since the creation of the islamic republic of iran in 1979 , europeans have realized that they do n't rule the world by themselves .
for a long time , secular europe had not realized that it was an exception , and that elsewhere , religions is a power .
" no peace among the nations , without peace between the religions !
no peace between the religions without dialog between the religions ! "
those are two central sentences of your world ethic principle .
in a time of globalization , there are many undreamed-of possibilities for communication on the internet .
the access to knowledge is easier than ever before .
can this development improve the dialog of religions ?
in principle , i would say yes , even though this brings many problems .
it 's a positive thing that today we can know a lot about other religions .
a different question , of course , is whether we do want to be in the know .
there are people who do n't - they already know everything , without studying the islam .
who does n't want to know ?
for one , the fundamental christians who take everything the bible says literally and say they do n't need any other religions .
then there are the very secular people , dogmatists of laicism .
they get worked up simply when the word religion is mentioned , and they think that we should not talk about it in schools .
they have issues with the fact that religion , again , is a powerful factor in world history .
according to a survey , not christianity but buddhism is the most likeable religion for germans .
how do you explain that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .
it is a religion that 's turned to the inside and that emphasizes meditation .
it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .
of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .
even though islam is seen skeptically throughout europe , it attracts many , especially young people , around the globe .
there are 1.3 billion muslims , with an upward trend .
from rabat to damascus there are islamic groups that are becoming increasingly important politically .
why is that so ?
are there religious or social reasons for this ?
both .
those are religious groups that help people .
many muslims in those countries feel that the ruling elites have a life of their own and do n't take care of the population at large .
the fundamental islamist groups - or whatever you want to call them - try very hard to do something for people .
they take care of schools and education , and they give people clothes and food .
why did hamas win the elections -lsb- in the palestinian territories -rsb- ?
because they worked for the people .
one of the biggest mistakes of western politics - germany included , by the way - was to not accept those elections .
instead , fingers were pointed , saying : " you have to accept israel ! "
tell that to people that have been terrorized by an occupying power for decades .

because they helped people .

they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .

would one have to negotiate with the taliban and al qaeda as well ?
you can not negotiate with al qaeda .
it is a secret terrorist group .

when i wrote the book in 1990 , of course , one hoped that in the future , problems would not be solved with military means , with aggression and animosity and war , but instead - just like it worked in western and eastern europe - through mutual understanding , cooperation and integration .
unfortunately , this was disrupted by the mad policies that the second bush administration initiated with a clique of archconservative jewish intellectuals , so-called neocons and protestant fundamentalists .

while islam and buddhism are getting more popular , christianity is n't .
the controversial theologian spoke to dw-world.de about the reasons . born in 1928 , catholic theologian and church critic hans küng made his mark as a promoter of dialogue between religions and as president of the global ethic foundation .
in 1979 , the vatican withdrew his license to teach after the swiss native questioned the infallibility of the pope .
in the fall of 2005 , pope benedict xvi invited küng to a private meeting .
dw-world.de : professor küng , people - and not only in germany - are again enormously interested in religious issues .
can we speak of a return of religions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran in 1979 : ayatollah chomeini is back from exile hans küng : " return of religions " - that is an ambivalent term .
religion never disappeared .
just like music , religion is something that stays , even if it is suppressed for some time .
it is true , that since the new awakening of islam , since the creation of the islamic republic of iran in 1979 , europeans have realized that they do n't rule the world by themselves .
for a long time , secular europe had not realized that it was an exception , and that elsewhere , religions is a power .
" no peace among the nations , without peace between the religions !
no peace between the religions without dialog between the religions ! "
those are two central sentences of your world ethic principle .
in a time of globalization , there are many undreamed-of possibilities for communication on the internet .
the access to knowledge is easier than ever before .
can this development improve the dialog of religions ?
in principle , i would say yes , even though this brings many problems .
it 's a positive thing that today we can know a lot about other religions .
a different question , of course , is whether we do want to be in the know .
there are people who do n't - they already know everything , without studying the islam .
who does n't want to know ?
for one , the fundamental christians who take everything the bible says literally and say they do n't need any other religions .
then there are the very secular people , dogmatists of laicism .
they get worked up simply when the word religion is mentioned , and they think that we should not talk about it in schools .
they have issues with the fact that religion , again , is a powerful factor in world history .
according to a survey , not christianity but buddhism is the most likeable religion for germans .
how do you explain that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .
it is a religion that 's turned to the inside and that emphasizes meditation .
it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .
of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .

for miners , it means a beloved tradition and a way of life is coming to an end . on a recent wednesday morning , benno henschen 's alarm clock went off at 3:10 a.m.
he drove 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- to a non-descript complex of buildings near the leafy small town of voerde , changed into his work clothes , and promptly descended 820 meters -lrb- 2,690 feet -rrb- under the earth . it is the start of the early shift for henschen , 49 , who will spend the next seven hours overseeing the machines that extract the hard coal that turned this region in western germany , near the ruhr and rhine rivers , into germany 's industrial heartland and powered its comeback from the ashes of world war ii . " i have always loved being a miner , and i still do , " said henschen , who was just 14 when he went down into his first mining pit .
" but i 'm worried about the future . " henschen is a member of a profession whose days appear limited in germany .
while there were once over 100 pits at the hard-coal mining industry 's peak in the 1950s , today there are only eight such mines left in germany .
the ruhr region 's centuries-old mining history means it is necessary to go further and further underground to reach unexhausted coal seams .
stringent safety measures and high-labor costs have also added to the cost of german hard coal .
at around 180 euros -lrb- $ 248 -rrb- per ton , it costs more than three times the global market price . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun is setting on the german hard-coal mining industry but for decades , german lawmakers have propped up the industry with large-scale subsidies .
right now , federal and regional governments pump 2.5 billion euros a year into hard-coal mining . " the markets are international , our energy supplies are secure , and so there 's no reason to use public money to subsidize hard-coal mining , " said oliver wittke , minister for building and transport for the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the ruhr region , and henschen 's mine , are located .
" it is far too expensive . " but to henschen , the bottom line should not be the only consideration . " expensive is not always the most costly , " he said .
to him , what germany will be giving up when the mines close has a value that you ca n't put a euro-sign on . family tradition henschen is the third generation in his family to go into mining .
his grandfather , who he never knew , was a pitman .
his father was too , working in the late ' 50s during the industry 's heyday , when the ruhr area was a cauldron of smokestacks , steel factories and rumbling hard-coal conveyor belts which fed them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mine workers leave the elevator at the mine in voerde mining was in his blood , and really was all he ever knew , or saw .
miners lived mostly together in settlements often not far from the pits .
after the gritty shifts spent together far underground , miners would often spend their free time together and raise their families next door to one another . " the hard work underground welded us together , you could say , " said henschen .
" we respect one another , have to depend on one another .
it 's not like in other jobs . " miners , he said , are part of a tightly knit social fabric that is unraveling because of government decisions he thinks are wrong .
but that fabric has already been badly frayed by layoffs .
today there are 34,000 miners , down from 607,000 in 1970 . engine of integration ali sen , 39 , is in his 24th year as a miner , but is now spending time above ground in the public relations office of dsk , the company which manages germany 's remaining hard-coal mines , learning another side of the business , one that might have more of a future . his father was a miner in turkey before coming to germany as a so-called " guest worker , " bringing his family over when sen was two .
the strong sense of social cohesion among miners extended to relations between turks and germans , according to sen. while the integration of germany 's large turkish community into the large society is still seen as problematic , sen said with miners , ethnicity was never an issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long history : miners in 1880 " i do n't think these groups get along anywhere in german better than in the ruhr region , " he said .
" we live side by side , play together in soccer clubs , it 's exemplary . " both he and henschen said closing mines could further weaken the ruhr area 's economy - the mine in voerde , where they both work , is scheduled to close next year .
other businesses in the area , some of which depend on miners ' patronage , will suffer . " where mines have been closed , you notice the neighborhoods that bore the brunt of it have n't bounced back even after 20 or 30 years , " sen said .
" they might not quite be ghettos , but stores are closed and people do n't have money to buy . " structural change the ruhr region 's economy has been hard hit by the progressive shuttering of its heavy industry since the 1960s and successive waves of large-scale layoffs .
by the end of the 1990s , the once prosperous region had turned into a landscape of rusting industrial ruins , environmental degradation and dwindling hopes .
unemployment once reached 19 percent , although that number now stands at 14.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a light show at the repurposed mining tower , zollverein the region is now embarking on an economic redevelopment program that sees it moving away from heavy industry like steel and coal and toward the logistics , chemicals and service sectors .
the region will be one of europe 's cultural capitals for 2010 , and some of its industrial skeletons , like unused mining shaft towers , deserted factories , and silo-like gasometers , have already been turned into cultural spaces for exhibitions or performances . much ado about little ? some argue that miners ' complaints are exaggerated .
the agreement on ending the subsidies provides a " soft landing " for the workers and the federal and state governments will spend an estimated 21.6 billion euros over the next 11 years .
options for miners include retraining programs , job-search help , and start-up money for those wishing to become self-employed .
those who have 25 years underground can retire at 49 . " we are doing a lot for our miners , " said christof beike , a spokesman for dsk . but for those like henschen , used to the security mining once brought , that is cold comfort .
and even more then the end of an industry , it 's the end of a tradition and a life that might have been hard on the body , but was good for the soul . " now families are losing their bearings and the solidarity of our communities is being pulled apart , " he said .
" i think that 's a shame . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while islam and buddhism are getting more popular , christianity is n't .
the controversial theologian spoke to dw-world.de about the reasons . born in 1928 , catholic theologian and church critic hans küng made his mark as a promoter of dialogue between religions and as president of the global ethic foundation .
in 1979 , the vatican withdrew his license to teach after the swiss native questioned the infallibility of the pope .
in the fall of 2005 , pope benedict xvi invited küng to a private meeting .
dw-world.de : professor küng , people - and not only in germany - are again enormously interested in religious issues .
can we speak of a return of religions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran in 1979 : ayatollah chomeini is back from exile hans küng : " return of religions " - that is an ambivalent term .
religion never disappeared .
just like music , religion is something that stays , even if it is suppressed for some time .
it is true , that since the new awakening of islam , since the creation of the islamic republic of iran in 1979 , europeans have realized that they do n't rule the world by themselves .
for a long time , secular europe had not realized that it was an exception , and that elsewhere , religions is a power .
" no peace among the nations , without peace between the religions !
no peace between the religions without dialog between the religions ! "
those are two central sentences of your world ethic principle .
in a time of globalization , there are many undreamed-of possibilities for communication on the internet .
the access to knowledge is easier than ever before .
can this development improve the dialog of religions ?
in principle , i would say yes , even though this brings many problems .
it 's a positive thing that today we can know a lot about other religions .
a different question , of course , is whether we do want to be in the know .
there are people who do n't - they already know everything , without studying the islam .
who does n't want to know ?
for one , the fundamental christians who take everything the bible says literally and say they do n't need any other religions .
then there are the very secular people , dogmatists of laicism .
they get worked up simply when the word religion is mentioned , and they think that we should not talk about it in schools .
they have issues with the fact that religion , again , is a powerful factor in world history .
according to a survey , not christianity but buddhism is the most likeable religion for germans .
how do you explain that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .
it is a religion that 's turned to the inside and that emphasizes meditation .
it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .
of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .
even though islam is seen skeptically throughout europe , it attracts many , especially young people , around the globe .
there are 1.3 billion muslims , with an upward trend .
from rabat to damascus there are islamic groups that are becoming increasingly important politically .
why is that so ?
are there religious or social reasons for this ?
both .
those are religious groups that help people .
many muslims in those countries feel that the ruling elites have a life of their own and do n't take care of the population at large .
the fundamental islamist groups - or whatever you want to call them - try very hard to do something for people .
they take care of schools and education , and they give people clothes and food .
why did hamas win the elections -lsb- in the palestinian territories -rsb- ?
because they worked for the people .
one of the biggest mistakes of western politics - germany included , by the way - was to not accept those elections .
instead , fingers were pointed , saying : " you have to accept israel ! "
tell that to people that have been terrorized by an occupying power for decades .
that is not the right way to solve those problems .
you have to realize that there are parties that do have islam as a basis , yet they campaign for the people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate young muslims make themselves available for terrorist attacks a better example is the party of prime minister erdogan in turkey .
why did they win ?
because they helped people .
they showed - with all weaknesses that they have - that they will bring their country forward and in no way did they develop an islamic theocracy , such as the one in iran .
they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .
how far would the willingness to negotiate with the radical powers have to go ?

in the fall of 2005 , pope benedict xvi invited küng to a private meeting .
dw-world.de : professor küng , people - and not only in germany - are again enormously interested in religious issues .
can we speak of a return of religions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran in 1979 : ayatollah chomeini is back from exile hans küng : " return of religions " - that is an ambivalent term .
religion never disappeared .
just like music , religion is something that stays , even if it is suppressed for some time .
it is true , that since the new awakening of islam , since the creation of the islamic republic of iran in 1979 , europeans have realized that they do n't rule the world by themselves .
for a long time , secular europe had not realized that it was an exception , and that elsewhere , religions is a power .
" no peace among the nations , without peace between the religions !
no peace between the religions without dialog between the religions ! "
those are two central sentences of your world ethic principle .
in a time of globalization , there are many undreamed-of possibilities for communication on the internet .
the access to knowledge is easier than ever before .
can this development improve the dialog of religions ?
in principle , i would say yes , even though this brings many problems .
it 's a positive thing that today we can know a lot about other religions .
a different question , of course , is whether we do want to be in the know .
there are people who do n't - they already know everything , without studying the islam .
who does n't want to know ?
for one , the fundamental christians who take everything the bible says literally and say they do n't need any other religions .
then there are the very secular people , dogmatists of laicism .
they get worked up simply when the word religion is mentioned , and they think that we should not talk about it in schools .
they have issues with the fact that religion , again , is a powerful factor in world history .
according to a survey , not christianity but buddhism is the most likeable religion for germans .
how do you explain that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .
it is a religion that 's turned to the inside and that emphasizes meditation .
it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .
of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .
even though islam is seen skeptically throughout europe , it attracts many , especially young people , around the globe .
there are 1.3 billion muslims , with an upward trend .
from rabat to damascus there are islamic groups that are becoming increasingly important politically .
why is that so ?
are there religious or social reasons for this ?
both .
those are religious groups that help people .
many muslims in those countries feel that the ruling elites have a life of their own and do n't take care of the population at large .
the fundamental islamist groups - or whatever you want to call them - try very hard to do something for people .
they take care of schools and education , and they give people clothes and food .
why did hamas win the elections -lsb- in the palestinian territories -rsb- ?
because they worked for the people .
one of the biggest mistakes of western politics - germany included , by the way - was to not accept those elections .
instead , fingers were pointed , saying : " you have to accept israel ! "
tell that to people that have been terrorized by an occupying power for decades .
that is not the right way to solve those problems .
you have to realize that there are parties that do have islam as a basis , yet they campaign for the people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate young muslims make themselves available for terrorist attacks a better example is the party of prime minister erdogan in turkey .
why did they win ?
because they helped people .
they showed - with all weaknesses that they have - that they will bring their country forward and in no way did they develop an islamic theocracy , such as the one in iran .
they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .
how far would the willingness to negotiate with the radical powers have to go ?
would one have to negotiate with the taliban and al qaeda as well ?
you can not negotiate with al qaeda .
it is a secret terrorist group .
you can only dry them up .
but the west has watered them so much that they could sprout .
the american secret service recently admitted in secret documents that the iraq war only helped al qaeda .
before , there was no al qaeda in iraq .
you could certainly negotiate with the taliban .
they are n't just crazy people .
there are some extremists , and there are , on the other hand , those that warned the bush administration about sept .
11 .
but it was n't taken seriously .
there were chieftains in afghanistan that warned against marching in with an army .
a personal question : on sept .
12 you will introduce your autobiography " controversial truth . "
if you look back , are you still as optimistic as you were in 1990 when you wrote " global responsibility : in search of a new world ethic " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen after bush ?
when i wrote the book in 1990 , of course , one hoped that in the future , problems would not be solved with military means , with aggression and animosity and war , but instead - just like it worked in western and eastern europe - through mutual understanding , cooperation and integration .
unfortunately , this was disrupted by the mad policies that the second bush administration initiated with a clique of archconservative jewish intellectuals , so-called neocons and protestant fundamentalists .
i am not an enemy , but a friend of the americans .
i hope that , despite the backlash that the policies of bush jr. brought on , americans can remember their great democratic tradition and lead in terms of international understanding , moderation and world peace .
were you hurt that pope benedict xvi never accepted your idea of the world ethic ?
he accepted the idea as such .
he realizes that there have to be common ethical standards .
during our conversation he conceded that those standards need to be valid for believers and non-believers .
one could only have expected that he would personally advocate this .
but that might still happen . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for miners , it means a beloved tradition and a way of life is coming to an end . on a recent wednesday morning , benno henschen 's alarm clock went off at 3:10 a.m.
he drove 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- to a non-descript complex of buildings near the leafy small town of voerde , changed into his work clothes , and promptly descended 820 meters -lrb- 2,690 feet -rrb- under the earth . it is the start of the early shift for henschen , 49 , who will spend the next seven hours overseeing the machines that extract the hard coal that turned this region in western germany , near the ruhr and rhine rivers , into germany 's industrial heartland and powered its comeback from the ashes of world war ii . " i have always loved being a miner , and i still do , " said henschen , who was just 14 when he went down into his first mining pit .
" but i 'm worried about the future . " henschen is a member of a profession whose days appear limited in germany .
while there were once over 100 pits at the hard-coal mining industry 's peak in the 1950s , today there are only eight such mines left in germany .
the ruhr region 's centuries-old mining history means it is necessary to go further and further underground to reach unexhausted coal seams .
stringent safety measures and high-labor costs have also added to the cost of german hard coal .
at around 180 euros -lrb- $ 248 -rrb- per ton , it costs more than three times the global market price . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun is setting on the german hard-coal mining industry but for decades , german lawmakers have propped up the industry with large-scale subsidies .
right now , federal and regional governments pump 2.5 billion euros a year into hard-coal mining . " the markets are international , our energy supplies are secure , and so there 's no reason to use public money to subsidize hard-coal mining , " said oliver wittke , minister for building and transport for the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the ruhr region , and henschen 's mine , are located .
" it is far too expensive . " but to henschen , the bottom line should not be the only consideration . " expensive is not always the most costly , " he said .
to him , what germany will be giving up when the mines close has a value that you ca n't put a euro-sign on . family tradition henschen is the third generation in his family to go into mining .
his grandfather , who he never knew , was a pitman .
his father was too , working in the late ' 50s during the industry 's heyday , when the ruhr area was a cauldron of smokestacks , steel factories and rumbling hard-coal conveyor belts which fed them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mine workers leave the elevator at the mine in voerde mining was in his blood , and really was all he ever knew , or saw .
miners lived mostly together in settlements often not far from the pits .
after the gritty shifts spent together far underground , miners would often spend their free time together and raise their families next door to one another . " the hard work underground welded us together , you could say , " said henschen .
" we respect one another , have to depend on one another .
it 's not like in other jobs . " miners , he said , are part of a tightly knit social fabric that is unraveling because of government decisions he thinks are wrong .
but that fabric has already been badly frayed by layoffs .
today there are 34,000 miners , down from 607,000 in 1970 . engine of integration ali sen , 39 , is in his 24th year as a miner , but is now spending time above ground in the public relations office of dsk , the company which manages germany 's remaining hard-coal mines , learning another side of the business , one that might have more of a future . his father was a miner in turkey before coming to germany as a so-called " guest worker , " bringing his family over when sen was two .
the strong sense of social cohesion among miners extended to relations between turks and germans , according to sen. while the integration of germany 's large turkish community into the large society is still seen as problematic , sen said with miners , ethnicity was never an issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long history : miners in 1880 " i do n't think these groups get along anywhere in german better than in the ruhr region , " he said .
" we live side by side , play together in soccer clubs , it 's exemplary . " both he and henschen said closing mines could further weaken the ruhr area 's economy - the mine in voerde , where they both work , is scheduled to close next year .
other businesses in the area , some of which depend on miners ' patronage , will suffer . " where mines have been closed , you notice the neighborhoods that bore the brunt of it have n't bounced back even after 20 or 30 years , " sen said .
" they might not quite be ghettos , but stores are closed and people do n't have money to buy . " structural change the ruhr region 's economy has been hard hit by the progressive shuttering of its heavy industry since the 1960s and successive waves of large-scale layoffs .
by the end of the 1990s , the once prosperous region had turned into a landscape of rusting industrial ruins , environmental degradation and dwindling hopes .
unemployment once reached 19 percent , although that number now stands at 14.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a light show at the repurposed mining tower , zollverein the region is now embarking on an economic redevelopment program that sees it moving away from heavy industry like steel and coal and toward the logistics , chemicals and service sectors .
the region will be one of europe 's cultural capitals for 2010 , and some of its industrial skeletons , like unused mining shaft towers , deserted factories , and silo-like gasometers , have already been turned into cultural spaces for exhibitions or performances . much ado about little ? some argue that miners ' complaints are exaggerated .
the agreement on ending the subsidies provides a " soft landing " for the workers and the federal and state governments will spend an estimated 21.6 billion euros over the next 11 years .
options for miners include retraining programs , job-search help , and start-up money for those wishing to become self-employed .
those who have 25 years underground can retire at 49 . " we are doing a lot for our miners , " said christof beike , a spokesman for dsk . but for those like henschen , used to the security mining once brought , that is cold comfort .
and even more then the end of an industry , it 's the end of a tradition and a life that might have been hard on the body , but was good for the soul . " now families are losing their bearings and the solidarity of our communities is being pulled apart , " he said .

for miners , it means a beloved tradition and a way of life is coming to an end . on a recent wednesday morning , benno henschen 's alarm clock went off at 3:10 a.m.
he drove 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- to a non-descript complex of buildings near the leafy small town of voerde , changed into his work clothes , and promptly descended 820 meters -lrb- 2,690 feet -rrb- under the earth . it is the start of the early shift for henschen , 49 , who will spend the next seven hours overseeing the machines that extract the hard coal that turned this region in western germany , near the ruhr and rhine rivers , into germany 's industrial heartland and powered its comeback from the ashes of world war ii . " i have always loved being a miner , and i still do , " said henschen , who was just 14 when he went down into his first mining pit .
" but i 'm worried about the future . " henschen is a member of a profession whose days appear limited in germany .
while there were once over 100 pits at the hard-coal mining industry 's peak in the 1950s , today there are only eight such mines left in germany .
the ruhr region 's centuries-old mining history means it is necessary to go further and further underground to reach unexhausted coal seams .
stringent safety measures and high-labor costs have also added to the cost of german hard coal .
at around 180 euros -lrb- $ 248 -rrb- per ton , it costs more than three times the global market price . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun is setting on the german hard-coal mining industry but for decades , german lawmakers have propped up the industry with large-scale subsidies .
right now , federal and regional governments pump 2.5 billion euros a year into hard-coal mining . " the markets are international , our energy supplies are secure , and so there 's no reason to use public money to subsidize hard-coal mining , " said oliver wittke , minister for building and transport for the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the ruhr region , and henschen 's mine , are located .
" it is far too expensive . " but to henschen , the bottom line should not be the only consideration . " expensive is not always the most costly , " he said .
to him , what germany will be giving up when the mines close has a value that you ca n't put a euro-sign on . family tradition henschen is the third generation in his family to go into mining .
his grandfather , who he never knew , was a pitman .
his father was too , working in the late ' 50s during the industry 's heyday , when the ruhr area was a cauldron of smokestacks , steel factories and rumbling hard-coal conveyor belts which fed them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mine workers leave the elevator at the mine in voerde mining was in his blood , and really was all he ever knew , or saw .
miners lived mostly together in settlements often not far from the pits .
after the gritty shifts spent together far underground , miners would often spend their free time together and raise their families next door to one another . " the hard work underground welded us together , you could say , " said henschen .
" we respect one another , have to depend on one another .
it 's not like in other jobs . " miners , he said , are part of a tightly knit social fabric that is unraveling because of government decisions he thinks are wrong .
but that fabric has already been badly frayed by layoffs .
today there are 34,000 miners , down from 607,000 in 1970 . engine of integration ali sen , 39 , is in his 24th year as a miner , but is now spending time above ground in the public relations office of dsk , the company which manages germany 's remaining hard-coal mines , learning another side of the business , one that might have more of a future . his father was a miner in turkey before coming to germany as a so-called " guest worker , " bringing his family over when sen was two .
the strong sense of social cohesion among miners extended to relations between turks and germans , according to sen. while the integration of germany 's large turkish community into the large society is still seen as problematic , sen said with miners , ethnicity was never an issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long history : miners in 1880 " i do n't think these groups get along anywhere in german better than in the ruhr region , " he said .
" we live side by side , play together in soccer clubs , it 's exemplary . " both he and henschen said closing mines could further weaken the ruhr area 's economy - the mine in voerde , where they both work , is scheduled to close next year .
other businesses in the area , some of which depend on miners ' patronage , will suffer . " where mines have been closed , you notice the neighborhoods that bore the brunt of it have n't bounced back even after 20 or 30 years , " sen said .
" they might not quite be ghettos , but stores are closed and people do n't have money to buy . " structural change the ruhr region 's economy has been hard hit by the progressive shuttering of its heavy industry since the 1960s and successive waves of large-scale layoffs .
by the end of the 1990s , the once prosperous region had turned into a landscape of rusting industrial ruins , environmental degradation and dwindling hopes .
unemployment once reached 19 percent , although that number now stands at 14.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a light show at the repurposed mining tower , zollverein the region is now embarking on an economic redevelopment program that sees it moving away from heavy industry like steel and coal and toward the logistics , chemicals and service sectors .
the region will be one of europe 's cultural capitals for 2010 , and some of its industrial skeletons , like unused mining shaft towers , deserted factories , and silo-like gasometers , have already been turned into cultural spaces for exhibitions or performances . much ado about little ? some argue that miners ' complaints are exaggerated .
the agreement on ending the subsidies provides a " soft landing " for the workers and the federal and state governments will spend an estimated 21.6 billion euros over the next 11 years .
options for miners include retraining programs , job-search help , and start-up money for those wishing to become self-employed .
those who have 25 years underground can retire at 49 . " we are doing a lot for our miners , " said christof beike , a spokesman for dsk . but for those like henschen , used to the security mining once brought , that is cold comfort .
and even more then the end of an industry , it 's the end of a tradition and a life that might have been hard on the body , but was good for the soul . " now families are losing their bearings and the solidarity of our communities is being pulled apart , " he said .
" i think that 's a shame . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany decides to abandon coal mining germany will gradually phase out its coal mining , after declaring that it makes no economic sense .
subsidies to phase out the mining over the next decade will cost 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion . -rrb- -lrb- 08.08.2007 -rrb- the rise and fall of germany 's coal mining industry coal might be germany 's most abundant indigenous energy source , but the death knell finally sounded for the country 's unprofitable coal industry when the government decided to end mining subsidies by 2018 .

while islam and buddhism are getting more popular , christianity is n't .
the controversial theologian spoke to dw-world.de about the reasons . born in 1928 , catholic theologian and church critic hans küng made his mark as a promoter of dialogue between religions and as president of the global ethic foundation .
in 1979 , the vatican withdrew his license to teach after the swiss native questioned the infallibility of the pope .
in the fall of 2005 , pope benedict xvi invited küng to a private meeting .
dw-world.de : professor küng , people - and not only in germany - are again enormously interested in religious issues .
can we speak of a return of religions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran in 1979 : ayatollah chomeini is back from exile hans küng : " return of religions " - that is an ambivalent term .
religion never disappeared .
just like music , religion is something that stays , even if it is suppressed for some time .
it is true , that since the new awakening of islam , since the creation of the islamic republic of iran in 1979 , europeans have realized that they do n't rule the world by themselves .
for a long time , secular europe had not realized that it was an exception , and that elsewhere , religions is a power .
" no peace among the nations , without peace between the religions !
no peace between the religions without dialog between the religions ! "
those are two central sentences of your world ethic principle .
in a time of globalization , there are many undreamed-of possibilities for communication on the internet .
the access to knowledge is easier than ever before .
can this development improve the dialog of religions ?
in principle , i would say yes , even though this brings many problems .
it 's a positive thing that today we can know a lot about other religions .
a different question , of course , is whether we do want to be in the know .
there are people who do n't - they already know everything , without studying the islam .
who does n't want to know ?
for one , the fundamental christians who take everything the bible says literally and say they do n't need any other religions .
then there are the very secular people , dogmatists of laicism .
they get worked up simply when the word religion is mentioned , and they think that we should not talk about it in schools .
they have issues with the fact that religion , again , is a powerful factor in world history .
according to a survey , not christianity but buddhism is the most likeable religion for germans .
how do you explain that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .
it is a religion that 's turned to the inside and that emphasizes meditation .
it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .
of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .
even though islam is seen skeptically throughout europe , it attracts many , especially young people , around the globe .
there are 1.3 billion muslims , with an upward trend .
from rabat to damascus there are islamic groups that are becoming increasingly important politically .
why is that so ?
are there religious or social reasons for this ?
both .
those are religious groups that help people .
many muslims in those countries feel that the ruling elites have a life of their own and do n't take care of the population at large .
the fundamental islamist groups - or whatever you want to call them - try very hard to do something for people .
they take care of schools and education , and they give people clothes and food .
why did hamas win the elections -lsb- in the palestinian territories -rsb- ?
because they worked for the people .
one of the biggest mistakes of western politics - germany included , by the way - was to not accept those elections .
instead , fingers were pointed , saying : " you have to accept israel ! "
tell that to people that have been terrorized by an occupying power for decades .
that is not the right way to solve those problems .
you have to realize that there are parties that do have islam as a basis , yet they campaign for the people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate young muslims make themselves available for terrorist attacks a better example is the party of prime minister erdogan in turkey .
why did they win ?
because they helped people .
they showed - with all weaknesses that they have - that they will bring their country forward and in no way did they develop an islamic theocracy , such as the one in iran .
they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .
how far would the willingness to negotiate with the radical powers have to go ?
would one have to negotiate with the taliban and al qaeda as well ?
you can not negotiate with al qaeda .
it is a secret terrorist group .
you can only dry them up .
but the west has watered them so much that they could sprout .
the american secret service recently admitted in secret documents that the iraq war only helped al qaeda .
before , there was no al qaeda in iraq .
you could certainly negotiate with the taliban .
they are n't just crazy people .
there are some extremists , and there are , on the other hand , those that warned the bush administration about sept .
11 .
but it was n't taken seriously .
there were chieftains in afghanistan that warned against marching in with an army .
a personal question : on sept .
12 you will introduce your autobiography " controversial truth . "
if you look back , are you still as optimistic as you were in 1990 when you wrote " global responsibility : in search of a new world ethic " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen after bush ?
when i wrote the book in 1990 , of course , one hoped that in the future , problems would not be solved with military means , with aggression and animosity and war , but instead - just like it worked in western and eastern europe - through mutual understanding , cooperation and integration .
unfortunately , this was disrupted by the mad policies that the second bush administration initiated with a clique of archconservative jewish intellectuals , so-called neocons and protestant fundamentalists .
i am not an enemy , but a friend of the americans .
i hope that , despite the backlash that the policies of bush jr. brought on , americans can remember their great democratic tradition and lead in terms of international understanding , moderation and world peace .
were you hurt that pope benedict xvi never accepted your idea of the world ethic ?
he accepted the idea as such .
he realizes that there have to be common ethical standards .
during our conversation he conceded that those standards need to be valid for believers and non-believers .
one could only have expected that he would personally advocate this .
but that might still happen . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .
even though islam is seen skeptically throughout europe , it attracts many , especially young people , around the globe .
there are 1.3 billion muslims , with an upward trend .
from rabat to damascus there are islamic groups that are becoming increasingly important politically .
why is that so ?
are there religious or social reasons for this ?
both .
those are religious groups that help people .
many muslims in those countries feel that the ruling elites have a life of their own and do n't take care of the population at large .
the fundamental islamist groups - or whatever you want to call them - try very hard to do something for people .
they take care of schools and education , and they give people clothes and food .
why did hamas win the elections -lsb- in the palestinian territories -rsb- ?
because they worked for the people .
one of the biggest mistakes of western politics - germany included , by the way - was to not accept those elections .
instead , fingers were pointed , saying : " you have to accept israel ! "
tell that to people that have been terrorized by an occupying power for decades .
that is not the right way to solve those problems .
you have to realize that there are parties that do have islam as a basis , yet they campaign for the people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate young muslims make themselves available for terrorist attacks a better example is the party of prime minister erdogan in turkey .
why did they win ?
because they helped people .
they showed - with all weaknesses that they have - that they will bring their country forward and in no way did they develop an islamic theocracy , such as the one in iran .
they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .
how far would the willingness to negotiate with the radical powers have to go ?
would one have to negotiate with the taliban and al qaeda as well ?
you can not negotiate with al qaeda .
it is a secret terrorist group .
you can only dry them up .
but the west has watered them so much that they could sprout .
the american secret service recently admitted in secret documents that the iraq war only helped al qaeda .
before , there was no al qaeda in iraq .
you could certainly negotiate with the taliban .
they are n't just crazy people .
there are some extremists , and there are , on the other hand , those that warned the bush administration about sept .

if you look back , are you still as optimistic as you were in 1990 when you wrote " global responsibility : in search of a new world ethic " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen after bush ?
when i wrote the book in 1990 , of course , one hoped that in the future , problems would not be solved with military means , with aggression and animosity and war , but instead - just like it worked in western and eastern europe - through mutual understanding , cooperation and integration .
unfortunately , this was disrupted by the mad policies that the second bush administration initiated with a clique of archconservative jewish intellectuals , so-called neocons and protestant fundamentalists .
i am not an enemy , but a friend of the americans .
i hope that , despite the backlash that the policies of bush jr. brought on , americans can remember their great democratic tradition and lead in terms of international understanding , moderation and world peace .
were you hurt that pope benedict xvi never accepted your idea of the world ethic ?
he accepted the idea as such .
he realizes that there have to be common ethical standards .

while islam and buddhism are getting more popular , christianity is n't .
the controversial theologian spoke to dw-world.de about the reasons . born in 1928 , catholic theologian and church critic hans küng made his mark as a promoter of dialogue between religions and as president of the global ethic foundation .
in 1979 , the vatican withdrew his license to teach after the swiss native questioned the infallibility of the pope .
in the fall of 2005 , pope benedict xvi invited küng to a private meeting .
dw-world.de : professor küng , people - and not only in germany - are again enormously interested in religious issues .
can we speak of a return of religions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran in 1979 : ayatollah chomeini is back from exile hans küng : " return of religions " - that is an ambivalent term .
religion never disappeared .
just like music , religion is something that stays , even if it is suppressed for some time .
it is true , that since the new awakening of islam , since the creation of the islamic republic of iran in 1979 , europeans have realized that they do n't rule the world by themselves .
for a long time , secular europe had not realized that it was an exception , and that elsewhere , religions is a power .
" no peace among the nations , without peace between the religions !
no peace between the religions without dialog between the religions ! "
those are two central sentences of your world ethic principle .
in a time of globalization , there are many undreamed-of possibilities for communication on the internet .
the access to knowledge is easier than ever before .
can this development improve the dialog of religions ?
in principle , i would say yes , even though this brings many problems .
it 's a positive thing that today we can know a lot about other religions .
a different question , of course , is whether we do want to be in the know .
there are people who do n't - they already know everything , without studying the islam .
who does n't want to know ?
for one , the fundamental christians who take everything the bible says literally and say they do n't need any other religions .
then there are the very secular people , dogmatists of laicism .
they get worked up simply when the word religion is mentioned , and they think that we should not talk about it in schools .
they have issues with the fact that religion , again , is a powerful factor in world history .
according to a survey , not christianity but buddhism is the most likeable religion for germans .
how do you explain that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .
it is a religion that 's turned to the inside and that emphasizes meditation .
it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .

you have to realize that there are parties that do have islam as a basis , yet they campaign for the people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate young muslims make themselves available for terrorist attacks a better example is the party of prime minister erdogan in turkey .
why did they win ?
because they helped people .
they showed - with all weaknesses that they have - that they will bring their country forward and in no way did they develop an islamic theocracy , such as the one in iran .
they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .
how far would the willingness to negotiate with the radical powers have to go ?
would one have to negotiate with the taliban and al qaeda as well ?
you can not negotiate with al qaeda .
it is a secret terrorist group .
you can only dry them up .
but the west has watered them so much that they could sprout .
the american secret service recently admitted in secret documents that the iraq war only helped al qaeda .
before , there was no al qaeda in iraq .
you could certainly negotiate with the taliban .
they are n't just crazy people .
there are some extremists , and there are , on the other hand , those that warned the bush administration about sept .
11 .
but it was n't taken seriously .
there were chieftains in afghanistan that warned against marching in with an army .
a personal question : on sept .
12 you will introduce your autobiography " controversial truth . "
if you look back , are you still as optimistic as you were in 1990 when you wrote " global responsibility : in search of a new world ethic " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen after bush ?
when i wrote the book in 1990 , of course , one hoped that in the future , problems would not be solved with military means , with aggression and animosity and war , but instead - just like it worked in western and eastern europe - through mutual understanding , cooperation and integration .
unfortunately , this was disrupted by the mad policies that the second bush administration initiated with a clique of archconservative jewish intellectuals , so-called neocons and protestant fundamentalists .
i am not an enemy , but a friend of the americans .
i hope that , despite the backlash that the policies of bush jr. brought on , americans can remember their great democratic tradition and lead in terms of international understanding , moderation and world peace .
were you hurt that pope benedict xvi never accepted your idea of the world ethic ?
he accepted the idea as such .
he realizes that there have to be common ethical standards .
during our conversation he conceded that those standards need to be valid for believers and non-believers .
one could only have expected that he would personally advocate this .
but that might still happen . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for miners , it means a beloved tradition and a way of life is coming to an end . on a recent wednesday morning , benno henschen 's alarm clock went off at 3:10 a.m.
he drove 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- to a non-descript complex of buildings near the leafy small town of voerde , changed into his work clothes , and promptly descended 820 meters -lrb- 2,690 feet -rrb- under the earth . it is the start of the early shift for henschen , 49 , who will spend the next seven hours overseeing the machines that extract the hard coal that turned this region in western germany , near the ruhr and rhine rivers , into germany 's industrial heartland and powered its comeback from the ashes of world war ii . " i have always loved being a miner , and i still do , " said henschen , who was just 14 when he went down into his first mining pit .
" but i 'm worried about the future . " henschen is a member of a profession whose days appear limited in germany .
while there were once over 100 pits at the hard-coal mining industry 's peak in the 1950s , today there are only eight such mines left in germany .
the ruhr region 's centuries-old mining history means it is necessary to go further and further underground to reach unexhausted coal seams .
stringent safety measures and high-labor costs have also added to the cost of german hard coal .
at around 180 euros -lrb- $ 248 -rrb- per ton , it costs more than three times the global market price . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun is setting on the german hard-coal mining industry but for decades , german lawmakers have propped up the industry with large-scale subsidies .
right now , federal and regional governments pump 2.5 billion euros a year into hard-coal mining . " the markets are international , our energy supplies are secure , and so there 's no reason to use public money to subsidize hard-coal mining , " said oliver wittke , minister for building and transport for the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the ruhr region , and henschen 's mine , are located .
" it is far too expensive . " but to henschen , the bottom line should not be the only consideration . " expensive is not always the most costly , " he said .
to him , what germany will be giving up when the mines close has a value that you ca n't put a euro-sign on . family tradition henschen is the third generation in his family to go into mining .
his grandfather , who he never knew , was a pitman .
his father was too , working in the late ' 50s during the industry 's heyday , when the ruhr area was a cauldron of smokestacks , steel factories and rumbling hard-coal conveyor belts which fed them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mine workers leave the elevator at the mine in voerde mining was in his blood , and really was all he ever knew , or saw .
miners lived mostly together in settlements often not far from the pits .
after the gritty shifts spent together far underground , miners would often spend their free time together and raise their families next door to one another . " the hard work underground welded us together , you could say , " said henschen .
" we respect one another , have to depend on one another .
it 's not like in other jobs . " miners , he said , are part of a tightly knit social fabric that is unraveling because of government decisions he thinks are wrong .
but that fabric has already been badly frayed by layoffs .
today there are 34,000 miners , down from 607,000 in 1970 . engine of integration ali sen , 39 , is in his 24th year as a miner , but is now spending time above ground in the public relations office of dsk , the company which manages germany 's remaining hard-coal mines , learning another side of the business , one that might have more of a future . his father was a miner in turkey before coming to germany as a so-called " guest worker , " bringing his family over when sen was two .
the strong sense of social cohesion among miners extended to relations between turks and germans , according to sen. while the integration of germany 's large turkish community into the large society is still seen as problematic , sen said with miners , ethnicity was never an issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long history : miners in 1880 " i do n't think these groups get along anywhere in german better than in the ruhr region , " he said .
" we live side by side , play together in soccer clubs , it 's exemplary . " both he and henschen said closing mines could further weaken the ruhr area 's economy - the mine in voerde , where they both work , is scheduled to close next year .
other businesses in the area , some of which depend on miners ' patronage , will suffer . " where mines have been closed , you notice the neighborhoods that bore the brunt of it have n't bounced back even after 20 or 30 years , " sen said .
" they might not quite be ghettos , but stores are closed and people do n't have money to buy . " structural change the ruhr region 's economy has been hard hit by the progressive shuttering of its heavy industry since the 1960s and successive waves of large-scale layoffs .
by the end of the 1990s , the once prosperous region had turned into a landscape of rusting industrial ruins , environmental degradation and dwindling hopes .
unemployment once reached 19 percent , although that number now stands at 14.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a light show at the repurposed mining tower , zollverein the region is now embarking on an economic redevelopment program that sees it moving away from heavy industry like steel and coal and toward the logistics , chemicals and service sectors .
the region will be one of europe 's cultural capitals for 2010 , and some of its industrial skeletons , like unused mining shaft towers , deserted factories , and silo-like gasometers , have already been turned into cultural spaces for exhibitions or performances . much ado about little ? some argue that miners ' complaints are exaggerated .
the agreement on ending the subsidies provides a " soft landing " for the workers and the federal and state governments will spend an estimated 21.6 billion euros over the next 11 years .
options for miners include retraining programs , job-search help , and start-up money for those wishing to become self-employed .
those who have 25 years underground can retire at 49 . " we are doing a lot for our miners , " said christof beike , a spokesman for dsk . but for those like henschen , used to the security mining once brought , that is cold comfort .
and even more then the end of an industry , it 's the end of a tradition and a life that might have been hard on the body , but was good for the soul . " now families are losing their bearings and the solidarity of our communities is being pulled apart , " he said .

for miners , it means a beloved tradition and a way of life is coming to an end . on a recent wednesday morning , benno henschen 's alarm clock went off at 3:10 a.m.
he drove 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- to a non-descript complex of buildings near the leafy small town of voerde , changed into his work clothes , and promptly descended 820 meters -lrb- 2,690 feet -rrb- under the earth . it is the start of the early shift for henschen , 49 , who will spend the next seven hours overseeing the machines that extract the hard coal that turned this region in western germany , near the ruhr and rhine rivers , into germany 's industrial heartland and powered its comeback from the ashes of world war ii . " i have always loved being a miner , and i still do , " said henschen , who was just 14 when he went down into his first mining pit .
" but i 'm worried about the future . " henschen is a member of a profession whose days appear limited in germany .
while there were once over 100 pits at the hard-coal mining industry 's peak in the 1950s , today there are only eight such mines left in germany .
the ruhr region 's centuries-old mining history means it is necessary to go further and further underground to reach unexhausted coal seams .
stringent safety measures and high-labor costs have also added to the cost of german hard coal .
at around 180 euros -lrb- $ 248 -rrb- per ton , it costs more than three times the global market price . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun is setting on the german hard-coal mining industry but for decades , german lawmakers have propped up the industry with large-scale subsidies .
right now , federal and regional governments pump 2.5 billion euros a year into hard-coal mining . " the markets are international , our energy supplies are secure , and so there 's no reason to use public money to subsidize hard-coal mining , " said oliver wittke , minister for building and transport for the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the ruhr region , and henschen 's mine , are located .
" it is far too expensive . " but to henschen , the bottom line should not be the only consideration . " expensive is not always the most costly , " he said .
to him , what germany will be giving up when the mines close has a value that you ca n't put a euro-sign on . family tradition henschen is the third generation in his family to go into mining .
his grandfather , who he never knew , was a pitman .
his father was too , working in the late ' 50s during the industry 's heyday , when the ruhr area was a cauldron of smokestacks , steel factories and rumbling hard-coal conveyor belts which fed them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mine workers leave the elevator at the mine in voerde mining was in his blood , and really was all he ever knew , or saw .
miners lived mostly together in settlements often not far from the pits .
after the gritty shifts spent together far underground , miners would often spend their free time together and raise their families next door to one another . " the hard work underground welded us together , you could say , " said henschen .
" we respect one another , have to depend on one another .
it 's not like in other jobs . " miners , he said , are part of a tightly knit social fabric that is unraveling because of government decisions he thinks are wrong .
but that fabric has already been badly frayed by layoffs .
today there are 34,000 miners , down from 607,000 in 1970 . engine of integration ali sen , 39 , is in his 24th year as a miner , but is now spending time above ground in the public relations office of dsk , the company which manages germany 's remaining hard-coal mines , learning another side of the business , one that might have more of a future . his father was a miner in turkey before coming to germany as a so-called " guest worker , " bringing his family over when sen was two .
the strong sense of social cohesion among miners extended to relations between turks and germans , according to sen. while the integration of germany 's large turkish community into the large society is still seen as problematic , sen said with miners , ethnicity was never an issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long history : miners in 1880 " i do n't think these groups get along anywhere in german better than in the ruhr region , " he said .
" we live side by side , play together in soccer clubs , it 's exemplary . " both he and henschen said closing mines could further weaken the ruhr area 's economy - the mine in voerde , where they both work , is scheduled to close next year .
other businesses in the area , some of which depend on miners ' patronage , will suffer . " where mines have been closed , you notice the neighborhoods that bore the brunt of it have n't bounced back even after 20 or 30 years , " sen said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the return of religion in search of germany 's religious identity ex-muslims demand right to renounce islamic faith promises of miracles attract millions to nigeria 's churches most european nations keep god out of constitution religion -pipe- 10.09.2007 theologian küng : christianity gets on many people 's nerves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : küng : religion can co-exist with democracy for catholic theologian hans küng , religion has again become a power factor .
while islam and buddhism are getting more popular , christianity is n't .
the controversial theologian spoke to dw-world.de about the reasons . born in 1928 , catholic theologian and church critic hans küng made his mark as a promoter of dialogue between religions and as president of the global ethic foundation .
in 1979 , the vatican withdrew his license to teach after the swiss native questioned the infallibility of the pope .
in the fall of 2005 , pope benedict xvi invited küng to a private meeting .
dw-world.de : professor küng , people - and not only in germany - are again enormously interested in religious issues .
can we speak of a return of religions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran in 1979 : ayatollah chomeini is back from exile hans küng : " return of religions " - that is an ambivalent term .
religion never disappeared .
just like music , religion is something that stays , even if it is suppressed for some time .
it is true , that since the new awakening of islam , since the creation of the islamic republic of iran in 1979 , europeans have realized that they do n't rule the world by themselves .
for a long time , secular europe had not realized that it was an exception , and that elsewhere , religions is a power .
" no peace among the nations , without peace between the religions !
no peace between the religions without dialog between the religions ! "
those are two central sentences of your world ethic principle .
in a time of globalization , there are many undreamed-of possibilities for communication on the internet .
the access to knowledge is easier than ever before .
can this development improve the dialog of religions ?
in principle , i would say yes , even though this brings many problems .
it 's a positive thing that today we can know a lot about other religions .
a different question , of course , is whether we do want to be in the know .
there are people who do n't - they already know everything , without studying the islam .
who does n't want to know ?
for one , the fundamental christians who take everything the bible says literally and say they do n't need any other religions .
then there are the very secular people , dogmatists of laicism .
they get worked up simply when the word religion is mentioned , and they think that we should not talk about it in schools .
they have issues with the fact that religion , again , is a powerful factor in world history .
according to a survey , not christianity but buddhism is the most likeable religion for germans .
how do you explain that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .
it is a religion that 's turned to the inside and that emphasizes meditation .
it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .
of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .
even though islam is seen skeptically throughout europe , it attracts many , especially young people , around the globe .
there are 1.3 billion muslims , with an upward trend .
from rabat to damascus there are islamic groups that are becoming increasingly important politically .
why is that so ?
are there religious or social reasons for this ?
both .
those are religious groups that help people .
many muslims in those countries feel that the ruling elites have a life of their own and do n't take care of the population at large .
the fundamental islamist groups - or whatever you want to call them - try very hard to do something for people .
they take care of schools and education , and they give people clothes and food .
why did hamas win the elections -lsb- in the palestinian territories -rsb- ?
because they worked for the people .
one of the biggest mistakes of western politics - germany included , by the way - was to not accept those elections .
instead , fingers were pointed , saying : " you have to accept israel ! "
tell that to people that have been terrorized by an occupying power for decades .
that is not the right way to solve those problems .
you have to realize that there are parties that do have islam as a basis , yet they campaign for the people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate young muslims make themselves available for terrorist attacks a better example is the party of prime minister erdogan in turkey .
why did they win ?
because they helped people .
they showed - with all weaknesses that they have - that they will bring their country forward and in no way did they develop an islamic theocracy , such as the one in iran .
they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .
how far would the willingness to negotiate with the radical powers have to go ?
would one have to negotiate with the taliban and al qaeda as well ?
you can not negotiate with al qaeda .
it is a secret terrorist group .
you can only dry them up .
but the west has watered them so much that they could sprout .
the american secret service recently admitted in secret documents that the iraq war only helped al qaeda .
before , there was no al qaeda in iraq .
you could certainly negotiate with the taliban .
they are n't just crazy people .
there are some extremists , and there are , on the other hand , those that warned the bush administration about sept .

but it was n't taken seriously .
there were chieftains in afghanistan that warned against marching in with an army .

if you look back , are you still as optimistic as you were in 1990 when you wrote " global responsibility : in search of a new world ethic " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen after bush ?
when i wrote the book in 1990 , of course , one hoped that in the future , problems would not be solved with military means , with aggression and animosity and war , but instead - just like it worked in western and eastern europe - through mutual understanding , cooperation and integration .
unfortunately , this was disrupted by the mad policies that the second bush administration initiated with a clique of archconservative jewish intellectuals , so-called neocons and protestant fundamentalists .
i am not an enemy , but a friend of the americans .
i hope that , despite the backlash that the policies of bush jr. brought on , americans can remember their great democratic tradition and lead in terms of international understanding , moderation and world peace .
were you hurt that pope benedict xvi never accepted your idea of the world ethic ?
he accepted the idea as such .
he realizes that there have to be common ethical standards .

while islam and buddhism are getting more popular , christianity is n't .
the controversial theologian spoke to dw-world.de about the reasons . born in 1928 , catholic theologian and church critic hans küng made his mark as a promoter of dialogue between religions and as president of the global ethic foundation .
in 1979 , the vatican withdrew his license to teach after the swiss native questioned the infallibility of the pope .
in the fall of 2005 , pope benedict xvi invited küng to a private meeting .
dw-world.de : professor küng , people - and not only in germany - are again enormously interested in religious issues .
can we speak of a return of religions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran in 1979 : ayatollah chomeini is back from exile hans küng : " return of religions " - that is an ambivalent term .
religion never disappeared .
just like music , religion is something that stays , even if it is suppressed for some time .
it is true , that since the new awakening of islam , since the creation of the islamic republic of iran in 1979 , europeans have realized that they do n't rule the world by themselves .
for a long time , secular europe had not realized that it was an exception , and that elsewhere , religions is a power .
" no peace among the nations , without peace between the religions !
no peace between the religions without dialog between the religions ! "
those are two central sentences of your world ethic principle .
in a time of globalization , there are many undreamed-of possibilities for communication on the internet .
the access to knowledge is easier than ever before .
can this development improve the dialog of religions ?
in principle , i would say yes , even though this brings many problems .
it 's a positive thing that today we can know a lot about other religions .
a different question , of course , is whether we do want to be in the know .
there are people who do n't - they already know everything , without studying the islam .
who does n't want to know ?
for one , the fundamental christians who take everything the bible says literally and say they do n't need any other religions .
then there are the very secular people , dogmatists of laicism .
they get worked up simply when the word religion is mentioned , and they think that we should not talk about it in schools .
they have issues with the fact that religion , again , is a powerful factor in world history .
according to a survey , not christianity but buddhism is the most likeable religion for germans .
how do you explain that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .
it is a religion that 's turned to the inside and that emphasizes meditation .
it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .
of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .

for miners , it means a beloved tradition and a way of life is coming to an end . on a recent wednesday morning , benno henschen 's alarm clock went off at 3:10 a.m.
he drove 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- to a non-descript complex of buildings near the leafy small town of voerde , changed into his work clothes , and promptly descended 820 meters -lrb- 2,690 feet -rrb- under the earth . it is the start of the early shift for henschen , 49 , who will spend the next seven hours overseeing the machines that extract the hard coal that turned this region in western germany , near the ruhr and rhine rivers , into germany 's industrial heartland and powered its comeback from the ashes of world war ii . " i have always loved being a miner , and i still do , " said henschen , who was just 14 when he went down into his first mining pit .
" but i 'm worried about the future . " henschen is a member of a profession whose days appear limited in germany .
while there were once over 100 pits at the hard-coal mining industry 's peak in the 1950s , today there are only eight such mines left in germany .
the ruhr region 's centuries-old mining history means it is necessary to go further and further underground to reach unexhausted coal seams .
stringent safety measures and high-labor costs have also added to the cost of german hard coal .
at around 180 euros -lrb- $ 248 -rrb- per ton , it costs more than three times the global market price . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun is setting on the german hard-coal mining industry but for decades , german lawmakers have propped up the industry with large-scale subsidies .
right now , federal and regional governments pump 2.5 billion euros a year into hard-coal mining . " the markets are international , our energy supplies are secure , and so there 's no reason to use public money to subsidize hard-coal mining , " said oliver wittke , minister for building and transport for the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the ruhr region , and henschen 's mine , are located .
" it is far too expensive . " but to henschen , the bottom line should not be the only consideration . " expensive is not always the most costly , " he said .
to him , what germany will be giving up when the mines close has a value that you ca n't put a euro-sign on . family tradition henschen is the third generation in his family to go into mining .
his grandfather , who he never knew , was a pitman .
his father was too , working in the late ' 50s during the industry 's heyday , when the ruhr area was a cauldron of smokestacks , steel factories and rumbling hard-coal conveyor belts which fed them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal mine workers leave the elevator at the mine in voerde mining was in his blood , and really was all he ever knew , or saw .
miners lived mostly together in settlements often not far from the pits .
after the gritty shifts spent together far underground , miners would often spend their free time together and raise their families next door to one another . " the hard work underground welded us together , you could say , " said henschen .
" we respect one another , have to depend on one another .
it 's not like in other jobs . " miners , he said , are part of a tightly knit social fabric that is unraveling because of government decisions he thinks are wrong .
but that fabric has already been badly frayed by layoffs .
today there are 34,000 miners , down from 607,000 in 1970 . engine of integration ali sen , 39 , is in his 24th year as a miner , but is now spending time above ground in the public relations office of dsk , the company which manages germany 's remaining hard-coal mines , learning another side of the business , one that might have more of a future . his father was a miner in turkey before coming to germany as a so-called " guest worker , " bringing his family over when sen was two .
the strong sense of social cohesion among miners extended to relations between turks and germans , according to sen. while the integration of germany 's large turkish community into the large society is still seen as problematic , sen said with miners , ethnicity was never an issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long history : miners in 1880 " i do n't think these groups get along anywhere in german better than in the ruhr region , " he said .
" we live side by side , play together in soccer clubs , it 's exemplary . " both he and henschen said closing mines could further weaken the ruhr area 's economy - the mine in voerde , where they both work , is scheduled to close next year .
other businesses in the area , some of which depend on miners ' patronage , will suffer . " where mines have been closed , you notice the neighborhoods that bore the brunt of it have n't bounced back even after 20 or 30 years , " sen said .
" they might not quite be ghettos , but stores are closed and people do n't have money to buy . " structural change the ruhr region 's economy has been hard hit by the progressive shuttering of its heavy industry since the 1960s and successive waves of large-scale layoffs .
by the end of the 1990s , the once prosperous region had turned into a landscape of rusting industrial ruins , environmental degradation and dwindling hopes .
unemployment once reached 19 percent , although that number now stands at 14.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a light show at the repurposed mining tower , zollverein the region is now embarking on an economic redevelopment program that sees it moving away from heavy industry like steel and coal and toward the logistics , chemicals and service sectors .
the region will be one of europe 's cultural capitals for 2010 , and some of its industrial skeletons , like unused mining shaft towers , deserted factories , and silo-like gasometers , have already been turned into cultural spaces for exhibitions or performances . much ado about little ? some argue that miners ' complaints are exaggerated .
the agreement on ending the subsidies provides a " soft landing " for the workers and the federal and state governments will spend an estimated 21.6 billion euros over the next 11 years .
options for miners include retraining programs , job-search help , and start-up money for those wishing to become self-employed .
those who have 25 years underground can retire at 49 . " we are doing a lot for our miners , " said christof beike , a spokesman for dsk . but for those like henschen , used to the security mining once brought , that is cold comfort .
and even more then the end of an industry , it 's the end of a tradition and a life that might have been hard on the body , but was good for the soul . " now families are losing their bearings and the solidarity of our communities is being pulled apart , " he said .
" i think that 's a shame . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while islam and buddhism are getting more popular , christianity is n't .
the controversial theologian spoke to dw-world.de about the reasons . born in 1928 , catholic theologian and church critic hans küng made his mark as a promoter of dialogue between religions and as president of the global ethic foundation .
in 1979 , the vatican withdrew his license to teach after the swiss native questioned the infallibility of the pope .
in the fall of 2005 , pope benedict xvi invited küng to a private meeting .
dw-world.de : professor küng , people - and not only in germany - are again enormously interested in religious issues .
can we speak of a return of religions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran in 1979 : ayatollah chomeini is back from exile hans küng : " return of religions " - that is an ambivalent term .
religion never disappeared .
just like music , religion is something that stays , even if it is suppressed for some time .
it is true , that since the new awakening of islam , since the creation of the islamic republic of iran in 1979 , europeans have realized that they do n't rule the world by themselves .
for a long time , secular europe had not realized that it was an exception , and that elsewhere , religions is a power .
" no peace among the nations , without peace between the religions !
no peace between the religions without dialog between the religions ! "
those are two central sentences of your world ethic principle .
in a time of globalization , there are many undreamed-of possibilities for communication on the internet .
the access to knowledge is easier than ever before .
can this development improve the dialog of religions ?
in principle , i would say yes , even though this brings many problems .
it 's a positive thing that today we can know a lot about other religions .
a different question , of course , is whether we do want to be in the know .
there are people who do n't - they already know everything , without studying the islam .
who does n't want to know ?
for one , the fundamental christians who take everything the bible says literally and say they do n't need any other religions .
then there are the very secular people , dogmatists of laicism .
they get worked up simply when the word religion is mentioned , and they think that we should not talk about it in schools .
they have issues with the fact that religion , again , is a powerful factor in world history .
according to a survey , not christianity but buddhism is the most likeable religion for germans .
how do you explain that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .
it is a religion that 's turned to the inside and that emphasizes meditation .
it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .
of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .
even though islam is seen skeptically throughout europe , it attracts many , especially young people , around the globe .
there are 1.3 billion muslims , with an upward trend .
from rabat to damascus there are islamic groups that are becoming increasingly important politically .
why is that so ?
are there religious or social reasons for this ?
both .
those are religious groups that help people .
many muslims in those countries feel that the ruling elites have a life of their own and do n't take care of the population at large .
the fundamental islamist groups - or whatever you want to call them - try very hard to do something for people .
they take care of schools and education , and they give people clothes and food .
why did hamas win the elections -lsb- in the palestinian territories -rsb- ?
because they worked for the people .
one of the biggest mistakes of western politics - germany included , by the way - was to not accept those elections .
instead , fingers were pointed , saying : " you have to accept israel ! "
tell that to people that have been terrorized by an occupying power for decades .
that is not the right way to solve those problems .
you have to realize that there are parties that do have islam as a basis , yet they campaign for the people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate young muslims make themselves available for terrorist attacks a better example is the party of prime minister erdogan in turkey .
why did they win ?
because they helped people .
they showed - with all weaknesses that they have - that they will bring their country forward and in no way did they develop an islamic theocracy , such as the one in iran .
they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .
how far would the willingness to negotiate with the radical powers have to go ?
would one have to negotiate with the taliban and al qaeda as well ?
you can not negotiate with al qaeda .
it is a secret terrorist group .
you can only dry them up .
but the west has watered them so much that they could sprout .
the american secret service recently admitted in secret documents that the iraq war only helped al qaeda .
before , there was no al qaeda in iraq .
you could certainly negotiate with the taliban .
they are n't just crazy people .
there are some extremists , and there are , on the other hand , those that warned the bush administration about sept .
11 .
but it was n't taken seriously .
there were chieftains in afghanistan that warned against marching in with an army .
a personal question : on sept .
12 you will introduce your autobiography " controversial truth . "
if you look back , are you still as optimistic as you were in 1990 when you wrote " global responsibility : in search of a new world ethic " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen after bush ?
when i wrote the book in 1990 , of course , one hoped that in the future , problems would not be solved with military means , with aggression and animosity and war , but instead - just like it worked in western and eastern europe - through mutual understanding , cooperation and integration .
unfortunately , this was disrupted by the mad policies that the second bush administration initiated with a clique of archconservative jewish intellectuals , so-called neocons and protestant fundamentalists .
i am not an enemy , but a friend of the americans .
i hope that , despite the backlash that the policies of bush jr. brought on , americans can remember their great democratic tradition and lead in terms of international understanding , moderation and world peace .
were you hurt that pope benedict xvi never accepted your idea of the world ethic ?
he accepted the idea as such .
he realizes that there have to be common ethical standards .
during our conversation he conceded that those standards need to be valid for believers and non-believers .
one could only have expected that he would personally advocate this .
but that might still happen . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran in 1979 : ayatollah chomeini is back from exile hans küng : " return of religions " - that is an ambivalent term .
religion never disappeared .
just like music , religion is something that stays , even if it is suppressed for some time .
it is true , that since the new awakening of islam , since the creation of the islamic republic of iran in 1979 , europeans have realized that they do n't rule the world by themselves .
for a long time , secular europe had not realized that it was an exception , and that elsewhere , religions is a power .
" no peace among the nations , without peace between the religions !
no peace between the religions without dialog between the religions ! "
those are two central sentences of your world ethic principle .
in a time of globalization , there are many undreamed-of possibilities for communication on the internet .
the access to knowledge is easier than ever before .
can this development improve the dialog of religions ?
in principle , i would say yes , even though this brings many problems .
it 's a positive thing that today we can know a lot about other religions .
a different question , of course , is whether we do want to be in the know .
there are people who do n't - they already know everything , without studying the islam .
who does n't want to know ?
for one , the fundamental christians who take everything the bible says literally and say they do n't need any other religions .
then there are the very secular people , dogmatists of laicism .
they get worked up simply when the word religion is mentioned , and they think that we should not talk about it in schools .
they have issues with the fact that religion , again , is a powerful factor in world history .
according to a survey , not christianity but buddhism is the most likeable religion for germans .
how do you explain that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .
it is a religion that 's turned to the inside and that emphasizes meditation .
it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .
of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .
even though islam is seen skeptically throughout europe , it attracts many , especially young people , around the globe .
there are 1.3 billion muslims , with an upward trend .
from rabat to damascus there are islamic groups that are becoming increasingly important politically .
why is that so ?
are there religious or social reasons for this ?
both .
those are religious groups that help people .
many muslims in those countries feel that the ruling elites have a life of their own and do n't take care of the population at large .
the fundamental islamist groups - or whatever you want to call them - try very hard to do something for people .
they take care of schools and education , and they give people clothes and food .
why did hamas win the elections -lsb- in the palestinian territories -rsb- ?
because they worked for the people .
one of the biggest mistakes of western politics - germany included , by the way - was to not accept those elections .
instead , fingers were pointed , saying : " you have to accept israel ! "
tell that to people that have been terrorized by an occupying power for decades .
that is not the right way to solve those problems .
you have to realize that there are parties that do have islam as a basis , yet they campaign for the people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate young muslims make themselves available for terrorist attacks a better example is the party of prime minister erdogan in turkey .
why did they win ?
because they helped people .
they showed - with all weaknesses that they have - that they will bring their country forward and in no way did they develop an islamic theocracy , such as the one in iran .
they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .
how far would the willingness to negotiate with the radical powers have to go ?
would one have to negotiate with the taliban and al qaeda as well ?
you can not negotiate with al qaeda .
it is a secret terrorist group .
you can only dry them up .
but the west has watered them so much that they could sprout .
the american secret service recently admitted in secret documents that the iraq war only helped al qaeda .
before , there was no al qaeda in iraq .
you could certainly negotiate with the taliban .
they are n't just crazy people .
there are some extremists , and there are , on the other hand , those that warned the bush administration about sept .
11 .
but it was n't taken seriously .
there were chieftains in afghanistan that warned against marching in with an army .
a personal question : on sept .
12 you will introduce your autobiography " controversial truth . "
if you look back , are you still as optimistic as you were in 1990 when you wrote " global responsibility : in search of a new world ethic " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen after bush ?
when i wrote the book in 1990 , of course , one hoped that in the future , problems would not be solved with military means , with aggression and animosity and war , but instead - just like it worked in western and eastern europe - through mutual understanding , cooperation and integration .
unfortunately , this was disrupted by the mad policies that the second bush administration initiated with a clique of archconservative jewish intellectuals , so-called neocons and protestant fundamentalists .
i am not an enemy , but a friend of the americans .
i hope that , despite the backlash that the policies of bush jr. brought on , americans can remember their great democratic tradition and lead in terms of international understanding , moderation and world peace .
were you hurt that pope benedict xvi never accepted your idea of the world ethic ?
he accepted the idea as such .
he realizes that there have to be common ethical standards .
during our conversation he conceded that those standards need to be valid for believers and non-believers .
one could only have expected that he would personally advocate this .

it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .
of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .
even though islam is seen skeptically throughout europe , it attracts many , especially young people , around the globe .
there are 1.3 billion muslims , with an upward trend .
from rabat to damascus there are islamic groups that are becoming increasingly important politically .
why is that so ?
are there religious or social reasons for this ?
both .
those are religious groups that help people .
many muslims in those countries feel that the ruling elites have a life of their own and do n't take care of the population at large .
the fundamental islamist groups - or whatever you want to call them - try very hard to do something for people .
they take care of schools and education , and they give people clothes and food .
why did hamas win the elections -lsb- in the palestinian territories -rsb- ?
because they worked for the people .
one of the biggest mistakes of western politics - germany included , by the way - was to not accept those elections .
instead , fingers were pointed , saying : " you have to accept israel ! "
tell that to people that have been terrorized by an occupying power for decades .
that is not the right way to solve those problems .
you have to realize that there are parties that do have islam as a basis , yet they campaign for the people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate young muslims make themselves available for terrorist attacks a better example is the party of prime minister erdogan in turkey .
why did they win ?
because they helped people .
they showed - with all weaknesses that they have - that they will bring their country forward and in no way did they develop an islamic theocracy , such as the one in iran .
they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .
how far would the willingness to negotiate with the radical powers have to go ?
would one have to negotiate with the taliban and al qaeda as well ?
you can not negotiate with al qaeda .
it is a secret terrorist group .
you can only dry them up .
but the west has watered them so much that they could sprout .
the american secret service recently admitted in secret documents that the iraq war only helped al qaeda .
before , there was no al qaeda in iraq .
you could certainly negotiate with the taliban .
they are n't just crazy people .
there are some extremists , and there are , on the other hand , those that warned the bush administration about sept .
11 .
but it was n't taken seriously .
there were chieftains in afghanistan that warned against marching in with an army .
a personal question : on sept .
12 you will introduce your autobiography " controversial truth . "
if you look back , are you still as optimistic as you were in 1990 when you wrote " global responsibility : in search of a new world ethic " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen after bush ?
when i wrote the book in 1990 , of course , one hoped that in the future , problems would not be solved with military means , with aggression and animosity and war , but instead - just like it worked in western and eastern europe - through mutual understanding , cooperation and integration .
unfortunately , this was disrupted by the mad policies that the second bush administration initiated with a clique of archconservative jewish intellectuals , so-called neocons and protestant fundamentalists .
i am not an enemy , but a friend of the americans .
i hope that , despite the backlash that the policies of bush jr. brought on , americans can remember their great democratic tradition and lead in terms of international understanding , moderation and world peace .
were you hurt that pope benedict xvi never accepted your idea of the world ethic ?
he accepted the idea as such .
he realizes that there have to be common ethical standards .
during our conversation he conceded that those standards need to be valid for believers and non-believers .
one could only have expected that he would personally advocate this .
but that might still happen . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while islam and buddhism are getting more popular , christianity is n't .
the controversial theologian spoke to dw-world.de about the reasons . born in 1928 , catholic theologian and church critic hans küng made his mark as a promoter of dialogue between religions and as president of the global ethic foundation .
in 1979 , the vatican withdrew his license to teach after the swiss native questioned the infallibility of the pope .
in the fall of 2005 , pope benedict xvi invited küng to a private meeting .
dw-world.de : professor küng , people - and not only in germany - are again enormously interested in religious issues .
can we speak of a return of religions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran in 1979 : ayatollah chomeini is back from exile hans küng : " return of religions " - that is an ambivalent term .
religion never disappeared .
just like music , religion is something that stays , even if it is suppressed for some time .
it is true , that since the new awakening of islam , since the creation of the islamic republic of iran in 1979 , europeans have realized that they do n't rule the world by themselves .
for a long time , secular europe had not realized that it was an exception , and that elsewhere , religions is a power .
" no peace among the nations , without peace between the religions !
no peace between the religions without dialog between the religions ! "
those are two central sentences of your world ethic principle .
in a time of globalization , there are many undreamed-of possibilities for communication on the internet .
the access to knowledge is easier than ever before .
can this development improve the dialog of religions ?
in principle , i would say yes , even though this brings many problems .
it 's a positive thing that today we can know a lot about other religions .
a different question , of course , is whether we do want to be in the know .
there are people who do n't - they already know everything , without studying the islam .
who does n't want to know ?
for one , the fundamental christians who take everything the bible says literally and say they do n't need any other religions .
then there are the very secular people , dogmatists of laicism .
they get worked up simply when the word religion is mentioned , and they think that we should not talk about it in schools .
they have issues with the fact that religion , again , is a powerful factor in world history .
according to a survey , not christianity but buddhism is the most likeable religion for germans .
how do you explain that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .

you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .
even though islam is seen skeptically throughout europe , it attracts many , especially young people , around the globe .
there are 1.3 billion muslims , with an upward trend .
from rabat to damascus there are islamic groups that are becoming increasingly important politically .
why is that so ?
are there religious or social reasons for this ?
both .
those are religious groups that help people .
many muslims in those countries feel that the ruling elites have a life of their own and do n't take care of the population at large .
the fundamental islamist groups - or whatever you want to call them - try very hard to do something for people .
they take care of schools and education , and they give people clothes and food .
why did hamas win the elections -lsb- in the palestinian territories -rsb- ?
because they worked for the people .
one of the biggest mistakes of western politics - germany included , by the way - was to not accept those elections .
instead , fingers were pointed , saying : " you have to accept israel ! "
tell that to people that have been terrorized by an occupying power for decades .
that is not the right way to solve those problems .
you have to realize that there are parties that do have islam as a basis , yet they campaign for the people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate young muslims make themselves available for terrorist attacks a better example is the party of prime minister erdogan in turkey .
why did they win ?
because they helped people .
they showed - with all weaknesses that they have - that they will bring their country forward and in no way did they develop an islamic theocracy , such as the one in iran .
they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .
how far would the willingness to negotiate with the radical powers have to go ?
would one have to negotiate with the taliban and al qaeda as well ?
you can not negotiate with al qaeda .
it is a secret terrorist group .
you can only dry them up .
but the west has watered them so much that they could sprout .
the american secret service recently admitted in secret documents that the iraq war only helped al qaeda .
before , there was no al qaeda in iraq .
you could certainly negotiate with the taliban .
they are n't just crazy people .
there are some extremists , and there are , on the other hand , those that warned the bush administration about sept .
11 .
but it was n't taken seriously .
there were chieftains in afghanistan that warned against marching in with an army .
a personal question : on sept .
12 you will introduce your autobiography " controversial truth . "
if you look back , are you still as optimistic as you were in 1990 when you wrote " global responsibility : in search of a new world ethic " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen after bush ?
when i wrote the book in 1990 , of course , one hoped that in the future , problems would not be solved with military means , with aggression and animosity and war , but instead - just like it worked in western and eastern europe - through mutual understanding , cooperation and integration .
unfortunately , this was disrupted by the mad policies that the second bush administration initiated with a clique of archconservative jewish intellectuals , so-called neocons and protestant fundamentalists .
i am not an enemy , but a friend of the americans .
i hope that , despite the backlash that the policies of bush jr. brought on , americans can remember their great democratic tradition and lead in terms of international understanding , moderation and world peace .
were you hurt that pope benedict xvi never accepted your idea of the world ethic ?
he accepted the idea as such .
he realizes that there have to be common ethical standards .
during our conversation he conceded that those standards need to be valid for believers and non-believers .
one could only have expected that he would personally advocate this .
but that might still happen . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while islam and buddhism are getting more popular , christianity is n't .
the controversial theologian spoke to dw-world.de about the reasons . born in 1928 , catholic theologian and church critic hans küng made his mark as a promoter of dialogue between religions and as president of the global ethic foundation .
in 1979 , the vatican withdrew his license to teach after the swiss native questioned the infallibility of the pope .
in the fall of 2005 , pope benedict xvi invited küng to a private meeting .
dw-world.de : professor küng , people - and not only in germany - are again enormously interested in religious issues .
can we speak of a return of religions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teheran in 1979 : ayatollah chomeini is back from exile hans küng : " return of religions " - that is an ambivalent term .
religion never disappeared .
just like music , religion is something that stays , even if it is suppressed for some time .
it is true , that since the new awakening of islam , since the creation of the islamic republic of iran in 1979 , europeans have realized that they do n't rule the world by themselves .
for a long time , secular europe had not realized that it was an exception , and that elsewhere , religions is a power .
" no peace among the nations , without peace between the religions !
no peace between the religions without dialog between the religions ! "
those are two central sentences of your world ethic principle .
in a time of globalization , there are many undreamed-of possibilities for communication on the internet .
the access to knowledge is easier than ever before .
can this development improve the dialog of religions ?
in principle , i would say yes , even though this brings many problems .
it 's a positive thing that today we can know a lot about other religions .
a different question , of course , is whether we do want to be in the know .
there are people who do n't - they already know everything , without studying the islam .
who does n't want to know ?
for one , the fundamental christians who take everything the bible says literally and say they do n't need any other religions .
then there are the very secular people , dogmatists of laicism .
they get worked up simply when the word religion is mentioned , and they think that we should not talk about it in schools .
they have issues with the fact that religion , again , is a powerful factor in world history .
according to a survey , not christianity but buddhism is the most likeable religion for germans .
how do you explain that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is a role model for many westerners buddhism , in the west , is perceived as being free from dogmas , as a religion without many rules .
it is a religion that 's turned to the inside and that emphasizes meditation .
it is a religion , which has no anthropomorphic , concrete picture of the last reality .
the other is that christianity - with its concentration of power - gets on many people 's nerves .
when we have a pope , who claims that - as theological lord of the world - only those who are with him are true christians and that only his roman-catholic church is the true church , it gets on many people 's nerves .
even though they do n't protest publicly , they will turn away and say they do n't want to have anything to do with that .
let 's get back to islam , and to the question about the most peaceful religion : buddhism leads with 43 percent , before christianity with 41 percent .
islam only has one percent of people naming it as the most peaceful religion .
is islam viewed as the enemy in the west ?
yes , islam is definitely viewed as an enemy in the west , because the west only concentrates on certain points of islam .
it was like that in the past .
europeans look at it from the view of islam 's advancement from northern africa to spain , between the eighth and 15th century and the leadership of the ottomans on the balkan .
they do n't see that christians not only had the crusades , but until the 19th century they colonized the entire islamic area from morocco to the indonesian islands .
that leads to tensions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six day war continues to have an effect today the west did not resolve many of those tensions .
that 's especially true for the relationship between the palestinians and israel .
had they made peace after the six-day war in 1967 , there would have never been a bin laden and neither would there have been attacks on the world trade center in 2001 .
instead , a feeling spread that westerners even settled in the holy arabic lands , made themselves comfortable in afghanistan , and everywhere else they pushed to the front , so that defense forces were created .
desperate young people resorted to terrorism .
of course we have to judge suicide assassins and assaults .
but we have to think about why so many young people became so desperate to make themselves available for such assassinations .
could the catholic church better contribute to the resolution of these conflicts and to the dialog between the religions ?
one has to say at least that john paul ii clearly rejected the iraq war , just like the patriarch in moscow , the archbishop of canterbury , the world council of churches as well as the national council of churches usa .
unlike in previous times , it 's no longer easy to get churches excited about war .
of course more could be done , especially when it comes to enlightenment .
when the pope in -lsb- a much-publicized 2006 speech in the bavarian town of -rsb- regensburg tried to define islam as a religion of violence , he noticed himself that he took the wrong path .
you have to remember the kind of trails of blood christians left in history .
then you become modest , and you wo n't say that we have the religion of love and they have the religion of hate .
just like you and me , the majority of muslims in egypt , morocco , afghanistan or pakistan want to have peace .
do you think that pope benedict sees his speech in regensburg as a mistake ?
it does n't really seem that he distanced himself much from it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has a hard time admitting mistakes he did notice that it was a mistake , and he had to take in quite a bit of criticism .
he corrected his speech many times .
the romans , the roman bishop , i.e. the pope , have a hard time admitting mistakes .
when you have an ideology of infallibility , then infallible mistakes will be made , and those can not be corrected .
it was clear that the pope tried hard during his trip to turkey to improve the bad image that he had due to the speech in regensburg .
even though islam is seen skeptically throughout europe , it attracts many , especially young people , around the globe .
there are 1.3 billion muslims , with an upward trend .
from rabat to damascus there are islamic groups that are becoming increasingly important politically .
why is that so ?
are there religious or social reasons for this ?
both .
those are religious groups that help people .
many muslims in those countries feel that the ruling elites have a life of their own and do n't take care of the population at large .
the fundamental islamist groups - or whatever you want to call them - try very hard to do something for people .
they take care of schools and education , and they give people clothes and food .
why did hamas win the elections -lsb- in the palestinian territories -rsb- ?
because they worked for the people .
one of the biggest mistakes of western politics - germany included , by the way - was to not accept those elections .
instead , fingers were pointed , saying : " you have to accept israel ! "
tell that to people that have been terrorized by an occupying power for decades .
that is not the right way to solve those problems .
you have to realize that there are parties that do have islam as a basis , yet they campaign for the people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desperate young muslims make themselves available for terrorist attacks a better example is the party of prime minister erdogan in turkey .
why did they win ?
because they helped people .
they showed - with all weaknesses that they have - that they will bring their country forward and in no way did they develop an islamic theocracy , such as the one in iran .
they want a democracy , but they do n't want to limit islam to the private sphere , as atatürk did .
you once called turkey the " laboratory for democracy . "
can faith and religion co-exist with democracy ?
religion can co-exist with democracy .
the leading architects of europe , from charles de gaulle and konrad adenauer to robert schuman and alcide de gasperi , were all pious christians .
the reason why islam has more problems with democracy than christianity is that islam , in contrast to christianity and judaism , had no reformation and enlightenment , leaving out a few special circles .
if you want to help there , you have to support the moderate powers and isolate the radical ones .
the most foolish thing to do is to go against those people with armies .
that 's as stupid as going against the mafia with fighter jets .
how far would the willingness to negotiate with the radical powers have to go ?
would one have to negotiate with the taliban and al qaeda as well ?
you can not negotiate with al qaeda .
it is a secret terrorist group .
you can only dry them up .
but the west has watered them so much that they could sprout .
the american secret service recently admitted in secret documents that the iraq war only helped al qaeda .
before , there was no al qaeda in iraq .
you could certainly negotiate with the taliban .
they are n't just crazy people .
there are some extremists , and there are , on the other hand , those that warned the bush administration about sept .
11 .
but it was n't taken seriously .
there were chieftains in afghanistan that warned against marching in with an army .
a personal question : on sept .
12 you will introduce your autobiography " controversial truth . "
if you look back , are you still as optimistic as you were in 1990 when you wrote " global responsibility : in search of a new world ethic " ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will happen after bush ?
when i wrote the book in 1990 , of course , one hoped that in the future , problems would not be solved with military means , with aggression and animosity and war , but instead - just like it worked in western and eastern europe - through mutual understanding , cooperation and integration .
unfortunately , this was disrupted by the mad policies that the second bush administration initiated with a clique of archconservative jewish intellectuals , so-called neocons and protestant fundamentalists .
i am not an enemy , but a friend of the americans .
i hope that , despite the backlash that the policies of bush jr. brought on , americans can remember their great democratic tradition and lead in terms of international understanding , moderation and world peace .
were you hurt that pope benedict xvi never accepted your idea of the world ethic ?
he accepted the idea as such .
he realizes that there have to be common ethical standards .
during our conversation he conceded that those standards need to be valid for believers and non-believers .
one could only have expected that he would personally advocate this .
but that might still happen . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gabriel said the united nations climate conference being held in bali in december should provide the " starting signal " for comprehensive talks on a new climate agreement for the period after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol runs out .
this had to contain a long-term goal , ambitious and obligatory commitments from the industrialized world , and fair contributions from the larger developing countries , he said .
" under the gleneagles dialogue we are working at making investment in climate protection technologies more attractive , " gabriel said .
the gleneagles dialogue was set up at the g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland in 2005 .
apart from the g8 - the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , canada , italy and russia - large developing economies like china , brazil and australia are also participating .
the first day of the conference ended with many delegates making positive noises about the possible outcome of the two-day meeting .

on the other side of the argument , the industrialized nations point to new powerhouses like china and india , saying that pollution problems there are home-made .
attending the conference in berlin , gro harlem brundtland , the un special envoy on climate change , spoke of this " deep-rooted lack of trust between the industrialized and developing countries . "
" many industrialized countries believe that the developing countries are unwilling and that they are doing too little , " the former norwegian prime minister and world health organization head said .
" many developing countries believe that the industrialized world has defaulted on the promise of financial and technology assistance , " she added .
industrialized nations urged to cut emissions the global leadership for climate action , comprising former prominent leaders , called for industrialized countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent over the period 1990 to 2050 .
the united states should commit itself to this goal , said the organization 's presidents , former chilean president ricardo lagos and the president of the un foundation , former us senator timothy e wirth .
the organization also stated that major developing countries like china and india should cut their energy use by 30 per cent by 2020 as a first step .
from 2021 these countries should commit themselves to binding emission targets .

german environment minister sigmar gabriel admitted that the negotiations will be far from easy .
" here in germany , you know how difficult it is to reach a consensus on sensitive issues among our 16 states , " he said .
" you can imagine what a hard task it is to find common ground among the over 200 nations involved in the climate protection process .
there ’ s not even agreement yet among the signatories to the kyoto protocol on reductions in co2 emissions that negotiations on a follow-up treaty are needed .

the nation 's four police forces say they will be clamping down on those who fail to buckle up .
the drive is being led by dyfed-powys police , who say those who ignore the law are endangering all on the roads .
officers say that wearing a seat belt increases the chance of surviving an accident by up to 60 % .
wearing a seat belt really could mean the difference between life and death - and that applies just as much to passengers as it does to drivers chief insp phil davies the campaign will be launched in llandrindod wells in conjunction with the powys community safety partnership .
a year ago there was a similar crackdown , and more than 3,000 people were caught .
the law states that drivers and adult passengers in the front seat of cars must wear a seat belt unless they have a medical exemption certificate .
seat belt timetable 1967 : the law says new cars in the uk must be fitted with front seat belts 1986 : a three-year trial period forcing drivers and front seat passengers to wear seat belts becomes permanent 1991 : compulsory for adults to belt up in the back .
2001 : seat belts required to be fitted to all minibuses and coaches adults in the rear must also use seat belts , if they are fitted in the car .
it is not the driver who has the responsibility of ensuring adults in the car are wearing seat belts , but the passengers themselves .
front seat belts became compulsory in 1983 , and the royal society for the prevention of accidents -lrb- rospa -rrb- has estimated that 50,000 lives have been saved .
dyfed-powys police chief insp phil davies said : " wearing a seat belt is such a simple , easy thing to do .
" as police officers , we see the consequences of driving without a seat belt all too often at crash scenes .
" while you will face a fine if you are caught without your seat belt on , the key message we are trying to get across is that wearing a seat belt really could mean the difference between life and death - and that applies just as much to passengers as it does to drivers . "

over-anxious parents , computer games and school tests are to blame , a letter signed by almost 300 academics , authors and charity leaders says .
the decline in " unstructured , loosely supervised " play is adversely affecting children 's mental health , they add .
it also threatens young people 's long-term development , the letter to the daily telegraph says .
' disturbing trend ' among the signatories are novelist philip pullman , director of the royal institution baroness susan greenfield and child care expert dr penelope leach .
more than 40 professors , 60 psychologists and psychotherapists , and leaders of the main children 's charities and teaching unions also lend their names to the letter . "

the letter says : " we believe that a key factor in this disturbing trend is the marked decline over the last 15 years in children 's play . "
the experts say that play - especially when it takes place outdoors - is crucial to a child 's health .
an increase in traffic , parental fears about abduction by strangers and a " test-driven " culture of education have all contributed to the trend , they insist .
they add that " the ready availability of sedentary , sometimes addictive screen-based entertainment and the aggressive marketing of over-elaborate , commercialised toys " have also played a part .
they call for a " wide-ranging and informed public dialogue about the intrinsic nature and value of play in children 's healthy development " .
the signatures were gathered by sue palmer , author of the book toxic childhood , and dr richard house , a senior lecturer in psychotherapy at roehampton university .
they said : " ' real play ' - socially interactive , first-hand , loosely supervised - has always been a vital part of children 's development , and its loss could have serious implications .
" just as the epidemic of childhood obesity recently took the developed world by surprise , too much ' junk play ' could -lrb- like too much junk food -rrb- have alarming implications for the next generation . "
bob reitemeier , chief executive of the children 's society , said he agreed that adult anxieties about the modern world were curtailing children 's freedom .
he said : " recent research has shown that the uk is one of the worst places in the western world to be a child .

' disturbing trend ' among the signatories are novelist philip pullman , director of the royal institution baroness susan greenfield and child care expert dr penelope leach .

peter borsay of aberystwyth university said there were similar claims today and in the early 1700s that problem drinking showed a broken society .
but he said it was not the drinking that should be compared , but the " moral panic and media hype " of both eras .
public and political concern has risen amid an increase in alcohol-related deaths and hospital admissions .
prof borsay has published a paper , binge drinking and moral panics : historical parallels ? which looks at the " gin craze " of the early 18th century and the similarities with today .
he argued that while direct comparisons with drinking behaviour then and now " appear striking " , they have been over-stretched . "
it is not drinking behaviour that merits the comparison , but the moral panics that characterised both periods " prof peter borsay but he said " media-constructed moral panics " had been typical in both areas , which were symbolic of wider anxieties about " social breakdown " .
his comments came amid apparent widespread concern about the modern binge drinking culture in the uk .
in june , the british medical association said it wanted more use of street drinking bans , an increase in taxation and a cut in the driving alcohol limit .
relaxed licensing laws research last week by the institute of child health also suggested that teenage binge drinkers were more likely to use drugs , become alcoholics and have a criminal conviction in later life .
it was responding to figures showing that deaths and hospital admissions due to alcohol had both doubled in recent years .
last year , then labour party chairman hazel blears said britons could not emulate european drinking culture because they " enjoy getting drunk , " although she said relaxed licensing laws had not had the disastrous results predicted by some .
a conservative policy group has urged more tax on alcohol to help raise £ 400m a year to treat of alcohol abuse , and tory leader david cameron has said mending britain 's " broken society " is the country 's biggest problem .
prof borsay said : " media , public and political concern about problem drinking is not new and the alcoholic excesses of past generations are well chronicled .
" at first glance , the parallels between the 18th century gin craze and contemporary binge-drinking appear striking .
" but it is not drinking behaviour that merits the comparison , but the moral panics that characterised both periods , fuelled by pressure groups , the media and perceptions of government complacency . "
prof borsay questioned whether " today 's policymakers are dealing with a dramatic new phenomenon " that requires immediate action , or " an endemic feature of our society that is resistant to quick fix solutions " .
he said the gin craze was finally brought under control with a combination of increased tax and licensing fees and restrictions on retail outlets .
" no doubt concerted action by the government and police could bring a similar end to binge drinking today , but whether this would produce an overall drop in alcohol consumption and other social problems and a more disciplined and conformist youth remains questionable , " he added .

peter borsay of aberystwyth university said there were similar claims today and in the early 1700s that problem drinking showed a broken society .
but he said it was not the drinking that should be compared , but the " moral panic and media hype " of both eras .
public and political concern has risen amid an increase in alcohol-related deaths and hospital admissions .
prof borsay has published a paper , binge drinking and moral panics : historical parallels ? which looks at the " gin craze " of the early 18th century and the similarities with today .
he argued that while direct comparisons with drinking behaviour then and now " appear striking " , they have been over-stretched .
it is not drinking behaviour that merits the comparison , but the moral panics that characterised both periods prof peter borsay but he said " media-constructed moral panics " had been typical in both areas , which were symbolic of wider anxieties about " social breakdown " .
his comments came amid apparent widespread concern about the modern binge drinking culture in the uk .
in june , the british medical association said it wanted more use of street drinking bans , an increase in taxation and a cut in the driving alcohol limit .
relaxed licensing laws research last week by the institute of child health also suggested that teenage binge drinkers were more likely to use drugs , become alcoholics and have a criminal conviction in later life .
it was responding to figures showing that deaths and hospital admissions due to alcohol had both doubled in recent years .
last year , then labour party chairman hazel blears said britons could not emulate european drinking culture because they " enjoy getting drunk , " although she said relaxed licensing laws had not had the disastrous results predicted by some .
a conservative policy group has urged more tax on alcohol to help raise £ 400m a year to treat of alcohol abuse , and tory leader david cameron has said mending britain 's " broken society " is the country 's biggest problem .
comparisons are drawn with artist hogarth 's 18th century portrayal of drinking prof borsay said : " media , public and political concern about problem drinking is not new and the alcoholic excesses of past generations are well chronicled .
" at first glance , the parallels between the 18th century gin craze and contemporary binge-drinking appear striking .
" but it is not drinking behaviour that merits the comparison , but the moral panics that characterised both periods , fuelled by pressure groups , the media and perceptions of government complacency . "
prof borsay questioned whether " today 's policymakers are dealing with a dramatic new phenomenon " that requires immediate action , or " an endemic feature of our society that is resistant to quick fix solutions " .
he said the gin craze was finally brought under control with a combination of increased tax and licensing fees and restrictions on retail outlets .
" no doubt concerted action by the government and police could bring a similar end to binge drinking today , but whether this would produce an overall drop in alcohol consumption and other social problems and a more disciplined and conformist youth remains questionable , " he added .

currently a staggering 3,000 dialysis patients die on or before even reaching the transplant list .
the same number of kidneys are either buried or cremated daily .
kidney experts say much more needs to be done to make people more aware of chronic kidney disease , how to treat it and to improve the chance of patients getting a new organ , although not all those on the list are suitable for transplants .
getting weaker when michelle aldridge became sick she assumed she would be better in 24 hours .
three weeks later she was still vomiting , and had lost over three stones -lrb- 20kg -rrb- .
she was diagnosed with a rare condition - goodpasture 's syndrome - that had destroyed her kidneys . "
at the moment i feel quite well , but there is no doubt i would not be here if it was not for dialysis " michelle aldridge the syndrome is caused by a fault in the immune system , which instead of attacking invaders , turns inwards and attack 's the body 's own organs .
" at first i was not worried , as my husband and son had got better after 24 hours , " said michelle .
" but when i was still vomiting two weeks later i went to my gp who said he thought it was gastro-enteritis .
" he gave me medicine , but i was still being sick .
i was getting weaker and weaker . "
three weeks later she saw a different gp who ordered a blood test , which finally revealed the cause of her illness .
dialysis doctors told her that she already had end-stage renal failure and needed to be placed immediately onto dialysis and have six months of chemotherapy to help deal with her symptoms .
michelle felt constantly tired and had to give up her work as a waitress .
she thought her tiredness was simply down to having a toddler , but further tests showed she also had renal anaemia and needed to take erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- , a hormone naturally produced by the kidneys .
it is injected under the skin and stimulates red blood cell production . "
currently we are doing five transplants in the uk a day , if we were doing 10 we would have no waiting list . "
tim stratham six years later michelle is on dialysis waiting for a transplant .
her brother has offered to be considered as a living donor , but michelle is reluctant at this stage for him to endanger his health for her .
" i am not saying never , but he has his own family to think of , " said michelle .
while she is well enough she wants to wait for suitable donated organ from a dead recipient .
the average waiting time for an adult kidney transplant is 841 days .
children wait on average 164 days .
but although michelle knows her life expectancy without a transplant is seriously compromised , she is grateful to get receiving treatment at all .
somebody who starts dialysis in their 30s has the same life expectancy as a person in their 80s without it .
" i have been on the waiting list for six years now .
at the moment i feel quite well , but there is no doubt i would not be here if it was not for dialysis .
" dialysis should not be considered the end of the world .
" i never feel as well as i do the morning after dialysis , i can get up with the energy to enjoy life . "
future hopes tim stratham , of the national kidney federation , said the government is currently looking into what can be done to ease the kidney organ donor crisis , but he said more is urgently needed .

currently a staggering 3,000 dialysis patients die on or before even reaching the transplant list .
the same number of kidneys are either buried or cremated daily .
kidney experts say much more needs to be done to make people more aware of chronic kidney disease , how to treat it and to improve the chance of patients getting a new organ , although not all those on the list are suitable for transplants .
getting weaker when michelle aldridge became sick she assumed she would be better in 24 hours .
three weeks later she was still vomiting , and had lost over three stones -lrb- 20kg -rrb- .
she was diagnosed with a rare condition - goodpasture 's syndrome - that had destroyed her kidneys .
at the moment i feel quite well , but there is no doubt i would not be here if it was not for dialysis michelle aldridge the syndrome is caused by a fault in the immune system , which instead of attacking invaders , turns inwards and attack 's the body 's own organs .
" at first i was not worried , as my husband and son had got better after 24 hours , " said michelle .
" but when i was still vomiting two weeks later i went to my gp who said he thought it was gastro-enteritis .
" he gave me medicine , but i was still being sick .
i was getting weaker and weaker . "
three weeks later she saw a different gp who ordered a blood test , which finally revealed the cause of her illness .
dialysis doctors told her that she already had end-stage renal failure and needed to be placed immediately onto dialysis and have six months of chemotherapy to help deal with her symptoms .
michelle felt constantly tired and had to give up her work as a waitress .
she thought her tiredness was simply down to having a toddler , but further tests showed she also had renal anaemia and needed to take erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- , a hormone naturally produced by the kidneys .
it is injected under the skin and stimulates red blood cell production .
currently we are doing five transplants in the uk a day , if we were doing 10 we would have no waiting list .
tim stratham six years later michelle is on dialysis waiting for a transplant .
her brother has offered to be considered as a living donor , but michelle is reluctant at this stage for him to endanger his health for her .
" i am not saying never , but he has his own family to think of , " said michelle .
while she is well enough she wants to wait for suitable donated organ from a dead recipient .
the average waiting time for an adult kidney transplant is 841 days .
children wait on average 164 days .
but although michelle knows her life expectancy without a transplant is seriously compromised , she is grateful to get receiving treatment at all .
somebody who starts dialysis in their 30s has the same life expectancy as a person in their 80s without it .
" i have been on the waiting list for six years now .
at the moment i feel quite well , but there is no doubt i would not be here if it was not for dialysis .
" dialysis should not be considered the end of the world .
" i never feel as well as i do the morning after dialysis , i can get up with the energy to enjoy life . "
future hopes tim stratham , of the national kidney federation , said the government is currently looking into what can be done to ease the kidney organ donor crisis , but he said more is urgently needed .
" currently we are doing five transplants in the uk a day , if we were doing 10 we would have no waiting list .
" we need more transplant surgeons , more operating time and a transplant culture in hospitals . "

fans of both artists are being forced to choose between the two as 50 cent has announced if west sells more records then he does , he will stop releasing solo material .
speaking to the hip-hop website , sohh.com , he said : " i 'll write music and work with my other artists , but i wo n't put out any more solo albums . "
so who has got what it takes to win over the world of rap and become the ultimate artist ?
a clip from 50 cent 's ayo technology a clip from kanye west 's stronger 50 cent age 32 nationality american occupation rapper , actor , entrepreneur , producer childhood grew up in queens , new york .
he raised by his mother until she was murdered when he was eight .
at the age of 12 he began dealing crack cocaine on the streets of new york .
musical career in 2003 his debut commercial album , get rich or die tryin ' , sold over 900,000 copies in its opening week and reached number one in the us billboard album charts .
he has earned 11 grammy award nominations .
experiences shot nine times at point-blank range whilst sitting in a car in the us .
quote " the only thing that i 'm scared of is not livin ' up to the expectations of dr dre and eminem . "
" i think it 's easier for the general public to embrace me in a negative way .
you have people who already have a perception of me that says i 'm a bad person . "
feuds 50 cent has feuded with jadakiss , the game , ja rule and fat joe .
allies eminem and dr dre both helped launch his career .
kanye west age 30 nationality american occupation rapper , producer , owner of record label childhood born in atlanta , georgia , and raised in an upper-middle class background , he lived with both his parents until their divorce .
he then moved with his mother to chicago , illinois .
musical career he launched his second album , late registration , in 2003 which became number one on the us billboard album chart , selling 860,000 in its first week .
he has won a total of five grammy awards .
experiences involved in a car crash which left him with a metal plate in his chin .
quote " i hate the way they portray us in the media .
you see a black family , it -lsb- the media -rsb- says , ' they 're looting ' .
you see a white family , it says , ' they 're looking for food ' .
and , you know , it 's been five days -lsb- waiting for federal help -rsb- because most of the people are black " .
feuds none to date as he has kept himself to himself allies he has worked with pharrell , jamie foxx and in the early days twista .
conclusion : judging by the amount of grammy awards west has won it would appear the industry favours his music .
