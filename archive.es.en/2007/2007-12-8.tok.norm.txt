this ethnolect is spoken among young migrants of various ethnic backgrounds as well as young native germans . linguists say that fears in germany that this colloquial " lingua franca " might pose a threat to standard german language are unfounded .
but distorted media representations of this ethnolect could , however , serve to merely reinforce stereotypes about the country 's migrants . in popular culture , it 's frequently exposed to ridicule , while in the media it is frequently described as a social " problem " and depicted as posing a threat to standard german . sarmad ahmad , who is of iraqi origin , first encountered this new variant of german when he and his family went to live in berlin-wedding , a district with a high immigrant population .
he first came to germany nine years ago and spent the first few months attending intensive german lessons . the 20-year-old can switch effortlessly from one type to the other .
" my language split when i started mixing with the teenagers in this district .
i can speak one way or the other .
it 's separate from the other language .
it 's as if it 's ours .
there are also germans who have grown up here in this area who also use it too , " he said . " there are things in the way we speak to one another that are linked to our mother tongue .
in arabic you would just say " come " .
there are n't different endings for the verbs like there are in standard german .
this just gets carried across automatically , " he added . the grammar is simplified and features new constructions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people often use an ethnolect as a secret code it 's not unusual to overhear teenagers conversing hard and fast in " their " language in inner-city districts of berlin . but it 's not restricted to the german capital , professor heike wiese also says the phenomenon has been observed in a whole host of other german cities , from regensburg to hamburg . this german is characterized amongst other things by the omission of particles and prepositions in certain contexts and a certain " grammatical economy " , as wiese describes it . " for example , instead of saying ' ich gehe in die schule ' -lrb- i go to school -rrb- , they would say ' isch geh schule ' -lrb- i go school -rrb- , or ' isch bin görlitzer park ' -lrb- i am görlitzer park -rrb- rather than ' ich bin im görlitzer park ' , " adds the linguist , who works at the university of potsdam . it 's also sprinkled with arabic or turkish words , such as yalla -lrb- arabic for let 's go -rrb- , wallah -lrb- a compressed form of the arabic for by allah which is used to mean " really " -rrb- and lan , short for turkish " ulan " and used to mean " guy " or " dude " -rrb- are frequently featured . similar phenomena have been noted elsewhere in europe .
whereas in britain no single overarching multilingual ethnolect appears to exist , it has been detected in sweden , denmark and the netherlands in areas with a high density of migrants . these european ethnolects even seem to share some common features - despite differences because of variations in the languages involved , according to inken keim , professor at the university of mannheim and researcher at the institute for german language .
but it 's not yet possible to say for sure .
academic research into this whole area is still in its early days - both here in germany and abroad .
" it has a certain beat .
perhaps it has to do with tastes in music .
that 's still completely open at the moment , " said keim . a sign of marginalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been criticized for poor standards of second language tuition provision the phenomenon was first brought to the attention of the chattering classes via literature in 1995 .
turkish-born author feridun zaimoglu 's book kanak sprak contains 24 " transcripts " of meetings with young turkish-german men .
zaimoglu describes the ethnolect as " an underground code " , an expression of marginalization by mainstream german society .
the term kanak is itself the pejorative term for turks and other immigrants from southern europe , the middle east or north africa . over the past few years , there has been growing media exposure for this variant of german .
german comedy duos such as stefan and erkan , and mundstuhl , as dragan und alder lampooned this way of speaking , taking their cue from english comedian sacha baron cohen with his performance of ali g. , a boorish , uneducated youth , of immigrant origin . a number of feature films , such as kebab connection , directed by anno paul and screened in 1995 , and süperseks , which was directed by torsten wacker and came out a year earlier , have also engaged with the theme and there is increasing news media coverage . discrimination in popular culture and news media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feridun zaimoglu brought attention to the phenomenon of turkish ethnolects sociolinguist jannis androutsopoulos , reader in sociolinguistics and media discourse at the department of education at king 's college london , is concerned about the distortions involved in representations of ethnic styles of german in popular culture and public discourse and the impact on german mainstream society .
frequently , comedy tends to play up and even invent linguistic characteristics for laughs , while also generally indicating that the speakers of this style of german are badly educated and poorly behaved . according to androutsopoulos , a similar tendency to stereotyping can also be seen in films , including well-meaning ones that set out to celebrate cultural diversity .
" for example , you have films in which a tough , aggressive and obviously uneducated person of migrant background will be speaking markedly ethnic german , whereas in the same movie the good guys , who are also from an ethnic background tend to speak a much more standard german . " media reporting similarly tends to associate ethnic minority styles of german far too quickly with socially stigmatized categories or identities , according to the greek-born , german-reared sociolinguist , and perpetuates stereotypes . " if it 's non-standard german , it 's linked with the ghetto .
it 's problematic , an index of deviance , and something that wo n't get you anywhere in life , " added androutsopoulos . he believes ethnolect should be regarded much more positively .
" the linguistic reality is that the more people are in command of different styles of their language , the better .
it 's yet another layer in people 's linguistic repertoires .
there are people , also younger people , who are perfectly in command of standard german and are also in command of an ethnic style of german , just as like a regional dialect . " media discrimination towards the language and its speakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the comedy acts provide truly crass impersonations the tendency to ridicule ethnically marked german in popular culture has not gone unnoticed by sarmad ahmad .
" it 's got nothing to do with integration .
it is only about making fun of us . " however , he also acknowledges that some of his peer group can only speak ethnolect .
" many of these young people live here and do n't get to see much more than neukölln or wedding .
they do n't get the opportunity to develop , " he added . as heike wiese points out , this is not a threat to the german language , but a problem for the young people in question and german society at large . " for the young people themselves and for the society that loses them because they ca n't participate in society and have fewer chances professionally it 's a huge problem , " she said . just how enduring this phenomenon is likely to be is hard to predict .
wiese believes like most types of language spoken by teenagers that it will probably die out fairly quickly .
inken keim believes that it could establish itself , but only if people from ethnic minority backgrounds remained in areas with a high concentration of non-native speakers over the period of thirty years or so . at the moment , she believes that the chances are low of any of its features entering mainstream german language - above all because the negative connotations of , for example , turkish in germany , in contrast to the higher status of english . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political parties across the spectrum are turning to the issue to lure voters in the lead-up to elections in 2009 . in a pitch to distinguish themselves from their coalition partner the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has called for a softening of the prevailing conscription method , which requires all german males above the age of 18 to enter for military service for nine months . " we are not asking for military service to be scrapped but to proceed on a voluntary basis in future , " said spd party head kurt beck . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remains the last staunch supporter of general conscription and recently emphasized it will uphold current practice at its annual cdu summit earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung is a staunch supporter of conscription " i think that in principle we need conscription because it would be hard to find the 60,000 young men who agree to join the bundeswehr each year , " defense minister franz josef jung , a cdu member , told deutschlandfunk radio . he also dismissed beck 's call for " voluntary conscription " as a contradiction in terms . crucial campaign issue with both parties starting their scramble to improve their image within the grand coalition , issues such as conscription could well be crucial in next year 's campaigning ahead of elections in 2009 . mandatory military service not only serves as a focal point to distinguish party programs , but also directly affects the lives of every german male above the age of 18 .
since the number of conscientious objectors has been steadily rising in favor of civil service , conscription might well be an issue that could impact on the outcome of the next elections .
men can also choose to do a year of social work rather than enter the military . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscription could gain in importance during next year 's campaigns german opposition parties are generally united in their rejection of the current conscription practice and have called for its abolishment or suspension . conscription opponents argue that large standing armies are no longer necessary for domestic defense and that specialized , professional troops who can be deployed swiftly in any crisis region on the globe are needed . " conscription can not be justified any more from the security policy angle , " said claudia roth , a greens party leader .
" it also constitutes a massive intrusion into the basic rights of young men . " other critics refer to the majority of nato partners that have already adopted the model of smaller , professional armies saying that germany 's reliance on conscription is dated .
the only nato countries still applying conscription are estonia , lithuania , norway , greece and turkey .
german army conscripts do not serve in military missions abroad and often receive administrational duties . historic issues still cast their shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most nato members have professional armies in contrast to many nato members , historic issues have weighed heavily on german domestic and foreign policy since 1945 .
after world war ii 's disastrous consequences , german politicians wanted to ensure that the new army consisted of " citizens in uniform " in order to guarantee democratic control of the army . the concept of rearming germany was also fostered by nato partners who were confronted with the warsaw pact , led by the soviet union . however , with the end of the cold war and the reunification of germany in 1990 , the future of nato and costly large armies appeared rather blurred .
moreover , germany no longer had any borders with potential enemies and therefore one of the main arguments for conscription was void .
at the same time germany 's responsibility abroad was constantly growing . after the cold war , new threats were found to justify nato 's international role .
but it was only after a long domestic debate that germany agreed to contribute troops to the alliance 's missions in the balkans and later afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently has about 3,000 troops deployed to afghanistan accordingly , opposition parties like the free-market liberal free democratic party demand a suspension of " unnecessary conscription " at home in favor of more funding for a better equipped smaller professional army capable of acting more efficiently abroad under nato rule . as no fast end to the afghanistan mission is expected and calls for an increase of german troops have been made , it is probable that the conscription and military debate will feature in next year 's campaigning .
until then , german governing and opposition parties remain divided on the issue . neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , to push for a renewal of democracy in zimbabwe , saying the world could not look on as democracy is " trampled underfoot . " " the current state of zimbabwe damages the image of the new africa , " merkel told the leaders of 26 european and 53 african states .
" because this is so , we must take the chance here , in this framework , to put all our efforts together into strengthening democracy . " among her audience was zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , who is regarded in europe as having driven his country to political , agricultural and financial collapse .
he has been banned from entering the eu since 2002 , but the ban was waived for the summit . britain 's prime minister gordon brown refused to come to the summit when mugabe was invited . but despite that boycott , " we , the whole eu , are unified in our assessment of the situation in the country , " merkel said . zimbabwe concerns entire eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters said international leaders needed to stop ignoring africa " zimbabwe 's situation concerns us all , in europe as well as in africa , " she added .
" we do n't have the right to look away when human rights are trampled underfoot . " the chancellor said the eu 's concerns included zimbabwe 's official annual rate of inflation , which stands at nearly 8,000 percent , as well as attacks on opposition figures ahead of elections set for next year . " a democratic government in zimbabwe , which respects human rights , will have the support of the european union , with the aim of allowing zimbabwe to become a new free and prosperous state , " merkel added . while the session was behind closed-doors with only a copy of merkel 's speech being leaked to journalists , ireland 's prime minister bertie ahern said that merkel 's speech had made uncomfortable listening for mugabe . merkel had expressed her concerns about the " deep political and humanitarian crisis in his country , " ahern told reporters . mugabe had been widely expected to respond to merkel 's speech , but in the event he did not react to it , ahern said .
the zimbabwean president has blamed his country 's economic woes on britain , whom he accuses of failing to honor pledges to fund land redistribution and of inciting the opposition to exact regime change . human rights , trade inseparable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mbeki and merkel agreed the summit offered a chance to both africa and europe in a speech before merkel on the issue of human rights , south african president thabo mbeki did not address zimbabwe , where he has tried to mediate between mugabe and his political foes . mbeki said the summit should work to ensure that africa 's " masses escape from the clutches of poverty . " " we are fully conscious of the fact that good governance and respect for human rights are fundamental to the achievement of this objective , " he added . pressured by china 's growing investment and influence in africa , the europeans hope to agree after the two days of talks to ambitious action plan with the continent to revitalize trade - but also to improve cooperation in areas like immigration and peacekeeping . challenged by the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's colonial past in africa continues to strain relations portuguese prime minister jose socrates said history had " thrown down the gauntlet and challenged us to work together to write together a completely new page in the relationship between europe and africa . " " i think this eu-africa summit is a milestone on the path to better relations between our two continents , " merkel said after her speech . but the issue of mugabe , seen by many in africa as an independence hero , has underlined the difficult relationship between africa and the former colonial powers , some of whom gave up control only a few decades ago . " the real significance of this summit must be to lay the foundations of a new partnership based on mutual respect , " said john kufuor , president of ghana and current chairman of the african union .

8 , starting two days of talks aimed at creating a new alliance between the continents .
but animosity over colonial rule could derail the talks . " the message is clear : there is no time to lose , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates , hosting the meeting , said .
" we have to begin looking for new solutions for the future of the continents .
you are all here to meet an invitation from history . " in his opening address , socrates said the two days of meetings were intended to be a " summit of equals .

8 , starting two days of talks aimed at creating a new alliance between the continents .
but animosity over colonial rule could derail the talks . " the message is clear : there is no time to lose , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates , hosting the meeting , said .
" we have to begin looking for new solutions for the future of the continents .
you are all here to meet an invitation from history . " in his opening address , socrates said the two days of meetings were intended to be a " summit of equals . " but a row over the invitation of zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe and a call for colonial-era compensation from libyan leader moammar gadhafi threaten to overshadow the meeting , with british prime minister gordon brown boycotting the summit in protest at his presence . while mugabe kept a low-profile on his first visit to europe in more than two years , the equally controversial libyan leader announced his arrival by demanding that the european powers who carved up africa for their own gain should pay for the damage . " the colonial powers must compensate the people that they colonized and whose riches they plundered , " gadhafi said in a speech at lisbon university .
" this will be one of the main issues of the summit , " added gadhafi whose relations with europe are just coming out of the deep freeze after the freeing of a group of nurses accused of deliberately infecting children with aids . while gadhafi 's claim to speak for his peers is questionable , his demand highlighted the complexity of ties between europe and their one-time colonies and how easily the aim of the two-day summit could be blown off course . barroso : europe has neglected its ties with africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso sees the need for increased co-operation eu commission president jose manuel barroso has acknowledged europe has let relations with its old hunting ground drift and there are now plans for such a summit every third year .
his words were echoed by eu aid and development commissioner louis michel who said that the future of the eu lies in a new relationship with africa . the eu and africa must create " a more responsible and a more political partnership built on greater solidarity , ” michel said .
“ if we fail , lisbon will remain in the collective memory as a great missed opportunity . " we need to consider this summit as a launch pad for a new era in the relationship between europe and africa , " he added . " this summit must mark the end of a relationship rooted in conservatism and sometimes in prejudice on both sides and mark the start of a recognition of the real opportunities that are at hand for both sides . " almost 80 heads of state and government from the european and african unions are set to attend the meeting , which is the second such summit ever and the first since the au was created in 2002 , for talks on cooperation in areas ranging from trade support , energy and migration to education , human rights and science . africa betrayed over trade ; eu concerned with human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resource-rich africa looks to china for economic deals serious differences of opinion , however , remain on issues of trade and human rights , in particular . on trade , some african countries have accused the eu of trying to strong-arm them into accepting allegedly unfavorable trade deals known as economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- , ahead of a world trade organization deadline at the end of the year . europe remains africa 's biggest trading partner and source of aid but china 's growing push into the resource-rich continent as it seeks to fuel its economic growth has shown its influence can not be taken for granted . hopes of a breakthrough on new economic partnership agreements have been dashed this week with south africa , the continent 's economic powerhouse , saying the " detrimental impacts " of the deal offered by the eu had to be addressed . mugabe in spotlight , not marginalized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe 's eu travel ban was lifted for the summit human rights also looks set to be an explosive issue .
eu leaders have promised that the summit will involve a " substantive " debate on the human-rights situation in zimbabwe , where mugabe is accused of conducting a reign of terror and destroying the economy . eu diplomats admit that that risks splitting the summit into pro- and anti-mugabe camps and derailing talks on other issues .
britain 's prime minister brown announced in september that he would boycott the summit if mugabe attended , saying that mugabe 's presence would " divert attention " from other key topics . however , the boycott appears to have had the opposite effect , turning the spotlight on mugabe . the zimbabwean leader , who was banned from the eu for allegedly rigging his re-election five years ago , has portrayed his invitation as a slap in the face for britain whom he accuses of failing to honor commitments to fund land redistribution . while britain 's delegation has stayed at home , other eu leaders such as german chancellor angela merkel , feel the summit offers an opportunity to reproach mugabe and make their points to him personally . " there has been a very negative trend in the zimbabwe regime and this is something we will have to broach , " barroso said .
" but this is not just a summit to look at zimbabwe . " discussions on issues such as zimbabwe , efforts to bring peace to sudan 's darfur region and the conflict in somalia have not been formally timetabled but are expected to crop up in debates on human rights and peace and security . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , the german government has threatened to claw back subsidies for the project near dresden that has been opposed by unesco . german nature-lovers wept saturday as foresters with chain-saws cut down several oak trees at the site of a planned bridge that has raised the ire of the united nations world cultural body unesco . about 400 anti-bridge protesters , some with tears in their eyes , tried to stop the trees from being cut down with some holding hands for a sit-in round the trees .
riot police dragged them away so work could begin .

she said steps could be taken to reclaim the money if this were the case .
the spokeswoman also said a legal review was " normal " after federal subsidies had been paid . plans for the waldschlößchen bridge , which will cross river meadows four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- east of the baroque city center of dresden , have divided the city .

in a 2005 referendum , city residents voted in favor of the move . unesco listed a 20-kilometer section of the valley as a world heritage site in 2004 and has threatened to withdraw this status if the bridge is not made less intrusive . although courts have ruled that a unesco treaty can not prevent the project , a report by federal counsel maintained that saxony is bound by germany 's treaty undertakings , she said .
the state government of saxony said it has not seen the legal report .

8 , to push for a renewal of democracy in zimbabwe , saying the world could not look on as democracy is " trampled underfoot . " " the current state of zimbabwe damages the image of the new africa , " merkel told the leaders of 26 european and 53 african states .
" because this is so , we must take the chance here , in this framework , to put all our efforts together into strengthening democracy . " among her audience was zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , who is regarded in europe as having driven his country to political , agricultural and financial collapse .
he has been banned from entering the eu since 2002 , but the ban was waived for the summit . britain 's prime minister gordon brown refused to come to the summit when mugabe was invited . but despite that boycott , " we , the whole eu , are unified in our assessment of the situation in the country , " merkel said . zimbabwe concerns entire eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters said international leaders needed to stop ignoring africa " zimbabwe 's situation concerns us all , in europe as well as in africa , " she added .
" we do n't have the right to look away when human rights are trampled underfoot . " the chancellor said the eu 's concerns included zimbabwe 's official annual rate of inflation , which stands at nearly 8,000 percent , as well as attacks on opposition figures ahead of elections set for next year . " a democratic government in zimbabwe , which respects human rights , will have the support of the european union , with the aim of allowing zimbabwe to become a new free and prosperous state , " merkel added . while the session was behind closed-doors with only a copy of merkel 's speech being leaked to journalists , ireland 's prime minister bertie ahern said that merkel 's speech had made uncomfortable listening for mugabe . merkel had expressed her concerns about the " deep political and humanitarian crisis in his country , " ahern told reporters . mugabe had been widely expected to respond to merkel 's speech , but in the event he did not react to it , ahern said .
the zimbabwean president has blamed his country 's economic woes on britain , whom he accuses of failing to honor pledges to fund land redistribution and of inciting the opposition to exact regime change . human rights , trade inseparable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mbeki and merkel agreed the summit offered a chance to both africa and europe in a speech before merkel on the issue of human rights , south african president thabo mbeki did not address zimbabwe , where he has tried to mediate between mugabe and his political foes . mbeki said the summit should work to ensure that africa 's " masses escape from the clutches of poverty . " " we are fully conscious of the fact that good governance and respect for human rights are fundamental to the achievement of this objective , " he added . pressured by china 's growing investment and influence in africa , the europeans hope to agree after the two days of talks to ambitious action plan with the continent to revitalize trade - but also to improve cooperation in areas like immigration and peacekeeping . challenged by the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's colonial past in africa continues to strain relations portuguese prime minister jose socrates said history had " thrown down the gauntlet and challenged us to work together to write together a completely new page in the relationship between europe and africa . " " i think this eu-africa summit is a milestone on the path to better relations between our two continents , " merkel said after her speech . but the issue of mugabe , seen by many in africa as an independence hero , has underlined the difficult relationship between africa and the former colonial powers , some of whom gave up control only a few decades ago . " the real significance of this summit must be to lay the foundations of a new partnership based on mutual respect , " said john kufuor , president of ghana and current chairman of the african union .

" our study confirmed that in germany a connection has been observed between the distance of a domicile to the nearest nuclear power plant ... and the risk of developing cancer , such as leukemia , before the fifth birthday , " the daily süddeutsche zeitung quoted the report as saying . government radiation specialists said they could not explain the finding , since there was no direct radiation from the 16 german plants , which are all scheduled for closure in the early 2020s . the study was paid for by the german federal radiation protection agency -lsb- bfs -rsb- the government 's main adviser on nuclear health . it was conducted by the german register of child cancer , an office in mainz which is funded by the 16 german states and the federal health ministry . the study found that 37 children had come down with leukemia in the period between 1980 and 2003 while having home addresses within 5 kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- of nuclear power plants .
the statistical average for germany would have predicted just 17 cases in that group . statistically , the 20 extra cases could be associated with living close to the plants , but the bfs said more research was needed to discover if the presence of reactors was actually the cause of the cancers . doubts over causality remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said more studies needed to be done to explain the current findings german environment minister sigmar gabriel said the government radiation safety committee would analyze the findings and called for additional research to explain the increased number of cancer cases . " the population 's radiation exposure due to the operation of nuclear power plants in germany would have to be a least a thousand times higher to be able to explain the observed increase in cancer risk , " he said . bfs said current science held that radiation from reactors themselves or their emissions was too weak outside the perimeter to cause cancer , and other conceivable risk factors also could " not explain this distance-related heightening of risk . " germany generates more than 20,000 megawatts of electricity through nuclear power annually , around a quarter of its needs . despite broad public opposition to the plants , some german officials have suggested giving nuclear power a reprieve in order to reduce climate-damaging emissions from fossil fuels . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , to push for a renewal of democracy in zimbabwe , saying the world could not look on as democracy is " trampled underfoot . " " the current state of zimbabwe damages the image of the new africa , " merkel told the leaders of 26 european and 53 african states .
" because this is so , we must take the chance here , in this framework , to put all our efforts together into strengthening democracy . " among her audience was zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , who is regarded in europe as having driven his country to political , agricultural and financial collapse .
he has been banned from entering the eu since 2002 , but the ban was waived for the summit . britain 's prime minister gordon brown refused to come to the summit when mugabe was invited . but despite that boycott , " we , the whole eu , are unified in our assessment of the situation in the country , " merkel said . zimbabwe concerns entire eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters said international leaders needed to stop ignoring africa " zimbabwe 's situation concerns us all , in europe as well as in africa , " she added .
" we do n't have the right to look away when human rights are trampled underfoot . " the chancellor said the eu 's concerns included zimbabwe 's official annual rate of inflation , which stands at nearly 8,000 percent , as well as attacks on opposition figures ahead of elections set for next year . " a democratic government in zimbabwe , which respects human rights , will have the support of the european union , with the aim of allowing zimbabwe to become a new free and prosperous state , " merkel added . while the session was behind closed-doors with only a copy of merkel 's speech being leaked to journalists , ireland 's prime minister bertie ahern said that merkel 's speech had made uncomfortable listening for mugabe . merkel had expressed her concerns about the " deep political and humanitarian crisis in his country , " ahern told reporters . mugabe had been widely expected to respond to merkel 's speech , but in the event he did not react to it , ahern said .

" " we are fully conscious of the fact that good governance and respect for human rights are fundamental to the achievement of this objective , " he added . pressured by china 's growing investment and influence in africa , the europeans hope to agree after the two days of talks to ambitious action plan with the continent to revitalize trade - but also to improve cooperation in areas like immigration and peacekeeping . challenged by the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's colonial past in africa continues to strain relations portuguese prime minister jose socrates said history had " thrown down the gauntlet and challenged us to work together to write together a completely new page in the relationship between europe and africa . " " i think this eu-africa summit is a milestone on the path to better relations between our two continents , " merkel said after her speech . but the issue of mugabe , seen by many in africa as an independence hero , has underlined the difficult relationship between africa and the former colonial powers , some of whom gave up control only a few decades ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 08.12.2007 immigrants help create new type of german language großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the young people generally only use the language among themselves in multicultural urban areas of germany , a new variant of german has evolved with its own grammar and rhythm .
this ethnolect is spoken among young migrants of various ethnic backgrounds as well as young native germans . linguists say that fears in germany that this colloquial " lingua franca " might pose a threat to standard german language are unfounded .
but distorted media representations of this ethnolect could , however , serve to merely reinforce stereotypes about the country 's migrants . in popular culture , it 's frequently exposed to ridicule , while in the media it is frequently described as a social " problem " and depicted as posing a threat to standard german . sarmad ahmad , who is of iraqi origin , first encountered this new variant of german when he and his family went to live in berlin-wedding , a district with a high immigrant population .
he first came to germany nine years ago and spent the first few months attending intensive german lessons . the 20-year-old can switch effortlessly from one type to the other .
" my language split when i started mixing with the teenagers in this district .
i can speak one way or the other .
it 's separate from the other language .
it 's as if it 's ours .
there are also germans who have grown up here in this area who also use it too , " he said . " there are things in the way we speak to one another that are linked to our mother tongue .
in arabic you would just say " come " .
there are n't different endings for the verbs like there are in standard german .
this just gets carried across automatically , " he added . the grammar is simplified and features new constructions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people often use an ethnolect as a secret code it 's not unusual to overhear teenagers conversing hard and fast in " their " language in inner-city districts of berlin . but it 's not restricted to the german capital , professor heike wiese also says the phenomenon has been observed in a whole host of other german cities , from regensburg to hamburg . this german is characterized amongst other things by the omission of particles and prepositions in certain contexts and a certain " grammatical economy " , as wiese describes it . " for example , instead of saying ' ich gehe in die schule ' -lrb- i go to school -rrb- , they would say ' isch geh schule ' -lrb- i go school -rrb- , or ' isch bin görlitzer park ' -lrb- i am görlitzer park -rrb- rather than ' ich bin im görlitzer park ' , " adds the linguist , who works at the university of potsdam . it 's also sprinkled with arabic or turkish words , such as yalla -lrb- arabic for let 's go -rrb- , wallah -lrb- a compressed form of the arabic for by allah which is used to mean " really " -rrb- and lan , short for turkish " ulan " and used to mean " guy " or " dude " -rrb- are frequently featured . similar phenomena have been noted elsewhere in europe .
whereas in britain no single overarching multilingual ethnolect appears to exist , it has been detected in sweden , denmark and the netherlands in areas with a high density of migrants . these european ethnolects even seem to share some common features - despite differences because of variations in the languages involved , according to inken keim , professor at the university of mannheim and researcher at the institute for german language .
but it 's not yet possible to say for sure .
academic research into this whole area is still in its early days - both here in germany and abroad .
" it has a certain beat .
perhaps it has to do with tastes in music .
that 's still completely open at the moment , " said keim . a sign of marginalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been criticized for poor standards of second language tuition provision the phenomenon was first brought to the attention of the chattering classes via literature in 1995 .
turkish-born author feridun zaimoglu 's book kanak sprak contains 24 " transcripts " of meetings with young turkish-german men .
zaimoglu describes the ethnolect as " an underground code " , an expression of marginalization by mainstream german society .
the term kanak is itself the pejorative term for turks and other immigrants from southern europe , the middle east or north africa . over the past few years , there has been growing media exposure for this variant of german .
german comedy duos such as stefan and erkan , and mundstuhl , as dragan und alder lampooned this way of speaking , taking their cue from english comedian sacha baron cohen with his performance of ali g. , a boorish , uneducated youth , of immigrant origin . a number of feature films , such as kebab connection , directed by anno paul and screened in 1995 , and süperseks , which was directed by torsten wacker and came out a year earlier , have also engaged with the theme and there is increasing news media coverage . discrimination in popular culture and news media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feridun zaimoglu brought attention to the phenomenon of turkish ethnolects sociolinguist jannis androutsopoulos , reader in sociolinguistics and media discourse at the department of education at king 's college london , is concerned about the distortions involved in representations of ethnic styles of german in popular culture and public discourse and the impact on german mainstream society .
frequently , comedy tends to play up and even invent linguistic characteristics for laughs , while also generally indicating that the speakers of this style of german are badly educated and poorly behaved . according to androutsopoulos , a similar tendency to stereotyping can also be seen in films , including well-meaning ones that set out to celebrate cultural diversity .
" for example , you have films in which a tough , aggressive and obviously uneducated person of migrant background will be speaking markedly ethnic german , whereas in the same movie the good guys , who are also from an ethnic background tend to speak a much more standard german . " media reporting similarly tends to associate ethnic minority styles of german far too quickly with socially stigmatized categories or identities , according to the greek-born , german-reared sociolinguist , and perpetuates stereotypes .

this ethnolect is spoken among young migrants of various ethnic backgrounds as well as young native germans . linguists say that fears in germany that this colloquial " lingua franca " might pose a threat to standard german language are unfounded .
but distorted media representations of this ethnolect could , however , serve to merely reinforce stereotypes about the country 's migrants . in popular culture , it 's frequently exposed to ridicule , while in the media it is frequently described as a social " problem " and depicted as posing a threat to standard german . sarmad ahmad , who is of iraqi origin , first encountered this new variant of german when he and his family went to live in berlin-wedding , a district with a high immigrant population .
he first came to germany nine years ago and spent the first few months attending intensive german lessons . the 20-year-old can switch effortlessly from one type to the other .
" my language split when i started mixing with the teenagers in this district .
i can speak one way or the other .
it 's separate from the other language .
it 's as if it 's ours .
there are also germans who have grown up here in this area who also use it too , " he said . " there are things in the way we speak to one another that are linked to our mother tongue .
in arabic you would just say " come " .
there are n't different endings for the verbs like there are in standard german .
this just gets carried across automatically , " he added . the grammar is simplified and features new constructions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people often use an ethnolect as a secret code it 's not unusual to overhear teenagers conversing hard and fast in " their " language in inner-city districts of berlin . but it 's not restricted to the german capital , professor heike wiese also says the phenomenon has been observed in a whole host of other german cities , from regensburg to hamburg . this german is characterized amongst other things by the omission of particles and prepositions in certain contexts and a certain " grammatical economy " , as wiese describes it . " for example , instead of saying ' ich gehe in die schule ' -lrb- i go to school -rrb- , they would say ' isch geh schule ' -lrb- i go school -rrb- , or ' isch bin görlitzer park ' -lrb- i am görlitzer park -rrb- rather than ' ich bin im görlitzer park ' , " adds the linguist , who works at the university of potsdam . it 's also sprinkled with arabic or turkish words , such as yalla -lrb- arabic for let 's go -rrb- , wallah -lrb- a compressed form of the arabic for by allah which is used to mean " really " -rrb- and lan , short for turkish " ulan " and used to mean " guy " or " dude " -rrb- are frequently featured . similar phenomena have been noted elsewhere in europe .
whereas in britain no single overarching multilingual ethnolect appears to exist , it has been detected in sweden , denmark and the netherlands in areas with a high density of migrants . these european ethnolects even seem to share some common features - despite differences because of variations in the languages involved , according to inken keim , professor at the university of mannheim and researcher at the institute for german language .
but it 's not yet possible to say for sure .
academic research into this whole area is still in its early days - both here in germany and abroad .
" it has a certain beat .
perhaps it has to do with tastes in music .
that 's still completely open at the moment , " said keim . a sign of marginalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been criticized for poor standards of second language tuition provision the phenomenon was first brought to the attention of the chattering classes via literature in 1995 .
turkish-born author feridun zaimoglu 's book kanak sprak contains 24 " transcripts " of meetings with young turkish-german men .
zaimoglu describes the ethnolect as " an underground code " , an expression of marginalization by mainstream german society .
the term kanak is itself the pejorative term for turks and other immigrants from southern europe , the middle east or north africa . over the past few years , there has been growing media exposure for this variant of german .
german comedy duos such as stefan and erkan , and mundstuhl , as dragan und alder lampooned this way of speaking , taking their cue from english comedian sacha baron cohen with his performance of ali g. , a boorish , uneducated youth , of immigrant origin . a number of feature films , such as kebab connection , directed by anno paul and screened in 1995 , and süperseks , which was directed by torsten wacker and came out a year earlier , have also engaged with the theme and there is increasing news media coverage . discrimination in popular culture and news media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feridun zaimoglu brought attention to the phenomenon of turkish ethnolects sociolinguist jannis androutsopoulos , reader in sociolinguistics and media discourse at the department of education at king 's college london , is concerned about the distortions involved in representations of ethnic styles of german in popular culture and public discourse and the impact on german mainstream society .
frequently , comedy tends to play up and even invent linguistic characteristics for laughs , while also generally indicating that the speakers of this style of german are badly educated and poorly behaved . according to androutsopoulos , a similar tendency to stereotyping can also be seen in films , including well-meaning ones that set out to celebrate cultural diversity .
" for example , you have films in which a tough , aggressive and obviously uneducated person of migrant background will be speaking markedly ethnic german , whereas in the same movie the good guys , who are also from an ethnic background tend to speak a much more standard german . " media reporting similarly tends to associate ethnic minority styles of german far too quickly with socially stigmatized categories or identities , according to the greek-born , german-reared sociolinguist , and perpetuates stereotypes .

this ethnolect is spoken among young migrants of various ethnic backgrounds as well as young native germans . linguists say that fears in germany that this colloquial " lingua franca " might pose a threat to standard german language are unfounded .
but distorted media representations of this ethnolect could , however , serve to merely reinforce stereotypes about the country 's migrants . in popular culture , it 's frequently exposed to ridicule , while in the media it is frequently described as a social " problem " and depicted as posing a threat to standard german . sarmad ahmad , who is of iraqi origin , first encountered this new variant of german when he and his family went to live in berlin-wedding , a district with a high immigrant population .
he first came to germany nine years ago and spent the first few months attending intensive german lessons . the 20-year-old can switch effortlessly from one type to the other .
" my language split when i started mixing with the teenagers in this district .
i can speak one way or the other .
it 's separate from the other language .
it 's as if it 's ours .
there are also germans who have grown up here in this area who also use it too , " he said . " there are things in the way we speak to one another that are linked to our mother tongue .
in arabic you would just say " come " .
there are n't different endings for the verbs like there are in standard german .
this just gets carried across automatically , " he added . the grammar is simplified and features new constructions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people often use an ethnolect as a secret code it 's not unusual to overhear teenagers conversing hard and fast in " their " language in inner-city districts of berlin . but it 's not restricted to the german capital , professor heike wiese also says the phenomenon has been observed in a whole host of other german cities , from regensburg to hamburg . this german is characterized amongst other things by the omission of particles and prepositions in certain contexts and a certain " grammatical economy " , as wiese describes it . " for example , instead of saying ' ich gehe in die schule ' -lrb- i go to school -rrb- , they would say ' isch geh schule ' -lrb- i go school -rrb- , or ' isch bin görlitzer park ' -lrb- i am görlitzer park -rrb- rather than ' ich bin im görlitzer park ' , " adds the linguist , who works at the university of potsdam . it 's also sprinkled with arabic or turkish words , such as yalla -lrb- arabic for let 's go -rrb- , wallah -lrb- a compressed form of the arabic for by allah which is used to mean " really " -rrb- and lan , short for turkish " ulan " and used to mean " guy " or " dude " -rrb- are frequently featured . similar phenomena have been noted elsewhere in europe .
whereas in britain no single overarching multilingual ethnolect appears to exist , it has been detected in sweden , denmark and the netherlands in areas with a high density of migrants . these european ethnolects even seem to share some common features - despite differences because of variations in the languages involved , according to inken keim , professor at the university of mannheim and researcher at the institute for german language .
but it 's not yet possible to say for sure .
academic research into this whole area is still in its early days - both here in germany and abroad .

turkish-born author feridun zaimoglu 's book kanak sprak contains 24 " transcripts " of meetings with young turkish-german men .
zaimoglu describes the ethnolect as " an underground code " , an expression of marginalization by mainstream german society .
the term kanak is itself the pejorative term for turks and other immigrants from southern europe , the middle east or north africa . over the past few years , there has been growing media exposure for this variant of german .

" our study confirmed that in germany a connection has been observed between the distance of a domicile to the nearest nuclear power plant ... and the risk of developing cancer , such as leukemia , before the fifth birthday , " the daily süddeutsche zeitung quoted the report as saying . government radiation specialists said they could not explain the finding , since there was no direct radiation from the 16 german plants , which are all scheduled for closure in the early 2020s . the study was paid for by the german federal radiation protection agency -lsb- bfs -rsb- the government 's main adviser on nuclear health . it was conducted by the german register of child cancer , an office in mainz which is funded by the 16 german states and the federal health ministry . the study found that 37 children had come down with leukemia in the period between 1980 and 2003 while having home addresses within 5 kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- of nuclear power plants .
the statistical average for germany would have predicted just 17 cases in that group . statistically , the 20 extra cases could be associated with living close to the plants , but the bfs said more research was needed to discover if the presence of reactors was actually the cause of the cancers . doubts over causality remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said more studies needed to be done to explain the current findings german environment minister sigmar gabriel said the government radiation safety committee would analyze the findings and called for additional research to explain the increased number of cancer cases . " the population 's radiation exposure due to the operation of nuclear power plants in germany would have to be a least a thousand times higher to be able to explain the observed increase in cancer risk , " he said . bfs said current science held that radiation from reactors themselves or their emissions was too weak outside the perimeter to cause cancer , and other conceivable risk factors also could " not explain this distance-related heightening of risk . " germany generates more than 20,000 megawatts of electricity through nuclear power annually , around a quarter of its needs . despite broad public opposition to the plants , some german officials have suggested giving nuclear power a reprieve in order to reduce climate-damaging emissions from fossil fuels . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this ethnolect is spoken among young migrants of various ethnic backgrounds as well as young native germans . linguists say that fears in germany that this colloquial " lingua franca " might pose a threat to standard german language are unfounded .
but distorted media representations of this ethnolect could , however , serve to merely reinforce stereotypes about the country 's migrants . in popular culture , it 's frequently exposed to ridicule , while in the media it is frequently described as a social " problem " and depicted as posing a threat to standard german . sarmad ahmad , who is of iraqi origin , first encountered this new variant of german when he and his family went to live in berlin-wedding , a district with a high immigrant population .
he first came to germany nine years ago and spent the first few months attending intensive german lessons . the 20-year-old can switch effortlessly from one type to the other .
" my language split when i started mixing with the teenagers in this district .
i can speak one way or the other .
it 's separate from the other language .
it 's as if it 's ours .
there are also germans who have grown up here in this area who also use it too , " he said . " there are things in the way we speak to one another that are linked to our mother tongue .
in arabic you would just say " come " .
there are n't different endings for the verbs like there are in standard german .
this just gets carried across automatically , " he added . the grammar is simplified and features new constructions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people often use an ethnolect as a secret code it 's not unusual to overhear teenagers conversing hard and fast in " their " language in inner-city districts of berlin . but it 's not restricted to the german capital , professor heike wiese also says the phenomenon has been observed in a whole host of other german cities , from regensburg to hamburg . this german is characterized amongst other things by the omission of particles and prepositions in certain contexts and a certain " grammatical economy " , as wiese describes it . " for example , instead of saying ' ich gehe in die schule ' -lrb- i go to school -rrb- , they would say ' isch geh schule ' -lrb- i go school -rrb- , or ' isch bin görlitzer park ' -lrb- i am görlitzer park -rrb- rather than ' ich bin im görlitzer park ' , " adds the linguist , who works at the university of potsdam . it 's also sprinkled with arabic or turkish words , such as yalla -lrb- arabic for let 's go -rrb- , wallah -lrb- a compressed form of the arabic for by allah which is used to mean " really " -rrb- and lan , short for turkish " ulan " and used to mean " guy " or " dude " -rrb- are frequently featured . similar phenomena have been noted elsewhere in europe .
whereas in britain no single overarching multilingual ethnolect appears to exist , it has been detected in sweden , denmark and the netherlands in areas with a high density of migrants . these european ethnolects even seem to share some common features - despite differences because of variations in the languages involved , according to inken keim , professor at the university of mannheim and researcher at the institute for german language .
but it 's not yet possible to say for sure .
academic research into this whole area is still in its early days - both here in germany and abroad .
" it has a certain beat .
perhaps it has to do with tastes in music .
that 's still completely open at the moment , " said keim . a sign of marginalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been criticized for poor standards of second language tuition provision the phenomenon was first brought to the attention of the chattering classes via literature in 1995 .
turkish-born author feridun zaimoglu 's book kanak sprak contains 24 " transcripts " of meetings with young turkish-german men .
zaimoglu describes the ethnolect as " an underground code " , an expression of marginalization by mainstream german society .
the term kanak is itself the pejorative term for turks and other immigrants from southern europe , the middle east or north africa . over the past few years , there has been growing media exposure for this variant of german .
german comedy duos such as stefan and erkan , and mundstuhl , as dragan und alder lampooned this way of speaking , taking their cue from english comedian sacha baron cohen with his performance of ali g. , a boorish , uneducated youth , of immigrant origin . a number of feature films , such as kebab connection , directed by anno paul and screened in 1995 , and süperseks , which was directed by torsten wacker and came out a year earlier , have also engaged with the theme and there is increasing news media coverage . discrimination in popular culture and news media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feridun zaimoglu brought attention to the phenomenon of turkish ethnolects sociolinguist jannis androutsopoulos , reader in sociolinguistics and media discourse at the department of education at king 's college london , is concerned about the distortions involved in representations of ethnic styles of german in popular culture and public discourse and the impact on german mainstream society .
frequently , comedy tends to play up and even invent linguistic characteristics for laughs , while also generally indicating that the speakers of this style of german are badly educated and poorly behaved . according to androutsopoulos , a similar tendency to stereotyping can also be seen in films , including well-meaning ones that set out to celebrate cultural diversity .
" for example , you have films in which a tough , aggressive and obviously uneducated person of migrant background will be speaking markedly ethnic german , whereas in the same movie the good guys , who are also from an ethnic background tend to speak a much more standard german . " media reporting similarly tends to associate ethnic minority styles of german far too quickly with socially stigmatized categories or identities , according to the greek-born , german-reared sociolinguist , and perpetuates stereotypes . " if it 's non-standard german , it 's linked with the ghetto .
it 's problematic , an index of deviance , and something that wo n't get you anywhere in life , " added androutsopoulos . he believes ethnolect should be regarded much more positively .
" the linguistic reality is that the more people are in command of different styles of their language , the better .
it 's yet another layer in people 's linguistic repertoires .
there are people , also younger people , who are perfectly in command of standard german and are also in command of an ethnic style of german , just as like a regional dialect . " media discrimination towards the language and its speakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the comedy acts provide truly crass impersonations the tendency to ridicule ethnically marked german in popular culture has not gone unnoticed by sarmad ahmad .
" it 's got nothing to do with integration .
it is only about making fun of us . " however , he also acknowledges that some of his peer group can only speak ethnolect .
" many of these young people live here and do n't get to see much more than neukölln or wedding .
they do n't get the opportunity to develop , " he added . as heike wiese points out , this is not a threat to the german language , but a problem for the young people in question and german society at large . " for the young people themselves and for the society that loses them because they ca n't participate in society and have fewer chances professionally it 's a huge problem , " she said . just how enduring this phenomenon is likely to be is hard to predict .
wiese believes like most types of language spoken by teenagers that it will probably die out fairly quickly .
inken keim believes that it could establish itself , but only if people from ethnic minority backgrounds remained in areas with a high concentration of non-native speakers over the period of thirty years or so . at the moment , she believes that the chances are low of any of its features entering mainstream german language - above all because the negative connotations of , for example , turkish in germany , in contrast to the higher status of english . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this ethnolect is spoken among young migrants of various ethnic backgrounds as well as young native germans . linguists say that fears in germany that this colloquial " lingua franca " might pose a threat to standard german language are unfounded .
but distorted media representations of this ethnolect could , however , serve to merely reinforce stereotypes about the country 's migrants . in popular culture , it 's frequently exposed to ridicule , while in the media it is frequently described as a social " problem " and depicted as posing a threat to standard german . sarmad ahmad , who is of iraqi origin , first encountered this new variant of german when he and his family went to live in berlin-wedding , a district with a high immigrant population .
he first came to germany nine years ago and spent the first few months attending intensive german lessons . the 20-year-old can switch effortlessly from one type to the other .
" my language split when i started mixing with the teenagers in this district .
i can speak one way or the other .
it 's separate from the other language .
it 's as if it 's ours .
there are also germans who have grown up here in this area who also use it too , " he said . " there are things in the way we speak to one another that are linked to our mother tongue .
in arabic you would just say " come " .
there are n't different endings for the verbs like there are in standard german .
this just gets carried across automatically , " he added . the grammar is simplified and features new constructions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people often use an ethnolect as a secret code it 's not unusual to overhear teenagers conversing hard and fast in " their " language in inner-city districts of berlin . but it 's not restricted to the german capital , professor heike wiese also says the phenomenon has been observed in a whole host of other german cities , from regensburg to hamburg . this german is characterized amongst other things by the omission of particles and prepositions in certain contexts and a certain " grammatical economy " , as wiese describes it . " for example , instead of saying ' ich gehe in die schule ' -lrb- i go to school -rrb- , they would say ' isch geh schule ' -lrb- i go school -rrb- , or ' isch bin görlitzer park ' -lrb- i am görlitzer park -rrb- rather than ' ich bin im görlitzer park ' , " adds the linguist , who works at the university of potsdam . it 's also sprinkled with arabic or turkish words , such as yalla -lrb- arabic for let 's go -rrb- , wallah -lrb- a compressed form of the arabic for by allah which is used to mean " really " -rrb- and lan , short for turkish " ulan " and used to mean " guy " or " dude " -rrb- are frequently featured . similar phenomena have been noted elsewhere in europe .
whereas in britain no single overarching multilingual ethnolect appears to exist , it has been detected in sweden , denmark and the netherlands in areas with a high density of migrants . these european ethnolects even seem to share some common features - despite differences because of variations in the languages involved , according to inken keim , professor at the university of mannheim and researcher at the institute for german language .
but it 's not yet possible to say for sure .
academic research into this whole area is still in its early days - both here in germany and abroad .
" it has a certain beat .
perhaps it has to do with tastes in music .
that 's still completely open at the moment , " said keim . a sign of marginalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been criticized for poor standards of second language tuition provision the phenomenon was first brought to the attention of the chattering classes via literature in 1995 .
turkish-born author feridun zaimoglu 's book kanak sprak contains 24 " transcripts " of meetings with young turkish-german men .
zaimoglu describes the ethnolect as " an underground code " , an expression of marginalization by mainstream german society .
the term kanak is itself the pejorative term for turks and other immigrants from southern europe , the middle east or north africa . over the past few years , there has been growing media exposure for this variant of german .
german comedy duos such as stefan and erkan , and mundstuhl , as dragan und alder lampooned this way of speaking , taking their cue from english comedian sacha baron cohen with his performance of ali g. , a boorish , uneducated youth , of immigrant origin . a number of feature films , such as kebab connection , directed by anno paul and screened in 1995 , and süperseks , which was directed by torsten wacker and came out a year earlier , have also engaged with the theme and there is increasing news media coverage . discrimination in popular culture and news media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feridun zaimoglu brought attention to the phenomenon of turkish ethnolects sociolinguist jannis androutsopoulos , reader in sociolinguistics and media discourse at the department of education at king 's college london , is concerned about the distortions involved in representations of ethnic styles of german in popular culture and public discourse and the impact on german mainstream society .
frequently , comedy tends to play up and even invent linguistic characteristics for laughs , while also generally indicating that the speakers of this style of german are badly educated and poorly behaved . according to androutsopoulos , a similar tendency to stereotyping can also be seen in films , including well-meaning ones that set out to celebrate cultural diversity .
" for example , you have films in which a tough , aggressive and obviously uneducated person of migrant background will be speaking markedly ethnic german , whereas in the same movie the good guys , who are also from an ethnic background tend to speak a much more standard german . " media reporting similarly tends to associate ethnic minority styles of german far too quickly with socially stigmatized categories or identities , according to the greek-born , german-reared sociolinguist , and perpetuates stereotypes . " if it 's non-standard german , it 's linked with the ghetto .
it 's problematic , an index of deviance , and something that wo n't get you anywhere in life , " added androutsopoulos . he believes ethnolect should be regarded much more positively .
" the linguistic reality is that the more people are in command of different styles of their language , the better .
it 's yet another layer in people 's linguistic repertoires .
there are people , also younger people , who are perfectly in command of standard german and are also in command of an ethnic style of german , just as like a regional dialect . " media discrimination towards the language and its speakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the comedy acts provide truly crass impersonations the tendency to ridicule ethnically marked german in popular culture has not gone unnoticed by sarmad ahmad .
" it 's got nothing to do with integration .
it is only about making fun of us . " however , he also acknowledges that some of his peer group can only speak ethnolect .
" many of these young people live here and do n't get to see much more than neukölln or wedding .
they do n't get the opportunity to develop , " he added . as heike wiese points out , this is not a threat to the german language , but a problem for the young people in question and german society at large . " for the young people themselves and for the society that loses them because they ca n't participate in society and have fewer chances professionally it 's a huge problem , " she said . just how enduring this phenomenon is likely to be is hard to predict .
wiese believes like most types of language spoken by teenagers that it will probably die out fairly quickly .
inken keim believes that it could establish itself , but only if people from ethnic minority backgrounds remained in areas with a high concentration of non-native speakers over the period of thirty years or so . at the moment , she believes that the chances are low of any of its features entering mainstream german language - above all because the negative connotations of , for example , turkish in germany , in contrast to the higher status of english . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this ethnolect is spoken among young migrants of various ethnic backgrounds as well as young native germans . linguists say that fears in germany that this colloquial " lingua franca " might pose a threat to standard german language are unfounded .
but distorted media representations of this ethnolect could , however , serve to merely reinforce stereotypes about the country 's migrants . in popular culture , it 's frequently exposed to ridicule , while in the media it is frequently described as a social " problem " and depicted as posing a threat to standard german . sarmad ahmad , who is of iraqi origin , first encountered this new variant of german when he and his family went to live in berlin-wedding , a district with a high immigrant population .
he first came to germany nine years ago and spent the first few months attending intensive german lessons . the 20-year-old can switch effortlessly from one type to the other .
" my language split when i started mixing with the teenagers in this district .
i can speak one way or the other .
it 's separate from the other language .
it 's as if it 's ours .
there are also germans who have grown up here in this area who also use it too , " he said . " there are things in the way we speak to one another that are linked to our mother tongue .
in arabic you would just say " come " .
there are n't different endings for the verbs like there are in standard german .
this just gets carried across automatically , " he added . the grammar is simplified and features new constructions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people often use an ethnolect as a secret code it 's not unusual to overhear teenagers conversing hard and fast in " their " language in inner-city districts of berlin . but it 's not restricted to the german capital , professor heike wiese also says the phenomenon has been observed in a whole host of other german cities , from regensburg to hamburg . this german is characterized amongst other things by the omission of particles and prepositions in certain contexts and a certain " grammatical economy " , as wiese describes it . " for example , instead of saying ' ich gehe in die schule ' -lrb- i go to school -rrb- , they would say ' isch geh schule ' -lrb- i go school -rrb- , or ' isch bin görlitzer park ' -lrb- i am görlitzer park -rrb- rather than ' ich bin im görlitzer park ' , " adds the linguist , who works at the university of potsdam . it 's also sprinkled with arabic or turkish words , such as yalla -lrb- arabic for let 's go -rrb- , wallah -lrb- a compressed form of the arabic for by allah which is used to mean " really " -rrb- and lan , short for turkish " ulan " and used to mean " guy " or " dude " -rrb- are frequently featured . similar phenomena have been noted elsewhere in europe .
whereas in britain no single overarching multilingual ethnolect appears to exist , it has been detected in sweden , denmark and the netherlands in areas with a high density of migrants . these european ethnolects even seem to share some common features - despite differences because of variations in the languages involved , according to inken keim , professor at the university of mannheim and researcher at the institute for german language .
but it 's not yet possible to say for sure .
academic research into this whole area is still in its early days - both here in germany and abroad .
" it has a certain beat .
perhaps it has to do with tastes in music .
that 's still completely open at the moment , " said keim . a sign of marginalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been criticized for poor standards of second language tuition provision the phenomenon was first brought to the attention of the chattering classes via literature in 1995 .
turkish-born author feridun zaimoglu 's book kanak sprak contains 24 " transcripts " of meetings with young turkish-german men .
zaimoglu describes the ethnolect as " an underground code " , an expression of marginalization by mainstream german society .
the term kanak is itself the pejorative term for turks and other immigrants from southern europe , the middle east or north africa . over the past few years , there has been growing media exposure for this variant of german .
german comedy duos such as stefan and erkan , and mundstuhl , as dragan und alder lampooned this way of speaking , taking their cue from english comedian sacha baron cohen with his performance of ali g. , a boorish , uneducated youth , of immigrant origin . a number of feature films , such as kebab connection , directed by anno paul and screened in 1995 , and süperseks , which was directed by torsten wacker and came out a year earlier , have also engaged with the theme and there is increasing news media coverage . discrimination in popular culture and news media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feridun zaimoglu brought attention to the phenomenon of turkish ethnolects sociolinguist jannis androutsopoulos , reader in sociolinguistics and media discourse at the department of education at king 's college london , is concerned about the distortions involved in representations of ethnic styles of german in popular culture and public discourse and the impact on german mainstream society .
frequently , comedy tends to play up and even invent linguistic characteristics for laughs , while also generally indicating that the speakers of this style of german are badly educated and poorly behaved . according to androutsopoulos , a similar tendency to stereotyping can also be seen in films , including well-meaning ones that set out to celebrate cultural diversity .
" for example , you have films in which a tough , aggressive and obviously uneducated person of migrant background will be speaking markedly ethnic german , whereas in the same movie the good guys , who are also from an ethnic background tend to speak a much more standard german . " media reporting similarly tends to associate ethnic minority styles of german far too quickly with socially stigmatized categories or identities , according to the greek-born , german-reared sociolinguist , and perpetuates stereotypes . " if it 's non-standard german , it 's linked with the ghetto .
it 's problematic , an index of deviance , and something that wo n't get you anywhere in life , " added androutsopoulos . he believes ethnolect should be regarded much more positively .
" the linguistic reality is that the more people are in command of different styles of their language , the better .
it 's yet another layer in people 's linguistic repertoires .
there are people , also younger people , who are perfectly in command of standard german and are also in command of an ethnic style of german , just as like a regional dialect . " media discrimination towards the language and its speakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the comedy acts provide truly crass impersonations the tendency to ridicule ethnically marked german in popular culture has not gone unnoticed by sarmad ahmad .
" it 's got nothing to do with integration .
it is only about making fun of us . " however , he also acknowledges that some of his peer group can only speak ethnolect .
" many of these young people live here and do n't get to see much more than neukölln or wedding .
they do n't get the opportunity to develop , " he added . as heike wiese points out , this is not a threat to the german language , but a problem for the young people in question and german society at large . " for the young people themselves and for the society that loses them because they ca n't participate in society and have fewer chances professionally it 's a huge problem , " she said . just how enduring this phenomenon is likely to be is hard to predict .
wiese believes like most types of language spoken by teenagers that it will probably die out fairly quickly .
inken keim believes that it could establish itself , but only if people from ethnic minority backgrounds remained in areas with a high concentration of non-native speakers over the period of thirty years or so . at the moment , she believes that the chances are low of any of its features entering mainstream german language - above all because the negative connotations of , for example , turkish in germany , in contrast to the higher status of english . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the population 's radiation exposure due to the operation of nuclear power plants in germany would have to be a least a thousand times higher to be able to explain the observed increase in cancer risk , " he said . bfs said current science held that radiation from reactors themselves or their emissions was too weak outside the perimeter to cause cancer , and other conceivable risk factors also could " not explain this distance-related heightening of risk . " germany generates more than 20,000 megawatts of electricity through nuclear power annually , around a quarter of its needs . despite broad public opposition to the plants , some german officials have suggested giving nuclear power a reprieve in order to reduce climate-damaging emissions from fossil fuels . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , starting two days of talks aimed at creating a new alliance between the continents .
but animosity over colonial rule could derail the talks . " the message is clear : there is no time to lose , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates , hosting the meeting , said .
" we have to begin looking for new solutions for the future of the continents .
you are all here to meet an invitation from history . " in his opening address , socrates said the two days of meetings were intended to be a " summit of equals . " but a row over the invitation of zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe and a call for colonial-era compensation from libyan leader moammar gadhafi threaten to overshadow the meeting , with british prime minister gordon brown boycotting the summit in protest at his presence . while mugabe kept a low-profile on his first visit to europe in more than two years , the equally controversial libyan leader announced his arrival by demanding that the european powers who carved up africa for their own gain should pay for the damage . " the colonial powers must compensate the people that they colonized and whose riches they plundered , " gadhafi said in a speech at lisbon university .
" this will be one of the main issues of the summit , " added gadhafi whose relations with europe are just coming out of the deep freeze after the freeing of a group of nurses accused of deliberately infecting children with aids . while gadhafi 's claim to speak for his peers is questionable , his demand highlighted the complexity of ties between europe and their one-time colonies and how easily the aim of the two-day summit could be blown off course . barroso : europe has neglected its ties with africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso sees the need for increased co-operation eu commission president jose manuel barroso has acknowledged europe has let relations with its old hunting ground drift and there are now plans for such a summit every third year .
his words were echoed by eu aid and development commissioner louis michel who said that the future of the eu lies in a new relationship with africa . the eu and africa must create " a more responsible and a more political partnership built on greater solidarity , ” michel said .
“ if we fail , lisbon will remain in the collective memory as a great missed opportunity . " we need to consider this summit as a launch pad for a new era in the relationship between europe and africa , " he added . " this summit must mark the end of a relationship rooted in conservatism and sometimes in prejudice on both sides and mark the start of a recognition of the real opportunities that are at hand for both sides .

he has been banned from entering the eu since 2002 , but the ban was waived for the summit . britain 's prime minister gordon brown refused to come to the summit when mugabe was invited . but despite that boycott , " we , the whole eu , are unified in our assessment of the situation in the country , " merkel said . zimbabwe concerns entire eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters said international leaders needed to stop ignoring africa " zimbabwe 's situation concerns us all , in europe as well as in africa , " she added .
" we do n't have the right to look away when human rights are trampled underfoot . " the chancellor said the eu 's concerns included zimbabwe 's official annual rate of inflation , which stands at nearly 8,000 percent , as well as attacks on opposition figures ahead of elections set for next year . " a democratic government in zimbabwe , which respects human rights , will have the support of the european union , with the aim of allowing zimbabwe to become a new free and prosperous state , " merkel added . while the session was behind closed-doors with only a copy of merkel 's speech being leaked to journalists , ireland 's prime minister bertie ahern said that merkel 's speech had made uncomfortable listening for mugabe . merkel had expressed her concerns about the " deep political and humanitarian crisis in his country , " ahern told reporters . mugabe had been widely expected to respond to merkel 's speech , but in the event he did not react to it , ahern said .
the zimbabwean president has blamed his country 's economic woes on britain , whom he accuses of failing to honor pledges to fund land redistribution and of inciting the opposition to exact regime change . human rights , trade inseparable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mbeki and merkel agreed the summit offered a chance to both africa and europe in a speech before merkel on the issue of human rights , south african president thabo mbeki did not address zimbabwe , where he has tried to mediate between mugabe and his political foes . mbeki said the summit should work to ensure that africa 's " masses escape from the clutches of poverty . " " we are fully conscious of the fact that good governance and respect for human rights are fundamental to the achievement of this objective , " he added . pressured by china 's growing investment and influence in africa , the europeans hope to agree after the two days of talks to ambitious action plan with the continent to revitalize trade - but also to improve cooperation in areas like immigration and peacekeeping . challenged by the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's colonial past in africa continues to strain relations portuguese prime minister jose socrates said history had " thrown down the gauntlet and challenged us to work together to write together a completely new page in the relationship between europe and africa . " " i think this eu-africa summit is a milestone on the path to better relations between our two continents , " merkel said after her speech . but the issue of mugabe , seen by many in africa as an independence hero , has underlined the difficult relationship between africa and the former colonial powers , some of whom gave up control only a few decades ago . " the real significance of this summit must be to lay the foundations of a new partnership based on mutual respect , " said john kufuor , president of ghana and current chairman of the african union .

political parties across the spectrum are turning to the issue to lure voters in the lead-up to elections in 2009 . in a pitch to distinguish themselves from their coalition partner the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has called for a softening of the prevailing conscription method , which requires all german males above the age of 18 to enter for military service for nine months . " we are not asking for military service to be scrapped but to proceed on a voluntary basis in future , " said spd party head kurt beck . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remains the last staunch supporter of general conscription and recently emphasized it will uphold current practice at its annual cdu summit earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung is a staunch supporter of conscription " i think that in principle we need conscription because it would be hard to find the 60,000 young men who agree to join the bundeswehr each year , " defense minister franz josef jung , a cdu member , told deutschlandfunk radio . he also dismissed beck 's call for " voluntary conscription " as a contradiction in terms . crucial campaign issue with both parties starting their scramble to improve their image within the grand coalition , issues such as conscription could well be crucial in next year 's campaigning ahead of elections in 2009 . mandatory military service not only serves as a focal point to distinguish party programs , but also directly affects the lives of every german male above the age of 18 .
since the number of conscientious objectors has been steadily rising in favor of civil service , conscription might well be an issue that could impact on the outcome of the next elections .
men can also choose to do a year of social work rather than enter the military . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscription could gain in importance during next year 's campaigns german opposition parties are generally united in their rejection of the current conscription practice and have called for its abolishment or suspension . conscription opponents argue that large standing armies are no longer necessary for domestic defense and that specialized , professional troops who can be deployed swiftly in any crisis region on the globe are needed . " conscription can not be justified any more from the security policy angle , " said claudia roth , a greens party leader .
" it also constitutes a massive intrusion into the basic rights of young men . " other critics refer to the majority of nato partners that have already adopted the model of smaller , professional armies saying that germany 's reliance on conscription is dated .
the only nato countries still applying conscription are estonia , lithuania , norway , greece and turkey .
german army conscripts do not serve in military missions abroad and often receive administrational duties . historic issues still cast their shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most nato members have professional armies in contrast to many nato members , historic issues have weighed heavily on german domestic and foreign policy since 1945 .
after world war ii 's disastrous consequences , german politicians wanted to ensure that the new army consisted of " citizens in uniform " in order to guarantee democratic control of the army . the concept of rearming germany was also fostered by nato partners who were confronted with the warsaw pact , led by the soviet union . however , with the end of the cold war and the reunification of germany in 1990 , the future of nato and costly large armies appeared rather blurred .
moreover , germany no longer had any borders with potential enemies and therefore one of the main arguments for conscription was void .
at the same time germany 's responsibility abroad was constantly growing . after the cold war , new threats were found to justify nato 's international role .
but it was only after a long domestic debate that germany agreed to contribute troops to the alliance 's missions in the balkans and later afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently has about 3,000 troops deployed to afghanistan accordingly , opposition parties like the free-market liberal free democratic party demand a suspension of " unnecessary conscription " at home in favor of more funding for a better equipped smaller professional army capable of acting more efficiently abroad under nato rule . as no fast end to the afghanistan mission is expected and calls for an increase of german troops have been made , it is probable that the conscription and military debate will feature in next year 's campaigning .
until then , german governing and opposition parties remain divided on the issue . neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" for example , instead of saying ' ich gehe in die schule ' -lrb- i go to school -rrb- , they would say ' isch geh schule ' -lrb- i go school -rrb- , or ' isch bin görlitzer park ' -lrb- i am görlitzer park -rrb- rather than ' ich bin im görlitzer park ' , " adds the linguist , who works at the university of potsdam . it 's also sprinkled with arabic or turkish words , such as yalla -lrb- arabic for let 's go -rrb- , wallah -lrb- a compressed form of the arabic for by allah which is used to mean " really " -rrb- and lan , short for turkish " ulan " and used to mean " guy " or " dude " -rrb- are frequently featured . similar phenomena have been noted elsewhere in europe .
whereas in britain no single overarching multilingual ethnolect appears to exist , it has been detected in sweden , denmark and the netherlands in areas with a high density of migrants . these european ethnolects even seem to share some common features - despite differences because of variations in the languages involved , according to inken keim , professor at the university of mannheim and researcher at the institute for german language .
but it 's not yet possible to say for sure .

zaimoglu describes the ethnolect as " an underground code " , an expression of marginalization by mainstream german society .
the term kanak is itself the pejorative term for turks and other immigrants from southern europe , the middle east or north africa . over the past few years , there has been growing media exposure for this variant of german .

frequently , comedy tends to play up and even invent linguistic characteristics for laughs , while also generally indicating that the speakers of this style of german are badly educated and poorly behaved . according to androutsopoulos , a similar tendency to stereotyping can also be seen in films , including well-meaning ones that set out to celebrate cultural diversity .
" for example , you have films in which a tough , aggressive and obviously uneducated person of migrant background will be speaking markedly ethnic german , whereas in the same movie the good guys , who are also from an ethnic background tend to speak a much more standard german .

this ethnolect is spoken among young migrants of various ethnic backgrounds as well as young native germans . linguists say that fears in germany that this colloquial " lingua franca " might pose a threat to standard german language are unfounded .
but distorted media representations of this ethnolect could , however , serve to merely reinforce stereotypes about the country 's migrants . in popular culture , it 's frequently exposed to ridicule , while in the media it is frequently described as a social " problem " and depicted as posing a threat to standard german . sarmad ahmad , who is of iraqi origin , first encountered this new variant of german when he and his family went to live in berlin-wedding , a district with a high immigrant population .
he first came to germany nine years ago and spent the first few months attending intensive german lessons . the 20-year-old can switch effortlessly from one type to the other .
" my language split when i started mixing with the teenagers in this district .
i can speak one way or the other .
it 's separate from the other language .
it 's as if it 's ours .
there are also germans who have grown up here in this area who also use it too , " he said . " there are things in the way we speak to one another that are linked to our mother tongue .
in arabic you would just say " come " .
there are n't different endings for the verbs like there are in standard german .
this just gets carried across automatically , " he added . the grammar is simplified and features new constructions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people often use an ethnolect as a secret code it 's not unusual to overhear teenagers conversing hard and fast in " their " language in inner-city districts of berlin . but it 's not restricted to the german capital , professor heike wiese also says the phenomenon has been observed in a whole host of other german cities , from regensburg to hamburg . this german is characterized amongst other things by the omission of particles and prepositions in certain contexts and a certain " grammatical economy " , as wiese describes it . " for example , instead of saying ' ich gehe in die schule ' -lrb- i go to school -rrb- , they would say ' isch geh schule ' -lrb- i go school -rrb- , or ' isch bin görlitzer park ' -lrb- i am görlitzer park -rrb- rather than ' ich bin im görlitzer park ' , " adds the linguist , who works at the university of potsdam . it 's also sprinkled with arabic or turkish words , such as yalla -lrb- arabic for let 's go -rrb- , wallah -lrb- a compressed form of the arabic for by allah which is used to mean " really " -rrb- and lan , short for turkish " ulan " and used to mean " guy " or " dude " -rrb- are frequently featured . similar phenomena have been noted elsewhere in europe .
whereas in britain no single overarching multilingual ethnolect appears to exist , it has been detected in sweden , denmark and the netherlands in areas with a high density of migrants . these european ethnolects even seem to share some common features - despite differences because of variations in the languages involved , according to inken keim , professor at the university of mannheim and researcher at the institute for german language .
but it 's not yet possible to say for sure .
academic research into this whole area is still in its early days - both here in germany and abroad .
" it has a certain beat .
perhaps it has to do with tastes in music .
that 's still completely open at the moment , " said keim . a sign of marginalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been criticized for poor standards of second language tuition provision the phenomenon was first brought to the attention of the chattering classes via literature in 1995 .
turkish-born author feridun zaimoglu 's book kanak sprak contains 24 " transcripts " of meetings with young turkish-german men .
zaimoglu describes the ethnolect as " an underground code " , an expression of marginalization by mainstream german society .
the term kanak is itself the pejorative term for turks and other immigrants from southern europe , the middle east or north africa . over the past few years , there has been growing media exposure for this variant of german .
german comedy duos such as stefan and erkan , and mundstuhl , as dragan und alder lampooned this way of speaking , taking their cue from english comedian sacha baron cohen with his performance of ali g. , a boorish , uneducated youth , of immigrant origin . a number of feature films , such as kebab connection , directed by anno paul and screened in 1995 , and süperseks , which was directed by torsten wacker and came out a year earlier , have also engaged with the theme and there is increasing news media coverage . discrimination in popular culture and news media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feridun zaimoglu brought attention to the phenomenon of turkish ethnolects sociolinguist jannis androutsopoulos , reader in sociolinguistics and media discourse at the department of education at king 's college london , is concerned about the distortions involved in representations of ethnic styles of german in popular culture and public discourse and the impact on german mainstream society .
frequently , comedy tends to play up and even invent linguistic characteristics for laughs , while also generally indicating that the speakers of this style of german are badly educated and poorly behaved . according to androutsopoulos , a similar tendency to stereotyping can also be seen in films , including well-meaning ones that set out to celebrate cultural diversity .
" for example , you have films in which a tough , aggressive and obviously uneducated person of migrant background will be speaking markedly ethnic german , whereas in the same movie the good guys , who are also from an ethnic background tend to speak a much more standard german . " media reporting similarly tends to associate ethnic minority styles of german far too quickly with socially stigmatized categories or identities , according to the greek-born , german-reared sociolinguist , and perpetuates stereotypes . " if it 's non-standard german , it 's linked with the ghetto .
it 's problematic , an index of deviance , and something that wo n't get you anywhere in life , " added androutsopoulos . he believes ethnolect should be regarded much more positively .
" the linguistic reality is that the more people are in command of different styles of their language , the better .
it 's yet another layer in people 's linguistic repertoires .
there are people , also younger people , who are perfectly in command of standard german and are also in command of an ethnic style of german , just as like a regional dialect . " media discrimination towards the language and its speakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the comedy acts provide truly crass impersonations the tendency to ridicule ethnically marked german in popular culture has not gone unnoticed by sarmad ahmad .
" it 's got nothing to do with integration .
it is only about making fun of us . " however , he also acknowledges that some of his peer group can only speak ethnolect .
" many of these young people live here and do n't get to see much more than neukölln or wedding .
they do n't get the opportunity to develop , " he added . as heike wiese points out , this is not a threat to the german language , but a problem for the young people in question and german society at large . " for the young people themselves and for the society that loses them because they ca n't participate in society and have fewer chances professionally it 's a huge problem , " she said . just how enduring this phenomenon is likely to be is hard to predict .
wiese believes like most types of language spoken by teenagers that it will probably die out fairly quickly .

political parties across the spectrum are turning to the issue to lure voters in the lead-up to elections in 2009 . in a pitch to distinguish themselves from their coalition partner the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has called for a softening of the prevailing conscription method , which requires all german males above the age of 18 to enter for military service for nine months . " we are not asking for military service to be scrapped but to proceed on a voluntary basis in future , " said spd party head kurt beck . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remains the last staunch supporter of general conscription and recently emphasized it will uphold current practice at its annual cdu summit earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung is a staunch supporter of conscription " i think that in principle we need conscription because it would be hard to find the 60,000 young men who agree to join the bundeswehr each year , " defense minister franz josef jung , a cdu member , told deutschlandfunk radio . he also dismissed beck 's call for " voluntary conscription " as a contradiction in terms . crucial campaign issue with both parties starting their scramble to improve their image within the grand coalition , issues such as conscription could well be crucial in next year 's campaigning ahead of elections in 2009 . mandatory military service not only serves as a focal point to distinguish party programs , but also directly affects the lives of every german male above the age of 18 .
since the number of conscientious objectors has been steadily rising in favor of civil service , conscription might well be an issue that could impact on the outcome of the next elections .
men can also choose to do a year of social work rather than enter the military . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscription could gain in importance during next year 's campaigns german opposition parties are generally united in their rejection of the current conscription practice and have called for its abolishment or suspension . conscription opponents argue that large standing armies are no longer necessary for domestic defense and that specialized , professional troops who can be deployed swiftly in any crisis region on the globe are needed . " conscription can not be justified any more from the security policy angle , " said claudia roth , a greens party leader .
" it also constitutes a massive intrusion into the basic rights of young men . " other critics refer to the majority of nato partners that have already adopted the model of smaller , professional armies saying that germany 's reliance on conscription is dated .
the only nato countries still applying conscription are estonia , lithuania , norway , greece and turkey .

after world war ii 's disastrous consequences , german politicians wanted to ensure that the new army consisted of " citizens in uniform " in order to guarantee democratic control of the army . the concept of rearming germany was also fostered by nato partners who were confronted with the warsaw pact , led by the soviet union . however , with the end of the cold war and the reunification of germany in 1990 , the future of nato and costly large armies appeared rather blurred .
moreover , germany no longer had any borders with potential enemies and therefore one of the main arguments for conscription was void .
at the same time germany 's responsibility abroad was constantly growing . after the cold war , new threats were found to justify nato 's international role .
but it was only after a long domestic debate that germany agreed to contribute troops to the alliance 's missions in the balkans and later afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently has about 3,000 troops deployed to afghanistan accordingly , opposition parties like the free-market liberal free democratic party demand a suspension of " unnecessary conscription " at home in favor of more funding for a better equipped smaller professional army capable of acting more efficiently abroad under nato rule . as no fast end to the afghanistan mission is expected and calls for an increase of german troops have been made , it is probable that the conscription and military debate will feature in next year 's campaigning .

8 , starting two days of talks aimed at creating a new alliance between the continents .
but animosity over colonial rule could derail the talks . " the message is clear : there is no time to lose , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates , hosting the meeting , said .
" we have to begin looking for new solutions for the future of the continents .
you are all here to meet an invitation from history . " in his opening address , socrates said the two days of meetings were intended to be a " summit of equals . " but a row over the invitation of zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe and a call for colonial-era compensation from libyan leader moammar gadhafi threaten to overshadow the meeting , with british prime minister gordon brown boycotting the summit in protest at his presence . while mugabe kept a low-profile on his first visit to europe in more than two years , the equally controversial libyan leader announced his arrival by demanding that the european powers who carved up africa for their own gain should pay for the damage . " the colonial powers must compensate the people that they colonized and whose riches they plundered , " gadhafi said in a speech at lisbon university .
" this will be one of the main issues of the summit , " added gadhafi whose relations with europe are just coming out of the deep freeze after the freeing of a group of nurses accused of deliberately infecting children with aids . while gadhafi 's claim to speak for his peers is questionable , his demand highlighted the complexity of ties between europe and their one-time colonies and how easily the aim of the two-day summit could be blown off course . barroso : europe has neglected its ties with africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso sees the need for increased co-operation eu commission president jose manuel barroso has acknowledged europe has let relations with its old hunting ground drift and there are now plans for such a summit every third year .
his words were echoed by eu aid and development commissioner louis michel who said that the future of the eu lies in a new relationship with africa . the eu and africa must create " a more responsible and a more political partnership built on greater solidarity , ” michel said .
“ if we fail , lisbon will remain in the collective memory as a great missed opportunity . " we need to consider this summit as a launch pad for a new era in the relationship between europe and africa , " he added . " this summit must mark the end of a relationship rooted in conservatism and sometimes in prejudice on both sides and mark the start of a recognition of the real opportunities that are at hand for both sides . " almost 80 heads of state and government from the european and african unions are set to attend the meeting , which is the second such summit ever and the first since the au was created in 2002 , for talks on cooperation in areas ranging from trade support , energy and migration to education , human rights and science . africa betrayed over trade ; eu concerned with human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resource-rich africa looks to china for economic deals serious differences of opinion , however , remain on issues of trade and human rights , in particular . on trade , some african countries have accused the eu of trying to strong-arm them into accepting allegedly unfavorable trade deals known as economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- , ahead of a world trade organization deadline at the end of the year . europe remains africa 's biggest trading partner and source of aid but china 's growing push into the resource-rich continent as it seeks to fuel its economic growth has shown its influence can not be taken for granted . hopes of a breakthrough on new economic partnership agreements have been dashed this week with south africa , the continent 's economic powerhouse , saying the " detrimental impacts " of the deal offered by the eu had to be addressed . mugabe in spotlight , not marginalized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe 's eu travel ban was lifted for the summit human rights also looks set to be an explosive issue .
eu leaders have promised that the summit will involve a " substantive " debate on the human-rights situation in zimbabwe , where mugabe is accused of conducting a reign of terror and destroying the economy . eu diplomats admit that that risks splitting the summit into pro- and anti-mugabe camps and derailing talks on other issues .
britain 's prime minister brown announced in september that he would boycott the summit if mugabe attended , saying that mugabe 's presence would " divert attention " from other key topics . however , the boycott appears to have had the opposite effect , turning the spotlight on mugabe . the zimbabwean leader , who was banned from the eu for allegedly rigging his re-election five years ago , has portrayed his invitation as a slap in the face for britain whom he accuses of failing to honor commitments to fund land redistribution . while britain 's delegation has stayed at home , other eu leaders such as german chancellor angela merkel , feel the summit offers an opportunity to reproach mugabe and make their points to him personally . " there has been a very negative trend in the zimbabwe regime and this is something we will have to broach , " barroso said .
" but this is not just a summit to look at zimbabwe . " discussions on issues such as zimbabwe , efforts to bring peace to sudan 's darfur region and the conflict in somalia have not been formally timetabled but are expected to crop up in debates on human rights and peace and security . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , to push for a renewal of democracy in zimbabwe , saying the world could not look on as democracy is " trampled underfoot . " " the current state of zimbabwe damages the image of the new africa , " merkel told the leaders of 26 european and 53 african states .
" because this is so , we must take the chance here , in this framework , to put all our efforts together into strengthening democracy . " among her audience was zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , who is regarded in europe as having driven his country to political , agricultural and financial collapse .
he has been banned from entering the eu since 2002 , but the ban was waived for the summit . britain 's prime minister gordon brown refused to come to the summit when mugabe was invited . but despite that boycott , " we , the whole eu , are unified in our assessment of the situation in the country , " merkel said . zimbabwe concerns entire eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters said international leaders needed to stop ignoring africa " zimbabwe 's situation concerns us all , in europe as well as in africa , " she added .
" we do n't have the right to look away when human rights are trampled underfoot . " the chancellor said the eu 's concerns included zimbabwe 's official annual rate of inflation , which stands at nearly 8,000 percent , as well as attacks on opposition figures ahead of elections set for next year . " a democratic government in zimbabwe , which respects human rights , will have the support of the european union , with the aim of allowing zimbabwe to become a new free and prosperous state , " merkel added . while the session was behind closed-doors with only a copy of merkel 's speech being leaked to journalists , ireland 's prime minister bertie ahern said that merkel 's speech had made uncomfortable listening for mugabe . merkel had expressed her concerns about the " deep political and humanitarian crisis in his country , " ahern told reporters . mugabe had been widely expected to respond to merkel 's speech , but in the event he did not react to it , ahern said .
the zimbabwean president has blamed his country 's economic woes on britain , whom he accuses of failing to honor pledges to fund land redistribution and of inciting the opposition to exact regime change . human rights , trade inseparable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mbeki and merkel agreed the summit offered a chance to both africa and europe in a speech before merkel on the issue of human rights , south african president thabo mbeki did not address zimbabwe , where he has tried to mediate between mugabe and his political foes . mbeki said the summit should work to ensure that africa 's " masses escape from the clutches of poverty . " " we are fully conscious of the fact that good governance and respect for human rights are fundamental to the achievement of this objective , " he added . pressured by china 's growing investment and influence in africa , the europeans hope to agree after the two days of talks to ambitious action plan with the continent to revitalize trade - but also to improve cooperation in areas like immigration and peacekeeping . challenged by the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's colonial past in africa continues to strain relations portuguese prime minister jose socrates said history had " thrown down the gauntlet and challenged us to work together to write together a completely new page in the relationship between europe and africa . " " i think this eu-africa summit is a milestone on the path to better relations between our two continents , " merkel said after her speech . but the issue of mugabe , seen by many in africa as an independence hero , has underlined the difficult relationship between africa and the former colonial powers , some of whom gave up control only a few decades ago . " the real significance of this summit must be to lay the foundations of a new partnership based on mutual respect , " said john kufuor , president of ghana and current chairman of the african union .

" our study confirmed that in germany a connection has been observed between the distance of a domicile to the nearest nuclear power plant ... and the risk of developing cancer , such as leukemia , before the fifth birthday , " the daily süddeutsche zeitung quoted the report as saying . government radiation specialists said they could not explain the finding , since there was no direct radiation from the 16 german plants , which are all scheduled for closure in the early 2020s . the study was paid for by the german federal radiation protection agency -lsb- bfs -rsb- the government 's main adviser on nuclear health . it was conducted by the german register of child cancer , an office in mainz which is funded by the 16 german states and the federal health ministry . the study found that 37 children had come down with leukemia in the period between 1980 and 2003 while having home addresses within 5 kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- of nuclear power plants .
the statistical average for germany would have predicted just 17 cases in that group . statistically , the 20 extra cases could be associated with living close to the plants , but the bfs said more research was needed to discover if the presence of reactors was actually the cause of the cancers . doubts over causality remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said more studies needed to be done to explain the current findings german environment minister sigmar gabriel said the government radiation safety committee would analyze the findings and called for additional research to explain the increased number of cancer cases . " the population 's radiation exposure due to the operation of nuclear power plants in germany would have to be a least a thousand times higher to be able to explain the observed increase in cancer risk , " he said . bfs said current science held that radiation from reactors themselves or their emissions was too weak outside the perimeter to cause cancer , and other conceivable risk factors also could " not explain this distance-related heightening of risk . " germany generates more than 20,000 megawatts of electricity through nuclear power annually , around a quarter of its needs . despite broad public opposition to the plants , some german officials have suggested giving nuclear power a reprieve in order to reduce climate-damaging emissions from fossil fuels . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political parties across the spectrum are turning to the issue to lure voters in the lead-up to elections in 2009 . in a pitch to distinguish themselves from their coalition partner the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has called for a softening of the prevailing conscription method , which requires all german males above the age of 18 to enter for military service for nine months . " we are not asking for military service to be scrapped but to proceed on a voluntary basis in future , " said spd party head kurt beck . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remains the last staunch supporter of general conscription and recently emphasized it will uphold current practice at its annual cdu summit earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung is a staunch supporter of conscription " i think that in principle we need conscription because it would be hard to find the 60,000 young men who agree to join the bundeswehr each year , " defense minister franz josef jung , a cdu member , told deutschlandfunk radio . he also dismissed beck 's call for " voluntary conscription " as a contradiction in terms . crucial campaign issue with both parties starting their scramble to improve their image within the grand coalition , issues such as conscription could well be crucial in next year 's campaigning ahead of elections in 2009 . mandatory military service not only serves as a focal point to distinguish party programs , but also directly affects the lives of every german male above the age of 18 .
since the number of conscientious objectors has been steadily rising in favor of civil service , conscription might well be an issue that could impact on the outcome of the next elections .
men can also choose to do a year of social work rather than enter the military . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscription could gain in importance during next year 's campaigns german opposition parties are generally united in their rejection of the current conscription practice and have called for its abolishment or suspension . conscription opponents argue that large standing armies are no longer necessary for domestic defense and that specialized , professional troops who can be deployed swiftly in any crisis region on the globe are needed . " conscription can not be justified any more from the security policy angle , " said claudia roth , a greens party leader .
" it also constitutes a massive intrusion into the basic rights of young men . " other critics refer to the majority of nato partners that have already adopted the model of smaller , professional armies saying that germany 's reliance on conscription is dated .
the only nato countries still applying conscription are estonia , lithuania , norway , greece and turkey .
german army conscripts do not serve in military missions abroad and often receive administrational duties . historic issues still cast their shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most nato members have professional armies in contrast to many nato members , historic issues have weighed heavily on german domestic and foreign policy since 1945 .
after world war ii 's disastrous consequences , german politicians wanted to ensure that the new army consisted of " citizens in uniform " in order to guarantee democratic control of the army . the concept of rearming germany was also fostered by nato partners who were confronted with the warsaw pact , led by the soviet union . however , with the end of the cold war and the reunification of germany in 1990 , the future of nato and costly large armies appeared rather blurred .
moreover , germany no longer had any borders with potential enemies and therefore one of the main arguments for conscription was void .
at the same time germany 's responsibility abroad was constantly growing . after the cold war , new threats were found to justify nato 's international role .
but it was only after a long domestic debate that germany agreed to contribute troops to the alliance 's missions in the balkans and later afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently has about 3,000 troops deployed to afghanistan accordingly , opposition parties like the free-market liberal free democratic party demand a suspension of " unnecessary conscription " at home in favor of more funding for a better equipped smaller professional army capable of acting more efficiently abroad under nato rule . as no fast end to the afghanistan mission is expected and calls for an increase of german troops have been made , it is probable that the conscription and military debate will feature in next year 's campaigning .
until then , german governing and opposition parties remain divided on the issue . neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this ethnolect is spoken among young migrants of various ethnic backgrounds as well as young native germans . linguists say that fears in germany that this colloquial " lingua franca " might pose a threat to standard german language are unfounded .
but distorted media representations of this ethnolect could , however , serve to merely reinforce stereotypes about the country 's migrants . in popular culture , it 's frequently exposed to ridicule , while in the media it is frequently described as a social " problem " and depicted as posing a threat to standard german . sarmad ahmad , who is of iraqi origin , first encountered this new variant of german when he and his family went to live in berlin-wedding , a district with a high immigrant population .
he first came to germany nine years ago and spent the first few months attending intensive german lessons . the 20-year-old can switch effortlessly from one type to the other .
" my language split when i started mixing with the teenagers in this district .
i can speak one way or the other .
it 's separate from the other language .
it 's as if it 's ours .
there are also germans who have grown up here in this area who also use it too , " he said . " there are things in the way we speak to one another that are linked to our mother tongue .
in arabic you would just say " come " .
there are n't different endings for the verbs like there are in standard german .
this just gets carried across automatically , " he added . the grammar is simplified and features new constructions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people often use an ethnolect as a secret code it 's not unusual to overhear teenagers conversing hard and fast in " their " language in inner-city districts of berlin . but it 's not restricted to the german capital , professor heike wiese also says the phenomenon has been observed in a whole host of other german cities , from regensburg to hamburg . this german is characterized amongst other things by the omission of particles and prepositions in certain contexts and a certain " grammatical economy " , as wiese describes it . " for example , instead of saying ' ich gehe in die schule ' -lrb- i go to school -rrb- , they would say ' isch geh schule ' -lrb- i go school -rrb- , or ' isch bin görlitzer park ' -lrb- i am görlitzer park -rrb- rather than ' ich bin im görlitzer park ' , " adds the linguist , who works at the university of potsdam . it 's also sprinkled with arabic or turkish words , such as yalla -lrb- arabic for let 's go -rrb- , wallah -lrb- a compressed form of the arabic for by allah which is used to mean " really " -rrb- and lan , short for turkish " ulan " and used to mean " guy " or " dude " -rrb- are frequently featured . similar phenomena have been noted elsewhere in europe .
whereas in britain no single overarching multilingual ethnolect appears to exist , it has been detected in sweden , denmark and the netherlands in areas with a high density of migrants . these european ethnolects even seem to share some common features - despite differences because of variations in the languages involved , according to inken keim , professor at the university of mannheim and researcher at the institute for german language .
but it 's not yet possible to say for sure .
academic research into this whole area is still in its early days - both here in germany and abroad .
" it has a certain beat .
perhaps it has to do with tastes in music .
that 's still completely open at the moment , " said keim . a sign of marginalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been criticized for poor standards of second language tuition provision the phenomenon was first brought to the attention of the chattering classes via literature in 1995 .
turkish-born author feridun zaimoglu 's book kanak sprak contains 24 " transcripts " of meetings with young turkish-german men .
zaimoglu describes the ethnolect as " an underground code " , an expression of marginalization by mainstream german society .
the term kanak is itself the pejorative term for turks and other immigrants from southern europe , the middle east or north africa . over the past few years , there has been growing media exposure for this variant of german .
german comedy duos such as stefan and erkan , and mundstuhl , as dragan und alder lampooned this way of speaking , taking their cue from english comedian sacha baron cohen with his performance of ali g. , a boorish , uneducated youth , of immigrant origin . a number of feature films , such as kebab connection , directed by anno paul and screened in 1995 , and süperseks , which was directed by torsten wacker and came out a year earlier , have also engaged with the theme and there is increasing news media coverage . discrimination in popular culture and news media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feridun zaimoglu brought attention to the phenomenon of turkish ethnolects sociolinguist jannis androutsopoulos , reader in sociolinguistics and media discourse at the department of education at king 's college london , is concerned about the distortions involved in representations of ethnic styles of german in popular culture and public discourse and the impact on german mainstream society .
frequently , comedy tends to play up and even invent linguistic characteristics for laughs , while also generally indicating that the speakers of this style of german are badly educated and poorly behaved . according to androutsopoulos , a similar tendency to stereotyping can also be seen in films , including well-meaning ones that set out to celebrate cultural diversity .
" for example , you have films in which a tough , aggressive and obviously uneducated person of migrant background will be speaking markedly ethnic german , whereas in the same movie the good guys , who are also from an ethnic background tend to speak a much more standard german . " media reporting similarly tends to associate ethnic minority styles of german far too quickly with socially stigmatized categories or identities , according to the greek-born , german-reared sociolinguist , and perpetuates stereotypes . " if it 's non-standard german , it 's linked with the ghetto .
it 's problematic , an index of deviance , and something that wo n't get you anywhere in life , " added androutsopoulos . he believes ethnolect should be regarded much more positively .
" the linguistic reality is that the more people are in command of different styles of their language , the better .
it 's yet another layer in people 's linguistic repertoires .
there are people , also younger people , who are perfectly in command of standard german and are also in command of an ethnic style of german , just as like a regional dialect . " media discrimination towards the language and its speakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the comedy acts provide truly crass impersonations the tendency to ridicule ethnically marked german in popular culture has not gone unnoticed by sarmad ahmad .
" it 's got nothing to do with integration .
it is only about making fun of us . " however , he also acknowledges that some of his peer group can only speak ethnolect .
" many of these young people live here and do n't get to see much more than neukölln or wedding .
they do n't get the opportunity to develop , " he added . as heike wiese points out , this is not a threat to the german language , but a problem for the young people in question and german society at large . " for the young people themselves and for the society that loses them because they ca n't participate in society and have fewer chances professionally it 's a huge problem , " she said . just how enduring this phenomenon is likely to be is hard to predict .
wiese believes like most types of language spoken by teenagers that it will probably die out fairly quickly .
inken keim believes that it could establish itself , but only if people from ethnic minority backgrounds remained in areas with a high concentration of non-native speakers over the period of thirty years or so . at the moment , she believes that the chances are low of any of its features entering mainstream german language - above all because the negative connotations of , for example , turkish in germany , in contrast to the higher status of english . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political parties across the spectrum are turning to the issue to lure voters in the lead-up to elections in 2009 . in a pitch to distinguish themselves from their coalition partner the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has called for a softening of the prevailing conscription method , which requires all german males above the age of 18 to enter for military service for nine months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 08.12.2007 immigrants help create new type of german language großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the young people generally only use the language among themselves in multicultural urban areas of germany , a new variant of german has evolved with its own grammar and rhythm .
this ethnolect is spoken among young migrants of various ethnic backgrounds as well as young native germans . linguists say that fears in germany that this colloquial " lingua franca " might pose a threat to standard german language are unfounded .
but distorted media representations of this ethnolect could , however , serve to merely reinforce stereotypes about the country 's migrants . in popular culture , it 's frequently exposed to ridicule , while in the media it is frequently described as a social " problem " and depicted as posing a threat to standard german . sarmad ahmad , who is of iraqi origin , first encountered this new variant of german when he and his family went to live in berlin-wedding , a district with a high immigrant population .
he first came to germany nine years ago and spent the first few months attending intensive german lessons . the 20-year-old can switch effortlessly from one type to the other .
" my language split when i started mixing with the teenagers in this district .
i can speak one way or the other .
it 's separate from the other language .
it 's as if it 's ours .
there are also germans who have grown up here in this area who also use it too , " he said . " there are things in the way we speak to one another that are linked to our mother tongue .
in arabic you would just say " come " .
there are n't different endings for the verbs like there are in standard german .
this just gets carried across automatically , " he added . the grammar is simplified and features new constructions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people often use an ethnolect as a secret code it 's not unusual to overhear teenagers conversing hard and fast in " their " language in inner-city districts of berlin . but it 's not restricted to the german capital , professor heike wiese also says the phenomenon has been observed in a whole host of other german cities , from regensburg to hamburg . this german is characterized amongst other things by the omission of particles and prepositions in certain contexts and a certain " grammatical economy " , as wiese describes it . " for example , instead of saying ' ich gehe in die schule ' -lrb- i go to school -rrb- , they would say ' isch geh schule ' -lrb- i go school -rrb- , or ' isch bin görlitzer park ' -lrb- i am görlitzer park -rrb- rather than ' ich bin im görlitzer park ' , " adds the linguist , who works at the university of potsdam . it 's also sprinkled with arabic or turkish words , such as yalla -lrb- arabic for let 's go -rrb- , wallah -lrb- a compressed form of the arabic for by allah which is used to mean " really " -rrb- and lan , short for turkish " ulan " and used to mean " guy " or " dude " -rrb- are frequently featured . similar phenomena have been noted elsewhere in europe .
whereas in britain no single overarching multilingual ethnolect appears to exist , it has been detected in sweden , denmark and the netherlands in areas with a high density of migrants . these european ethnolects even seem to share some common features - despite differences because of variations in the languages involved , according to inken keim , professor at the university of mannheim and researcher at the institute for german language .
but it 's not yet possible to say for sure .
academic research into this whole area is still in its early days - both here in germany and abroad .
" it has a certain beat .
perhaps it has to do with tastes in music .
that 's still completely open at the moment , " said keim . a sign of marginalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been criticized for poor standards of second language tuition provision the phenomenon was first brought to the attention of the chattering classes via literature in 1995 .
turkish-born author feridun zaimoglu 's book kanak sprak contains 24 " transcripts " of meetings with young turkish-german men .
zaimoglu describes the ethnolect as " an underground code " , an expression of marginalization by mainstream german society .
the term kanak is itself the pejorative term for turks and other immigrants from southern europe , the middle east or north africa . over the past few years , there has been growing media exposure for this variant of german .
german comedy duos such as stefan and erkan , and mundstuhl , as dragan und alder lampooned this way of speaking , taking their cue from english comedian sacha baron cohen with his performance of ali g. , a boorish , uneducated youth , of immigrant origin . a number of feature films , such as kebab connection , directed by anno paul and screened in 1995 , and süperseks , which was directed by torsten wacker and came out a year earlier , have also engaged with the theme and there is increasing news media coverage . discrimination in popular culture and news media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feridun zaimoglu brought attention to the phenomenon of turkish ethnolects sociolinguist jannis androutsopoulos , reader in sociolinguistics and media discourse at the department of education at king 's college london , is concerned about the distortions involved in representations of ethnic styles of german in popular culture and public discourse and the impact on german mainstream society .
frequently , comedy tends to play up and even invent linguistic characteristics for laughs , while also generally indicating that the speakers of this style of german are badly educated and poorly behaved . according to androutsopoulos , a similar tendency to stereotyping can also be seen in films , including well-meaning ones that set out to celebrate cultural diversity .
" for example , you have films in which a tough , aggressive and obviously uneducated person of migrant background will be speaking markedly ethnic german , whereas in the same movie the good guys , who are also from an ethnic background tend to speak a much more standard german . " media reporting similarly tends to associate ethnic minority styles of german far too quickly with socially stigmatized categories or identities , according to the greek-born , german-reared sociolinguist , and perpetuates stereotypes . " if it 's non-standard german , it 's linked with the ghetto .
it 's problematic , an index of deviance , and something that wo n't get you anywhere in life , " added androutsopoulos . he believes ethnolect should be regarded much more positively .
" the linguistic reality is that the more people are in command of different styles of their language , the better .
it 's yet another layer in people 's linguistic repertoires .
there are people , also younger people , who are perfectly in command of standard german and are also in command of an ethnic style of german , just as like a regional dialect . " media discrimination towards the language and its speakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the comedy acts provide truly crass impersonations the tendency to ridicule ethnically marked german in popular culture has not gone unnoticed by sarmad ahmad .
" it 's got nothing to do with integration .
it is only about making fun of us . " however , he also acknowledges that some of his peer group can only speak ethnolect .

this ethnolect is spoken among young migrants of various ethnic backgrounds as well as young native germans . linguists say that fears in germany that this colloquial " lingua franca " might pose a threat to standard german language are unfounded .
but distorted media representations of this ethnolect could , however , serve to merely reinforce stereotypes about the country 's migrants . in popular culture , it 's frequently exposed to ridicule , while in the media it is frequently described as a social " problem " and depicted as posing a threat to standard german . sarmad ahmad , who is of iraqi origin , first encountered this new variant of german when he and his family went to live in berlin-wedding , a district with a high immigrant population .
he first came to germany nine years ago and spent the first few months attending intensive german lessons . the 20-year-old can switch effortlessly from one type to the other .
" my language split when i started mixing with the teenagers in this district .
i can speak one way or the other .
it 's separate from the other language .
it 's as if it 's ours .
there are also germans who have grown up here in this area who also use it too , " he said . " there are things in the way we speak to one another that are linked to our mother tongue .
in arabic you would just say " come " .
there are n't different endings for the verbs like there are in standard german .
this just gets carried across automatically , " he added . the grammar is simplified and features new constructions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people often use an ethnolect as a secret code it 's not unusual to overhear teenagers conversing hard and fast in " their " language in inner-city districts of berlin . but it 's not restricted to the german capital , professor heike wiese also says the phenomenon has been observed in a whole host of other german cities , from regensburg to hamburg . this german is characterized amongst other things by the omission of particles and prepositions in certain contexts and a certain " grammatical economy " , as wiese describes it . " for example , instead of saying ' ich gehe in die schule ' -lrb- i go to school -rrb- , they would say ' isch geh schule ' -lrb- i go school -rrb- , or ' isch bin görlitzer park ' -lrb- i am görlitzer park -rrb- rather than ' ich bin im görlitzer park ' , " adds the linguist , who works at the university of potsdam . it 's also sprinkled with arabic or turkish words , such as yalla -lrb- arabic for let 's go -rrb- , wallah -lrb- a compressed form of the arabic for by allah which is used to mean " really " -rrb- and lan , short for turkish " ulan " and used to mean " guy " or " dude " -rrb- are frequently featured . similar phenomena have been noted elsewhere in europe .
whereas in britain no single overarching multilingual ethnolect appears to exist , it has been detected in sweden , denmark and the netherlands in areas with a high density of migrants . these european ethnolects even seem to share some common features - despite differences because of variations in the languages involved , according to inken keim , professor at the university of mannheim and researcher at the institute for german language .
but it 's not yet possible to say for sure .
academic research into this whole area is still in its early days - both here in germany and abroad .
" it has a certain beat .
perhaps it has to do with tastes in music .
that 's still completely open at the moment , " said keim . a sign of marginalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been criticized for poor standards of second language tuition provision the phenomenon was first brought to the attention of the chattering classes via literature in 1995 .
turkish-born author feridun zaimoglu 's book kanak sprak contains 24 " transcripts " of meetings with young turkish-german men .
zaimoglu describes the ethnolect as " an underground code " , an expression of marginalization by mainstream german society .
the term kanak is itself the pejorative term for turks and other immigrants from southern europe , the middle east or north africa . over the past few years , there has been growing media exposure for this variant of german .
german comedy duos such as stefan and erkan , and mundstuhl , as dragan und alder lampooned this way of speaking , taking their cue from english comedian sacha baron cohen with his performance of ali g. , a boorish , uneducated youth , of immigrant origin . a number of feature films , such as kebab connection , directed by anno paul and screened in 1995 , and süperseks , which was directed by torsten wacker and came out a year earlier , have also engaged with the theme and there is increasing news media coverage . discrimination in popular culture and news media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feridun zaimoglu brought attention to the phenomenon of turkish ethnolects sociolinguist jannis androutsopoulos , reader in sociolinguistics and media discourse at the department of education at king 's college london , is concerned about the distortions involved in representations of ethnic styles of german in popular culture and public discourse and the impact on german mainstream society .
frequently , comedy tends to play up and even invent linguistic characteristics for laughs , while also generally indicating that the speakers of this style of german are badly educated and poorly behaved . according to androutsopoulos , a similar tendency to stereotyping can also be seen in films , including well-meaning ones that set out to celebrate cultural diversity .
" for example , you have films in which a tough , aggressive and obviously uneducated person of migrant background will be speaking markedly ethnic german , whereas in the same movie the good guys , who are also from an ethnic background tend to speak a much more standard german . " media reporting similarly tends to associate ethnic minority styles of german far too quickly with socially stigmatized categories or identities , according to the greek-born , german-reared sociolinguist , and perpetuates stereotypes . " if it 's non-standard german , it 's linked with the ghetto .
it 's problematic , an index of deviance , and something that wo n't get you anywhere in life , " added androutsopoulos . he believes ethnolect should be regarded much more positively .
" the linguistic reality is that the more people are in command of different styles of their language , the better .
it 's yet another layer in people 's linguistic repertoires .
there are people , also younger people , who are perfectly in command of standard german and are also in command of an ethnic style of german , just as like a regional dialect . " media discrimination towards the language and its speakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the comedy acts provide truly crass impersonations the tendency to ridicule ethnically marked german in popular culture has not gone unnoticed by sarmad ahmad .
" it 's got nothing to do with integration .
it is only about making fun of us . " however , he also acknowledges that some of his peer group can only speak ethnolect .

this ethnolect is spoken among young migrants of various ethnic backgrounds as well as young native germans . linguists say that fears in germany that this colloquial " lingua franca " might pose a threat to standard german language are unfounded .
but distorted media representations of this ethnolect could , however , serve to merely reinforce stereotypes about the country 's migrants . in popular culture , it 's frequently exposed to ridicule , while in the media it is frequently described as a social " problem " and depicted as posing a threat to standard german . sarmad ahmad , who is of iraqi origin , first encountered this new variant of german when he and his family went to live in berlin-wedding , a district with a high immigrant population .
he first came to germany nine years ago and spent the first few months attending intensive german lessons . the 20-year-old can switch effortlessly from one type to the other .
" my language split when i started mixing with the teenagers in this district .
i can speak one way or the other .
it 's separate from the other language .
it 's as if it 's ours .
there are also germans who have grown up here in this area who also use it too , " he said . " there are things in the way we speak to one another that are linked to our mother tongue .
in arabic you would just say " come " .
there are n't different endings for the verbs like there are in standard german .
this just gets carried across automatically , " he added . the grammar is simplified and features new constructions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people often use an ethnolect as a secret code it 's not unusual to overhear teenagers conversing hard and fast in " their " language in inner-city districts of berlin . but it 's not restricted to the german capital , professor heike wiese also says the phenomenon has been observed in a whole host of other german cities , from regensburg to hamburg . this german is characterized amongst other things by the omission of particles and prepositions in certain contexts and a certain " grammatical economy " , as wiese describes it . " for example , instead of saying ' ich gehe in die schule ' -lrb- i go to school -rrb- , they would say ' isch geh schule ' -lrb- i go school -rrb- , or ' isch bin görlitzer park ' -lrb- i am görlitzer park -rrb- rather than ' ich bin im görlitzer park ' , " adds the linguist , who works at the university of potsdam . it 's also sprinkled with arabic or turkish words , such as yalla -lrb- arabic for let 's go -rrb- , wallah -lrb- a compressed form of the arabic for by allah which is used to mean " really " -rrb- and lan , short for turkish " ulan " and used to mean " guy " or " dude " -rrb- are frequently featured . similar phenomena have been noted elsewhere in europe .
whereas in britain no single overarching multilingual ethnolect appears to exist , it has been detected in sweden , denmark and the netherlands in areas with a high density of migrants . these european ethnolects even seem to share some common features - despite differences because of variations in the languages involved , according to inken keim , professor at the university of mannheim and researcher at the institute for german language .
but it 's not yet possible to say for sure .
academic research into this whole area is still in its early days - both here in germany and abroad .
" it has a certain beat .
perhaps it has to do with tastes in music .
that 's still completely open at the moment , " said keim . a sign of marginalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been criticized for poor standards of second language tuition provision the phenomenon was first brought to the attention of the chattering classes via literature in 1995 .
turkish-born author feridun zaimoglu 's book kanak sprak contains 24 " transcripts " of meetings with young turkish-german men .
zaimoglu describes the ethnolect as " an underground code " , an expression of marginalization by mainstream german society .
the term kanak is itself the pejorative term for turks and other immigrants from southern europe , the middle east or north africa . over the past few years , there has been growing media exposure for this variant of german .
german comedy duos such as stefan and erkan , and mundstuhl , as dragan und alder lampooned this way of speaking , taking their cue from english comedian sacha baron cohen with his performance of ali g. , a boorish , uneducated youth , of immigrant origin . a number of feature films , such as kebab connection , directed by anno paul and screened in 1995 , and süperseks , which was directed by torsten wacker and came out a year earlier , have also engaged with the theme and there is increasing news media coverage . discrimination in popular culture and news media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feridun zaimoglu brought attention to the phenomenon of turkish ethnolects sociolinguist jannis androutsopoulos , reader in sociolinguistics and media discourse at the department of education at king 's college london , is concerned about the distortions involved in representations of ethnic styles of german in popular culture and public discourse and the impact on german mainstream society .
frequently , comedy tends to play up and even invent linguistic characteristics for laughs , while also generally indicating that the speakers of this style of german are badly educated and poorly behaved . according to androutsopoulos , a similar tendency to stereotyping can also be seen in films , including well-meaning ones that set out to celebrate cultural diversity .
" for example , you have films in which a tough , aggressive and obviously uneducated person of migrant background will be speaking markedly ethnic german , whereas in the same movie the good guys , who are also from an ethnic background tend to speak a much more standard german . " media reporting similarly tends to associate ethnic minority styles of german far too quickly with socially stigmatized categories or identities , according to the greek-born , german-reared sociolinguist , and perpetuates stereotypes . " if it 's non-standard german , it 's linked with the ghetto .
it 's problematic , an index of deviance , and something that wo n't get you anywhere in life , " added androutsopoulos . he believes ethnolect should be regarded much more positively .
" the linguistic reality is that the more people are in command of different styles of their language , the better .
it 's yet another layer in people 's linguistic repertoires .
there are people , also younger people , who are perfectly in command of standard german and are also in command of an ethnic style of german , just as like a regional dialect . " media discrimination towards the language and its speakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the comedy acts provide truly crass impersonations the tendency to ridicule ethnically marked german in popular culture has not gone unnoticed by sarmad ahmad .

8 , the german government has threatened to claw back subsidies for the project near dresden that has been opposed by unesco . german nature-lovers wept saturday as foresters with chain-saws cut down several oak trees at the site of a planned bridge that has raised the ire of the united nations world cultural body unesco . about 400 anti-bridge protesters , some with tears in their eyes , tried to stop the trees from being cut down with some holding hands for a sit-in round the trees .
riot police dragged them away so work could begin . " these trees survived the bombing by the us and british military on february 13 , 1945 but not the actions of our saxon government , " one elderly woman told the dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests in dresden did not becoming violent the demonstrations were latest protests against building the 160 million euro -lrb- $ 235 million -rrb- bridge , which began two weeks ago with site clearance .
additional protests are planned in the city on sunday and monday . federal funds threatened earlier in the week , a german transport ministry spokeswoman said legal counsel had been asked to examine whether the project is at odds with germany 's international undertakings to unesco .
she said steps could be taken to reclaim the money if this were the case .
the spokeswoman also said a legal review was " normal " after federal subsidies had been paid . plans for the waldschlößchen bridge , which will cross river meadows four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- east of the baroque city center of dresden , have divided the city .

in a 2005 referendum , city residents voted in favor of the move . unesco listed a 20-kilometer section of the valley as a world heritage site in 2004 and has threatened to withdraw this status if the bridge is not made less intrusive . although courts have ruled that a unesco treaty can not prevent the project , a report by federal counsel maintained that saxony is bound by germany 's treaty undertakings , she said .
the state government of saxony said it has not seen the legal report .

political parties across the spectrum are turning to the issue to lure voters in the lead-up to elections in 2009 . in a pitch to distinguish themselves from their coalition partner the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has called for a softening of the prevailing conscription method , which requires all german males above the age of 18 to enter for military service for nine months . " we are not asking for military service to be scrapped but to proceed on a voluntary basis in future , " said spd party head kurt beck . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remains the last staunch supporter of general conscription and recently emphasized it will uphold current practice at its annual cdu summit earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung is a staunch supporter of conscription " i think that in principle we need conscription because it would be hard to find the 60,000 young men who agree to join the bundeswehr each year , " defense minister franz josef jung , a cdu member , told deutschlandfunk radio . he also dismissed beck 's call for " voluntary conscription " as a contradiction in terms . crucial campaign issue with both parties starting their scramble to improve their image within the grand coalition , issues such as conscription could well be crucial in next year 's campaigning ahead of elections in 2009 . mandatory military service not only serves as a focal point to distinguish party programs , but also directly affects the lives of every german male above the age of 18 .
since the number of conscientious objectors has been steadily rising in favor of civil service , conscription might well be an issue that could impact on the outcome of the next elections .
men can also choose to do a year of social work rather than enter the military . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscription could gain in importance during next year 's campaigns german opposition parties are generally united in their rejection of the current conscription practice and have called for its abolishment or suspension . conscription opponents argue that large standing armies are no longer necessary for domestic defense and that specialized , professional troops who can be deployed swiftly in any crisis region on the globe are needed . " conscription can not be justified any more from the security policy angle , " said claudia roth , a greens party leader .
" it also constitutes a massive intrusion into the basic rights of young men . " other critics refer to the majority of nato partners that have already adopted the model of smaller , professional armies saying that germany 's reliance on conscription is dated .
the only nato countries still applying conscription are estonia , lithuania , norway , greece and turkey .
german army conscripts do not serve in military missions abroad and often receive administrational duties . historic issues still cast their shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most nato members have professional armies in contrast to many nato members , historic issues have weighed heavily on german domestic and foreign policy since 1945 .
after world war ii 's disastrous consequences , german politicians wanted to ensure that the new army consisted of " citizens in uniform " in order to guarantee democratic control of the army . the concept of rearming germany was also fostered by nato partners who were confronted with the warsaw pact , led by the soviet union . however , with the end of the cold war and the reunification of germany in 1990 , the future of nato and costly large armies appeared rather blurred .
moreover , germany no longer had any borders with potential enemies and therefore one of the main arguments for conscription was void .
at the same time germany 's responsibility abroad was constantly growing . after the cold war , new threats were found to justify nato 's international role .
but it was only after a long domestic debate that germany agreed to contribute troops to the alliance 's missions in the balkans and later afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently has about 3,000 troops deployed to afghanistan accordingly , opposition parties like the free-market liberal free democratic party demand a suspension of " unnecessary conscription " at home in favor of more funding for a better equipped smaller professional army capable of acting more efficiently abroad under nato rule . as no fast end to the afghanistan mission is expected and calls for an increase of german troops have been made , it is probable that the conscription and military debate will feature in next year 's campaigning .
until then , german governing and opposition parties remain divided on the issue . neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after world war ii 's disastrous consequences , german politicians wanted to ensure that the new army consisted of " citizens in uniform " in order to guarantee democratic control of the army . the concept of rearming germany was also fostered by nato partners who were confronted with the warsaw pact , led by the soviet union . however , with the end of the cold war and the reunification of germany in 1990 , the future of nato and costly large armies appeared rather blurred .
moreover , germany no longer had any borders with potential enemies and therefore one of the main arguments for conscription was void .
at the same time germany 's responsibility abroad was constantly growing . after the cold war , new threats were found to justify nato 's international role .
but it was only after a long domestic debate that germany agreed to contribute troops to the alliance 's missions in the balkans and later afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently has about 3,000 troops deployed to afghanistan accordingly , opposition parties like the free-market liberal free democratic party demand a suspension of " unnecessary conscription " at home in favor of more funding for a better equipped smaller professional army capable of acting more efficiently abroad under nato rule . as no fast end to the afghanistan mission is expected and calls for an increase of german troops have been made , it is probable that the conscription and military debate will feature in next year 's campaigning .
until then , german governing and opposition parties remain divided on the issue . neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this ethnolect is spoken among young migrants of various ethnic backgrounds as well as young native germans . linguists say that fears in germany that this colloquial " lingua franca " might pose a threat to standard german language are unfounded .
but distorted media representations of this ethnolect could , however , serve to merely reinforce stereotypes about the country 's migrants . in popular culture , it 's frequently exposed to ridicule , while in the media it is frequently described as a social " problem " and depicted as posing a threat to standard german . sarmad ahmad , who is of iraqi origin , first encountered this new variant of german when he and his family went to live in berlin-wedding , a district with a high immigrant population .
he first came to germany nine years ago and spent the first few months attending intensive german lessons . the 20-year-old can switch effortlessly from one type to the other .
" my language split when i started mixing with the teenagers in this district .
i can speak one way or the other .
it 's separate from the other language .
it 's as if it 's ours .
there are also germans who have grown up here in this area who also use it too , " he said . " there are things in the way we speak to one another that are linked to our mother tongue .
in arabic you would just say " come " .
there are n't different endings for the verbs like there are in standard german .
this just gets carried across automatically , " he added . the grammar is simplified and features new constructions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people often use an ethnolect as a secret code it 's not unusual to overhear teenagers conversing hard and fast in " their " language in inner-city districts of berlin . but it 's not restricted to the german capital , professor heike wiese also says the phenomenon has been observed in a whole host of other german cities , from regensburg to hamburg . this german is characterized amongst other things by the omission of particles and prepositions in certain contexts and a certain " grammatical economy " , as wiese describes it . " for example , instead of saying ' ich gehe in die schule ' -lrb- i go to school -rrb- , they would say ' isch geh schule ' -lrb- i go school -rrb- , or ' isch bin görlitzer park ' -lrb- i am görlitzer park -rrb- rather than ' ich bin im görlitzer park ' , " adds the linguist , who works at the university of potsdam . it 's also sprinkled with arabic or turkish words , such as yalla -lrb- arabic for let 's go -rrb- , wallah -lrb- a compressed form of the arabic for by allah which is used to mean " really " -rrb- and lan , short for turkish " ulan " and used to mean " guy " or " dude " -rrb- are frequently featured . similar phenomena have been noted elsewhere in europe .
whereas in britain no single overarching multilingual ethnolect appears to exist , it has been detected in sweden , denmark and the netherlands in areas with a high density of migrants . these european ethnolects even seem to share some common features - despite differences because of variations in the languages involved , according to inken keim , professor at the university of mannheim and researcher at the institute for german language .
but it 's not yet possible to say for sure .
academic research into this whole area is still in its early days - both here in germany and abroad .
" it has a certain beat .
perhaps it has to do with tastes in music .
that 's still completely open at the moment , " said keim . a sign of marginalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been criticized for poor standards of second language tuition provision the phenomenon was first brought to the attention of the chattering classes via literature in 1995 .
turkish-born author feridun zaimoglu 's book kanak sprak contains 24 " transcripts " of meetings with young turkish-german men .
zaimoglu describes the ethnolect as " an underground code " , an expression of marginalization by mainstream german society .
the term kanak is itself the pejorative term for turks and other immigrants from southern europe , the middle east or north africa . over the past few years , there has been growing media exposure for this variant of german .
german comedy duos such as stefan and erkan , and mundstuhl , as dragan und alder lampooned this way of speaking , taking their cue from english comedian sacha baron cohen with his performance of ali g. , a boorish , uneducated youth , of immigrant origin . a number of feature films , such as kebab connection , directed by anno paul and screened in 1995 , and süperseks , which was directed by torsten wacker and came out a year earlier , have also engaged with the theme and there is increasing news media coverage . discrimination in popular culture and news media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feridun zaimoglu brought attention to the phenomenon of turkish ethnolects sociolinguist jannis androutsopoulos , reader in sociolinguistics and media discourse at the department of education at king 's college london , is concerned about the distortions involved in representations of ethnic styles of german in popular culture and public discourse and the impact on german mainstream society .
frequently , comedy tends to play up and even invent linguistic characteristics for laughs , while also generally indicating that the speakers of this style of german are badly educated and poorly behaved . according to androutsopoulos , a similar tendency to stereotyping can also be seen in films , including well-meaning ones that set out to celebrate cultural diversity .
" for example , you have films in which a tough , aggressive and obviously uneducated person of migrant background will be speaking markedly ethnic german , whereas in the same movie the good guys , who are also from an ethnic background tend to speak a much more standard german . " media reporting similarly tends to associate ethnic minority styles of german far too quickly with socially stigmatized categories or identities , according to the greek-born , german-reared sociolinguist , and perpetuates stereotypes . " if it 's non-standard german , it 's linked with the ghetto .
it 's problematic , an index of deviance , and something that wo n't get you anywhere in life , " added androutsopoulos . he believes ethnolect should be regarded much more positively .
" the linguistic reality is that the more people are in command of different styles of their language , the better .
it 's yet another layer in people 's linguistic repertoires .
there are people , also younger people , who are perfectly in command of standard german and are also in command of an ethnic style of german , just as like a regional dialect . " media discrimination towards the language and its speakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the comedy acts provide truly crass impersonations the tendency to ridicule ethnically marked german in popular culture has not gone unnoticed by sarmad ahmad .
" it 's got nothing to do with integration .
it is only about making fun of us . " however , he also acknowledges that some of his peer group can only speak ethnolect .
" many of these young people live here and do n't get to see much more than neukölln or wedding .
they do n't get the opportunity to develop , " he added . as heike wiese points out , this is not a threat to the german language , but a problem for the young people in question and german society at large . " for the young people themselves and for the society that loses them because they ca n't participate in society and have fewer chances professionally it 's a huge problem , " she said . just how enduring this phenomenon is likely to be is hard to predict .
wiese believes like most types of language spoken by teenagers that it will probably die out fairly quickly .
inken keim believes that it could establish itself , but only if people from ethnic minority backgrounds remained in areas with a high concentration of non-native speakers over the period of thirty years or so . at the moment , she believes that the chances are low of any of its features entering mainstream german language - above all because the negative connotations of , for example , turkish in germany , in contrast to the higher status of english . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if it 's non-standard german , it 's linked with the ghetto .
it 's problematic , an index of deviance , and something that wo n't get you anywhere in life , " added androutsopoulos . he believes ethnolect should be regarded much more positively .
" the linguistic reality is that the more people are in command of different styles of their language , the better .
it 's yet another layer in people 's linguistic repertoires .
there are people , also younger people , who are perfectly in command of standard german and are also in command of an ethnic style of german , just as like a regional dialect . " media discrimination towards the language and its speakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the comedy acts provide truly crass impersonations the tendency to ridicule ethnically marked german in popular culture has not gone unnoticed by sarmad ahmad .
" it 's got nothing to do with integration .
it is only about making fun of us . " however , he also acknowledges that some of his peer group can only speak ethnolect .
" many of these young people live here and do n't get to see much more than neukölln or wedding .
they do n't get the opportunity to develop , " he added . as heike wiese points out , this is not a threat to the german language , but a problem for the young people in question and german society at large . " for the young people themselves and for the society that loses them because they ca n't participate in society and have fewer chances professionally it 's a huge problem , " she said . just how enduring this phenomenon is likely to be is hard to predict .
wiese believes like most types of language spoken by teenagers that it will probably die out fairly quickly .
inken keim believes that it could establish itself , but only if people from ethnic minority backgrounds remained in areas with a high concentration of non-native speakers over the period of thirty years or so . at the moment , she believes that the chances are low of any of its features entering mainstream german language - above all because the negative connotations of , for example , turkish in germany , in contrast to the higher status of english . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political parties across the spectrum are turning to the issue to lure voters in the lead-up to elections in 2009 . in a pitch to distinguish themselves from their coalition partner the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has called for a softening of the prevailing conscription method , which requires all german males above the age of 18 to enter for military service for nine months . " we are not asking for military service to be scrapped but to proceed on a voluntary basis in future , " said spd party head kurt beck . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remains the last staunch supporter of general conscription and recently emphasized it will uphold current practice at its annual cdu summit earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung is a staunch supporter of conscription " i think that in principle we need conscription because it would be hard to find the 60,000 young men who agree to join the bundeswehr each year , " defense minister franz josef jung , a cdu member , told deutschlandfunk radio . he also dismissed beck 's call for " voluntary conscription " as a contradiction in terms . crucial campaign issue with both parties starting their scramble to improve their image within the grand coalition , issues such as conscription could well be crucial in next year 's campaigning ahead of elections in 2009 . mandatory military service not only serves as a focal point to distinguish party programs , but also directly affects the lives of every german male above the age of 18 .
since the number of conscientious objectors has been steadily rising in favor of civil service , conscription might well be an issue that could impact on the outcome of the next elections .

" conscription can not be justified any more from the security policy angle , " said claudia roth , a greens party leader .
" it also constitutes a massive intrusion into the basic rights of young men . " other critics refer to the majority of nato partners that have already adopted the model of smaller , professional armies saying that germany 's reliance on conscription is dated .
the only nato countries still applying conscription are estonia , lithuania , norway , greece and turkey .
german army conscripts do not serve in military missions abroad and often receive administrational duties . historic issues still cast their shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most nato members have professional armies in contrast to many nato members , historic issues have weighed heavily on german domestic and foreign policy since 1945 .
after world war ii 's disastrous consequences , german politicians wanted to ensure that the new army consisted of " citizens in uniform " in order to guarantee democratic control of the army . the concept of rearming germany was also fostered by nato partners who were confronted with the warsaw pact , led by the soviet union . however , with the end of the cold war and the reunification of germany in 1990 , the future of nato and costly large armies appeared rather blurred .
moreover , germany no longer had any borders with potential enemies and therefore one of the main arguments for conscription was void .
at the same time germany 's responsibility abroad was constantly growing . after the cold war , new threats were found to justify nato 's international role .
but it was only after a long domestic debate that germany agreed to contribute troops to the alliance 's missions in the balkans and later afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently has about 3,000 troops deployed to afghanistan accordingly , opposition parties like the free-market liberal free democratic party demand a suspension of " unnecessary conscription " at home in favor of more funding for a better equipped smaller professional army capable of acting more efficiently abroad under nato rule . as no fast end to the afghanistan mission is expected and calls for an increase of german troops have been made , it is probable that the conscription and military debate will feature in next year 's campaigning .

this ethnolect is spoken among young migrants of various ethnic backgrounds as well as young native germans . linguists say that fears in germany that this colloquial " lingua franca " might pose a threat to standard german language are unfounded .
but distorted media representations of this ethnolect could , however , serve to merely reinforce stereotypes about the country 's migrants . in popular culture , it 's frequently exposed to ridicule , while in the media it is frequently described as a social " problem " and depicted as posing a threat to standard german . sarmad ahmad , who is of iraqi origin , first encountered this new variant of german when he and his family went to live in berlin-wedding , a district with a high immigrant population .
he first came to germany nine years ago and spent the first few months attending intensive german lessons . the 20-year-old can switch effortlessly from one type to the other .
" my language split when i started mixing with the teenagers in this district .
i can speak one way or the other .
it 's separate from the other language .
it 's as if it 's ours .
there are also germans who have grown up here in this area who also use it too , " he said . " there are things in the way we speak to one another that are linked to our mother tongue .
in arabic you would just say " come " .
there are n't different endings for the verbs like there are in standard german .
this just gets carried across automatically , " he added . the grammar is simplified and features new constructions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people often use an ethnolect as a secret code it 's not unusual to overhear teenagers conversing hard and fast in " their " language in inner-city districts of berlin . but it 's not restricted to the german capital , professor heike wiese also says the phenomenon has been observed in a whole host of other german cities , from regensburg to hamburg . this german is characterized amongst other things by the omission of particles and prepositions in certain contexts and a certain " grammatical economy " , as wiese describes it . " for example , instead of saying ' ich gehe in die schule ' -lrb- i go to school -rrb- , they would say ' isch geh schule ' -lrb- i go school -rrb- , or ' isch bin görlitzer park ' -lrb- i am görlitzer park -rrb- rather than ' ich bin im görlitzer park ' , " adds the linguist , who works at the university of potsdam . it 's also sprinkled with arabic or turkish words , such as yalla -lrb- arabic for let 's go -rrb- , wallah -lrb- a compressed form of the arabic for by allah which is used to mean " really " -rrb- and lan , short for turkish " ulan " and used to mean " guy " or " dude " -rrb- are frequently featured . similar phenomena have been noted elsewhere in europe .
whereas in britain no single overarching multilingual ethnolect appears to exist , it has been detected in sweden , denmark and the netherlands in areas with a high density of migrants . these european ethnolects even seem to share some common features - despite differences because of variations in the languages involved , according to inken keim , professor at the university of mannheim and researcher at the institute for german language .
but it 's not yet possible to say for sure .
academic research into this whole area is still in its early days - both here in germany and abroad .
" it has a certain beat .
perhaps it has to do with tastes in music .
that 's still completely open at the moment , " said keim . a sign of marginalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been criticized for poor standards of second language tuition provision the phenomenon was first brought to the attention of the chattering classes via literature in 1995 .
turkish-born author feridun zaimoglu 's book kanak sprak contains 24 " transcripts " of meetings with young turkish-german men .
zaimoglu describes the ethnolect as " an underground code " , an expression of marginalization by mainstream german society .
the term kanak is itself the pejorative term for turks and other immigrants from southern europe , the middle east or north africa . over the past few years , there has been growing media exposure for this variant of german .
german comedy duos such as stefan and erkan , and mundstuhl , as dragan und alder lampooned this way of speaking , taking their cue from english comedian sacha baron cohen with his performance of ali g. , a boorish , uneducated youth , of immigrant origin . a number of feature films , such as kebab connection , directed by anno paul and screened in 1995 , and süperseks , which was directed by torsten wacker and came out a year earlier , have also engaged with the theme and there is increasing news media coverage . discrimination in popular culture and news media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feridun zaimoglu brought attention to the phenomenon of turkish ethnolects sociolinguist jannis androutsopoulos , reader in sociolinguistics and media discourse at the department of education at king 's college london , is concerned about the distortions involved in representations of ethnic styles of german in popular culture and public discourse and the impact on german mainstream society .
frequently , comedy tends to play up and even invent linguistic characteristics for laughs , while also generally indicating that the speakers of this style of german are badly educated and poorly behaved . according to androutsopoulos , a similar tendency to stereotyping can also be seen in films , including well-meaning ones that set out to celebrate cultural diversity .
" for example , you have films in which a tough , aggressive and obviously uneducated person of migrant background will be speaking markedly ethnic german , whereas in the same movie the good guys , who are also from an ethnic background tend to speak a much more standard german . " media reporting similarly tends to associate ethnic minority styles of german far too quickly with socially stigmatized categories or identities , according to the greek-born , german-reared sociolinguist , and perpetuates stereotypes . " if it 's non-standard german , it 's linked with the ghetto .
it 's problematic , an index of deviance , and something that wo n't get you anywhere in life , " added androutsopoulos . he believes ethnolect should be regarded much more positively .
" the linguistic reality is that the more people are in command of different styles of their language , the better .
it 's yet another layer in people 's linguistic repertoires .
there are people , also younger people , who are perfectly in command of standard german and are also in command of an ethnic style of german , just as like a regional dialect . " media discrimination towards the language and its speakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the comedy acts provide truly crass impersonations the tendency to ridicule ethnically marked german in popular culture has not gone unnoticed by sarmad ahmad .
" it 's got nothing to do with integration .
it is only about making fun of us . " however , he also acknowledges that some of his peer group can only speak ethnolect .
" many of these young people live here and do n't get to see much more than neukölln or wedding .
they do n't get the opportunity to develop , " he added . as heike wiese points out , this is not a threat to the german language , but a problem for the young people in question and german society at large . " for the young people themselves and for the society that loses them because they ca n't participate in society and have fewer chances professionally it 's a huge problem , " she said . just how enduring this phenomenon is likely to be is hard to predict .
wiese believes like most types of language spoken by teenagers that it will probably die out fairly quickly .
inken keim believes that it could establish itself , but only if people from ethnic minority backgrounds remained in areas with a high concentration of non-native speakers over the period of thirty years or so . at the moment , she believes that the chances are low of any of its features entering mainstream german language - above all because the negative connotations of , for example , turkish in germany , in contrast to the higher status of english . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are not asking for military service to be scrapped but to proceed on a voluntary basis in future , " said spd party head kurt beck . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remains the last staunch supporter of general conscription and recently emphasized it will uphold current practice at its annual cdu summit earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung is a staunch supporter of conscription " i think that in principle we need conscription because it would be hard to find the 60,000 young men who agree to join the bundeswehr each year , " defense minister franz josef jung , a cdu member , told deutschlandfunk radio . he also dismissed beck 's call for " voluntary conscription " as a contradiction in terms . crucial campaign issue with both parties starting their scramble to improve their image within the grand coalition , issues such as conscription could well be crucial in next year 's campaigning ahead of elections in 2009 . mandatory military service not only serves as a focal point to distinguish party programs , but also directly affects the lives of every german male above the age of 18 .

" it also constitutes a massive intrusion into the basic rights of young men . " other critics refer to the majority of nato partners that have already adopted the model of smaller , professional armies saying that germany 's reliance on conscription is dated .
the only nato countries still applying conscription are estonia , lithuania , norway , greece and turkey .
german army conscripts do not serve in military missions abroad and often receive administrational duties . historic issues still cast their shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most nato members have professional armies in contrast to many nato members , historic issues have weighed heavily on german domestic and foreign policy since 1945 .
after world war ii 's disastrous consequences , german politicians wanted to ensure that the new army consisted of " citizens in uniform " in order to guarantee democratic control of the army . the concept of rearming germany was also fostered by nato partners who were confronted with the warsaw pact , led by the soviet union . however , with the end of the cold war and the reunification of germany in 1990 , the future of nato and costly large armies appeared rather blurred .
moreover , germany no longer had any borders with potential enemies and therefore one of the main arguments for conscription was void .
at the same time germany 's responsibility abroad was constantly growing . after the cold war , new threats were found to justify nato 's international role .
but it was only after a long domestic debate that germany agreed to contribute troops to the alliance 's missions in the balkans and later afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently has about 3,000 troops deployed to afghanistan accordingly , opposition parties like the free-market liberal free democratic party demand a suspension of " unnecessary conscription " at home in favor of more funding for a better equipped smaller professional army capable of acting more efficiently abroad under nato rule . as no fast end to the afghanistan mission is expected and calls for an increase of german troops have been made , it is probable that the conscription and military debate will feature in next year 's campaigning .
until then , german governing and opposition parties remain divided on the issue . neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this ethnolect is spoken among young migrants of various ethnic backgrounds as well as young native germans . linguists say that fears in germany that this colloquial " lingua franca " might pose a threat to standard german language are unfounded .
but distorted media representations of this ethnolect could , however , serve to merely reinforce stereotypes about the country 's migrants . in popular culture , it 's frequently exposed to ridicule , while in the media it is frequently described as a social " problem " and depicted as posing a threat to standard german . sarmad ahmad , who is of iraqi origin , first encountered this new variant of german when he and his family went to live in berlin-wedding , a district with a high immigrant population .
he first came to germany nine years ago and spent the first few months attending intensive german lessons . the 20-year-old can switch effortlessly from one type to the other .
" my language split when i started mixing with the teenagers in this district .
i can speak one way or the other .
it 's separate from the other language .
it 's as if it 's ours .
there are also germans who have grown up here in this area who also use it too , " he said . " there are things in the way we speak to one another that are linked to our mother tongue .
in arabic you would just say " come " .
there are n't different endings for the verbs like there are in standard german .
this just gets carried across automatically , " he added . the grammar is simplified and features new constructions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people often use an ethnolect as a secret code it 's not unusual to overhear teenagers conversing hard and fast in " their " language in inner-city districts of berlin . but it 's not restricted to the german capital , professor heike wiese also says the phenomenon has been observed in a whole host of other german cities , from regensburg to hamburg . this german is characterized amongst other things by the omission of particles and prepositions in certain contexts and a certain " grammatical economy " , as wiese describes it . " for example , instead of saying ' ich gehe in die schule ' -lrb- i go to school -rrb- , they would say ' isch geh schule ' -lrb- i go school -rrb- , or ' isch bin görlitzer park ' -lrb- i am görlitzer park -rrb- rather than ' ich bin im görlitzer park ' , " adds the linguist , who works at the university of potsdam . it 's also sprinkled with arabic or turkish words , such as yalla -lrb- arabic for let 's go -rrb- , wallah -lrb- a compressed form of the arabic for by allah which is used to mean " really " -rrb- and lan , short for turkish " ulan " and used to mean " guy " or " dude " -rrb- are frequently featured . similar phenomena have been noted elsewhere in europe .
whereas in britain no single overarching multilingual ethnolect appears to exist , it has been detected in sweden , denmark and the netherlands in areas with a high density of migrants . these european ethnolects even seem to share some common features - despite differences because of variations in the languages involved , according to inken keim , professor at the university of mannheim and researcher at the institute for german language .
but it 's not yet possible to say for sure .
academic research into this whole area is still in its early days - both here in germany and abroad .
" it has a certain beat .
perhaps it has to do with tastes in music .
that 's still completely open at the moment , " said keim . a sign of marginalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been criticized for poor standards of second language tuition provision the phenomenon was first brought to the attention of the chattering classes via literature in 1995 .
turkish-born author feridun zaimoglu 's book kanak sprak contains 24 " transcripts " of meetings with young turkish-german men .
zaimoglu describes the ethnolect as " an underground code " , an expression of marginalization by mainstream german society .
the term kanak is itself the pejorative term for turks and other immigrants from southern europe , the middle east or north africa . over the past few years , there has been growing media exposure for this variant of german .
german comedy duos such as stefan and erkan , and mundstuhl , as dragan und alder lampooned this way of speaking , taking their cue from english comedian sacha baron cohen with his performance of ali g. , a boorish , uneducated youth , of immigrant origin . a number of feature films , such as kebab connection , directed by anno paul and screened in 1995 , and süperseks , which was directed by torsten wacker and came out a year earlier , have also engaged with the theme and there is increasing news media coverage . discrimination in popular culture and news media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feridun zaimoglu brought attention to the phenomenon of turkish ethnolects sociolinguist jannis androutsopoulos , reader in sociolinguistics and media discourse at the department of education at king 's college london , is concerned about the distortions involved in representations of ethnic styles of german in popular culture and public discourse and the impact on german mainstream society .
frequently , comedy tends to play up and even invent linguistic characteristics for laughs , while also generally indicating that the speakers of this style of german are badly educated and poorly behaved . according to androutsopoulos , a similar tendency to stereotyping can also be seen in films , including well-meaning ones that set out to celebrate cultural diversity .
" for example , you have films in which a tough , aggressive and obviously uneducated person of migrant background will be speaking markedly ethnic german , whereas in the same movie the good guys , who are also from an ethnic background tend to speak a much more standard german . " media reporting similarly tends to associate ethnic minority styles of german far too quickly with socially stigmatized categories or identities , according to the greek-born , german-reared sociolinguist , and perpetuates stereotypes . " if it 's non-standard german , it 's linked with the ghetto .
it 's problematic , an index of deviance , and something that wo n't get you anywhere in life , " added androutsopoulos . he believes ethnolect should be regarded much more positively .
" the linguistic reality is that the more people are in command of different styles of their language , the better .
it 's yet another layer in people 's linguistic repertoires .
there are people , also younger people , who are perfectly in command of standard german and are also in command of an ethnic style of german , just as like a regional dialect . " media discrimination towards the language and its speakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the comedy acts provide truly crass impersonations the tendency to ridicule ethnically marked german in popular culture has not gone unnoticed by sarmad ahmad .
" it 's got nothing to do with integration .
it is only about making fun of us . " however , he also acknowledges that some of his peer group can only speak ethnolect .
" many of these young people live here and do n't get to see much more than neukölln or wedding .
they do n't get the opportunity to develop , " he added . as heike wiese points out , this is not a threat to the german language , but a problem for the young people in question and german society at large . " for the young people themselves and for the society that loses them because they ca n't participate in society and have fewer chances professionally it 's a huge problem , " she said . just how enduring this phenomenon is likely to be is hard to predict .
wiese believes like most types of language spoken by teenagers that it will probably die out fairly quickly .
inken keim believes that it could establish itself , but only if people from ethnic minority backgrounds remained in areas with a high concentration of non-native speakers over the period of thirty years or so . at the moment , she believes that the chances are low of any of its features entering mainstream german language - above all because the negative connotations of , for example , turkish in germany , in contrast to the higher status of english . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german comedy duos such as stefan and erkan , and mundstuhl , as dragan und alder lampooned this way of speaking , taking their cue from english comedian sacha baron cohen with his performance of ali g. , a boorish , uneducated youth , of immigrant origin . a number of feature films , such as kebab connection , directed by anno paul and screened in 1995 , and süperseks , which was directed by torsten wacker and came out a year earlier , have also engaged with the theme and there is increasing news media coverage . discrimination in popular culture and news media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feridun zaimoglu brought attention to the phenomenon of turkish ethnolects sociolinguist jannis androutsopoulos , reader in sociolinguistics and media discourse at the department of education at king 's college london , is concerned about the distortions involved in representations of ethnic styles of german in popular culture and public discourse and the impact on german mainstream society .
frequently , comedy tends to play up and even invent linguistic characteristics for laughs , while also generally indicating that the speakers of this style of german are badly educated and poorly behaved . according to androutsopoulos , a similar tendency to stereotyping can also be seen in films , including well-meaning ones that set out to celebrate cultural diversity .
" for example , you have films in which a tough , aggressive and obviously uneducated person of migrant background will be speaking markedly ethnic german , whereas in the same movie the good guys , who are also from an ethnic background tend to speak a much more standard german . " media reporting similarly tends to associate ethnic minority styles of german far too quickly with socially stigmatized categories or identities , according to the greek-born , german-reared sociolinguist , and perpetuates stereotypes . " if it 's non-standard german , it 's linked with the ghetto .
it 's problematic , an index of deviance , and something that wo n't get you anywhere in life , " added androutsopoulos . he believes ethnolect should be regarded much more positively .
" the linguistic reality is that the more people are in command of different styles of their language , the better .
it 's yet another layer in people 's linguistic repertoires .
there are people , also younger people , who are perfectly in command of standard german and are also in command of an ethnic style of german , just as like a regional dialect . " media discrimination towards the language and its speakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the comedy acts provide truly crass impersonations the tendency to ridicule ethnically marked german in popular culture has not gone unnoticed by sarmad ahmad .
" it 's got nothing to do with integration .
it is only about making fun of us . " however , he also acknowledges that some of his peer group can only speak ethnolect .
" many of these young people live here and do n't get to see much more than neukölln or wedding .
they do n't get the opportunity to develop , " he added . as heike wiese points out , this is not a threat to the german language , but a problem for the young people in question and german society at large . " for the young people themselves and for the society that loses them because they ca n't participate in society and have fewer chances professionally it 's a huge problem , " she said . just how enduring this phenomenon is likely to be is hard to predict .
wiese believes like most types of language spoken by teenagers that it will probably die out fairly quickly .
inken keim believes that it could establish itself , but only if people from ethnic minority backgrounds remained in areas with a high concentration of non-native speakers over the period of thirty years or so . at the moment , she believes that the chances are low of any of its features entering mainstream german language - above all because the negative connotations of , for example , turkish in germany , in contrast to the higher status of english . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , to push for a renewal of democracy in zimbabwe , saying the world could not look on as democracy is " trampled underfoot . " " the current state of zimbabwe damages the image of the new africa , " merkel told the leaders of 26 european and 53 african states .
" because this is so , we must take the chance here , in this framework , to put all our efforts together into strengthening democracy . " among her audience was zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , who is regarded in europe as having driven his country to political , agricultural and financial collapse .
he has been banned from entering the eu since 2002 , but the ban was waived for the summit . britain 's prime minister gordon brown refused to come to the summit when mugabe was invited . but despite that boycott , " we , the whole eu , are unified in our assessment of the situation in the country , " merkel said . zimbabwe concerns entire eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters said international leaders needed to stop ignoring africa " zimbabwe 's situation concerns us all , in europe as well as in africa , " she added .
" we do n't have the right to look away when human rights are trampled underfoot . " the chancellor said the eu 's concerns included zimbabwe 's official annual rate of inflation , which stands at nearly 8,000 percent , as well as attacks on opposition figures ahead of elections set for next year . " a democratic government in zimbabwe , which respects human rights , will have the support of the european union , with the aim of allowing zimbabwe to become a new free and prosperous state , " merkel added . while the session was behind closed-doors with only a copy of merkel 's speech being leaked to journalists , ireland 's prime minister bertie ahern said that merkel 's speech had made uncomfortable listening for mugabe . merkel had expressed her concerns about the " deep political and humanitarian crisis in his country , " ahern told reporters . mugabe had been widely expected to respond to merkel 's speech , but in the event he did not react to it , ahern said .
the zimbabwean president has blamed his country 's economic woes on britain , whom he accuses of failing to honor pledges to fund land redistribution and of inciting the opposition to exact regime change . human rights , trade inseparable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mbeki and merkel agreed the summit offered a chance to both africa and europe in a speech before merkel on the issue of human rights , south african president thabo mbeki did not address zimbabwe , where he has tried to mediate between mugabe and his political foes . mbeki said the summit should work to ensure that africa 's " masses escape from the clutches of poverty . " " we are fully conscious of the fact that good governance and respect for human rights are fundamental to the achievement of this objective , " he added . pressured by china 's growing investment and influence in africa , the europeans hope to agree after the two days of talks to ambitious action plan with the continent to revitalize trade - but also to improve cooperation in areas like immigration and peacekeeping . challenged by the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's colonial past in africa continues to strain relations portuguese prime minister jose socrates said history had " thrown down the gauntlet and challenged us to work together to write together a completely new page in the relationship between europe and africa . " " i think this eu-africa summit is a milestone on the path to better relations between our two continents , " merkel said after her speech . but the issue of mugabe , seen by many in africa as an independence hero , has underlined the difficult relationship between africa and the former colonial powers , some of whom gave up control only a few decades ago . " the real significance of this summit must be to lay the foundations of a new partnership based on mutual respect , " said john kufuor , president of ghana and current chairman of the african union .

this ethnolect is spoken among young migrants of various ethnic backgrounds as well as young native germans . linguists say that fears in germany that this colloquial " lingua franca " might pose a threat to standard german language are unfounded .
but distorted media representations of this ethnolect could , however , serve to merely reinforce stereotypes about the country 's migrants . in popular culture , it 's frequently exposed to ridicule , while in the media it is frequently described as a social " problem " and depicted as posing a threat to standard german . sarmad ahmad , who is of iraqi origin , first encountered this new variant of german when he and his family went to live in berlin-wedding , a district with a high immigrant population .
he first came to germany nine years ago and spent the first few months attending intensive german lessons . the 20-year-old can switch effortlessly from one type to the other .
" my language split when i started mixing with the teenagers in this district .
i can speak one way or the other .
it 's separate from the other language .
it 's as if it 's ours .
there are also germans who have grown up here in this area who also use it too , " he said . " there are things in the way we speak to one another that are linked to our mother tongue .
in arabic you would just say " come " .
there are n't different endings for the verbs like there are in standard german .
this just gets carried across automatically , " he added . the grammar is simplified and features new constructions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people often use an ethnolect as a secret code it 's not unusual to overhear teenagers conversing hard and fast in " their " language in inner-city districts of berlin . but it 's not restricted to the german capital , professor heike wiese also says the phenomenon has been observed in a whole host of other german cities , from regensburg to hamburg . this german is characterized amongst other things by the omission of particles and prepositions in certain contexts and a certain " grammatical economy " , as wiese describes it . " for example , instead of saying ' ich gehe in die schule ' -lrb- i go to school -rrb- , they would say ' isch geh schule ' -lrb- i go school -rrb- , or ' isch bin görlitzer park ' -lrb- i am görlitzer park -rrb- rather than ' ich bin im görlitzer park ' , " adds the linguist , who works at the university of potsdam . it 's also sprinkled with arabic or turkish words , such as yalla -lrb- arabic for let 's go -rrb- , wallah -lrb- a compressed form of the arabic for by allah which is used to mean " really " -rrb- and lan , short for turkish " ulan " and used to mean " guy " or " dude " -rrb- are frequently featured . similar phenomena have been noted elsewhere in europe .
whereas in britain no single overarching multilingual ethnolect appears to exist , it has been detected in sweden , denmark and the netherlands in areas with a high density of migrants . these european ethnolects even seem to share some common features - despite differences because of variations in the languages involved , according to inken keim , professor at the university of mannheim and researcher at the institute for german language .
but it 's not yet possible to say for sure .
academic research into this whole area is still in its early days - both here in germany and abroad .
" it has a certain beat .
perhaps it has to do with tastes in music .
that 's still completely open at the moment , " said keim . a sign of marginalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been criticized for poor standards of second language tuition provision the phenomenon was first brought to the attention of the chattering classes via literature in 1995 .
turkish-born author feridun zaimoglu 's book kanak sprak contains 24 " transcripts " of meetings with young turkish-german men .
zaimoglu describes the ethnolect as " an underground code " , an expression of marginalization by mainstream german society .
the term kanak is itself the pejorative term for turks and other immigrants from southern europe , the middle east or north africa . over the past few years , there has been growing media exposure for this variant of german .
german comedy duos such as stefan and erkan , and mundstuhl , as dragan und alder lampooned this way of speaking , taking their cue from english comedian sacha baron cohen with his performance of ali g. , a boorish , uneducated youth , of immigrant origin . a number of feature films , such as kebab connection , directed by anno paul and screened in 1995 , and süperseks , which was directed by torsten wacker and came out a year earlier , have also engaged with the theme and there is increasing news media coverage . discrimination in popular culture and news media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feridun zaimoglu brought attention to the phenomenon of turkish ethnolects sociolinguist jannis androutsopoulos , reader in sociolinguistics and media discourse at the department of education at king 's college london , is concerned about the distortions involved in representations of ethnic styles of german in popular culture and public discourse and the impact on german mainstream society .
frequently , comedy tends to play up and even invent linguistic characteristics for laughs , while also generally indicating that the speakers of this style of german are badly educated and poorly behaved . according to androutsopoulos , a similar tendency to stereotyping can also be seen in films , including well-meaning ones that set out to celebrate cultural diversity .
" for example , you have films in which a tough , aggressive and obviously uneducated person of migrant background will be speaking markedly ethnic german , whereas in the same movie the good guys , who are also from an ethnic background tend to speak a much more standard german . " media reporting similarly tends to associate ethnic minority styles of german far too quickly with socially stigmatized categories or identities , according to the greek-born , german-reared sociolinguist , and perpetuates stereotypes . " if it 's non-standard german , it 's linked with the ghetto .
it 's problematic , an index of deviance , and something that wo n't get you anywhere in life , " added androutsopoulos . he believes ethnolect should be regarded much more positively .
" the linguistic reality is that the more people are in command of different styles of their language , the better .
it 's yet another layer in people 's linguistic repertoires .
there are people , also younger people , who are perfectly in command of standard german and are also in command of an ethnic style of german , just as like a regional dialect . " media discrimination towards the language and its speakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the comedy acts provide truly crass impersonations the tendency to ridicule ethnically marked german in popular culture has not gone unnoticed by sarmad ahmad .
" it 's got nothing to do with integration .
it is only about making fun of us . " however , he also acknowledges that some of his peer group can only speak ethnolect .
" many of these young people live here and do n't get to see much more than neukölln or wedding .

this ethnolect is spoken among young migrants of various ethnic backgrounds as well as young native germans . linguists say that fears in germany that this colloquial " lingua franca " might pose a threat to standard german language are unfounded .
but distorted media representations of this ethnolect could , however , serve to merely reinforce stereotypes about the country 's migrants . in popular culture , it 's frequently exposed to ridicule , while in the media it is frequently described as a social " problem " and depicted as posing a threat to standard german . sarmad ahmad , who is of iraqi origin , first encountered this new variant of german when he and his family went to live in berlin-wedding , a district with a high immigrant population .
he first came to germany nine years ago and spent the first few months attending intensive german lessons . the 20-year-old can switch effortlessly from one type to the other .
" my language split when i started mixing with the teenagers in this district .
i can speak one way or the other .
it 's separate from the other language .
it 's as if it 's ours .
there are also germans who have grown up here in this area who also use it too , " he said . " there are things in the way we speak to one another that are linked to our mother tongue .
in arabic you would just say " come " .
there are n't different endings for the verbs like there are in standard german .
this just gets carried across automatically , " he added . the grammar is simplified and features new constructions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people often use an ethnolect as a secret code it 's not unusual to overhear teenagers conversing hard and fast in " their " language in inner-city districts of berlin . but it 's not restricted to the german capital , professor heike wiese also says the phenomenon has been observed in a whole host of other german cities , from regensburg to hamburg . this german is characterized amongst other things by the omission of particles and prepositions in certain contexts and a certain " grammatical economy " , as wiese describes it . " for example , instead of saying ' ich gehe in die schule ' -lrb- i go to school -rrb- , they would say ' isch geh schule ' -lrb- i go school -rrb- , or ' isch bin görlitzer park ' -lrb- i am görlitzer park -rrb- rather than ' ich bin im görlitzer park ' , " adds the linguist , who works at the university of potsdam . it 's also sprinkled with arabic or turkish words , such as yalla -lrb- arabic for let 's go -rrb- , wallah -lrb- a compressed form of the arabic for by allah which is used to mean " really " -rrb- and lan , short for turkish " ulan " and used to mean " guy " or " dude " -rrb- are frequently featured . similar phenomena have been noted elsewhere in europe .
whereas in britain no single overarching multilingual ethnolect appears to exist , it has been detected in sweden , denmark and the netherlands in areas with a high density of migrants . these european ethnolects even seem to share some common features - despite differences because of variations in the languages involved , according to inken keim , professor at the university of mannheim and researcher at the institute for german language .
but it 's not yet possible to say for sure .
academic research into this whole area is still in its early days - both here in germany and abroad .
" it has a certain beat .
perhaps it has to do with tastes in music .
that 's still completely open at the moment , " said keim . a sign of marginalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been criticized for poor standards of second language tuition provision the phenomenon was first brought to the attention of the chattering classes via literature in 1995 .
turkish-born author feridun zaimoglu 's book kanak sprak contains 24 " transcripts " of meetings with young turkish-german men .
zaimoglu describes the ethnolect as " an underground code " , an expression of marginalization by mainstream german society .
the term kanak is itself the pejorative term for turks and other immigrants from southern europe , the middle east or north africa . over the past few years , there has been growing media exposure for this variant of german .
german comedy duos such as stefan and erkan , and mundstuhl , as dragan und alder lampooned this way of speaking , taking their cue from english comedian sacha baron cohen with his performance of ali g. , a boorish , uneducated youth , of immigrant origin . a number of feature films , such as kebab connection , directed by anno paul and screened in 1995 , and süperseks , which was directed by torsten wacker and came out a year earlier , have also engaged with the theme and there is increasing news media coverage . discrimination in popular culture and news media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feridun zaimoglu brought attention to the phenomenon of turkish ethnolects sociolinguist jannis androutsopoulos , reader in sociolinguistics and media discourse at the department of education at king 's college london , is concerned about the distortions involved in representations of ethnic styles of german in popular culture and public discourse and the impact on german mainstream society .
frequently , comedy tends to play up and even invent linguistic characteristics for laughs , while also generally indicating that the speakers of this style of german are badly educated and poorly behaved . according to androutsopoulos , a similar tendency to stereotyping can also be seen in films , including well-meaning ones that set out to celebrate cultural diversity .
" for example , you have films in which a tough , aggressive and obviously uneducated person of migrant background will be speaking markedly ethnic german , whereas in the same movie the good guys , who are also from an ethnic background tend to speak a much more standard german . " media reporting similarly tends to associate ethnic minority styles of german far too quickly with socially stigmatized categories or identities , according to the greek-born , german-reared sociolinguist , and perpetuates stereotypes . " if it 's non-standard german , it 's linked with the ghetto .
it 's problematic , an index of deviance , and something that wo n't get you anywhere in life , " added androutsopoulos . he believes ethnolect should be regarded much more positively .
" the linguistic reality is that the more people are in command of different styles of their language , the better .
it 's yet another layer in people 's linguistic repertoires .
there are people , also younger people , who are perfectly in command of standard german and are also in command of an ethnic style of german , just as like a regional dialect . " media discrimination towards the language and its speakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the comedy acts provide truly crass impersonations the tendency to ridicule ethnically marked german in popular culture has not gone unnoticed by sarmad ahmad .

8 , to push for a renewal of democracy in zimbabwe , saying the world could not look on as democracy is " trampled underfoot . " " the current state of zimbabwe damages the image of the new africa , " merkel told the leaders of 26 european and 53 african states .
" because this is so , we must take the chance here , in this framework , to put all our efforts together into strengthening democracy . " among her audience was zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , who is regarded in europe as having driven his country to political , agricultural and financial collapse .
he has been banned from entering the eu since 2002 , but the ban was waived for the summit . britain 's prime minister gordon brown refused to come to the summit when mugabe was invited . but despite that boycott , " we , the whole eu , are unified in our assessment of the situation in the country , " merkel said . zimbabwe concerns entire eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters said international leaders needed to stop ignoring africa " zimbabwe 's situation concerns us all , in europe as well as in africa , " she added .
" we do n't have the right to look away when human rights are trampled underfoot . " the chancellor said the eu 's concerns included zimbabwe 's official annual rate of inflation , which stands at nearly 8,000 percent , as well as attacks on opposition figures ahead of elections set for next year . " a democratic government in zimbabwe , which respects human rights , will have the support of the european union , with the aim of allowing zimbabwe to become a new free and prosperous state , " merkel added . while the session was behind closed-doors with only a copy of merkel 's speech being leaked to journalists , ireland 's prime minister bertie ahern said that merkel 's speech had made uncomfortable listening for mugabe . merkel had expressed her concerns about the " deep political and humanitarian crisis in his country , " ahern told reporters . mugabe had been widely expected to respond to merkel 's speech , but in the event he did not react to it , ahern said .

" " we are fully conscious of the fact that good governance and respect for human rights are fundamental to the achievement of this objective , " he added . pressured by china 's growing investment and influence in africa , the europeans hope to agree after the two days of talks to ambitious action plan with the continent to revitalize trade - but also to improve cooperation in areas like immigration and peacekeeping . challenged by the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's colonial past in africa continues to strain relations portuguese prime minister jose socrates said history had " thrown down the gauntlet and challenged us to work together to write together a completely new page in the relationship between europe and africa . " " i think this eu-africa summit is a milestone on the path to better relations between our two continents , " merkel said after her speech . but the issue of mugabe , seen by many in africa as an independence hero , has underlined the difficult relationship between africa and the former colonial powers , some of whom gave up control only a few decades ago .

8 , the german government has threatened to claw back subsidies for the project near dresden that has been opposed by unesco . german nature-lovers wept saturday as foresters with chain-saws cut down several oak trees at the site of a planned bridge that has raised the ire of the united nations world cultural body unesco . about 400 anti-bridge protesters , some with tears in their eyes , tried to stop the trees from being cut down with some holding hands for a sit-in round the trees .
riot police dragged them away so work could begin .

additional protests are planned in the city on sunday and monday . federal funds threatened earlier in the week , a german transport ministry spokeswoman said legal counsel had been asked to examine whether the project is at odds with germany 's international undertakings to unesco .
she said steps could be taken to reclaim the money if this were the case .
the spokeswoman also said a legal review was " normal " after federal subsidies had been paid . plans for the waldschlößchen bridge , which will cross river meadows four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- east of the baroque city center of dresden , have divided the city .

in a 2005 referendum , city residents voted in favor of the move . unesco listed a 20-kilometer section of the valley as a world heritage site in 2004 and has threatened to withdraw this status if the bridge is not made less intrusive . although courts have ruled that a unesco treaty can not prevent the project , a report by federal counsel maintained that saxony is bound by germany 's treaty undertakings , she said .

political parties across the spectrum are turning to the issue to lure voters in the lead-up to elections in 2009 . in a pitch to distinguish themselves from their coalition partner the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has called for a softening of the prevailing conscription method , which requires all german males above the age of 18 to enter for military service for nine months . " we are not asking for military service to be scrapped but to proceed on a voluntary basis in future , " said spd party head kurt beck . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remains the last staunch supporter of general conscription and recently emphasized it will uphold current practice at its annual cdu summit earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung is a staunch supporter of conscription " i think that in principle we need conscription because it would be hard to find the 60,000 young men who agree to join the bundeswehr each year , " defense minister franz josef jung , a cdu member , told deutschlandfunk radio . he also dismissed beck 's call for " voluntary conscription " as a contradiction in terms . crucial campaign issue with both parties starting their scramble to improve their image within the grand coalition , issues such as conscription could well be crucial in next year 's campaigning ahead of elections in 2009 . mandatory military service not only serves as a focal point to distinguish party programs , but also directly affects the lives of every german male above the age of 18 .
since the number of conscientious objectors has been steadily rising in favor of civil service , conscription might well be an issue that could impact on the outcome of the next elections .
men can also choose to do a year of social work rather than enter the military . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscription could gain in importance during next year 's campaigns german opposition parties are generally united in their rejection of the current conscription practice and have called for its abolishment or suspension . conscription opponents argue that large standing armies are no longer necessary for domestic defense and that specialized , professional troops who can be deployed swiftly in any crisis region on the globe are needed . " conscription can not be justified any more from the security policy angle , " said claudia roth , a greens party leader .
" it also constitutes a massive intrusion into the basic rights of young men . " other critics refer to the majority of nato partners that have already adopted the model of smaller , professional armies saying that germany 's reliance on conscription is dated .
the only nato countries still applying conscription are estonia , lithuania , norway , greece and turkey .
german army conscripts do not serve in military missions abroad and often receive administrational duties . historic issues still cast their shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most nato members have professional armies in contrast to many nato members , historic issues have weighed heavily on german domestic and foreign policy since 1945 .

political parties across the spectrum are turning to the issue to lure voters in the lead-up to elections in 2009 . in a pitch to distinguish themselves from their coalition partner the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has called for a softening of the prevailing conscription method , which requires all german males above the age of 18 to enter for military service for nine months . " we are not asking for military service to be scrapped but to proceed on a voluntary basis in future , " said spd party head kurt beck . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remains the last staunch supporter of general conscription and recently emphasized it will uphold current practice at its annual cdu summit earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung is a staunch supporter of conscription " i think that in principle we need conscription because it would be hard to find the 60,000 young men who agree to join the bundeswehr each year , " defense minister franz josef jung , a cdu member , told deutschlandfunk radio . he also dismissed beck 's call for " voluntary conscription " as a contradiction in terms . crucial campaign issue with both parties starting their scramble to improve their image within the grand coalition , issues such as conscription could well be crucial in next year 's campaigning ahead of elections in 2009 . mandatory military service not only serves as a focal point to distinguish party programs , but also directly affects the lives of every german male above the age of 18 .
since the number of conscientious objectors has been steadily rising in favor of civil service , conscription might well be an issue that could impact on the outcome of the next elections .
men can also choose to do a year of social work rather than enter the military . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscription could gain in importance during next year 's campaigns german opposition parties are generally united in their rejection of the current conscription practice and have called for its abolishment or suspension . conscription opponents argue that large standing armies are no longer necessary for domestic defense and that specialized , professional troops who can be deployed swiftly in any crisis region on the globe are needed . " conscription can not be justified any more from the security policy angle , " said claudia roth , a greens party leader .
" it also constitutes a massive intrusion into the basic rights of young men . " other critics refer to the majority of nato partners that have already adopted the model of smaller , professional armies saying that germany 's reliance on conscription is dated .
the only nato countries still applying conscription are estonia , lithuania , norway , greece and turkey .
german army conscripts do not serve in military missions abroad and often receive administrational duties . historic issues still cast their shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most nato members have professional armies in contrast to many nato members , historic issues have weighed heavily on german domestic and foreign policy since 1945 .

the state government of saxony said it has not seen the legal report .
berlin has provided nearly 100 million euros from federal roads funds for the project . dw staff -lrb- jg / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spokeswoman also said a legal review was " normal " after federal subsidies had been paid . plans for the waldschlößchen bridge , which will cross river meadows four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- east of the baroque city center of dresden , have divided the city .
conservationists have said it will spoil a picture-postcard view of the eastern city . consequence of urban expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trees are already being felled to make way for the construction the state of saxony insists on the need for the bridge to end lengthy detours in the city , which is growing along both banks of the elbe river .
in a 2005 referendum , city residents voted in favor of the move . unesco listed a 20-kilometer section of the valley as a world heritage site in 2004 and has threatened to withdraw this status if the bridge is not made less intrusive . although courts have ruled that a unesco treaty can not prevent the project , a report by federal counsel maintained that saxony is bound by germany 's treaty undertakings , she said .
the state government of saxony said it has not seen the legal report .
berlin has provided nearly 100 million euros from federal roads funds for the project . dw staff -lrb- jg / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political parties across the spectrum are turning to the issue to lure voters in the lead-up to elections in 2009 . in a pitch to distinguish themselves from their coalition partner the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has called for a softening of the prevailing conscription method , which requires all german males above the age of 18 to enter for military service for nine months . " we are not asking for military service to be scrapped but to proceed on a voluntary basis in future , " said spd party head kurt beck . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remains the last staunch supporter of general conscription and recently emphasized it will uphold current practice at its annual cdu summit earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung is a staunch supporter of conscription " i think that in principle we need conscription because it would be hard to find the 60,000 young men who agree to join the bundeswehr each year , " defense minister franz josef jung , a cdu member , told deutschlandfunk radio . he also dismissed beck 's call for " voluntary conscription " as a contradiction in terms . crucial campaign issue with both parties starting their scramble to improve their image within the grand coalition , issues such as conscription could well be crucial in next year 's campaigning ahead of elections in 2009 . mandatory military service not only serves as a focal point to distinguish party programs , but also directly affects the lives of every german male above the age of 18 .
since the number of conscientious objectors has been steadily rising in favor of civil service , conscription might well be an issue that could impact on the outcome of the next elections .
men can also choose to do a year of social work rather than enter the military . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscription could gain in importance during next year 's campaigns german opposition parties are generally united in their rejection of the current conscription practice and have called for its abolishment or suspension . conscription opponents argue that large standing armies are no longer necessary for domestic defense and that specialized , professional troops who can be deployed swiftly in any crisis region on the globe are needed . " conscription can not be justified any more from the security policy angle , " said claudia roth , a greens party leader .
" it also constitutes a massive intrusion into the basic rights of young men . " other critics refer to the majority of nato partners that have already adopted the model of smaller , professional armies saying that germany 's reliance on conscription is dated .
the only nato countries still applying conscription are estonia , lithuania , norway , greece and turkey .
german army conscripts do not serve in military missions abroad and often receive administrational duties . historic issues still cast their shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most nato members have professional armies in contrast to many nato members , historic issues have weighed heavily on german domestic and foreign policy since 1945 .
after world war ii 's disastrous consequences , german politicians wanted to ensure that the new army consisted of " citizens in uniform " in order to guarantee democratic control of the army . the concept of rearming germany was also fostered by nato partners who were confronted with the warsaw pact , led by the soviet union . however , with the end of the cold war and the reunification of germany in 1990 , the future of nato and costly large armies appeared rather blurred .
moreover , germany no longer had any borders with potential enemies and therefore one of the main arguments for conscription was void .
at the same time germany 's responsibility abroad was constantly growing . after the cold war , new threats were found to justify nato 's international role .
but it was only after a long domestic debate that germany agreed to contribute troops to the alliance 's missions in the balkans and later afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently has about 3,000 troops deployed to afghanistan accordingly , opposition parties like the free-market liberal free democratic party demand a suspension of " unnecessary conscription " at home in favor of more funding for a better equipped smaller professional army capable of acting more efficiently abroad under nato rule . as no fast end to the afghanistan mission is expected and calls for an increase of german troops have been made , it is probable that the conscription and military debate will feature in next year 's campaigning .
until then , german governing and opposition parties remain divided on the issue . neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have to begin looking for new solutions for the future of the continents .
you are all here to meet an invitation from history . " in his opening address , socrates said the two days of meetings were intended to be a " summit of equals .

" the colonial powers must compensate the people that they colonized and whose riches they plundered , " gadhafi said in a speech at lisbon university .
" this will be one of the main issues of the summit , " added gadhafi whose relations with europe are just coming out of the deep freeze after the freeing of a group of nurses accused of deliberately infecting children with aids . while gadhafi 's claim to speak for his peers is questionable , his demand highlighted the complexity of ties between europe and their one-time colonies and how easily the aim of the two-day summit could be blown off course . barroso : europe has neglected its ties with africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso sees the need for increased co-operation eu commission president jose manuel barroso has acknowledged europe has let relations with its old hunting ground drift and there are now plans for such a summit every third year .

" our study confirmed that in germany a connection has been observed between the distance of a domicile to the nearest nuclear power plant ... and the risk of developing cancer , such as leukemia , before the fifth birthday , " the daily süddeutsche zeitung quoted the report as saying . government radiation specialists said they could not explain the finding , since there was no direct radiation from the 16 german plants , which are all scheduled for closure in the early 2020s . the study was paid for by the german federal radiation protection agency -lsb- bfs -rsb- the government 's main adviser on nuclear health . it was conducted by the german register of child cancer , an office in mainz which is funded by the 16 german states and the federal health ministry . the study found that 37 children had come down with leukemia in the period between 1980 and 2003 while having home addresses within 5 kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- of nuclear power plants .
the statistical average for germany would have predicted just 17 cases in that group . statistically , the 20 extra cases could be associated with living close to the plants , but the bfs said more research was needed to discover if the presence of reactors was actually the cause of the cancers . doubts over causality remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said more studies needed to be done to explain the current findings german environment minister sigmar gabriel said the government radiation safety committee would analyze the findings and called for additional research to explain the increased number of cancer cases . " the population 's radiation exposure due to the operation of nuclear power plants in germany would have to be a least a thousand times higher to be able to explain the observed increase in cancer risk , " he said . bfs said current science held that radiation from reactors themselves or their emissions was too weak outside the perimeter to cause cancer , and other conceivable risk factors also could " not explain this distance-related heightening of risk . " germany generates more than 20,000 megawatts of electricity through nuclear power annually , around a quarter of its needs . despite broad public opposition to the plants , some german officials have suggested giving nuclear power a reprieve in order to reduce climate-damaging emissions from fossil fuels . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our study confirmed that in germany a connection has been observed between the distance of a domicile to the nearest nuclear power plant ... and the risk of developing cancer , such as leukemia , before the fifth birthday , " the daily süddeutsche zeitung quoted the report as saying . government radiation specialists said they could not explain the finding , since there was no direct radiation from the 16 german plants , which are all scheduled for closure in the early 2020s . the study was paid for by the german federal radiation protection agency -lsb- bfs -rsb- the government 's main adviser on nuclear health . it was conducted by the german register of child cancer , an office in mainz which is funded by the 16 german states and the federal health ministry . the study found that 37 children had come down with leukemia in the period between 1980 and 2003 while having home addresses within 5 kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- of nuclear power plants .
the statistical average for germany would have predicted just 17 cases in that group . statistically , the 20 extra cases could be associated with living close to the plants , but the bfs said more research was needed to discover if the presence of reactors was actually the cause of the cancers . doubts over causality remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said more studies needed to be done to explain the current findings german environment minister sigmar gabriel said the government radiation safety committee would analyze the findings and called for additional research to explain the increased number of cancer cases . " the population 's radiation exposure due to the operation of nuclear power plants in germany would have to be a least a thousand times higher to be able to explain the observed increase in cancer risk , " he said . bfs said current science held that radiation from reactors themselves or their emissions was too weak outside the perimeter to cause cancer , and other conceivable risk factors also could " not explain this distance-related heightening of risk . " germany generates more than 20,000 megawatts of electricity through nuclear power annually , around a quarter of its needs . despite broad public opposition to the plants , some german officials have suggested giving nuclear power a reprieve in order to reduce climate-damaging emissions from fossil fuels . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his words were echoed by eu aid and development commissioner louis michel who said that the future of the eu lies in a new relationship with africa . the eu and africa must create " a more responsible and a more political partnership built on greater solidarity , ” michel said .
“ if we fail , lisbon will remain in the collective memory as a great missed opportunity . " we need to consider this summit as a launch pad for a new era in the relationship between europe and africa , " he added . " this summit must mark the end of a relationship rooted in conservatism and sometimes in prejudice on both sides and mark the start of a recognition of the real opportunities that are at hand for both sides . " almost 80 heads of state and government from the european and african unions are set to attend the meeting , which is the second such summit ever and the first since the au was created in 2002 , for talks on cooperation in areas ranging from trade support , energy and migration to education , human rights and science . africa betrayed over trade ; eu concerned with human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resource-rich africa looks to china for economic deals serious differences of opinion , however , remain on issues of trade and human rights , in particular . on trade , some african countries have accused the eu of trying to strong-arm them into accepting allegedly unfavorable trade deals known as economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- , ahead of a world trade organization deadline at the end of the year . europe remains africa 's biggest trading partner and source of aid but china 's growing push into the resource-rich continent as it seeks to fuel its economic growth has shown its influence can not be taken for granted . hopes of a breakthrough on new economic partnership agreements have been dashed this week with south africa , the continent 's economic powerhouse , saying the " detrimental impacts " of the deal offered by the eu had to be addressed . mugabe in spotlight , not marginalized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe 's eu travel ban was lifted for the summit human rights also looks set to be an explosive issue .
eu leaders have promised that the summit will involve a " substantive " debate on the human-rights situation in zimbabwe , where mugabe is accused of conducting a reign of terror and destroying the economy . eu diplomats admit that that risks splitting the summit into pro- and anti-mugabe camps and derailing talks on other issues .
britain 's prime minister brown announced in september that he would boycott the summit if mugabe attended , saying that mugabe 's presence would " divert attention " from other key topics . however , the boycott appears to have had the opposite effect , turning the spotlight on mugabe . the zimbabwean leader , who was banned from the eu for allegedly rigging his re-election five years ago , has portrayed his invitation as a slap in the face for britain whom he accuses of failing to honor commitments to fund land redistribution . while britain 's delegation has stayed at home , other eu leaders such as german chancellor angela merkel , feel the summit offers an opportunity to reproach mugabe and make their points to him personally . " there has been a very negative trend in the zimbabwe regime and this is something we will have to broach , " barroso said .
" but this is not just a summit to look at zimbabwe . " discussions on issues such as zimbabwe , efforts to bring peace to sudan 's darfur region and the conflict in somalia have not been formally timetabled but are expected to crop up in debates on human rights and peace and security . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our study confirmed that in germany a connection has been observed between the distance of a domicile to the nearest nuclear power plant ... and the risk of developing cancer , such as leukemia , before the fifth birthday , " the daily süddeutsche zeitung quoted the report as saying . government radiation specialists said they could not explain the finding , since there was no direct radiation from the 16 german plants , which are all scheduled for closure in the early 2020s . the study was paid for by the german federal radiation protection agency -lsb- bfs -rsb- the government 's main adviser on nuclear health . it was conducted by the german register of child cancer , an office in mainz which is funded by the 16 german states and the federal health ministry . the study found that 37 children had come down with leukemia in the period between 1980 and 2003 while having home addresses within 5 kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- of nuclear power plants .
the statistical average for germany would have predicted just 17 cases in that group . statistically , the 20 extra cases could be associated with living close to the plants , but the bfs said more research was needed to discover if the presence of reactors was actually the cause of the cancers . doubts over causality remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said more studies needed to be done to explain the current findings german environment minister sigmar gabriel said the government radiation safety committee would analyze the findings and called for additional research to explain the increased number of cancer cases .

8 , starting two days of talks aimed at creating a new alliance between the continents .
but animosity over colonial rule could derail the talks . " the message is clear : there is no time to lose , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates , hosting the meeting , said .
" we have to begin looking for new solutions for the future of the continents .

8 , to push for a renewal of democracy in zimbabwe , saying the world could not look on as democracy is " trampled underfoot . " " the current state of zimbabwe damages the image of the new africa , " merkel told the leaders of 26 european and 53 african states .
" because this is so , we must take the chance here , in this framework , to put all our efforts together into strengthening democracy . " among her audience was zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , who is regarded in europe as having driven his country to political , agricultural and financial collapse .
he has been banned from entering the eu since 2002 , but the ban was waived for the summit . britain 's prime minister gordon brown refused to come to the summit when mugabe was invited . but despite that boycott , " we , the whole eu , are unified in our assessment of the situation in the country , " merkel said . zimbabwe concerns entire eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters said international leaders needed to stop ignoring africa " zimbabwe 's situation concerns us all , in europe as well as in africa , " she added .
" we do n't have the right to look away when human rights are trampled underfoot . " the chancellor said the eu 's concerns included zimbabwe 's official annual rate of inflation , which stands at nearly 8,000 percent , as well as attacks on opposition figures ahead of elections set for next year . " a democratic government in zimbabwe , which respects human rights , will have the support of the european union , with the aim of allowing zimbabwe to become a new free and prosperous state , " merkel added . while the session was behind closed-doors with only a copy of merkel 's speech being leaked to journalists , ireland 's prime minister bertie ahern said that merkel 's speech had made uncomfortable listening for mugabe . merkel had expressed her concerns about the " deep political and humanitarian crisis in his country , " ahern told reporters . mugabe had been widely expected to respond to merkel 's speech , but in the event he did not react to it , ahern said .
the zimbabwean president has blamed his country 's economic woes on britain , whom he accuses of failing to honor pledges to fund land redistribution and of inciting the opposition to exact regime change . human rights , trade inseparable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mbeki and merkel agreed the summit offered a chance to both africa and europe in a speech before merkel on the issue of human rights , south african president thabo mbeki did not address zimbabwe , where he has tried to mediate between mugabe and his political foes . mbeki said the summit should work to ensure that africa 's " masses escape from the clutches of poverty .

8 , to push for a renewal of democracy in zimbabwe , saying the world could not look on as democracy is " trampled underfoot . " " the current state of zimbabwe damages the image of the new africa , " merkel told the leaders of 26 european and 53 african states .
" because this is so , we must take the chance here , in this framework , to put all our efforts together into strengthening democracy . " among her audience was zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , who is regarded in europe as having driven his country to political , agricultural and financial collapse .
he has been banned from entering the eu since 2002 , but the ban was waived for the summit . britain 's prime minister gordon brown refused to come to the summit when mugabe was invited . but despite that boycott , " we , the whole eu , are unified in our assessment of the situation in the country , " merkel said . zimbabwe concerns entire eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters said international leaders needed to stop ignoring africa " zimbabwe 's situation concerns us all , in europe as well as in africa , " she added .
" we do n't have the right to look away when human rights are trampled underfoot . " the chancellor said the eu 's concerns included zimbabwe 's official annual rate of inflation , which stands at nearly 8,000 percent , as well as attacks on opposition figures ahead of elections set for next year . " a democratic government in zimbabwe , which respects human rights , will have the support of the european union , with the aim of allowing zimbabwe to become a new free and prosperous state , " merkel added . while the session was behind closed-doors with only a copy of merkel 's speech being leaked to journalists , ireland 's prime minister bertie ahern said that merkel 's speech had made uncomfortable listening for mugabe . merkel had expressed her concerns about the " deep political and humanitarian crisis in his country , " ahern told reporters . mugabe had been widely expected to respond to merkel 's speech , but in the event he did not react to it , ahern said .
the zimbabwean president has blamed his country 's economic woes on britain , whom he accuses of failing to honor pledges to fund land redistribution and of inciting the opposition to exact regime change . human rights , trade inseparable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mbeki and merkel agreed the summit offered a chance to both africa and europe in a speech before merkel on the issue of human rights , south african president thabo mbeki did not address zimbabwe , where he has tried to mediate between mugabe and his political foes . mbeki said the summit should work to ensure that africa 's " masses escape from the clutches of poverty . " " we are fully conscious of the fact that good governance and respect for human rights are fundamental to the achievement of this objective , " he added . pressured by china 's growing investment and influence in africa , the europeans hope to agree after the two days of talks to ambitious action plan with the continent to revitalize trade - but also to improve cooperation in areas like immigration and peacekeeping . challenged by the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's colonial past in africa continues to strain relations portuguese prime minister jose socrates said history had " thrown down the gauntlet and challenged us to work together to write together a completely new page in the relationship between europe and africa . " " i think this eu-africa summit is a milestone on the path to better relations between our two continents , " merkel said after her speech . but the issue of mugabe , seen by many in africa as an independence hero , has underlined the difficult relationship between africa and the former colonial powers , some of whom gave up control only a few decades ago . " the real significance of this summit must be to lay the foundations of a new partnership based on mutual respect , " said john kufuor , president of ghana and current chairman of the african union .

8 , starting two days of talks aimed at creating a new alliance between the continents .
but animosity over colonial rule could derail the talks . " the message is clear : there is no time to lose , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates , hosting the meeting , said .
" we have to begin looking for new solutions for the future of the continents .
you are all here to meet an invitation from history . " in his opening address , socrates said the two days of meetings were intended to be a " summit of equals . " but a row over the invitation of zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe and a call for colonial-era compensation from libyan leader moammar gadhafi threaten to overshadow the meeting , with british prime minister gordon brown boycotting the summit in protest at his presence . while mugabe kept a low-profile on his first visit to europe in more than two years , the equally controversial libyan leader announced his arrival by demanding that the european powers who carved up africa for their own gain should pay for the damage . " the colonial powers must compensate the people that they colonized and whose riches they plundered , " gadhafi said in a speech at lisbon university .
" this will be one of the main issues of the summit , " added gadhafi whose relations with europe are just coming out of the deep freeze after the freeing of a group of nurses accused of deliberately infecting children with aids . while gadhafi 's claim to speak for his peers is questionable , his demand highlighted the complexity of ties between europe and their one-time colonies and how easily the aim of the two-day summit could be blown off course . barroso : europe has neglected its ties with africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso sees the need for increased co-operation eu commission president jose manuel barroso has acknowledged europe has let relations with its old hunting ground drift and there are now plans for such a summit every third year .
his words were echoed by eu aid and development commissioner louis michel who said that the future of the eu lies in a new relationship with africa . the eu and africa must create " a more responsible and a more political partnership built on greater solidarity , ” michel said .
“ if we fail , lisbon will remain in the collective memory as a great missed opportunity . " we need to consider this summit as a launch pad for a new era in the relationship between europe and africa , " he added . " this summit must mark the end of a relationship rooted in conservatism and sometimes in prejudice on both sides and mark the start of a recognition of the real opportunities that are at hand for both sides . " almost 80 heads of state and government from the european and african unions are set to attend the meeting , which is the second such summit ever and the first since the au was created in 2002 , for talks on cooperation in areas ranging from trade support , energy and migration to education , human rights and science . africa betrayed over trade ; eu concerned with human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resource-rich africa looks to china for economic deals serious differences of opinion , however , remain on issues of trade and human rights , in particular . on trade , some african countries have accused the eu of trying to strong-arm them into accepting allegedly unfavorable trade deals known as economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- , ahead of a world trade organization deadline at the end of the year . europe remains africa 's biggest trading partner and source of aid but china 's growing push into the resource-rich continent as it seeks to fuel its economic growth has shown its influence can not be taken for granted . hopes of a breakthrough on new economic partnership agreements have been dashed this week with south africa , the continent 's economic powerhouse , saying the " detrimental impacts " of the deal offered by the eu had to be addressed . mugabe in spotlight , not marginalized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe 's eu travel ban was lifted for the summit human rights also looks set to be an explosive issue .

" our study confirmed that in germany a connection has been observed between the distance of a domicile to the nearest nuclear power plant ... and the risk of developing cancer , such as leukemia , before the fifth birthday , " the daily süddeutsche zeitung quoted the report as saying . government radiation specialists said they could not explain the finding , since there was no direct radiation from the 16 german plants , which are all scheduled for closure in the early 2020s . the study was paid for by the german federal radiation protection agency -lsb- bfs -rsb- the government 's main adviser on nuclear health . it was conducted by the german register of child cancer , an office in mainz which is funded by the 16 german states and the federal health ministry . the study found that 37 children had come down with leukemia in the period between 1980 and 2003 while having home addresses within 5 kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- of nuclear power plants .

8 , starting two days of talks aimed at creating a new alliance between the continents .
but animosity over colonial rule could derail the talks . " the message is clear : there is no time to lose , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates , hosting the meeting , said .
" we have to begin looking for new solutions for the future of the continents .
you are all here to meet an invitation from history . " in his opening address , socrates said the two days of meetings were intended to be a " summit of equals . " but a row over the invitation of zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe and a call for colonial-era compensation from libyan leader moammar gadhafi threaten to overshadow the meeting , with british prime minister gordon brown boycotting the summit in protest at his presence . while mugabe kept a low-profile on his first visit to europe in more than two years , the equally controversial libyan leader announced his arrival by demanding that the european powers who carved up africa for their own gain should pay for the damage . " the colonial powers must compensate the people that they colonized and whose riches they plundered , " gadhafi said in a speech at lisbon university .
" this will be one of the main issues of the summit , " added gadhafi whose relations with europe are just coming out of the deep freeze after the freeing of a group of nurses accused of deliberately infecting children with aids . while gadhafi 's claim to speak for his peers is questionable , his demand highlighted the complexity of ties between europe and their one-time colonies and how easily the aim of the two-day summit could be blown off course . barroso : europe has neglected its ties with africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso sees the need for increased co-operation eu commission president jose manuel barroso has acknowledged europe has let relations with its old hunting ground drift and there are now plans for such a summit every third year .
his words were echoed by eu aid and development commissioner louis michel who said that the future of the eu lies in a new relationship with africa . the eu and africa must create " a more responsible and a more political partnership built on greater solidarity , ” michel said .
“ if we fail , lisbon will remain in the collective memory as a great missed opportunity . " we need to consider this summit as a launch pad for a new era in the relationship between europe and africa , " he added . " this summit must mark the end of a relationship rooted in conservatism and sometimes in prejudice on both sides and mark the start of a recognition of the real opportunities that are at hand for both sides . " almost 80 heads of state and government from the european and african unions are set to attend the meeting , which is the second such summit ever and the first since the au was created in 2002 , for talks on cooperation in areas ranging from trade support , energy and migration to education , human rights and science . africa betrayed over trade ; eu concerned with human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resource-rich africa looks to china for economic deals serious differences of opinion , however , remain on issues of trade and human rights , in particular . on trade , some african countries have accused the eu of trying to strong-arm them into accepting allegedly unfavorable trade deals known as economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- , ahead of a world trade organization deadline at the end of the year . europe remains africa 's biggest trading partner and source of aid but china 's growing push into the resource-rich continent as it seeks to fuel its economic growth has shown its influence can not be taken for granted . hopes of a breakthrough on new economic partnership agreements have been dashed this week with south africa , the continent 's economic powerhouse , saying the " detrimental impacts " of the deal offered by the eu had to be addressed . mugabe in spotlight , not marginalized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe 's eu travel ban was lifted for the summit human rights also looks set to be an explosive issue .
eu leaders have promised that the summit will involve a " substantive " debate on the human-rights situation in zimbabwe , where mugabe is accused of conducting a reign of terror and destroying the economy . eu diplomats admit that that risks splitting the summit into pro- and anti-mugabe camps and derailing talks on other issues .
britain 's prime minister brown announced in september that he would boycott the summit if mugabe attended , saying that mugabe 's presence would " divert attention " from other key topics . however , the boycott appears to have had the opposite effect , turning the spotlight on mugabe . the zimbabwean leader , who was banned from the eu for allegedly rigging his re-election five years ago , has portrayed his invitation as a slap in the face for britain whom he accuses of failing to honor commitments to fund land redistribution . while britain 's delegation has stayed at home , other eu leaders such as german chancellor angela merkel , feel the summit offers an opportunity to reproach mugabe and make their points to him personally . " there has been a very negative trend in the zimbabwe regime and this is something we will have to broach , " barroso said .
" but this is not just a summit to look at zimbabwe . " discussions on issues such as zimbabwe , efforts to bring peace to sudan 's darfur region and the conflict in somalia have not been formally timetabled but are expected to crop up in debates on human rights and peace and security . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , starting two days of talks aimed at creating a new alliance between the continents .
but animosity over colonial rule could derail the talks . " the message is clear : there is no time to lose , " portuguese prime minister jose socrates , hosting the meeting , said .
" we have to begin looking for new solutions for the future of the continents .
you are all here to meet an invitation from history . " in his opening address , socrates said the two days of meetings were intended to be a " summit of equals . " but a row over the invitation of zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe and a call for colonial-era compensation from libyan leader moammar gadhafi threaten to overshadow the meeting , with british prime minister gordon brown boycotting the summit in protest at his presence . while mugabe kept a low-profile on his first visit to europe in more than two years , the equally controversial libyan leader announced his arrival by demanding that the european powers who carved up africa for their own gain should pay for the damage . " the colonial powers must compensate the people that they colonized and whose riches they plundered , " gadhafi said in a speech at lisbon university .
" this will be one of the main issues of the summit , " added gadhafi whose relations with europe are just coming out of the deep freeze after the freeing of a group of nurses accused of deliberately infecting children with aids . while gadhafi 's claim to speak for his peers is questionable , his demand highlighted the complexity of ties between europe and their one-time colonies and how easily the aim of the two-day summit could be blown off course . barroso : europe has neglected its ties with africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso sees the need for increased co-operation eu commission president jose manuel barroso has acknowledged europe has let relations with its old hunting ground drift and there are now plans for such a summit every third year .
his words were echoed by eu aid and development commissioner louis michel who said that the future of the eu lies in a new relationship with africa . the eu and africa must create " a more responsible and a more political partnership built on greater solidarity , ” michel said .
“ if we fail , lisbon will remain in the collective memory as a great missed opportunity . " we need to consider this summit as a launch pad for a new era in the relationship between europe and africa , " he added . " this summit must mark the end of a relationship rooted in conservatism and sometimes in prejudice on both sides and mark the start of a recognition of the real opportunities that are at hand for both sides . " almost 80 heads of state and government from the european and african unions are set to attend the meeting , which is the second such summit ever and the first since the au was created in 2002 , for talks on cooperation in areas ranging from trade support , energy and migration to education , human rights and science . africa betrayed over trade ; eu concerned with human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resource-rich africa looks to china for economic deals serious differences of opinion , however , remain on issues of trade and human rights , in particular . on trade , some african countries have accused the eu of trying to strong-arm them into accepting allegedly unfavorable trade deals known as economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- , ahead of a world trade organization deadline at the end of the year . europe remains africa 's biggest trading partner and source of aid but china 's growing push into the resource-rich continent as it seeks to fuel its economic growth has shown its influence can not be taken for granted . hopes of a breakthrough on new economic partnership agreements have been dashed this week with south africa , the continent 's economic powerhouse , saying the " detrimental impacts " of the deal offered by the eu had to be addressed . mugabe in spotlight , not marginalized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe 's eu travel ban was lifted for the summit human rights also looks set to be an explosive issue .
eu leaders have promised that the summit will involve a " substantive " debate on the human-rights situation in zimbabwe , where mugabe is accused of conducting a reign of terror and destroying the economy . eu diplomats admit that that risks splitting the summit into pro- and anti-mugabe camps and derailing talks on other issues .
britain 's prime minister brown announced in september that he would boycott the summit if mugabe attended , saying that mugabe 's presence would " divert attention " from other key topics . however , the boycott appears to have had the opposite effect , turning the spotlight on mugabe . the zimbabwean leader , who was banned from the eu for allegedly rigging his re-election five years ago , has portrayed his invitation as a slap in the face for britain whom he accuses of failing to honor commitments to fund land redistribution . while britain 's delegation has stayed at home , other eu leaders such as german chancellor angela merkel , feel the summit offers an opportunity to reproach mugabe and make their points to him personally . " there has been a very negative trend in the zimbabwe regime and this is something we will have to broach , " barroso said .
" but this is not just a summit to look at zimbabwe . " discussions on issues such as zimbabwe , efforts to bring peace to sudan 's darfur region and the conflict in somalia have not been formally timetabled but are expected to crop up in debates on human rights and peace and security . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , the german government has threatened to claw back subsidies for the project near dresden that has been opposed by unesco . german nature-lovers wept saturday as foresters with chain-saws cut down several oak trees at the site of a planned bridge that has raised the ire of the united nations world cultural body unesco . about 400 anti-bridge protesters , some with tears in their eyes , tried to stop the trees from being cut down with some holding hands for a sit-in round the trees .
riot police dragged them away so work could begin . " these trees survived the bombing by the us and british military on february 13 , 1945 but not the actions of our saxon government , " one elderly woman told the dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests in dresden did not becoming violent the demonstrations were latest protests against building the 160 million euro -lrb- $ 235 million -rrb- bridge , which began two weeks ago with site clearance .

the spokeswoman also said a legal review was " normal " after federal subsidies had been paid . plans for the waldschlößchen bridge , which will cross river meadows four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- east of the baroque city center of dresden , have divided the city .

in a 2005 referendum , city residents voted in favor of the move . unesco listed a 20-kilometer section of the valley as a world heritage site in 2004 and has threatened to withdraw this status if the bridge is not made less intrusive . although courts have ruled that a unesco treaty can not prevent the project , a report by federal counsel maintained that saxony is bound by germany 's treaty undertakings , she said .
the state government of saxony said it has not seen the legal report .
berlin has provided nearly 100 million euros from federal roads funds for the project . dw staff -lrb- jg / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political parties across the spectrum are turning to the issue to lure voters in the lead-up to elections in 2009 . in a pitch to distinguish themselves from their coalition partner the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has called for a softening of the prevailing conscription method , which requires all german males above the age of 18 to enter for military service for nine months . " we are not asking for military service to be scrapped but to proceed on a voluntary basis in future , " said spd party head kurt beck . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remains the last staunch supporter of general conscription and recently emphasized it will uphold current practice at its annual cdu summit earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung is a staunch supporter of conscription " i think that in principle we need conscription because it would be hard to find the 60,000 young men who agree to join the bundeswehr each year , " defense minister franz josef jung , a cdu member , told deutschlandfunk radio . he also dismissed beck 's call for " voluntary conscription " as a contradiction in terms . crucial campaign issue with both parties starting their scramble to improve their image within the grand coalition , issues such as conscription could well be crucial in next year 's campaigning ahead of elections in 2009 . mandatory military service not only serves as a focal point to distinguish party programs , but also directly affects the lives of every german male above the age of 18 .
since the number of conscientious objectors has been steadily rising in favor of civil service , conscription might well be an issue that could impact on the outcome of the next elections .
men can also choose to do a year of social work rather than enter the military . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscription could gain in importance during next year 's campaigns german opposition parties are generally united in their rejection of the current conscription practice and have called for its abolishment or suspension . conscription opponents argue that large standing armies are no longer necessary for domestic defense and that specialized , professional troops who can be deployed swiftly in any crisis region on the globe are needed . " conscription can not be justified any more from the security policy angle , " said claudia roth , a greens party leader .
" it also constitutes a massive intrusion into the basic rights of young men . " other critics refer to the majority of nato partners that have already adopted the model of smaller , professional armies saying that germany 's reliance on conscription is dated .

political parties across the spectrum are turning to the issue to lure voters in the lead-up to elections in 2009 . in a pitch to distinguish themselves from their coalition partner the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has called for a softening of the prevailing conscription method , which requires all german males above the age of 18 to enter for military service for nine months . " we are not asking for military service to be scrapped but to proceed on a voluntary basis in future , " said spd party head kurt beck . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remains the last staunch supporter of general conscription and recently emphasized it will uphold current practice at its annual cdu summit earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung is a staunch supporter of conscription " i think that in principle we need conscription because it would be hard to find the 60,000 young men who agree to join the bundeswehr each year , " defense minister franz josef jung , a cdu member , told deutschlandfunk radio . he also dismissed beck 's call for " voluntary conscription " as a contradiction in terms . crucial campaign issue with both parties starting their scramble to improve their image within the grand coalition , issues such as conscription could well be crucial in next year 's campaigning ahead of elections in 2009 . mandatory military service not only serves as a focal point to distinguish party programs , but also directly affects the lives of every german male above the age of 18 .
since the number of conscientious objectors has been steadily rising in favor of civil service , conscription might well be an issue that could impact on the outcome of the next elections .
men can also choose to do a year of social work rather than enter the military . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscription could gain in importance during next year 's campaigns german opposition parties are generally united in their rejection of the current conscription practice and have called for its abolishment or suspension . conscription opponents argue that large standing armies are no longer necessary for domestic defense and that specialized , professional troops who can be deployed swiftly in any crisis region on the globe are needed . " conscription can not be justified any more from the security policy angle , " said claudia roth , a greens party leader .
" it also constitutes a massive intrusion into the basic rights of young men . " other critics refer to the majority of nato partners that have already adopted the model of smaller , professional armies saying that germany 's reliance on conscription is dated .

political parties across the spectrum are turning to the issue to lure voters in the lead-up to elections in 2009 . in a pitch to distinguish themselves from their coalition partner the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has called for a softening of the prevailing conscription method , which requires all german males above the age of 18 to enter for military service for nine months . " we are not asking for military service to be scrapped but to proceed on a voluntary basis in future , " said spd party head kurt beck . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remains the last staunch supporter of general conscription and recently emphasized it will uphold current practice at its annual cdu summit earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung is a staunch supporter of conscription " i think that in principle we need conscription because it would be hard to find the 60,000 young men who agree to join the bundeswehr each year , " defense minister franz josef jung , a cdu member , told deutschlandfunk radio . he also dismissed beck 's call for " voluntary conscription " as a contradiction in terms . crucial campaign issue with both parties starting their scramble to improve their image within the grand coalition , issues such as conscription could well be crucial in next year 's campaigning ahead of elections in 2009 . mandatory military service not only serves as a focal point to distinguish party programs , but also directly affects the lives of every german male above the age of 18 .
since the number of conscientious objectors has been steadily rising in favor of civil service , conscription might well be an issue that could impact on the outcome of the next elections .

" conscription can not be justified any more from the security policy angle , " said claudia roth , a greens party leader .
" it also constitutes a massive intrusion into the basic rights of young men . " other critics refer to the majority of nato partners that have already adopted the model of smaller , professional armies saying that germany 's reliance on conscription is dated .

german army conscripts do not serve in military missions abroad and often receive administrational duties . historic issues still cast their shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most nato members have professional armies in contrast to many nato members , historic issues have weighed heavily on german domestic and foreign policy since 1945 .
after world war ii 's disastrous consequences , german politicians wanted to ensure that the new army consisted of " citizens in uniform " in order to guarantee democratic control of the army . the concept of rearming germany was also fostered by nato partners who were confronted with the warsaw pact , led by the soviet union . however , with the end of the cold war and the reunification of germany in 1990 , the future of nato and costly large armies appeared rather blurred .
moreover , germany no longer had any borders with potential enemies and therefore one of the main arguments for conscription was void .
at the same time germany 's responsibility abroad was constantly growing . after the cold war , new threats were found to justify nato 's international role .
but it was only after a long domestic debate that germany agreed to contribute troops to the alliance 's missions in the balkans and later afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently has about 3,000 troops deployed to afghanistan accordingly , opposition parties like the free-market liberal free democratic party demand a suspension of " unnecessary conscription " at home in favor of more funding for a better equipped smaller professional army capable of acting more efficiently abroad under nato rule . as no fast end to the afghanistan mission is expected and calls for an increase of german troops have been made , it is probable that the conscription and military debate will feature in next year 's campaigning .

political parties across the spectrum are turning to the issue to lure voters in the lead-up to elections in 2009 . in a pitch to distinguish themselves from their coalition partner the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has called for a softening of the prevailing conscription method , which requires all german males above the age of 18 to enter for military service for nine months . " we are not asking for military service to be scrapped but to proceed on a voluntary basis in future , " said spd party head kurt beck . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remains the last staunch supporter of general conscription and recently emphasized it will uphold current practice at its annual cdu summit earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung is a staunch supporter of conscription " i think that in principle we need conscription because it would be hard to find the 60,000 young men who agree to join the bundeswehr each year , " defense minister franz josef jung , a cdu member , told deutschlandfunk radio . he also dismissed beck 's call for " voluntary conscription " as a contradiction in terms . crucial campaign issue with both parties starting their scramble to improve their image within the grand coalition , issues such as conscription could well be crucial in next year 's campaigning ahead of elections in 2009 . mandatory military service not only serves as a focal point to distinguish party programs , but also directly affects the lives of every german male above the age of 18 .
since the number of conscientious objectors has been steadily rising in favor of civil service , conscription might well be an issue that could impact on the outcome of the next elections .
men can also choose to do a year of social work rather than enter the military . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscription could gain in importance during next year 's campaigns german opposition parties are generally united in their rejection of the current conscription practice and have called for its abolishment or suspension . conscription opponents argue that large standing armies are no longer necessary for domestic defense and that specialized , professional troops who can be deployed swiftly in any crisis region on the globe are needed . " conscription can not be justified any more from the security policy angle , " said claudia roth , a greens party leader .
" it also constitutes a massive intrusion into the basic rights of young men . " other critics refer to the majority of nato partners that have already adopted the model of smaller , professional armies saying that germany 's reliance on conscription is dated .
the only nato countries still applying conscription are estonia , lithuania , norway , greece and turkey .
german army conscripts do not serve in military missions abroad and often receive administrational duties . historic issues still cast their shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most nato members have professional armies in contrast to many nato members , historic issues have weighed heavily on german domestic and foreign policy since 1945 .
after world war ii 's disastrous consequences , german politicians wanted to ensure that the new army consisted of " citizens in uniform " in order to guarantee democratic control of the army . the concept of rearming germany was also fostered by nato partners who were confronted with the warsaw pact , led by the soviet union . however , with the end of the cold war and the reunification of germany in 1990 , the future of nato and costly large armies appeared rather blurred .
moreover , germany no longer had any borders with potential enemies and therefore one of the main arguments for conscription was void .
at the same time germany 's responsibility abroad was constantly growing . after the cold war , new threats were found to justify nato 's international role .
