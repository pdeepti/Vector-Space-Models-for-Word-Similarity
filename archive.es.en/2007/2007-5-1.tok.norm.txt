"
germany currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .
estonia 's president toomas hendrik ilves has described the moscow embassy protest as " psycho-terror . "
" nearly two dozen citizens of estonia are in the embassy building , as if taken hostage .
other citizens of estonia are blocked from entering the embassy , " he said .
about 100 youths from pro-kremlin organisations young guard and ours have ringed the estonian embassy since friday , chanting anti-estonian government slogans and pointing the barrel of a green inflatable tank at it .
the protest came after estonian authorities removed a controversial soviet war memorial from central tallinn for relocation at a military cemetery .
estonians see the statue - a monument to red army soldiers who died while fighting fascist forces during world war ii - as a reminder of 50 years of soviet occupation .
flag desecration one russian demonstrator broke into the grounds of the estonian embassy in moscow on tuesday afternoon and cut down and desecrated its flag in a row over the fate of a soviet war memorial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bronze statue of a soviet soldier was relocated to the military cemetery in tallinn estonia and russia have been at loggerheads for months over estonian plans to remove a red army war memorial from its current location in central tallinn to a nearby war cemetery .
and on tuesday afternoon a group of demonstrators broke through the first of two fences surrounding the embassy .
one man then jumped the second fence , cut the estonian flag down from its nine-meter staff and began cutting it up , persidski said .
" the militia caught him as he tried to get away and returned the remains of the flag to us .
we put up a new one , " he added .
the leader of the young russia movement , which is conducting the siege , said that the men were not part of his organization , the baltic news service bns reported .
but estonia 's ambassador to russia , marina kaljurand , told the echo moskvy radio station that the blockade could only take place with the " tacit agreement " of the russian authorities , persidski said .
archeology work completed estonian archeologists finished their search for the coffins of soldiers buried at the site in tallinn on tuesday evening , the estonian defence ministry announced .
according to initial information from the site , a total of 12 coffins of fallen red army soldiers have been found , defense ministry spokeswoman aet kukk told the german news agency dpa .
the soldiers are to be exhumed and taken to a morgue for forensic examination and possible identification .
the ministry then plans to rebury them in a tallinn war cemetery , to which the statue which guarded them has already been moved , kukk said .
and the estonian defence forces will hold memorial ceremonies in the cemetery both on may 8 - the anniversary of the end of world war ii in western europe - and at the end of june , when the complete memorial complex is scheduled to be re-inaugurated at its new site . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel calls putin over missile row and violence in estonia german chancellor angela merkel spoke to russian president vladimir putin saturday to discuss the growing controversy over the proposed us missile shield and to hear his views on the escalating violence in estonia .

but even this race for the rich and famous ran into trouble when it came up against german police , who told them to slow it down . are you rich , with lots of time on your hands ?
if you 've got a fat wallet and a jaw-dropping , pedal-to-the-metal kind of car , the gumball 3000 rally is the race for you .
this year 's gumball 3000 - which started on sunday - is a race from london to istanbul and back with drivers maneuvering some of the world 's fastest , flashiest cars .
by day , the 240 drivers in 120 cars aim to travel sixteen countries in eight days .
by night , they party their speed-demon hearts out .
the gumball is a 3,000 mile , global race for the jet-set crowd : models , celebrities , billionaires , athletes , businessmen , rock stars and a few wanna-bes .
their " steeds " range from ferraris to lamborghinis and rolls royces , but also include ice cream trucks , vw campers and even a turkish taxi .
german police not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officer yells " say cheese " to gumballers the gumballers have stumbled onto a problem in germany , though . the country may pride itself in having highways without speed limits - so much so that tourists from abroad book vacations in the country to drive the autobahns , but there are still limits along certain stretches of highway .
on monday , german police were more than a little miffed about the gumball racers .
they handed out hefty " security deposit " tickets of around 420 euros -lrb- $ 574 -rrb- to nearly 70 speedsters in the german states of north rhine-westphalia , hesse and rhineland-palatinate .
-lrb- actual fines will be established later . -rrb-

"
germany currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .
estonia 's president toomas hendrik ilves has described the moscow embassy protest as " psycho-terror . "
" nearly two dozen citizens of estonia are in the embassy building , as if taken hostage .
other citizens of estonia are blocked from entering the embassy , " he said .
about 100 youths from pro-kremlin organisations young guard and ours have ringed the estonian embassy since friday , chanting anti-estonian government slogans and pointing the barrel of a green inflatable tank at it .
the protest came after estonian authorities removed a controversial soviet war memorial from central tallinn for relocation at a military cemetery .
estonians see the statue - a monument to red army soldiers who died while fighting fascist forces during world war ii - as a reminder of 50 years of soviet occupation .
flag desecration one russian demonstrator broke into the grounds of the estonian embassy in moscow on tuesday afternoon and cut down and desecrated its flag in a row over the fate of a soviet war memorial .

and on tuesday afternoon a group of demonstrators broke through the first of two fences surrounding the embassy .
one man then jumped the second fence , cut the estonian flag down from its nine-meter staff and began cutting it up , persidski said .
" the militia caught him as he tried to get away and returned the remains of the flag to us .
we put up a new one , " he added .
the leader of the young russia movement , which is conducting the siege , said that the men were not part of his organization , the baltic news service bns reported .
but estonia 's ambassador to russia , marina kaljurand , told the echo moskvy radio station that the blockade could only take place with the " tacit agreement " of the russian authorities , persidski said .
archeology work completed estonian archeologists finished their search for the coffins of soldiers buried at the site in tallinn on tuesday evening , the estonian defence ministry announced .
according to initial information from the site , a total of 12 coffins of fallen red army soldiers have been found , defense ministry spokeswoman aet kukk told the german news agency dpa .
the soldiers are to be exhumed and taken to a morgue for forensic examination and possible identification .
the ministry then plans to rebury them in a tallinn war cemetery , to which the statue which guarded them has already been moved , kukk said .
and the estonian defence forces will hold memorial ceremonies in the cemetery both on may 8 - the anniversary of the end of world war ii in western europe - and at the end of june , when the complete memorial complex is scheduled to be re-inaugurated at its new site . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel calls putin over missile row and violence in estonia german chancellor angela merkel spoke to russian president vladimir putin saturday to discuss the growing controversy over the proposed us missile shield and to hear his views on the escalating violence in estonia .

other celebrations , however , were largely peaceful . rioters threw bottles at police officers in berlin last night during what is known as " walpurgnis night , " or " witches ' night " in germany and other parts of europe .
traditionally a pagan custom to ring in springtime , people celebrate and dance in pubs and outside .
berlin police said that drunken young people also threw stones at them in friedrichshain , an eastern district of the city .
earlier in the evening , around 1,000 anti-globalization protestors held peaceful demonstrations in friedrichshain .
over 5,000 riot police equipped with batons and water-cannons are currently on duty in berlin - 1,000 of those from other german states - to keep celebrations and demonstrations under control .
undercover unit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reminders of kreuzberg street battle 20 years ago berlin police also said a special undercover unit had been installed , with around 100 plain-clothes agents mixing unobtrusively with demonstrators in order to spot and arrest trouble-makers and prevent riots .
the undercover unit was created during last year 's world cup to catch soccer hooligans on berlin 's streets .
twenty years ago , on may 1 , 1987 , rioters in the kreuzberg district of berlin clashed with police and smashed shop windows .
businesses were also plundered and cars set on fire .
since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , run-ins between rioters and police have been frequent on may day eve or may 1 , particularly in the eastern districts of the city .
however , celebrations and demonstrations have been more peaceful the past two years , police said .

cabinet officials also signed a landmark " open skies " agreement designed to allow every eu and us airline to fly between every city in the european union and the united states starting march 30 .
the agreement could bring up to 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- in economic benefits , up to 80,000 new jobs on both sides and lower airfares , according to eu officials .
" this agreement provides air service with a reliable and modern set of regulations , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said .

" our economic relation is by far the most important in the world , " barroso said after the eu-us summit , noting that us-eu trade totals 1.7 billion euros a day .
" but we can work together more to make that relation even easier , and i believe there is some untapped potential . "

" i really welcome the fact that there was progress in this meeting , " barroso said .
" we agree there 's a threat , there 's a very serious and global threat .
we agree that there is a need to reduce emissions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 01.05.2007 gumball rally racers flagged down by german police großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : throw your cares to the wind during the gumball in a race stretching across europe , the gumball 3000 is not for the faint of heart .
but even this race for the rich and famous ran into trouble when it came up against german police , who told them to slow it down . are you rich , with lots of time on your hands ?
if you 've got a fat wallet and a jaw-dropping , pedal-to-the-metal kind of car , the gumball 3000 rally is the race for you .
this year 's gumball 3000 - which started on sunday - is a race from london to istanbul and back with drivers maneuvering some of the world 's fastest , flashiest cars .
by day , the 240 drivers in 120 cars aim to travel sixteen countries in eight days .
by night , they party their speed-demon hearts out .
the gumball is a 3,000 mile , global race for the jet-set crowd : models , celebrities , billionaires , athletes , businessmen , rock stars and a few wanna-bes .
their " steeds " range from ferraris to lamborghinis and rolls royces , but also include ice cream trucks , vw campers and even a turkish taxi .
german police not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officer yells " say cheese " to gumballers the gumballers have stumbled onto a problem in germany , though . the country may pride itself in having highways without speed limits - so much so that tourists from abroad book vacations in the country to drive the autobahns , but there are still limits along certain stretches of highway .
on monday , german police were more than a little miffed about the gumball racers .
they handed out hefty " security deposit " tickets of around 420 euros -lrb- $ 574 -rrb- to nearly 70 speedsters in the german states of north rhine-westphalia , hesse and rhineland-palatinate .
-lrb- actual fines will be established later . -rrb-
one racer was even caught driving 150 kilometers per hour -lrb- 93 miles per hour -rrb- in an 80-kph zone .
police also forbade the race from continuing through germany from belgium .
from london to istanbul and back gumballers were on their way to the hahn airport near frankfurt , where two planes were to transport their cars to istanbul , turkey , where they would resume their course .
from istanbul , the illegal race is supposed to head back through southeast europe to london via slovakia and berlin .
in germany , though , gumballers had to downshift and allow themselves to be escorted by german police in convoys to the airport .
but the racers were n't irked , and the " security deposits " certainly did n't put a dent in the drivers ' wallets .
speedsters consider tickets reaped during the rally to be more like badges or trophies in the pursuit of high speed and gumball fame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will retired michael schumacher become a gumballer ?
besides , having to pay around 41,000 euros to participate in the contest in the first place , and owning the kind of car necessary for such escapades , a few hundred euros mean nothing .
that kind of attitude is probably necessary anyway to be able to whiz down european highways and not flinch during the near-misses as old grannies pull out in front of you in the passing lane , or clunker cars scramble to get out of your way .
after all , the annual " gumball 3000 " - which kicked off in 1999 - is not just a race , it 's a " lifestyle , " the website boasts .
and , if you want to believe founder maximillion cooper 's portal , it 's not surprising that the gumball 3000 rally was created by a man who was fathered by a rock ' n ' roll drummer , mothered by a model and hobnobs with the likes of north korea leader kim jong il .

by night , they party their speed-demon hearts out .
the gumball is a 3,000 mile , global race for the jet-set crowd : models , celebrities , billionaires , athletes , businessmen , rock stars and a few wanna-bes .
their " steeds " range from ferraris to lamborghinis and rolls royces , but also include ice cream trucks , vw campers and even a turkish taxi .
german police not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officer yells " say cheese " to gumballers the gumballers have stumbled onto a problem in germany , though . the country may pride itself in having highways without speed limits - so much so that tourists from abroad book vacations in the country to drive the autobahns , but there are still limits along certain stretches of highway .
on monday , german police were more than a little miffed about the gumball racers .
they handed out hefty " security deposit " tickets of around 420 euros -lrb- $ 574 -rrb- to nearly 70 speedsters in the german states of north rhine-westphalia , hesse and rhineland-palatinate .
-lrb- actual fines will be established later . -rrb-
one racer was even caught driving 150 kilometers per hour -lrb- 93 miles per hour -rrb- in an 80-kph zone .
police also forbade the race from continuing through germany from belgium .
from london to istanbul and back gumballers were on their way to the hahn airport near frankfurt , where two planes were to transport their cars to istanbul , turkey , where they would resume their course .
from istanbul , the illegal race is supposed to head back through southeast europe to london via slovakia and berlin .
in germany , though , gumballers had to downshift and allow themselves to be escorted by german police in convoys to the airport .
but the racers were n't irked , and the " security deposits " certainly did n't put a dent in the drivers ' wallets .
speedsters consider tickets reaped during the rally to be more like badges or trophies in the pursuit of high speed and gumball fame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will retired michael schumacher become a gumballer ?
besides , having to pay around 41,000 euros to participate in the contest in the first place , and owning the kind of car necessary for such escapades , a few hundred euros mean nothing .
that kind of attitude is probably necessary anyway to be able to whiz down european highways and not flinch during the near-misses as old grannies pull out in front of you in the passing lane , or clunker cars scramble to get out of your way .
after all , the annual " gumball 3000 " - which kicked off in 1999 - is not just a race , it 's a " lifestyle , " the website boasts .
and , if you want to believe founder maximillion cooper 's portal , it 's not surprising that the gumball 3000 rally was created by a man who was fathered by a rock ' n ' roll drummer , mothered by a model and hobnobs with the likes of north korea leader kim jong il .

about 100 youths from pro-kremlin organisations young guard and ours have ringed the estonian embassy since friday , chanting anti-estonian government slogans and pointing the barrel of a green inflatable tank at it .
the protest came after estonian authorities removed a controversial soviet war memorial from central tallinn for relocation at a military cemetery .

one man then jumped the second fence , cut the estonian flag down from its nine-meter staff and began cutting it up , persidski said .
" the militia caught him as he tried to get away and returned the remains of the flag to us .
we put up a new one , " he added .
the leader of the young russia movement , which is conducting the siege , said that the men were not part of his organization , the baltic news service bns reported .
but estonia 's ambassador to russia , marina kaljurand , told the echo moskvy radio station that the blockade could only take place with the " tacit agreement " of the russian authorities , persidski said .
archeology work completed estonian archeologists finished their search for the coffins of soldiers buried at the site in tallinn on tuesday evening , the estonian defence ministry announced .
according to initial information from the site , a total of 12 coffins of fallen red army soldiers have been found , defense ministry spokeswoman aet kukk told the german news agency dpa .
the soldiers are to be exhumed and taken to a morgue for forensic examination and possible identification .
the ministry then plans to rebury them in a tallinn war cemetery , to which the statue which guarded them has already been moved , kukk said .
and the estonian defence forces will hold memorial ceremonies in the cemetery both on may 8 - the anniversary of the end of world war ii in western europe - and at the end of june , when the complete memorial complex is scheduled to be re-inaugurated at its new site . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel calls putin over missile row and violence in estonia german chancellor angela merkel spoke to russian president vladimir putin saturday to discuss the growing controversy over the proposed us missile shield and to hear his views on the escalating violence in estonia .

but even this race for the rich and famous ran into trouble when it came up against german police , who told them to slow it down . are you rich , with lots of time on your hands ?
if you 've got a fat wallet and a jaw-dropping , pedal-to-the-metal kind of car , the gumball 3000 rally is the race for you .
this year 's gumball 3000 - which started on sunday - is a race from london to istanbul and back with drivers maneuvering some of the world 's fastest , flashiest cars .
by day , the 240 drivers in 120 cars aim to travel sixteen countries in eight days .
by night , they party their speed-demon hearts out .
the gumball is a 3,000 mile , global race for the jet-set crowd : models , celebrities , billionaires , athletes , businessmen , rock stars and a few wanna-bes .
their " steeds " range from ferraris to lamborghinis and rolls royces , but also include ice cream trucks , vw campers and even a turkish taxi .
german police not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officer yells " say cheese " to gumballers the gumballers have stumbled onto a problem in germany , though . the country may pride itself in having highways without speed limits - so much so that tourists from abroad book vacations in the country to drive the autobahns , but there are still limits along certain stretches of highway .
on monday , german police were more than a little miffed about the gumball racers .
they handed out hefty " security deposit " tickets of around 420 euros -lrb- $ 574 -rrb- to nearly 70 speedsters in the german states of north rhine-westphalia , hesse and rhineland-palatinate .
-lrb- actual fines will be established later . -rrb-
one racer was even caught driving 150 kilometers per hour -lrb- 93 miles per hour -rrb- in an 80-kph zone .
police also forbade the race from continuing through germany from belgium .
from london to istanbul and back gumballers were on their way to the hahn airport near frankfurt , where two planes were to transport their cars to istanbul , turkey , where they would resume their course .
from istanbul , the illegal race is supposed to head back through southeast europe to london via slovakia and berlin .
in germany , though , gumballers had to downshift and allow themselves to be escorted by german police in convoys to the airport .
but the racers were n't irked , and the " security deposits " certainly did n't put a dent in the drivers ' wallets .
speedsters consider tickets reaped during the rally to be more like badges or trophies in the pursuit of high speed and gumball fame .

besides , having to pay around 41,000 euros to participate in the contest in the first place , and owning the kind of car necessary for such escapades , a few hundred euros mean nothing .
that kind of attitude is probably necessary anyway to be able to whiz down european highways and not flinch during the near-misses as old grannies pull out in front of you in the passing lane , or clunker cars scramble to get out of your way .
after all , the annual " gumball 3000 " - which kicked off in 1999 - is not just a race , it 's a " lifestyle , " the website boasts .
and , if you want to believe founder maximillion cooper 's portal , it 's not surprising that the gumball 3000 rally was created by a man who was fathered by a rock ' n ' roll drummer , mothered by a model and hobnobs with the likes of north korea leader kim jong il .

according to parliamentary minutes , 361 lawmakers were present in the assembly on friday .
the petition challenging the procedure was filed by the main opposition party , the social-democratic republican people 's party .
" it is now up to parliament to decide how to proceed , " kilic said , adding that parliament could begin the election process anew .

" the number -lrb- of lawmakers in support of his presidency -rrb- may increase or decrease , but , after that , my personal opinion is to call ... elections at the earliest possible time , " he said .
the ruling came amid a tense standoff between the secularist military and the ruling islamist-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , whose foreign minister abdullah gul was the sole candidate in the presidential election .
the turkish constitution orders general elections if parliament fails to elect a president in up to four rounds of voting .
general elections are currently scheduled for november 4 .
according to media reports , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and his aides have already discussed bringing the november 4 elections forward to sometime between the end of june and early august .

but even this race for the rich and famous ran into trouble when it came up against german police , who told them to slow it down . are you rich , with lots of time on your hands ?
if you 've got a fat wallet and a jaw-dropping , pedal-to-the-metal kind of car , the gumball 3000 rally is the race for you .
this year 's gumball 3000 - which started on sunday - is a race from london to istanbul and back with drivers maneuvering some of the world 's fastest , flashiest cars .
by day , the 240 drivers in 120 cars aim to travel sixteen countries in eight days .
by night , they party their speed-demon hearts out .
the gumball is a 3,000 mile , global race for the jet-set crowd : models , celebrities , billionaires , athletes , businessmen , rock stars and a few wanna-bes .
their " steeds " range from ferraris to lamborghinis and rolls royces , but also include ice cream trucks , vw campers and even a turkish taxi .
german police not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officer yells " say cheese " to gumballers the gumballers have stumbled onto a problem in germany , though . the country may pride itself in having highways without speed limits - so much so that tourists from abroad book vacations in the country to drive the autobahns , but there are still limits along certain stretches of highway .
on monday , german police were more than a little miffed about the gumball racers .
they handed out hefty " security deposit " tickets of around 420 euros -lrb- $ 574 -rrb- to nearly 70 speedsters in the german states of north rhine-westphalia , hesse and rhineland-palatinate .
-lrb- actual fines will be established later . -rrb-
one racer was even caught driving 150 kilometers per hour -lrb- 93 miles per hour -rrb- in an 80-kph zone .
police also forbade the race from continuing through germany from belgium .
from london to istanbul and back gumballers were on their way to the hahn airport near frankfurt , where two planes were to transport their cars to istanbul , turkey , where they would resume their course .
from istanbul , the illegal race is supposed to head back through southeast europe to london via slovakia and berlin .
in germany , though , gumballers had to downshift and allow themselves to be escorted by german police in convoys to the airport .
but the racers were n't irked , and the " security deposits " certainly did n't put a dent in the drivers ' wallets .
speedsters consider tickets reaped during the rally to be more like badges or trophies in the pursuit of high speed and gumball fame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will retired michael schumacher become a gumballer ?
besides , having to pay around 41,000 euros to participate in the contest in the first place , and owning the kind of car necessary for such escapades , a few hundred euros mean nothing .
that kind of attitude is probably necessary anyway to be able to whiz down european highways and not flinch during the near-misses as old grannies pull out in front of you in the passing lane , or clunker cars scramble to get out of your way .
after all , the annual " gumball 3000 " - which kicked off in 1999 - is not just a race , it 's a " lifestyle , " the website boasts .
and , if you want to believe founder maximillion cooper 's portal , it 's not surprising that the gumball 3000 rally was created by a man who was fathered by a rock ' n ' roll drummer , mothered by a model and hobnobs with the likes of north korea leader kim jong il .
so , for those of you seeking gumball glory , you can get your first taste of it through saturday , when the contest ends . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de death defying driving lesson drives driver round the bend most people draw the line at teaching their partner how to drive .

other celebrations , however , were largely peaceful . rioters threw bottles at police officers in berlin last night during what is known as " walpurgnis night , " or " witches ' night " in germany and other parts of europe .
traditionally a pagan custom to ring in springtime , people celebrate and dance in pubs and outside .
berlin police said that drunken young people also threw stones at them in friedrichshain , an eastern district of the city .
earlier in the evening , around 1,000 anti-globalization protestors held peaceful demonstrations in friedrichshain .
over 5,000 riot police equipped with batons and water-cannons are currently on duty in berlin - 1,000 of those from other german states - to keep celebrations and demonstrations under control .
undercover unit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reminders of kreuzberg street battle 20 years ago berlin police also said a special undercover unit had been installed , with around 100 plain-clothes agents mixing unobtrusively with demonstrators in order to spot and arrest trouble-makers and prevent riots .
the undercover unit was created during last year 's world cup to catch soccer hooligans on berlin 's streets .
twenty years ago , on may 1 , 1987 , rioters in the kreuzberg district of berlin clashed with police and smashed shop windows .
businesses were also plundered and cars set on fire .
since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , run-ins between rioters and police have been frequent on may day eve or may 1 , particularly in the eastern districts of the city .
however , celebrations and demonstrations have been more peaceful the past two years , police said .
may 1 is traditionally a day for nation-wide protests and rallies , mainly organized by unions , to demand better working conditions in german businesses . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful unions launch warning strikes with more to come thousands of workers downed tools monday after the ig metall trade union called strikes to step up pressure for wage talks in the electrical , engineering and metalworking sectors .

according to parliamentary minutes , 361 lawmakers were present in the assembly on friday .
the petition challenging the procedure was filed by the main opposition party , the social-democratic republican people 's party .
" it is now up to parliament to decide how to proceed , " kilic said , adding that parliament could begin the election process anew .
early elections urged gul urged speedy early legislative polls if parliament fails to elect him in a repeated vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early elections are a way out of the crisis " let us see if the lawmakers have changed their minds after all these developments , " gul said in an interview broadcast on trt state-television .
" the number -lrb- of lawmakers in support of his presidency -rrb- may increase or decrease , but , after that , my personal opinion is to call ... elections at the earliest possible time , " he said .
the ruling came amid a tense standoff between the secularist military and the ruling islamist-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , whose foreign minister abdullah gul was the sole candidate in the presidential election .
the turkish constitution orders general elections if parliament fails to elect a president in up to four rounds of voting .
general elections are currently scheduled for november 4 .
according to media reports , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and his aides have already discussed bringing the november 4 elections forward to sometime between the end of june and early august .
secularists worry early elections are generally seen as a way out of the current crisis , which erupted over the prospect of the akp-dominated parliament electing a president with an islamist background .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators during a rally in istanbul on sunday secularists say the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist party , is not truly committed to turkey 's fiercely guarded secular system and gul 's presidency would erode the separation between state and religion .
opposition parties , who had been pressing for early elections for months , boycotted the first-round vote on friday .
hours after the balloting , in which gul fell just 10 votes short of being elected , the influential turkish army accused the government of failing to stop rising islamism in the country and warned that it would act to protect the secular system if necessary .
the extraordinarily harsh statement was widely seen as an indication that gul is unwelcome as president .
about one million people demonstrated in istanbul at the weekend in favor of secularism and against gul 's presidential ambitions . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de council of europe urges turkish army to stay out of elections the council of europe joined the growing chorus of disapproval over the statements made by the turkish army that effectively warned that it would defend turkey 's secular state if a new president threatened it .

"
germany currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .
estonia 's president toomas hendrik ilves has described the moscow embassy protest as " psycho-terror . "
" nearly two dozen citizens of estonia are in the embassy building , as if taken hostage .
other citizens of estonia are blocked from entering the embassy , " he said .
about 100 youths from pro-kremlin organisations young guard and ours have ringed the estonian embassy since friday , chanting anti-estonian government slogans and pointing the barrel of a green inflatable tank at it .
the protest came after estonian authorities removed a controversial soviet war memorial from central tallinn for relocation at a military cemetery .
estonians see the statue - a monument to red army soldiers who died while fighting fascist forces during world war ii - as a reminder of 50 years of soviet occupation .
flag desecration one russian demonstrator broke into the grounds of the estonian embassy in moscow on tuesday afternoon and cut down and desecrated its flag in a row over the fate of a soviet war memorial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bronze statue of a soviet soldier was relocated to the military cemetery in tallinn estonia and russia have been at loggerheads for months over estonian plans to remove a red army war memorial from its current location in central tallinn to a nearby war cemetery .
and on tuesday afternoon a group of demonstrators broke through the first of two fences surrounding the embassy .
one man then jumped the second fence , cut the estonian flag down from its nine-meter staff and began cutting it up , persidski said .
" the militia caught him as he tried to get away and returned the remains of the flag to us .
we put up a new one , " he added .
the leader of the young russia movement , which is conducting the siege , said that the men were not part of his organization , the baltic news service bns reported .
but estonia 's ambassador to russia , marina kaljurand , told the echo moskvy radio station that the blockade could only take place with the " tacit agreement " of the russian authorities , persidski said .
archeology work completed estonian archeologists finished their search for the coffins of soldiers buried at the site in tallinn on tuesday evening , the estonian defence ministry announced .
according to initial information from the site , a total of 12 coffins of fallen red army soldiers have been found , defense ministry spokeswoman aet kukk told the german news agency dpa .
the soldiers are to be exhumed and taken to a morgue for forensic examination and possible identification .
the ministry then plans to rebury them in a tallinn war cemetery , to which the statue which guarded them has already been moved , kukk said .
and the estonian defence forces will hold memorial ceremonies in the cemetery both on may 8 - the anniversary of the end of world war ii in western europe - and at the end of june , when the complete memorial complex is scheduled to be re-inaugurated at its new site . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel calls putin over missile row and violence in estonia german chancellor angela merkel spoke to russian president vladimir putin saturday to discuss the growing controversy over the proposed us missile shield and to hear his views on the escalating violence in estonia .

but even this race for the rich and famous ran into trouble when it came up against german police , who told them to slow it down . are you rich , with lots of time on your hands ?
if you 've got a fat wallet and a jaw-dropping , pedal-to-the-metal kind of car , the gumball 3000 rally is the race for you .
this year 's gumball 3000 - which started on sunday - is a race from london to istanbul and back with drivers maneuvering some of the world 's fastest , flashiest cars .
by day , the 240 drivers in 120 cars aim to travel sixteen countries in eight days .
by night , they party their speed-demon hearts out .
the gumball is a 3,000 mile , global race for the jet-set crowd : models , celebrities , billionaires , athletes , businessmen , rock stars and a few wanna-bes .
their " steeds " range from ferraris to lamborghinis and rolls royces , but also include ice cream trucks , vw campers and even a turkish taxi .
german police not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officer yells " say cheese " to gumballers the gumballers have stumbled onto a problem in germany , though . the country may pride itself in having highways without speed limits - so much so that tourists from abroad book vacations in the country to drive the autobahns , but there are still limits along certain stretches of highway .
on monday , german police were more than a little miffed about the gumball racers .
they handed out hefty " security deposit " tickets of around 420 euros -lrb- $ 574 -rrb- to nearly 70 speedsters in the german states of north rhine-westphalia , hesse and rhineland-palatinate .
-lrb- actual fines will be established later . -rrb-
one racer was even caught driving 150 kilometers per hour -lrb- 93 miles per hour -rrb- in an 80-kph zone .
police also forbade the race from continuing through germany from belgium .
from london to istanbul and back gumballers were on their way to the hahn airport near frankfurt , where two planes were to transport their cars to istanbul , turkey , where they would resume their course .
from istanbul , the illegal race is supposed to head back through southeast europe to london via slovakia and berlin .
in germany , though , gumballers had to downshift and allow themselves to be escorted by german police in convoys to the airport .
but the racers were n't irked , and the " security deposits " certainly did n't put a dent in the drivers ' wallets .
speedsters consider tickets reaped during the rally to be more like badges or trophies in the pursuit of high speed and gumball fame .

besides , having to pay around 41,000 euros to participate in the contest in the first place , and owning the kind of car necessary for such escapades , a few hundred euros mean nothing .
that kind of attitude is probably necessary anyway to be able to whiz down european highways and not flinch during the near-misses as old grannies pull out in front of you in the passing lane , or clunker cars scramble to get out of your way .
after all , the annual " gumball 3000 " - which kicked off in 1999 - is not just a race , it 's a " lifestyle , " the website boasts .
and , if you want to believe founder maximillion cooper 's portal , it 's not surprising that the gumball 3000 rally was created by a man who was fathered by a rock ' n ' roll drummer , mothered by a model and hobnobs with the likes of north korea leader kim jong il .

other celebrations , however , were largely peaceful . rioters threw bottles at police officers in berlin last night during what is known as " walpurgnis night , " or " witches ' night " in germany and other parts of europe .
traditionally a pagan custom to ring in springtime , people celebrate and dance in pubs and outside .
berlin police said that drunken young people also threw stones at them in friedrichshain , an eastern district of the city .
earlier in the evening , around 1,000 anti-globalization protestors held peaceful demonstrations in friedrichshain .
over 5,000 riot police equipped with batons and water-cannons are currently on duty in berlin - 1,000 of those from other german states - to keep celebrations and demonstrations under control .
undercover unit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reminders of kreuzberg street battle 20 years ago berlin police also said a special undercover unit had been installed , with around 100 plain-clothes agents mixing unobtrusively with demonstrators in order to spot and arrest trouble-makers and prevent riots .
the undercover unit was created during last year 's world cup to catch soccer hooligans on berlin 's streets .
twenty years ago , on may 1 , 1987 , rioters in the kreuzberg district of berlin clashed with police and smashed shop windows .
businesses were also plundered and cars set on fire .
since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , run-ins between rioters and police have been frequent on may day eve or may 1 , particularly in the eastern districts of the city .
however , celebrations and demonstrations have been more peaceful the past two years , police said .

about 100 youths from pro-kremlin organisations young guard and ours have ringed the estonian embassy since friday , chanting anti-estonian government slogans and pointing the barrel of a green inflatable tank at it .
the protest came after estonian authorities removed a controversial soviet war memorial from central tallinn for relocation at a military cemetery .
estonians see the statue - a monument to red army soldiers who died while fighting fascist forces during world war ii - as a reminder of 50 years of soviet occupation .

one man then jumped the second fence , cut the estonian flag down from its nine-meter staff and began cutting it up , persidski said .
" the militia caught him as he tried to get away and returned the remains of the flag to us .
we put up a new one , " he added .
the leader of the young russia movement , which is conducting the siege , said that the men were not part of his organization , the baltic news service bns reported .
but estonia 's ambassador to russia , marina kaljurand , told the echo moskvy radio station that the blockade could only take place with the " tacit agreement " of the russian authorities , persidski said .
archeology work completed estonian archeologists finished their search for the coffins of soldiers buried at the site in tallinn on tuesday evening , the estonian defence ministry announced .
according to initial information from the site , a total of 12 coffins of fallen red army soldiers have been found , defense ministry spokeswoman aet kukk told the german news agency dpa .
the soldiers are to be exhumed and taken to a morgue for forensic examination and possible identification .
the ministry then plans to rebury them in a tallinn war cemetery , to which the statue which guarded them has already been moved , kukk said .
and the estonian defence forces will hold memorial ceremonies in the cemetery both on may 8 - the anniversary of the end of world war ii in western europe - and at the end of june , when the complete memorial complex is scheduled to be re-inaugurated at its new site . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel calls putin over missile row and violence in estonia german chancellor angela merkel spoke to russian president vladimir putin saturday to discuss the growing controversy over the proposed us missile shield and to hear his views on the escalating violence in estonia .

if you 've got a fat wallet and a jaw-dropping , pedal-to-the-metal kind of car , the gumball 3000 rally is the race for you .
this year 's gumball 3000 - which started on sunday - is a race from london to istanbul and back with drivers maneuvering some of the world 's fastest , flashiest cars .
by day , the 240 drivers in 120 cars aim to travel sixteen countries in eight days .
by night , they party their speed-demon hearts out .
the gumball is a 3,000 mile , global race for the jet-set crowd : models , celebrities , billionaires , athletes , businessmen , rock stars and a few wanna-bes .
their " steeds " range from ferraris to lamborghinis and rolls royces , but also include ice cream trucks , vw campers and even a turkish taxi .
german police not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officer yells " say cheese " to gumballers the gumballers have stumbled onto a problem in germany , though . the country may pride itself in having highways without speed limits - so much so that tourists from abroad book vacations in the country to drive the autobahns , but there are still limits along certain stretches of highway .
on monday , german police were more than a little miffed about the gumball racers .
they handed out hefty " security deposit " tickets of around 420 euros -lrb- $ 574 -rrb- to nearly 70 speedsters in the german states of north rhine-westphalia , hesse and rhineland-palatinate .
-lrb- actual fines will be established later . -rrb-
one racer was even caught driving 150 kilometers per hour -lrb- 93 miles per hour -rrb- in an 80-kph zone .
police also forbade the race from continuing through germany from belgium .
from london to istanbul and back gumballers were on their way to the hahn airport near frankfurt , where two planes were to transport their cars to istanbul , turkey , where they would resume their course .
from istanbul , the illegal race is supposed to head back through southeast europe to london via slovakia and berlin .
in germany , though , gumballers had to downshift and allow themselves to be escorted by german police in convoys to the airport .
but the racers were n't irked , and the " security deposits " certainly did n't put a dent in the drivers ' wallets .
speedsters consider tickets reaped during the rally to be more like badges or trophies in the pursuit of high speed and gumball fame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will retired michael schumacher become a gumballer ?
besides , having to pay around 41,000 euros to participate in the contest in the first place , and owning the kind of car necessary for such escapades , a few hundred euros mean nothing .
that kind of attitude is probably necessary anyway to be able to whiz down european highways and not flinch during the near-misses as old grannies pull out in front of you in the passing lane , or clunker cars scramble to get out of your way .
after all , the annual " gumball 3000 " - which kicked off in 1999 - is not just a race , it 's a " lifestyle , " the website boasts .
and , if you want to believe founder maximillion cooper 's portal , it 's not surprising that the gumball 3000 rally was created by a man who was fathered by a rock ' n ' roll drummer , mothered by a model and hobnobs with the likes of north korea leader kim jong il .

but even this race for the rich and famous ran into trouble when it came up against german police , who told them to slow it down . are you rich , with lots of time on your hands ?
if you 've got a fat wallet and a jaw-dropping , pedal-to-the-metal kind of car , the gumball 3000 rally is the race for you .
this year 's gumball 3000 - which started on sunday - is a race from london to istanbul and back with drivers maneuvering some of the world 's fastest , flashiest cars .
by day , the 240 drivers in 120 cars aim to travel sixteen countries in eight days .
by night , they party their speed-demon hearts out .
the gumball is a 3,000 mile , global race for the jet-set crowd : models , celebrities , billionaires , athletes , businessmen , rock stars and a few wanna-bes .
their " steeds " range from ferraris to lamborghinis and rolls royces , but also include ice cream trucks , vw campers and even a turkish taxi .
german police not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officer yells " say cheese " to gumballers the gumballers have stumbled onto a problem in germany , though . the country may pride itself in having highways without speed limits - so much so that tourists from abroad book vacations in the country to drive the autobahns , but there are still limits along certain stretches of highway .
on monday , german police were more than a little miffed about the gumball racers .
they handed out hefty " security deposit " tickets of around 420 euros -lrb- $ 574 -rrb- to nearly 70 speedsters in the german states of north rhine-westphalia , hesse and rhineland-palatinate .
-lrb- actual fines will be established later . -rrb-
one racer was even caught driving 150 kilometers per hour -lrb- 93 miles per hour -rrb- in an 80-kph zone .
police also forbade the race from continuing through germany from belgium .
from london to istanbul and back gumballers were on their way to the hahn airport near frankfurt , where two planes were to transport their cars to istanbul , turkey , where they would resume their course .
from istanbul , the illegal race is supposed to head back through southeast europe to london via slovakia and berlin .
in germany , though , gumballers had to downshift and allow themselves to be escorted by german police in convoys to the airport .
but the racers were n't irked , and the " security deposits " certainly did n't put a dent in the drivers ' wallets .
speedsters consider tickets reaped during the rally to be more like badges or trophies in the pursuit of high speed and gumball fame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will retired michael schumacher become a gumballer ?
besides , having to pay around 41,000 euros to participate in the contest in the first place , and owning the kind of car necessary for such escapades , a few hundred euros mean nothing .
that kind of attitude is probably necessary anyway to be able to whiz down european highways and not flinch during the near-misses as old grannies pull out in front of you in the passing lane , or clunker cars scramble to get out of your way .
after all , the annual " gumball 3000 " - which kicked off in 1999 - is not just a race , it 's a " lifestyle , " the website boasts .
and , if you want to believe founder maximillion cooper 's portal , it 's not surprising that the gumball 3000 rally was created by a man who was fathered by a rock ' n ' roll drummer , mothered by a model and hobnobs with the likes of north korea leader kim jong il .

other celebrations , however , were largely peaceful . rioters threw bottles at police officers in berlin last night during what is known as " walpurgnis night , " or " witches ' night " in germany and other parts of europe .
traditionally a pagan custom to ring in springtime , people celebrate and dance in pubs and outside .
berlin police said that drunken young people also threw stones at them in friedrichshain , an eastern district of the city .
earlier in the evening , around 1,000 anti-globalization protestors held peaceful demonstrations in friedrichshain .
over 5,000 riot police equipped with batons and water-cannons are currently on duty in berlin - 1,000 of those from other german states - to keep celebrations and demonstrations under control .
undercover unit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reminders of kreuzberg street battle 20 years ago berlin police also said a special undercover unit had been installed , with around 100 plain-clothes agents mixing unobtrusively with demonstrators in order to spot and arrest trouble-makers and prevent riots .
the undercover unit was created during last year 's world cup to catch soccer hooligans on berlin 's streets .
twenty years ago , on may 1 , 1987 , rioters in the kreuzberg district of berlin clashed with police and smashed shop windows .
businesses were also plundered and cars set on fire .
since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , run-ins between rioters and police have been frequent on may day eve or may 1 , particularly in the eastern districts of the city .
however , celebrations and demonstrations have been more peaceful the past two years , police said .

cabinet officials also signed a landmark " open skies " agreement designed to allow every eu and us airline to fly between every city in the european union and the united states starting march 30 .
the agreement could bring up to 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- in economic benefits , up to 80,000 new jobs on both sides and lower airfares , according to eu officials .
" this agreement provides air service with a reliable and modern set of regulations , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said .
" both sides will benefit . "
the deal notably ends restrictions at london 's heathrow airport , where us-british service has been limited to four airlines .
however , the accord bars eu investors from buying shareholder control of us airlines .

cooperation is to focus first on the auto industry , medical services and pharmaceuticals .
" our economic relation is by far the most important in the world , " barroso said after the eu-us summit , noting that us-eu trade totals 1.7 billion euros a day .
" but we can work together more to make that relation even easier , and i believe there is some untapped potential . "
the leaders also stressed their commitment to bringing the deadlocked world trade talks to a successful outcome .
" we told our trade ministers : work hard , work often , work constructively , " bush said at a joint press conference .
" i believe we can be successful . "

" we are aware of the fact that we do have a problem here , that we need to solve this problem , " merkel , whose country holds the both the rotating eu and group of eight presidencies .
barroso said that the us even agreeing to call global warming a problem was step in the right direction .
" i really welcome the fact that there was progress in this meeting , " barroso said .
" we agree there 's a threat , there 's a very serious and global threat .
we agree that there is a need to reduce emissions .
we agree that we should work together . "
the trans-atlantic leaders said they had set up a us-eu conference on alternative-fuel standards to meet in washington next year , and discussed plans to take up climate change at the june g8 summit in germany .

but even this race for the rich and famous ran into trouble when it came up against german police , who told them to slow it down . are you rich , with lots of time on your hands ?
if you 've got a fat wallet and a jaw-dropping , pedal-to-the-metal kind of car , the gumball 3000 rally is the race for you .
this year 's gumball 3000 - which started on sunday - is a race from london to istanbul and back with drivers maneuvering some of the world 's fastest , flashiest cars .
by day , the 240 drivers in 120 cars aim to travel sixteen countries in eight days .
by night , they party their speed-demon hearts out .
the gumball is a 3,000 mile , global race for the jet-set crowd : models , celebrities , billionaires , athletes , businessmen , rock stars and a few wanna-bes .
their " steeds " range from ferraris to lamborghinis and rolls royces , but also include ice cream trucks , vw campers and even a turkish taxi .
german police not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officer yells " say cheese " to gumballers the gumballers have stumbled onto a problem in germany , though . the country may pride itself in having highways without speed limits - so much so that tourists from abroad book vacations in the country to drive the autobahns , but there are still limits along certain stretches of highway .
on monday , german police were more than a little miffed about the gumball racers .
they handed out hefty " security deposit " tickets of around 420 euros -lrb- $ 574 -rrb- to nearly 70 speedsters in the german states of north rhine-westphalia , hesse and rhineland-palatinate .
-lrb- actual fines will be established later . -rrb-
one racer was even caught driving 150 kilometers per hour -lrb- 93 miles per hour -rrb- in an 80-kph zone .
police also forbade the race from continuing through germany from belgium .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 01.05.2007 turkish high court annuls presidential vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan , left , talks with his deputy abdullah gul turkey 's constitutional court on tuesday annulled the first round of a parliamentary vote for a new president in a move likely to pave the way for early general elections . the court ruled that the 550-seat parliament should have convened with at least 367 deputies - or the two-thirds majority needed for a president to be elected in the first round - for the voting to have begun , the court 's vice president hasim kilic told reporters .
according to parliamentary minutes , 361 lawmakers were present in the assembly on friday .
the petition challenging the procedure was filed by the main opposition party , the social-democratic republican people 's party .
" it is now up to parliament to decide how to proceed , " kilic said , adding that parliament could begin the election process anew .
early elections urged gul urged speedy early legislative polls if parliament fails to elect him in a repeated vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early elections are a way out of the crisis " let us see if the lawmakers have changed their minds after all these developments , " gul said in an interview broadcast on trt state-television .
" the number -lrb- of lawmakers in support of his presidency -rrb- may increase or decrease , but , after that , my personal opinion is to call ... elections at the earliest possible time , " he said .
the ruling came amid a tense standoff between the secularist military and the ruling islamist-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , whose foreign minister abdullah gul was the sole candidate in the presidential election .
the turkish constitution orders general elections if parliament fails to elect a president in up to four rounds of voting .
general elections are currently scheduled for november 4 .
according to media reports , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and his aides have already discussed bringing the november 4 elections forward to sometime between the end of june and early august .
secularists worry early elections are generally seen as a way out of the current crisis , which erupted over the prospect of the akp-dominated parliament electing a president with an islamist background .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators during a rally in istanbul on sunday secularists say the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist party , is not truly committed to turkey 's fiercely guarded secular system and gul 's presidency would erode the separation between state and religion .
opposition parties , who had been pressing for early elections for months , boycotted the first-round vote on friday .
hours after the balloting , in which gul fell just 10 votes short of being elected , the influential turkish army accused the government of failing to stop rising islamism in the country and warned that it would act to protect the secular system if necessary .
the extraordinarily harsh statement was widely seen as an indication that gul is unwelcome as president .
about one million people demonstrated in istanbul at the weekend in favor of secularism and against gul 's presidential ambitions . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de council of europe urges turkish army to stay out of elections the council of europe joined the growing chorus of disapproval over the statements made by the turkish army that effectively warned that it would defend turkey 's secular state if a new president threatened it .

according to parliamentary minutes , 361 lawmakers were present in the assembly on friday .
the petition challenging the procedure was filed by the main opposition party , the social-democratic republican people 's party .
" it is now up to parliament to decide how to proceed , " kilic said , adding that parliament could begin the election process anew .
early elections urged gul urged speedy early legislative polls if parliament fails to elect him in a repeated vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early elections are a way out of the crisis " let us see if the lawmakers have changed their minds after all these developments , " gul said in an interview broadcast on trt state-television .
" the number -lrb- of lawmakers in support of his presidency -rrb- may increase or decrease , but , after that , my personal opinion is to call ... elections at the earliest possible time , " he said .
the ruling came amid a tense standoff between the secularist military and the ruling islamist-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , whose foreign minister abdullah gul was the sole candidate in the presidential election .
the turkish constitution orders general elections if parliament fails to elect a president in up to four rounds of voting .
general elections are currently scheduled for november 4 .
according to media reports , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and his aides have already discussed bringing the november 4 elections forward to sometime between the end of june and early august .
secularists worry early elections are generally seen as a way out of the current crisis , which erupted over the prospect of the akp-dominated parliament electing a president with an islamist background .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators during a rally in istanbul on sunday secularists say the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist party , is not truly committed to turkey 's fiercely guarded secular system and gul 's presidency would erode the separation between state and religion .
opposition parties , who had been pressing for early elections for months , boycotted the first-round vote on friday .
hours after the balloting , in which gul fell just 10 votes short of being elected , the influential turkish army accused the government of failing to stop rising islamism in the country and warned that it would act to protect the secular system if necessary .
the extraordinarily harsh statement was widely seen as an indication that gul is unwelcome as president .

cabinet officials also signed a landmark " open skies " agreement designed to allow every eu and us airline to fly between every city in the european union and the united states starting march 30 .
the agreement could bring up to 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- in economic benefits , up to 80,000 new jobs on both sides and lower airfares , according to eu officials .
" this agreement provides air service with a reliable and modern set of regulations , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said .
" both sides will benefit . "
the deal notably ends restrictions at london 's heathrow airport , where us-british service has been limited to four airlines .
however , the accord bars eu investors from buying shareholder control of us airlines .
lowering economic hurdles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , bush and barroso said even more trade could take place between the eu and us the broader economic partnership is meant to lower regulatory hurdles - and costs for businesses and consumers in europe and the us - by promoting steps such as mutual recognition of accounting standards and rules governing securities markets , the eu said .
cooperation is to focus first on the auto industry , medical services and pharmaceuticals .
" our economic relation is by far the most important in the world , " barroso said after the eu-us summit , noting that us-eu trade totals 1.7 billion euros a day .
" but we can work together more to make that relation even easier , and i believe there is some untapped potential . "
the leaders also stressed their commitment to bringing the deadlocked world trade talks to a successful outcome .
" we told our trade ministers : work hard , work often , work constructively , " bush said at a joint press conference .
" i believe we can be successful . "
global warming needs " urgent " action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders did n't agree on what to do about the " urgent " problem of climate change bush , merkel and barroso agreed in washington to define global warming as a serious problem requiring " urgent " action , but were deadlocked on what concrete remedies to apply .
" we are aware of the fact that we do have a problem here , that we need to solve this problem , " merkel , whose country holds the both the rotating eu and group of eight presidencies .
barroso said that the us even agreeing to call global warming a problem was step in the right direction .
" i really welcome the fact that there was progress in this meeting , " barroso said .
" we agree there 's a threat , there 's a very serious and global threat .
we agree that there is a need to reduce emissions .
we agree that we should work together . "
the trans-atlantic leaders said they had set up a us-eu conference on alternative-fuel standards to meet in washington next year , and discussed plans to take up climate change at the june g8 summit in germany .

germany currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .
estonia 's president toomas hendrik ilves has described the moscow embassy protest as " psycho-terror . "
" nearly two dozen citizens of estonia are in the embassy building , as if taken hostage .
other citizens of estonia are blocked from entering the embassy , " he said .
about 100 youths from pro-kremlin organisations young guard and ours have ringed the estonian embassy since friday , chanting anti-estonian government slogans and pointing the barrel of a green inflatable tank at it .
the protest came after estonian authorities removed a controversial soviet war memorial from central tallinn for relocation at a military cemetery .
estonians see the statue - a monument to red army soldiers who died while fighting fascist forces during world war ii - as a reminder of 50 years of soviet occupation .
flag desecration one russian demonstrator broke into the grounds of the estonian embassy in moscow on tuesday afternoon and cut down and desecrated its flag in a row over the fate of a soviet war memorial .

and on tuesday afternoon a group of demonstrators broke through the first of two fences surrounding the embassy .
one man then jumped the second fence , cut the estonian flag down from its nine-meter staff and began cutting it up , persidski said .
" the militia caught him as he tried to get away and returned the remains of the flag to us .
we put up a new one , " he added .
the leader of the young russia movement , which is conducting the siege , said that the men were not part of his organization , the baltic news service bns reported .
but estonia 's ambassador to russia , marina kaljurand , told the echo moskvy radio station that the blockade could only take place with the " tacit agreement " of the russian authorities , persidski said .
archeology work completed estonian archeologists finished their search for the coffins of soldiers buried at the site in tallinn on tuesday evening , the estonian defence ministry announced .
according to initial information from the site , a total of 12 coffins of fallen red army soldiers have been found , defense ministry spokeswoman aet kukk told the german news agency dpa .
the soldiers are to be exhumed and taken to a morgue for forensic examination and possible identification .
the ministry then plans to rebury them in a tallinn war cemetery , to which the statue which guarded them has already been moved , kukk said .
and the estonian defence forces will hold memorial ceremonies in the cemetery both on may 8 - the anniversary of the end of world war ii in western europe - and at the end of june , when the complete memorial complex is scheduled to be re-inaugurated at its new site . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel calls putin over missile row and violence in estonia german chancellor angela merkel spoke to russian president vladimir putin saturday to discuss the growing controversy over the proposed us missile shield and to hear his views on the escalating violence in estonia .

" it is now up to parliament to decide how to proceed , " kilic said , adding that parliament could begin the election process anew .

"
germany currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .
estonia 's president toomas hendrik ilves has described the moscow embassy protest as " psycho-terror . "
" nearly two dozen citizens of estonia are in the embassy building , as if taken hostage .
other citizens of estonia are blocked from entering the embassy , " he said .
about 100 youths from pro-kremlin organisations young guard and ours have ringed the estonian embassy since friday , chanting anti-estonian government slogans and pointing the barrel of a green inflatable tank at it .
the protest came after estonian authorities removed a controversial soviet war memorial from central tallinn for relocation at a military cemetery .
estonians see the statue - a monument to red army soldiers who died while fighting fascist forces during world war ii - as a reminder of 50 years of soviet occupation .
flag desecration one russian demonstrator broke into the grounds of the estonian embassy in moscow on tuesday afternoon and cut down and desecrated its flag in a row over the fate of a soviet war memorial .

and on tuesday afternoon a group of demonstrators broke through the first of two fences surrounding the embassy .
one man then jumped the second fence , cut the estonian flag down from its nine-meter staff and began cutting it up , persidski said .
" the militia caught him as he tried to get away and returned the remains of the flag to us .
we put up a new one , " he added .
the leader of the young russia movement , which is conducting the siege , said that the men were not part of his organization , the baltic news service bns reported .
but estonia 's ambassador to russia , marina kaljurand , told the echo moskvy radio station that the blockade could only take place with the " tacit agreement " of the russian authorities , persidski said .
archeology work completed estonian archeologists finished their search for the coffins of soldiers buried at the site in tallinn on tuesday evening , the estonian defence ministry announced .
according to initial information from the site , a total of 12 coffins of fallen red army soldiers have been found , defense ministry spokeswoman aet kukk told the german news agency dpa .
the soldiers are to be exhumed and taken to a morgue for forensic examination and possible identification .
the ministry then plans to rebury them in a tallinn war cemetery , to which the statue which guarded them has already been moved , kukk said .
and the estonian defence forces will hold memorial ceremonies in the cemetery both on may 8 - the anniversary of the end of world war ii in western europe - and at the end of june , when the complete memorial complex is scheduled to be re-inaugurated at its new site . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel calls putin over missile row and violence in estonia german chancellor angela merkel spoke to russian president vladimir putin saturday to discuss the growing controversy over the proposed us missile shield and to hear his views on the escalating violence in estonia .

"
germany currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .
estonia 's president toomas hendrik ilves has described the moscow embassy protest as " psycho-terror . "
" nearly two dozen citizens of estonia are in the embassy building , as if taken hostage .
other citizens of estonia are blocked from entering the embassy , " he said .
about 100 youths from pro-kremlin organisations young guard and ours have ringed the estonian embassy since friday , chanting anti-estonian government slogans and pointing the barrel of a green inflatable tank at it .
the protest came after estonian authorities removed a controversial soviet war memorial from central tallinn for relocation at a military cemetery .
estonians see the statue - a monument to red army soldiers who died while fighting fascist forces during world war ii - as a reminder of 50 years of soviet occupation .
flag desecration one russian demonstrator broke into the grounds of the estonian embassy in moscow on tuesday afternoon and cut down and desecrated its flag in a row over the fate of a soviet war memorial .

and on tuesday afternoon a group of demonstrators broke through the first of two fences surrounding the embassy .
one man then jumped the second fence , cut the estonian flag down from its nine-meter staff and began cutting it up , persidski said .
" the militia caught him as he tried to get away and returned the remains of the flag to us .
we put up a new one , " he added .
the leader of the young russia movement , which is conducting the siege , said that the men were not part of his organization , the baltic news service bns reported .
but estonia 's ambassador to russia , marina kaljurand , told the echo moskvy radio station that the blockade could only take place with the " tacit agreement " of the russian authorities , persidski said .
archeology work completed estonian archeologists finished their search for the coffins of soldiers buried at the site in tallinn on tuesday evening , the estonian defence ministry announced .
according to initial information from the site , a total of 12 coffins of fallen red army soldiers have been found , defense ministry spokeswoman aet kukk told the german news agency dpa .
the soldiers are to be exhumed and taken to a morgue for forensic examination and possible identification .
the ministry then plans to rebury them in a tallinn war cemetery , to which the statue which guarded them has already been moved , kukk said .
and the estonian defence forces will hold memorial ceremonies in the cemetery both on may 8 - the anniversary of the end of world war ii in western europe - and at the end of june , when the complete memorial complex is scheduled to be re-inaugurated at its new site . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel calls putin over missile row and violence in estonia german chancellor angela merkel spoke to russian president vladimir putin saturday to discuss the growing controversy over the proposed us missile shield and to hear his views on the escalating violence in estonia .

"
germany currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .
estonia 's president toomas hendrik ilves has described the moscow embassy protest as " psycho-terror . "
" nearly two dozen citizens of estonia are in the embassy building , as if taken hostage .
other citizens of estonia are blocked from entering the embassy , " he said .
about 100 youths from pro-kremlin organisations young guard and ours have ringed the estonian embassy since friday , chanting anti-estonian government slogans and pointing the barrel of a green inflatable tank at it .
the protest came after estonian authorities removed a controversial soviet war memorial from central tallinn for relocation at a military cemetery .
estonians see the statue - a monument to red army soldiers who died while fighting fascist forces during world war ii - as a reminder of 50 years of soviet occupation .
flag desecration one russian demonstrator broke into the grounds of the estonian embassy in moscow on tuesday afternoon and cut down and desecrated its flag in a row over the fate of a soviet war memorial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bronze statue of a soviet soldier was relocated to the military cemetery in tallinn estonia and russia have been at loggerheads for months over estonian plans to remove a red army war memorial from its current location in central tallinn to a nearby war cemetery .
and on tuesday afternoon a group of demonstrators broke through the first of two fences surrounding the embassy .
one man then jumped the second fence , cut the estonian flag down from its nine-meter staff and began cutting it up , persidski said .
" the militia caught him as he tried to get away and returned the remains of the flag to us .
we put up a new one , " he added .
the leader of the young russia movement , which is conducting the siege , said that the men were not part of his organization , the baltic news service bns reported .
but estonia 's ambassador to russia , marina kaljurand , told the echo moskvy radio station that the blockade could only take place with the " tacit agreement " of the russian authorities , persidski said .
archeology work completed estonian archeologists finished their search for the coffins of soldiers buried at the site in tallinn on tuesday evening , the estonian defence ministry announced .
according to initial information from the site , a total of 12 coffins of fallen red army soldiers have been found , defense ministry spokeswoman aet kukk told the german news agency dpa .
the soldiers are to be exhumed and taken to a morgue for forensic examination and possible identification .
the ministry then plans to rebury them in a tallinn war cemetery , to which the statue which guarded them has already been moved , kukk said .
and the estonian defence forces will hold memorial ceremonies in the cemetery both on may 8 - the anniversary of the end of world war ii in western europe - and at the end of june , when the complete memorial complex is scheduled to be re-inaugurated at its new site . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel calls putin over missile row and violence in estonia german chancellor angela merkel spoke to russian president vladimir putin saturday to discuss the growing controversy over the proposed us missile shield and to hear his views on the escalating violence in estonia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 01.05.2007 turkish high court annuls presidential vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan , left , talks with his deputy abdullah gul turkey 's constitutional court on tuesday annulled the first round of a parliamentary vote for a new president in a move likely to pave the way for early general elections . the court ruled that the 550-seat parliament should have convened with at least 367 deputies - or the two-thirds majority needed for a president to be elected in the first round - for the voting to have begun , the court 's vice president hasim kilic told reporters .
according to parliamentary minutes , 361 lawmakers were present in the assembly on friday .
the petition challenging the procedure was filed by the main opposition party , the social-democratic republican people 's party .
" it is now up to parliament to decide how to proceed , " kilic said , adding that parliament could begin the election process anew .
early elections urged gul urged speedy early legislative polls if parliament fails to elect him in a repeated vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early elections are a way out of the crisis " let us see if the lawmakers have changed their minds after all these developments , " gul said in an interview broadcast on trt state-television .
" the number -lrb- of lawmakers in support of his presidency -rrb- may increase or decrease , but , after that , my personal opinion is to call ... elections at the earliest possible time , " he said .
the ruling came amid a tense standoff between the secularist military and the ruling islamist-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , whose foreign minister abdullah gul was the sole candidate in the presidential election .
the turkish constitution orders general elections if parliament fails to elect a president in up to four rounds of voting .
general elections are currently scheduled for november 4 .
according to media reports , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and his aides have already discussed bringing the november 4 elections forward to sometime between the end of june and early august .

according to parliamentary minutes , 361 lawmakers were present in the assembly on friday .
the petition challenging the procedure was filed by the main opposition party , the social-democratic republican people 's party .
" it is now up to parliament to decide how to proceed , " kilic said , adding that parliament could begin the election process anew .
early elections urged gul urged speedy early legislative polls if parliament fails to elect him in a repeated vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early elections are a way out of the crisis " let us see if the lawmakers have changed their minds after all these developments , " gul said in an interview broadcast on trt state-television .
" the number -lrb- of lawmakers in support of his presidency -rrb- may increase or decrease , but , after that , my personal opinion is to call ... elections at the earliest possible time , " he said .
the ruling came amid a tense standoff between the secularist military and the ruling islamist-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , whose foreign minister abdullah gul was the sole candidate in the presidential election .
the turkish constitution orders general elections if parliament fails to elect a president in up to four rounds of voting .
general elections are currently scheduled for november 4 .
according to media reports , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and his aides have already discussed bringing the november 4 elections forward to sometime between the end of june and early august .

if you 've got a fat wallet and a jaw-dropping , pedal-to-the-metal kind of car , the gumball 3000 rally is the race for you .
this year 's gumball 3000 - which started on sunday - is a race from london to istanbul and back with drivers maneuvering some of the world 's fastest , flashiest cars .
by day , the 240 drivers in 120 cars aim to travel sixteen countries in eight days .
by night , they party their speed-demon hearts out .
the gumball is a 3,000 mile , global race for the jet-set crowd : models , celebrities , billionaires , athletes , businessmen , rock stars and a few wanna-bes .
their " steeds " range from ferraris to lamborghinis and rolls royces , but also include ice cream trucks , vw campers and even a turkish taxi .
german police not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officer yells " say cheese " to gumballers the gumballers have stumbled onto a problem in germany , though . the country may pride itself in having highways without speed limits - so much so that tourists from abroad book vacations in the country to drive the autobahns , but there are still limits along certain stretches of highway .
on monday , german police were more than a little miffed about the gumball racers .
they handed out hefty " security deposit " tickets of around 420 euros -lrb- $ 574 -rrb- to nearly 70 speedsters in the german states of north rhine-westphalia , hesse and rhineland-palatinate .
-lrb- actual fines will be established later . -rrb-
one racer was even caught driving 150 kilometers per hour -lrb- 93 miles per hour -rrb- in an 80-kph zone .
police also forbade the race from continuing through germany from belgium .
from london to istanbul and back gumballers were on their way to the hahn airport near frankfurt , where two planes were to transport their cars to istanbul , turkey , where they would resume their course .
from istanbul , the illegal race is supposed to head back through southeast europe to london via slovakia and berlin .
in germany , though , gumballers had to downshift and allow themselves to be escorted by german police in convoys to the airport .
but the racers were n't irked , and the " security deposits " certainly did n't put a dent in the drivers ' wallets .
speedsters consider tickets reaped during the rally to be more like badges or trophies in the pursuit of high speed and gumball fame .

besides , having to pay around 41,000 euros to participate in the contest in the first place , and owning the kind of car necessary for such escapades , a few hundred euros mean nothing .
that kind of attitude is probably necessary anyway to be able to whiz down european highways and not flinch during the near-misses as old grannies pull out in front of you in the passing lane , or clunker cars scramble to get out of your way .
after all , the annual " gumball 3000 " - which kicked off in 1999 - is not just a race , it 's a " lifestyle , " the website boasts .
and , if you want to believe founder maximillion cooper 's portal , it 's not surprising that the gumball 3000 rally was created by a man who was fathered by a rock ' n ' roll drummer , mothered by a model and hobnobs with the likes of north korea leader kim jong il .

the philharmonic , which is largely self-governing , has also taken on educational tasks for children and young people in a subtle shift away from its previous focus on discriminating music-lover audiences .
pamela rosenberg , the orchestra 's chief executive who previously ran the san francisco opera , arrived in berlin with rattle and has worked to make the concerts appealing to all section of society , breathing fresh air into what was considered a somewhat stuffy orchestra . the orchestra 's modern approach can also be seen in the may day concert 's venue . the matinee concert of works by wagner and brahms , which was televised live in germany , was performed in a former factory , the kabelwerk oberspree . the industrial monument building has been converted into an auditorium . the documentary movie , " rhythm is it ! , " which has been shown around the globe and features the orchestra rehearsing under rattle for a ballet performed by young immigrants from 25 nations , was another way the orchestra attempted to open to the modern world .

according to parliamentary minutes , 361 lawmakers were present in the assembly on friday .
the petition challenging the procedure was filed by the main opposition party , the social-democratic republican people 's party .
" it is now up to parliament to decide how to proceed , " kilic said , adding that parliament could begin the election process anew .
early elections urged gul urged speedy early legislative polls if parliament fails to elect him in a repeated vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early elections are a way out of the crisis " let us see if the lawmakers have changed their minds after all these developments , " gul said in an interview broadcast on trt state-television .
" the number -lrb- of lawmakers in support of his presidency -rrb- may increase or decrease , but , after that , my personal opinion is to call ... elections at the earliest possible time , " he said .
the ruling came amid a tense standoff between the secularist military and the ruling islamist-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , whose foreign minister abdullah gul was the sole candidate in the presidential election .
the turkish constitution orders general elections if parliament fails to elect a president in up to four rounds of voting .
general elections are currently scheduled for november 4 .
according to media reports , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and his aides have already discussed bringing the november 4 elections forward to sometime between the end of june and early august .
secularists worry early elections are generally seen as a way out of the current crisis , which erupted over the prospect of the akp-dominated parliament electing a president with an islamist background .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators during a rally in istanbul on sunday secularists say the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist party , is not truly committed to turkey 's fiercely guarded secular system and gul 's presidency would erode the separation between state and religion .
opposition parties , who had been pressing for early elections for months , boycotted the first-round vote on friday .
hours after the balloting , in which gul fell just 10 votes short of being elected , the influential turkish army accused the government of failing to stop rising islamism in the country and warned that it would act to protect the secular system if necessary .
the extraordinarily harsh statement was widely seen as an indication that gul is unwelcome as president .

other celebrations , however , were largely peaceful . rioters threw bottles at police officers in berlin last night during what is known as " walpurgnis night , " or " witches ' night " in germany and other parts of europe .
traditionally a pagan custom to ring in springtime , people celebrate and dance in pubs and outside .
berlin police said that drunken young people also threw stones at them in friedrichshain , an eastern district of the city .
earlier in the evening , around 1,000 anti-globalization protestors held peaceful demonstrations in friedrichshain .
over 5,000 riot police equipped with batons and water-cannons are currently on duty in berlin - 1,000 of those from other german states - to keep celebrations and demonstrations under control .
undercover unit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reminders of kreuzberg street battle 20 years ago berlin police also said a special undercover unit had been installed , with around 100 plain-clothes agents mixing unobtrusively with demonstrators in order to spot and arrest trouble-makers and prevent riots .
the undercover unit was created during last year 's world cup to catch soccer hooligans on berlin 's streets .
twenty years ago , on may 1 , 1987 , rioters in the kreuzberg district of berlin clashed with police and smashed shop windows .
businesses were also plundered and cars set on fire .
since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , run-ins between rioters and police have been frequent on may day eve or may 1 , particularly in the eastern districts of the city .
however , celebrations and demonstrations have been more peaceful the past two years , police said .

about 100 youths from pro-kremlin organisations young guard and ours have ringed the estonian embassy since friday , chanting anti-estonian government slogans and pointing the barrel of a green inflatable tank at it .
the protest came after estonian authorities removed a controversial soviet war memorial from central tallinn for relocation at a military cemetery .
estonians see the statue - a monument to red army soldiers who died while fighting fascist forces during world war ii - as a reminder of 50 years of soviet occupation .

one man then jumped the second fence , cut the estonian flag down from its nine-meter staff and began cutting it up , persidski said .
" the militia caught him as he tried to get away and returned the remains of the flag to us .
we put up a new one , " he added .
the leader of the young russia movement , which is conducting the siege , said that the men were not part of his organization , the baltic news service bns reported .
but estonia 's ambassador to russia , marina kaljurand , told the echo moskvy radio station that the blockade could only take place with the " tacit agreement " of the russian authorities , persidski said .

according to initial information from the site , a total of 12 coffins of fallen red army soldiers have been found , defense ministry spokeswoman aet kukk told the german news agency dpa .
the soldiers are to be exhumed and taken to a morgue for forensic examination and possible identification .
the ministry then plans to rebury them in a tallinn war cemetery , to which the statue which guarded them has already been moved , kukk said .
and the estonian defence forces will hold memorial ceremonies in the cemetery both on may 8 - the anniversary of the end of world war ii in western europe - and at the end of june , when the complete memorial complex is scheduled to be re-inaugurated at its new site . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel calls putin over missile row and violence in estonia german chancellor angela merkel spoke to russian president vladimir putin saturday to discuss the growing controversy over the proposed us missile shield and to hear his views on the escalating violence in estonia .

the philharmonic , which is largely self-governing , has also taken on educational tasks for children and young people in a subtle shift away from its previous focus on discriminating music-lover audiences .
pamela rosenberg , the orchestra 's chief executive who previously ran the san francisco opera , arrived in berlin with rattle and has worked to make the concerts appealing to all section of society , breathing fresh air into what was considered a somewhat stuffy orchestra . the orchestra 's modern approach can also be seen in the may day concert 's venue . the matinee concert of works by wagner and brahms , which was televised live in germany , was performed in a former factory , the kabelwerk oberspree . the industrial monument building has been converted into an auditorium . the documentary movie , " rhythm is it ! , " which has been shown around the globe and features the orchestra rehearsing under rattle for a ballet performed by young immigrants from 25 nations , was another way the orchestra attempted to open to the modern world .
old vs. new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with the philharmonic 's best efforts , it 's unlikely to reach love parade status in berlin traditional music lovers and elite music critics have expressed discomfort at the new direction , but the philharmonic 's concerts are fully booked months in advance and sales of cd recordings , which are hitting shelves more frequently , are brisk . the orchestra was formed during a revolt by poorly paid musicians once working under benjamin bilse , a berlin director and impresario .
they rebelled against him and on may 1 , 1882 established the " former bilse orchestra , " which later evolved into the capital city 's philharmonic orchestra .
full-scale anniversary celebrations for the orchestra are set to take place this november . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : " wagner and the amazon fit wonderfully together " christoph schlingensief not only set richard wagner 's " the flying dutchman " in the amazon , he spent several months there rehearsing it .

receiving an award in london for news journalist of the year , mr humphrys said he did not deserve the honour .
he said bbc correspondents who faced danger on a regular basis , above all mr johnston , deserved the award more .
earlier , european parliament members said they were told by palestinian leaders that mr johnston is alive .
mr humphrys named nearly a dozen bbc correspondents , calling them unsung heroes who faced danger week in and week out .
" frankly if we were n't so obsessed with personalities and celebrities they 're the people who should have had the award , " he said to the applause of the audience at the sony radio academy awards .
" and i know we 've mentioned his name before , but would you mind awfully just standing up and remembering alan johnston . "
there has been no direct information on the correspondent 's fate since he was seized at gunpoint in gaza city on 12 march after leaving his office .
earlier on monday a 12-member delegation of meps were assured in a meeting with palestinian deputy pm azzam al-ahmad in the west bank city of ramallah that that mr johnston was alive .
the palestinian authorities have indicated that his kidnappers have made new demands , but gave no details .
he said that talks with the kidnappers were at a sensitive stage as mr johnston spent his 50th night in captivity .
vigils are held by his colleagues and friends in london every monday to keep his disappearance in the public eye .
on monday evening , an image of mr johnston 's face was projected on the outside wall of bbc television centre in west london .
mr johnston joined the bbc world service in 1991 and has spent eight of the last 16 years as a correspondent , including periods in uzbekistan and afghanistan .
he has lived and worked in gaza for three years and was the only western reporter permanently based in the often violent and lawless territory .

writing in a welsh-language magazine , meri huws said the debate on the language 's future had to tackle " immigration and emigration " .
she also claimed attempts by local authorities to use planning rules were being undermined by a lack of support .
the political parties gave a mixed reaction to her comments .
in the article in barn -lrb- opinion -rrb- , ms huws said wales " has moved on since the days when subjects like emigration and immigration were things that people were scared to discuss . "
' priority ' she argued the debate on the future of the language needed to move away from " safe " areas like bilingual signs and welsh lessons for adults .
her article suggested native welsh areas need a specific economic development body such as údarás na gaeltachta , which attracts investment to the gaeltacht , the gaelic speaking regions in ireland .
ms huws also claimed there was a lack of national leadership in the field of housing planning , where attempts by local authorities such as gwynedd council , she said , were undermined by a lack of support at a national level .
she finished the article by saying that " maintaining the percentage of people who speak welsh in the north and the west must be a priority in any attempt to promote the language .
" simply increasing the numbers across wales is not enough any more . "
ms huws was appointed as chair of the language board in august 2004 by the welsh assembly government .
welsh conservative leader nick bourne questioned ms huws ' timing in writing the article .
" controversial comments such as this are best left until after an election period , " he said .
mr bourne said he believed ms huws ' assessment was wrong and a spokesperson on his behalf said : " a lot of english speaking people moving into welsh speaking areas have ensured that their children learn welsh " .
he also said he thought some welsh speaking communities had been affected by people buying second homes in those areas , but not through immigration .
a spokesperson for welsh labour said : " meri huws is offering a very particular analysis - certainly not the only analysis , and one which can clearly be disputed .
" labour 's view is that there is no sustainable future for the welsh language if it simply retreats to some mythical heartland .
" for us , a young person brought up to speak welsh in newport is just as valuable as a young person brought up to speak welsh in caernarfon .
" ms huws may disagree with aspects of the national strategy , but she is certainly mistaken in describing her difference of view as an " absence " of leadership . "
a liberal democrat spokesman said the party would " develop and expand language action areas to help reverse the trend towards de-population and ensure a welcome and integration for those moving into welsh-speaking communities .
" these plans would include promotion of welsh as a community language , in all tiers of education , for passing down through generations and for business development .
" this would be alongside our plans to give citizens the right to service in welsh from public bodies and giving welsh and english official language status . "
however , plaid cymru leader ieuan wyn jones said there was a " growing political consensus on the future of the welsh language " .
" there is growing agreement on increasing welsh language education provision , further welsh language legislation and reforming housing planning processes , " he added .
" discussing the future of the welsh language will be a priority for the next assembly government , whichever party is in charge , but the next assembly government must show leadership on this issue . "

" ms huws may disagree with aspects of the national strategy , but she is certainly mistaken in describing her difference of view as an " absence " of leadership . "

a spoonful of ice cream helps the economic medicine go down nicolas sarkozy and segolene royal are trying to impress the french with their economic programmes as the final round of voting nears .
but some of the most prominent election-related posters in france right now are promoting ice cream , not politics .
in a shameless piece of opportunism , ben & jerry 's have dressed up their familiar cow mascot in a presidential sash and launched a fake campaign , complete with website and slogan : " for a greedy france . "
but if nothing else , the posters at least provide some light relief in a presidential race that is becoming increasingly fierce .
" some people manage to work 35 hours a week - for us it 's more like 70 " in pictures broadly speaking , ms royal advocates traditional socialist economic policies of state intervention , including a higher minimum wage and subsidised entry-level jobs for young people .
mr sarkozy , by contrast , wants to promote free-market measures , sidestepping the 35-hour working week by scrapping punitive taxes on overtime pay .
even so , both agree on policies that seem remarkably generous by hard-nosed anglo-saxon standards .
for instance , they both advocate paying people who lose their jobs the equivalent of 90 % of their salary in social security benefits - ms royal for one year , mr sarkozy for " as long as necessary " .
however , mr sarkozy does temper that by saying that those who refuse two successive offers of jobs for which they are qualified will get no further benefits .
centrists ' view probably the most important critique of the two candidates ' programmes is coming from the campaign of third-placed centrist candidate francois bayrou , whose supporters are expected to determine the outcome on 6 may .
despite being eliminated from the race in the first round , mr bayrou has taken part in a tv debate with ms royal .
segolene royal increase minimum wage to 1,500 euros a month -lrb- $ 1,900 ; £ 950 -rrb- create 500,000 state-backed entry-level jobs for young people no tax breaks for high earners new taxes on firms that pay share dividends instead of investing profits he has also had some harsh words for mr sarkozy , whom he likened to italy 's controversial ex-prime minister silvio berlusconi for being too close to big business and the media .
but mr bayrou has made clear he does not support ms royal 's spending plans as outlined in her presidential manifesto .
mr bayrou 's advisers have gone further , denouncing key aspects of her economic policies .
christian saint-etienne , an economist who helped draft mr bayrou 's programme , said there was very little chance of finding common ground with the socialist candidate .
" she would have to break with the extreme left , reconsider her plan to create 500,000 entry-level jobs and seriously shrink the size of the state and the public spending that is causing our growth to atrophy , " mr saint-etienne told le figaro newspaper .
" essentially , the economic programme that 's closest to ours is nicolas sarkozy 's , " he said .
" but in terms of institutions and the political process , we have many more points of convergence with segolene royal . "
structural change both candidates propose headline-grabbing structural reforms which have come under media scrutiny in recent days .
ms royal has reached out to the environmental lobby by saying france should reduce its reliance on nuclear power to 50 % of its electricity generation , as opposed to 80 % at present .
nicolas sarkozy remove taxes and social charges on overtime pay , encouraging people to work more than 35 hours a week impose new 50 % ceiling on personal taxation replace only 50 % of civil servants entering retirement " marshall plan " to train young people in disadvantaged areas she gives no indication of how this might be achieved beyond saying that " france is well-placed to become a world leader in renewable energy " .
but her suggestion comes at a time when some people in britain are starting to envy france for its use of nuclear power instead of climate-changing fossil fuels .
for his part , mr sarkozy has been questioned about his plan to reduce the size of the civil service .
amid growing concern about the size of france 's public debt , which is now more than 66 % of its gross domestic product , mr sarkozy 's main idea is to replace only 50 % of retiring bureaucrats .
estimates indicate this would save between 1.4bn and 1.7bn euros a year .
however , some analysts have expressed fears that the quality of public administration would suffer as a result .
mr sarkozy says his version of natural wastage would bring the french civil service back down to levels last seen in 1992 , when francois mitterrand was president .
" i do n't have the impression that france was under-administered at that time , " he remarks dryly .
' precarious ' whoever wins , " the new president will inherit a precarious economic situation , " says global insight economist sonia pangusion .
" despite reasonable economic growth in 2006 , the economy failed to reap all the potential benefits from the far brighter international environment . "
a loss of french market share and competitiveness , an inflexible labour market , substantial public ownership and the poor state of public finances are among the problems she identifies .
" neither -lsb- candidate -rsb- can deny that france 's economic woes need significant action , but the measures they propose could lead to wildly different outcomes , " she adds .
the successful candidate needs to be ready to take decisive measures .
if not , the french economy could end up alongside that tub of ben & jerry 's - in the deep-freeze .

centrists ' view probably the most important critique of the two candidates ' programmes is coming from the campaign of third-placed centrist candidate francois bayrou , whose supporters are expected to determine the outcome on 6 may .
despite being eliminated from the race in the first round , mr bayrou has taken part in a tv debate with ms royal .
segolene royal increase minimum wage to 1,500 euros a month -lrb- $ 1,900 ; £ 950 -rrb- create 500,000 state-backed entry-level jobs for young people no tax breaks for high earners new taxes on firms that pay share dividends instead of investing profits he has also had some harsh words for mr sarkozy , whom he likened to italy 's controversial ex-prime minister silvio berlusconi for being too close to big business and the media .
but mr bayrou has made clear he does not support ms royal 's spending plans as outlined in her presidential manifesto .
mr bayrou 's advisers have gone further , denouncing key aspects of her economic policies .
christian saint-etienne , an economist who helped draft mr bayrou 's programme , said there was very little chance of finding common ground with the socialist candidate .
" she would have to break with the extreme left , reconsider her plan to create 500,000 entry-level jobs and seriously shrink the size of the state and the public spending that is causing our growth to atrophy , " mr saint-etienne told le figaro newspaper .
" essentially , the economic programme that 's closest to ours is nicolas sarkozy 's , " he said .
" but in terms of institutions and the political process , we have many more points of convergence with segolene royal . "
structural change both candidates propose headline-grabbing structural reforms which have come under media scrutiny in recent days .
ms royal has reached out to the environmental lobby by saying france should reduce its reliance on nuclear power to 50 % of its electricity generation , as opposed to 80 % at present .
nicolas sarkozy remove taxes and social charges on overtime pay , encouraging people to work more than 35 hours a week impose new 50 % ceiling on personal taxation replace only 50 % of civil servants entering retirement " marshall plan " to train young people in disadvantaged areas she gives no indication of how this might be achieved beyond saying that " france is well-placed to become a world leader in renewable energy " .
but her suggestion comes at a time when some people in britain are starting to envy france for its use of nuclear power instead of climate-changing fossil fuels .
for his part , mr sarkozy has been questioned about his plan to reduce the size of the civil service .
amid growing concern about the size of france 's public debt , which is now more than 66 % of its gross domestic product , mr sarkozy 's main idea is to replace only 50 % of retiring bureaucrats .
estimates indicate this would save between 1.4bn and 1.7bn euros a year .
however , some analysts have expressed fears that the quality of public administration would suffer as a result .
mr sarkozy says his version of natural wastage would bring the french civil service back down to levels last seen in 1992 , when francois mitterrand was president .
" i do n't have the impression that france was under-administered at that time , " he remarks dryly .
' precarious ' whoever wins , " the new president will inherit a precarious economic situation , " says global insight economist sonia pangusion .
" despite reasonable economic growth in 2006 , the economy failed to reap all the potential benefits from the far brighter international environment . "
a loss of french market share and competitiveness , an inflexible labour market , substantial public ownership and the poor state of public finances are among the problems she identifies .
" neither -lsb- candidate -rsb- can deny that france 's economic woes need significant action , but the measures they propose could lead to wildly different outcomes , " she adds .
the successful candidate needs to be ready to take decisive measures .
if not , the french economy could end up alongside that tub of ben & jerry 's - in the deep-freeze .

structural change both candidates propose headline-grabbing structural reforms which have come under media scrutiny in recent days .
ms royal has reached out to the environmental lobby by saying france should reduce its reliance on nuclear power to 50 % of its electricity generation , as opposed to 80 % at present .
nicolas sarkozy remove taxes and social charges on overtime pay , encouraging people to work more than 35 hours a week impose new 50 % ceiling on personal taxation replace only 50 % of civil servants entering retirement " marshall plan " to train young people in disadvantaged areas she gives no indication of how this might be achieved beyond saying that " france is well-placed to become a world leader in renewable energy " .
but her suggestion comes at a time when some people in britain are starting to envy france for its use of nuclear power instead of climate-changing fossil fuels .
for his part , mr sarkozy has been questioned about his plan to reduce the size of the civil service .
amid growing concern about the size of france 's public debt , which is now more than 66 % of its gross domestic product , mr sarkozy 's main idea is to replace only 50 % of retiring bureaucrats .
estimates indicate this would save between 1.4bn and 1.7bn euros a year .
however , some analysts have expressed fears that the quality of public administration would suffer as a result .
mr sarkozy says his version of natural wastage would bring the french civil service back down to levels last seen in 1992 , when francois mitterrand was president .
" i do n't have the impression that france was under-administered at that time , " he remarks dryly .
' precarious ' whoever wins , " the new president will inherit a precarious economic situation , " says global insight economist sonia pangusion .
" despite reasonable economic growth in 2006 , the economy failed to reap all the potential benefits from the far brighter international environment . "
a loss of french market share and competitiveness , an inflexible labour market , substantial public ownership and the poor state of public finances are among the problems she identifies .
" neither -lsb- candidate -rsb- can deny that france 's economic woes need significant action , but the measures they propose could lead to wildly different outcomes , " she adds .
the successful candidate needs to be ready to take decisive measures .
if not , the french economy could end up alongside that tub of ben & jerry 's - in the deep-freeze .

a spoonful of ice cream helps the economic medicine go down nicolas sarkozy and segolene royal are trying to impress the french with their economic programmes as the final round of voting nears .
but some of the most prominent election-related posters in france right now are promoting ice cream , not politics .
in a shameless piece of opportunism , ben & jerry 's have dressed up their familiar cow mascot in a presidential sash and launched a fake campaign , complete with website and slogan : " for a greedy france . "
but if nothing else , the posters at least provide some light relief in a presidential race that is becoming increasingly fierce .
" some people manage to work 35 hours a week - for us it 's more like 70 " in pictures broadly speaking , ms royal advocates traditional socialist economic policies of state intervention , including a higher minimum wage and subsidised entry-level jobs for young people .
mr sarkozy , by contrast , wants to promote free-market measures , sidestepping the 35-hour working week by scrapping punitive taxes on overtime pay .
even so , both agree on policies that seem remarkably generous by hard-nosed anglo-saxon standards .
for instance , they both advocate paying people who lose their jobs the equivalent of 90 % of their salary in social security benefits - ms royal for one year , mr sarkozy for " as long as necessary " .
however , mr sarkozy does temper that by saying that those who refuse two successive offers of jobs for which they are qualified will get no further benefits .
centrists ' view probably the most important critique of the two candidates ' programmes is coming from the campaign of third-placed centrist candidate francois bayrou , whose supporters are expected to determine the outcome on 6 may .
despite being eliminated from the race in the first round , mr bayrou has taken part in a tv debate with ms royal .
segolene royal increase minimum wage to 1,500 euros a month -lrb- $ 1,900 ; £ 950 -rrb- create 500,000 state-backed entry-level jobs for young people no tax breaks for high earners new taxes on firms that pay share dividends instead of investing profits he has also had some harsh words for mr sarkozy , whom he likened to italy 's controversial ex-prime minister silvio berlusconi for being too close to big business and the media .
but mr bayrou has made clear he does not support ms royal 's spending plans as outlined in her presidential manifesto .
mr bayrou 's advisers have gone further , denouncing key aspects of her economic policies .
christian saint-etienne , an economist who helped draft mr bayrou 's programme , said there was very little chance of finding common ground with the socialist candidate .
" she would have to break with the extreme left , reconsider her plan to create 500,000 entry-level jobs and seriously shrink the size of the state and the public spending that is causing our growth to atrophy , " mr saint-etienne told le figaro newspaper .

the total cash earnings figure from the ministry of health , labour and welfare includes monthly wages , overtime pay and special payments .

can juries cope with the length of cases ?
can judges handle the unrelenting workload ?
and , with many other trials in the pipeline , is the court system able to take the strain ?
with the government still wedded to abolishing juries in complex fraud trials , some lawyers suspect that ministers would like to dispense with juries in terrorism trials too .
in her summing up in the fertiliser bomb trial , baroness kennedy qc made a pointed reference to the importance of the jury in such cases .
and , after sentencing , the judge , sir michael astill , thanked the jurors and said he supported " jury trial in this case 100 % " .
it is true former home secretary charles clarke made favourable references to some features of french counter-terrorism , with its cadre of specialist prosecutors and examining magistrates whose cases are heard by a special section of the paris court .
but there is no evidence for thinking such a radical departure from customary practice is being planned in the uk .
however , administrative changes are coming in .
judges need to ' get a grip ' " if most of the legal argument was heard before the jury is sworn , that would save a lot of time " gerald butler qc , retired judge a panel of up to 20 specialist high court judges has been nominated for terror trials and the deputy lord chief justice , sir igor judge , has issued a protocol on how to run cases more efficiently .
preliminary hearings are supposed to cut out some of the " surprise " elements which can slow down trials but , in many terrorism cases , they have failed to do so .
indeed , in the ongoing 21/7 trial at woolwich crown court , mr justice fulford has promised an inquiry into " what has gone wrong " and caused the case to overrun .
a retired judge , gerald butler qc , believes the problem in general lies principally with those on the bench .
he said : " it 's not the fault of the jury .
judges have to be encouraged to cut out the waffle and get a firm grip on these cases .
and if most of the legal argument was heard before the jury is sworn , that would also save a lot of time . "
how to relieve some of the pressure on the courts is also of concern .
even with the fertiliser bomb trial over , more than 20 other terror trials are still ongoing or in the pipeline .
the high security woolwich crown court complex hears most of these trials rather than the old bailey because of the proximity of belmarsh prison .
but only two of woolwich 's seven courts are big enough for cases with multiple defendants and there are only four consulting rooms for lawyers .
so there is an urgent search for other options , including using courts in birmingham and the north west for terror cases .
not enough cells prosecutors lay some of the blame for delay on the tactics of defence lawyers .
for example in the ricin trial , which ended in april 2005 , argument over the possible involvement of the algerian government in torturing one of the suspects occupied a month of court time .
the police , however , tend to be more sanguine .
a scotland yard source said : " if i was facing a terrorist charge , i would expect my brief to do anything to defend me . "
but the police are concerned about the number of officers diverted from front-line duties to attend long-running terror trials .
the strain is also being felt at paddington green police station , built in the 1960s to house ira suspects .
with only 16 cells , it could not cope when , as in one recent case , 21 people were arrested .
the independent police complaints commission noted paddington green 's problems in its report into the high-profile 2006 forest gate arrests .
it said the facility needed to be improved if it were to remain suitable for longer-term detention , such as that under current terrorism laws .
it seems certain that plans will be laid to build a new and bigger high security complex , perhaps at woolwich .

there is some debate about how to relieve pressure on the courts can juries cope with the length of cases ?
can judges handle the unrelenting workload ?
and , with many other trials in the pipeline , is the court system able to take the strain ?
with the government still wedded to abolishing juries in complex fraud trials , some lawyers suspect that ministers would like to dispense with juries in terrorism trials too .
in her summing up in the fertiliser bomb trial , baroness kennedy qc made a pointed reference to the importance of the jury in such cases .
and , after sentencing , the judge , sir michael astill , thanked the jurors and said he supported " jury trial in this case 100 % " .
it is true former home secretary charles clarke made favourable references to some features of french counter-terrorism , with its cadre of specialist prosecutors and examining magistrates whose cases are heard by a special section of the paris court .
but there is no evidence for thinking such a radical departure from customary practice is being planned in the uk .
however , administrative changes are coming in .
judges need to ' get a grip ' if most of the legal argument was heard before the jury is sworn , that would save a lot of time gerald butler qc , retired judge a panel of up to 20 specialist high court judges has been nominated for terror trials and the deputy lord chief justice , sir igor judge , has issued a protocol on how to run cases more efficiently .
preliminary hearings are supposed to cut out some of the " surprise " elements which can slow down trials but , in many terrorism cases , they have failed to do so .
indeed , in the ongoing 21/7 trial at woolwich crown court , mr justice fulford has promised an inquiry into " what has gone wrong " and caused the case to overrun .
a retired judge , gerald butler qc , believes the problem in general lies principally with those on the bench .
he said : " it 's not the fault of the jury .
judges have to be encouraged to cut out the waffle and get a firm grip on these cases .
and if most of the legal argument was heard before the jury is sworn , that would also save a lot of time . "
how to relieve some of the pressure on the courts is also of concern .
even with the fertiliser bomb trial over , more than 20 other terror trials are still ongoing or in the pipeline .
the high security woolwich crown court complex hears most of these trials rather than the old bailey because of the proximity of belmarsh prison .
but only two of woolwich 's seven courts are big enough for cases with multiple defendants and there are only four consulting rooms for lawyers .
so there is an urgent search for other options , including using courts in birmingham and the north west for terror cases .
not enough cells prosecutors lay some of the blame for delay on the tactics of defence lawyers .
for example in the ricin trial , which ended in april 2005 , argument over the possible involvement of the algerian government in torturing one of the suspects occupied a month of court time .
paddington green only holds 16 the police , however , tend to be more sanguine .
a scotland yard source said : " if i was facing a terrorist charge , i would expect my brief to do anything to defend me . "
but the police are concerned about the number of officers diverted from front-line duties to attend long-running terror trials .
the strain is also being felt at paddington green police station , built in the 1960s to house ira suspects .
with only 16 cells , it could not cope when , as in one recent case , 21 people were arrested .
the independent police complaints commission noted paddington green 's problems in its report into the high-profile 2006 forest gate arrests .
it said the facility needed to be improved if it were to remain suitable for longer-term detention , such as that under current terrorism laws .
it seems certain that plans will be laid to build a new and bigger high security complex , perhaps at woolwich .

last week , the royal society of chemistry offered a £ 500 reward for answering a maths problem which is part of a chinese university entry test - to illustrate how much chinese science students were outstripping their uk counterparts .
the challenge triggered a " phenomenal " level of interest , says the royal society of chemistry .
the chinese maths test and answers " the competition led to massive e-mail traffic , the establishment of internet blog sites and newspaper articles in numerous countries as diverse as china , iran and the usa , " says royal society of chemistry chief executive richard pike .
almost a million people looked at the puzzle on the bbc news website .
the winner - with the first correct answer drawn from among thousands of entries - was 34-year-old david brockley from shoreham-by-sea , west sussex .

angle grinders mr brockley answered the maths problem during his lunch break on friday - assisted , apparently , by his four-month-old son , jack .
the royal society of chemistry set the problem to show the gap between what is expected of undergraduates in the uk and those youngsters seeking to enter university in china .
the puzzle included a much easier maths question from an unnamed university in england , set to assess the capabilities of first year science students .
a kings college london maths professor , william shaw , rejected the comparison with china - saying students in the uk had a different approach to maths , but that did not mean that they were less able .
" we should not damage our international ' brand ' with foolish comparisons , " said professor shaw .
in case anyone was struggling with the maths challenge , the royal society of chemistry explained : " the question required knowledge of geometry within a prism , and the ability to visualise the orientation of lines and planes in three dimensions .

the team analysed the way bonobos and chimpanzees used hand and limb gestures to make themselves understood .
the scientists found the apes used gestures more flexibly than the way they used facial and vocal expressions .
they say the findings support the theory that human language developed through the use of hand gestures .
food or sex ?
the team comprised researchers from yerkes primate center , at emory university in atlanta , georgia .
it found ape groups developed different gestures to say different things and that meanings depended on context . "
they may use the same gesture for something totally different " frans de waal emory university , atlanta a male chimpanzee may beg for food from another chimpanzee by gesturing with an extended arm and open hand .
but the same gesture might also be used to ask a female chimpanzee for sex , or between two males as a sign of reconciliation after a fight , said primatologist frans de waal , a member of the research team .
" typically they may use it for food ... but they may use the same gesture for something totally different ; so , for instance , a male may invite a female for sex by holding out an open hand to her , " dr de waal said .
this ability to learn gestures distinguishes apes from monkeys and most other species on the planet , the scientist says .
although all primates use vocal and facial expressions to communicate , only the great apes - chimpanzees , bonobos , orang-utan and gorillas - use gestures as well , an ability they share with humans .

humphrys , who presents the station 's flagship today programme , read out the names of a dozen foreign correspondents , including bbc journalist alan johnston , who was kidnapped in gaza seven weeks ago .
humphrys said it was not " false modesty " to say he should not have won because he had done " a perfectly competent job when i did some stuff in iraq " .

the lifetime achievement awards went to bbc west midlands presenter tony butler , 76 , who sparked controversy recently when he said the royal navy 's faye turney , who had been held hostage by iran , should not be serving in the armed forces .
he later apologised for telling listeners : " if she gets her head chopped off , it will serve her right . "
he said his " words came out wrong " .
veteran broadcaster sir david frost , who presented the news journalist of the year award , was cheered by the audience when he said : " next year i hope this will be the moira stuart news journalist of the year award " .

peel 's wife sheila ravenscroft accepted it on his behalf .
the london ceremony was co-hosted by paul gambaccini , who received the gold award , and sir terry .

the dj managed to get prime minister tony blair on air after asking listeners to persuade famous people to call the show for charity .
the lifetime achievement awards went to bbc west midlands presenter tony butler , 76 , who sparked controversy recently when he said the royal navy 's faye turney , who had been held hostage by iran , should not be serving in the armed forces .
he later apologised for telling listeners : " if she gets her head chopped off , it will serve her right . "
he said his " words came out wrong " .
